Admission Date:  [**2114-1-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2114-1-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-1-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEONATOLOGY HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 32 week gestational female triplet, number two, admitted with respiratory distress.
The maternal history is significant for a 29-year-old gravida III, para I-0-[**Name (NI) **] mother with a past obstetrical history notable for a spontaneous vaginal [**2113**].
This pregnancy is significant for an IUI pregnancy and a triamniotic/trichorionic triplet gestation.
The pregnancy was complicated by maternal intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy which was treated with Ursodiol, and by preterm labor which was treated by magnesium sulfate, tocolysis until today.
Rupture of membranes was at delivery yielding clear amniotic fluid.
No maternal fever or fetal tachycardia was noted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The examination was consistent with a 31-32 weeks gestation and remarkable for some moderate intercostal retraction off of CPAP.
There were scattered coarse crackles.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient continued to have mild retractions that progressed.
The baby was extubated by day of life 2 [**1-4**] and continued to do well with minimal oxygen.
The patient was given a pre-extubation load of caffeine for some periodic breathing.
The infant continued to do well from a respiratory standpoint.
After the baby was extubated, maintenance caffeine was later started due to some episodes of periodic breathing.
No murmur was initially noted and then a soft clinically nonsequential murmur was heard at day of life number 1 [**1-4**].
It was concluded that the murmur was probably due secondary to a closing ductus arteriosus.
Like her siblings, the initial CBC was unusual for lymphocytosis which resolved after subsequent CBC.
