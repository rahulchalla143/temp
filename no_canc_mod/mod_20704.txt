On [**9-19**] pt had another episode of hemoptysis at home associated with syncope.
Admitted again to [**Hospital6 302**], intubated, CT showed cavitation on the L side and b/l pneumothoracies R>L, pneumomediastinum, L pleural effusion and evidence of aspiration on right.
On [**9-20**] patient trasferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hemoptysis with possible endobronchial ablative therapy.
Physical Exam: Tm: 97.1, Tc:97.0, BP: 109-160/31-62, P: 58-79, RR: 21(17-26), O2: 90% on 4l nc Gen: NAD, AAOx3 HEENT: perrla, eomi, mmm Neck: no jvd, no lad Chest: rrr, nl s1s2, no m/r/g Lungs: Bronchial breath sounds throughout, rales at Left lower lung field Abd: soft, nt, nd, normal bowel sounds Extremities: multiple soft/firm/mobile/nontender/subcutaneous nodules at forearm b/l, UE with non pitting edema r>l, LE with edematous knees, edematous feet, 2+ peripheral pulses.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidation with possible cavitation on the left.
On the right, there is obstruction of the right lower lobe bronchus with appearance suggesting possible hilar mass surrounding this bronchus.
Large left sided pleural effusion with component of loculation.
Dissection of air is likely the explanation for free air seen in the intraperitoneal space within the abdomen.
Multiple cystic lesions of the pancreas.
5.1 x 6.5 cm well delineated cystic lesion in the left upper quadrant.
this may represent a exophytic renal cyst, peritoneal inclusion cyst from prior surgery, another pancreatic cyst, or possibly a duplication cyst.
Shortly after procedure pt had recurrent hemoptysis and was transferred to MICU.
Pt was evaluated and found to have a cavitating pneumonia along with likely superimposed aspiration pneumonia.
On [**9-22**] a second bronchoscopy was performed, multiple clots and fresh blood was found which resolved with flushing.
Both brochoscopies determined the most likely bleeding site to be the bronchial artery of the RUL.
Pt arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] with b/l pneumothoracies, which are resolving though a small right loculated pocket remains.
Also c/b episode of hypertension to 160's treated with hydralazine.
Upon transfer to floor all cultures were obtained, without a single positive bacterial culture noted.
At these times he responded to suction and nebulizers, and it is felt that these episode are due to mucous plugging.
As on out patient it will be essential to work up incidental finding, CT abd showed retroperitoneal air and a 7x5 cm soft tissue mass.
