CT Chest [**1-18**]: There is patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe.
There is no evidence of cavitary lesion.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small on the right and trace on the left.
Mild linear atelectasis is also noted in the left lung base.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, but none meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
This exam is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
There are nonspecific periportal lymph nodes not meeting the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Peripelvic cysts are noted in the left kidney.
There is no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion.
The apparent abrupt cutoff of an upper lumbar vertebral body on the sagittal images is due to misregistration of two concatenated sequences of acquired images.
Patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia.
No cavitary lesion identified.
Small right and trace left pleural effusion.

Per renal consult, the finding of dilute urine made HCTZ side effect more likely than SIADH, but it is most likely that she had a mixed picture.
# Pneumonia: While initial x-ray suggested a cavitary lung lesion, this was not apparent on CT chest.
Felt that this was most c/w infection though did not have fever, leukocytosis, or productive cough at presentation.
She has no known risk factors for TB and denies systemic signs of TB.
She will complete a 7 day course of levofloxacin on [**1-24**]  # s/p fall: Likely due to unsteady gait, which may have been from developing hyponatremia over the last several days.
Seizure is also a possibility, especially since she had urinary incontinence and confusion afterwards, which may have been post-ictal.
Although she has a h/o AFib and positive stress test, there is no evidence at present for arrhythmia or ischemic event.
CT head and neck negative for acute process.
She has a h/o amnestic episode a couple of years ago, raising question that she may have underlying abnormal brain.
