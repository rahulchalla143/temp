Admission Date:  [**2160-7-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-9-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2121-12-2**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 38-year-old G7 P4 0-2-4, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] at 24-6/7 weeks after presenting with one pad of vaginal bleeding and unknown complete placenta previa.
Her transvaginal ultrasound revealed cerclage in good placement with cervical length of 33 mm and 8 mm dilated to the stitch.
She had no other symptoms.
Her prenatal course is significant for a 12 week prophylactic cerclage, which was placed given her history of incompetent cervix.
She has had no other episodes of low platelets since then.
OBSTETRIC HISTORY:  Significant for SAB x2, 36 week primary cesarean section for a 9 pound 14 ounce infant for possible preeclampsia and thrombocytopenia in [**2151**].
GYN HISTORY:  Significant for a LEEP x1 and a cone x1 for abnormal Pap smears prior to her [**2158**] pregnancy.
SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cesarean sections x4 and D&C x2, she had two laparoscopies for history of endometriosis.
She completed a course of betamethasone for fetal lung maturity.
On hospital day #7, she had a second episode of vaginal bleeding with a 2 x 2 cm bright red spot on toilet paper.
This episode subsided without intervention.
She was maintained with large bore IV access and an active blood bank while in the hospital.
Fetal testing remained reassuring and she had not had an episode of vaginal bleeding since [**2160-8-2**].
On [**2160-7-17**], she was found to have an anterior placenta a tip crossed in the os consistent with a complete placenta previa.
Amniotic fluid volume was moderately increased and the fetal anatomic survey was normal with limited views of the heart, outflow tracts, and spine.
On [**2160-9-9**], ultrasound revealed an anterior placenta with the tip crossed in the os consistent with an asymmetric complete previa.
There was difficult assessment secondary to the patient's body habitus, however, a large area of accreta was of concern.
Mild polyhydramnios was noted with an AFI equal to 23.
Central renal dilatation measuring 7 mm with caliectasis was consistent with mild hydronephrosis on the fetus.
No other fetal abnormalities were noted except now size was greater than dates by two weeks.
Urinalyses throughout the patient's stay had always been within normal limits with no evidence of hematuria.
She was brought to the main operating room and underwent repeat cesarean section, which was performed in a classical manner secondary to dense adhesions and cerclage removal.
Placenta previa was noted, however, there was no difficulty removing the placenta.
The patient underwent 2 liters of estimated blood loss intraoperatively and an intraoperative hematocrit was 21.
She received 4 more units of packed red blood cells and 3 liters of Lactated Ringers.
There was found to be clinical evidence of accreta.
She was begun on ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin for maternal temperature.
The patient's abdomen remained nontender and nondistended.
On postoperative day #5, there was found to be minimal erythema developing around the incision, and therefore the patient was begun on dicloxacillin for likely early wound cellulitis.
On postoperative day #6, the patient's staples were removed without incident, and that the patient was tolerating regular diet, voiding spontaneously, and was ambulating without any lightheadedness or dizziness prior to discharge.
Complete placenta previa with placenta accreta.
Likely early wound cellulitis.
