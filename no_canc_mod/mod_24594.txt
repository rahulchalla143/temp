A bedside echo showed no large effusions.
A stroke code was called, but a Neurology evaluation was negative for deficits and head CT was negative for acute intracranial process.
Her blood pressure improved with crystalloids, she remained afebrile, her white count remained normal, and her hypotension was attributed to volume loss from diarrhea and possibly the toxic effects from clostridium difficile.
She clinically improved overall on antibiotics for c.diff, was otherwise without symptoms or signs of sepsis physiology afterwards, and remained hemodynamically stable for the remainder of her admission.
EKG changes: On admission, she was noted to have ST depressions in leads V4, V5, and V6, and her BNP was elevated to greater than 24,000.
The changes were attributed to demand ischemia secondary to her hypotension.
These were held due to her hypotension on admission.
End stage renal disease:  The Renal team continued to follow her course and make recommendations.
