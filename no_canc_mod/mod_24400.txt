He was found to be in ventricular fibrillation and was shocked 5 times, given 3mg of epinephrine, 2mg of magnesium for torsades rhythm.
He was unresponsive and sedated and was eventually extubated on [**9-25**] and has been very agitated and uncooperative.
Cardiac cath [**2179-9-29**] revealed no coronary disease but he has 3+ mitral regurgitation.

There is no shift of normally midline structures and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is well preserved.
There is opacification of bilateral maxillary sinuses.
Ethmoid air cells demonstrate mucosal thickening.
There is trace fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
There is a left occipital posterior scalp hematoma.
No acute intracranial process.
Left occipital scalp hematoma, without fracture.
Intra-op TEE [**2179-10-7**] Pre-CPB: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 - 45 %).
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The mitral valve shows characteristic myxomatous deformity.
There is moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a mitral ring in good position with no leak and no MR.
Biventricular systolic fxn is mildly improved.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 year old male with no known past medical history admitted with VF arrest while at the Red Sox game.
He underwent CPR in the field along with defibrillation and transition to atrial fibrillation.
Initial echocardiogram showed severe mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation with a flail mitral valve, which was most likely the precipitant of his VF arrest.
Upon admission, he was started on empiric antibiotic therapy for possible aspiration pneumonia with cefepime, vancomycin and metronidazole.
Intra-operatively, the patient was found to have an osteoporotic appearing sternum.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
A dual chamber ACID was placed on [**2179-10-13**] without complication.
His Dobhoff tube was removed on day of discharge and patient was instructed by the speech and swallow team for aspiration precautions.
INR goal [**2-3**] for atrial fibrillation.
By the time of discharge on POD 7 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing well with staples in place and pain was controlled with oral analgesics and he was tolerating a ground diet.
