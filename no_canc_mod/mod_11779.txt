Admission Date:  [**2166-5-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-5-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-8-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**] Chief Complaint: Cough, lightheadedness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 41871**] is a 59yo M w/hx of HTN who presents with cough and lightheadedness for 1 day.
He states that he has been having intermittent episodes of lightheadness and dizziness for the past 1 month.
He reports this episodes are associated with chest tightness and palpitations and he feels a sense of "warmth" during them that lasts for moments.
[**Name2 (NI) **] denies shortness of breath with the episodes and has never experienced them previously.
He states that on the day prior to admission he developed a cough with white sputum and shortness of breath.
He describes 3 pillow orthopnea and could not sleep because of his breathing.
He also had lightheadness which persisted which is why he came to the ED.
He denies green or brown sputum production.
He was found to be in afib with RVR on arrival with stable blood pressures and otherwise asymptomatic.
He had a CXR which showed a ?RLL PNA which was difficult to visualize.
Due to concerns for PE he underwent CTA which showed no PE.
It showed mild CHF and pulmonary nodules.
Due to concerns for flash pulmonary edema he was placed on bipap, started on a nitro gtt and was given 40mg IV Lasix.
A repeat CXR showed a RLL infiltrate after 2L NS.

There is a subtle increased opacity in the lower right lung with suggestion of an underlying reticular nodular interstitial pattern.
No further consolidation is seen elsewhere.
The cardiac silhouette is grossly stable in size accounting for patient and technical factors.
No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Question possible early developing opacity in the right lung base as detailed above.
CTA chest [**2166-5-22**]: CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Somewhat diffuse bronchial wall thickening is seen but more pronounced in the right lower lobe.
A few interstitial septal lines are seen at the lung bases, but there is no alveolar edema or evidence of overt congestive heart failure.
There are numerous prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, which is pathologically enlarged, seen in the subcarinal, and AP window stations most prominently as well as pretracheal.
Numerous sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules are seen in a bilateral, subpleural distribution (e.g.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pulmonary embolus.
Findings only of mild congestive heart failure.
Scattered sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules, for which followup 12-month chest CT may be indicated if there is high risk for primary or secondary lung malignancy.
Likely underlying adrenal hyperplasia, though adrenal glands not fully evaluated on chest CT.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
CXR [**2166-5-22**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lung volumes are again diminished, and a previously subtle opacity in the right lung base has dramatically increased in the short interval.
There is no evidence of effusion, although the left costophrenic angle is excluded from view.
IMPRESSION: Short order significantly increased bibasilar consolidations in a pattern highly suggestive of aspiration.
Echocardiogram [**2166-5-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular cavity enlargement with mild global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.).
CXR [**2166-5-23**]: Compared to the prior study, there is significant improvement in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe opacities most likely consistent with interval resolution of pulmonary edema versus aspiration.
Still present bibasilar opacities representing residual of prior process but given the rapid improvement unlikely to represent pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusion is present as well as minimal perihilar vascular engorgement that most likely represents residual of the pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax, and cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
Brief Hospital Course: 59yo M w/hx of HTN who presents with new onset afib with RVR with unclear precipitant and respiratory distress, hypoxia.
Infection may have played a role given suggestion of PNA on imaging.
The rhthym was felt initally to be most consistent with atrial fibrillation, although there were episodes where the heart rate were regular, and it is uncommon for A-fib to reach rate in 200s.
However, even minor movement (such as sitting up in bed) triggered bursts of tachycardia to 140s-160s.
Adenosine was avoided given risk of SVT/WPW.
Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: This was felt most likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of RVR and poor forward flow.
However, there was possible contribution from PNA.
BNP was elevated in support of volume overload in the lungs.
Monday ([**5-26**]) FAX results to [**Last Name (LF) 162**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 41873**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Tachyarrhythmia Chronic heart failure Secondary Diagnosis: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for a very fast heart rate.
It is not clear what caused you to have this irregular heart rate, but it is now being controlled using medications.
The symptoms of heart failure are most likely due to your fast heart rate.
