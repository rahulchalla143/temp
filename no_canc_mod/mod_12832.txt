HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 39648**] is an 82 year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and angioplasty in [**2172**], diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presents to the [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital after a routine check up at her primary care physician's office revealed supraventricular tachycardia and some T wave changes concerning for ischemic disease.
There she was evaluated for acute myocardial infarction and cardioverted for her dysrhythmia, although it was unclear whether the dysrhythmia represented supraventricular tachycardia or atrial flutter and fibrillation.
During the examination she had no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
There is no abdominal pain or problems with her bowel control.
Diabetes mellitus.
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2172**] for coronary artery disease.
Asthma and bronchitis.
Scheduled for colonoscopy shortly.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General, the patient is a pleasant, elderly woman in no acute distress.
Head and neck showed mucous membranes are moist.
Chest with some bibasilar rales right greater then left.
No organomegaly.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No carotid or femoral bruits.
Cardiac catheterization revealed a 50% stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery and a 30% stenosis in the distal circumflex with diffusely diseased distal left anterior descending coronary artery.
However, there was no flow limiting stenoses appreciated.
Mrs.[**Hospital 39650**] hospital course was complicated by some left sided weakness one day post cardiac catheterization.
This history began on the [**5-13**] where she awoke at 2:00 a.m. after having gone to bed several hours earlier with new onset of left sided weakness and left sided facial droop and left sided neglect.
MR imaging study of the head revealed a small diffusion signal increase in the right basal ganglia internal capsule area without flow distal to the take off of the right MCA from the ICA.
She reports no problems with her vision, numbness and tingling, although she can now appreciate that she has weakness on her left side.
Token together we cannot be certain that this stroke was not secondary to some Cardioembolic disease.
However, what is clear is that a transesophageal echocardiogram done at the time of cardioversion revealed no evidence of atrial disease or thrombus present.
Depending upon the results of this cardiac echocardiogram we may consider anticoagulation although in the absence of any evidence of thrombus formation it is unlikely that anticoagulation is of any benefit.
One may also consider the addition of Aggrenox via the extended release formulation of aspirin and Dipridamole and this will be considered at her next visit with her neurology physicians as well as the Stroke Service.
This is important as although she may not have any significant left sided neglect in the setting of any infection in the future, any stress of any sort in future days to years and may bring out this old left sided neglect and present as a problem for Mrs. [**Known lastname 39648**].
Supraventricular tachycardia status post cardioversion.
Right MCA ischemic infarction status post IVTPA as part of the DIFUSE study.
Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2172**].
Diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Iron deficiency anemia with colonoscopy as scheduled.
