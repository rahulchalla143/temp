There has been interval removal of right-sided chest tube.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is persistent right lower lobe atelectasis, and there is new loss of the left hemidiaphragm, which may represent atelectasis or consolidation.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
Focal calcifications in aortic arch.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No perivalvular or central leaks.
Mild to Moderate MR and Mild to Moderate TR.
Interpretation assigned to [**Name6 (MD) 3892**] [**Name8 (MD) 3893**], MD, Interpreting physician CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE Study Date of [**2133-4-22**] 8:21 AM Final Report Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
There is no mass effect, midline shift, hemorrhage or extra-axial fluid collection.
There is no decreased diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
Multiple areas of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity are again noted in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, not significantly changed since the prior examination, and a nonspecific finding.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted in the visualized paranasal sinuses.
The mastoid air cells demonstrate some small areas of fluid, left greater than right.
MRA HEAD: The left vertebral artery demonstrates decreased flow compared with the prior examination, likely representing interval stenosis.
There is normal flow-related enhancement of the intracranial internal carotid arteries, anterior cerebral arteries, middle cerebral arteries, right vertebral artery, the basilar artery and the left posterior cerebral artery.
There is no evidence of a dissection or aneurysm, within the limitations of the MRA technique.
A posterior communicating artery is identified on the right, but there is no definite posterior communicating artery on the left.
No evidence of an acute infarct or other acute intracranial pathology.
Areas of white matter hyperintensity are a nonspecific finding, but may represent the sequela of chronic microangiopathy given the patient's age.
Decreased flow in the left vertebral artery is concerning for interval stenosis.
At peak exercise, 0.5-1.0mm upsloping ST segment depression was noted inferolaterally.
Sinus rhythm with rare isolated VPDs post-exercise.
INTERPRETATION: Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium.

The LCx had a mild mid eccentric 30% stenosis but was otherwise patent.
There was moderate to severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 40 mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.98 cm2.
Moderate to severe aortic stenosis.
CARDIOLOGY FELLOW: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] R. ATTENDING STAFF: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] E.   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6682**] was admitted to the BIMDC on [**2133-4-20**] for further work-up of his chest pain and left arm numbness.
As he had known aortic stenosis, a cardiac work-up was performed.
An echo revealed severe and worsened aortic stenosis.
A cardiac catheterization was also performed which showed no significant coronary artery disease.
The cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical management of his aortic valve stenosis and he was worked up in the usual preoperative manner.
A carotid ultrasound was negative for any significant carotid artery disease.
