Admission Date:  [**2120-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-5-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2040-3-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: The patient is an 80 year old man with a history of poliomyelitis as a child, new onset atrial fibrillation, and recent GI bleed now presenting with respiratory failure.
The patient problems began in late [**Month (only) 956**] when he presented to his Cardiologist with increased shortness of breath and was found to be in rapid afib and congestive heart failure.
He went for a cardiac catheterization at the time which showed severe LAD disease.
He was noted to have a bilateral pneumonia and was started on doxycycline.
He epresented about a week later to the hospital, febrile and with hematemesis and BRBPR--his bp was 80/38 with a HR of 125; INR was 6.2.
He was found to have bleeding jejunal diverticulas and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear--both of which were surgically corrected.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Percutaneous Tracheostomy  History of Present Illness: This is a 80 year old male with recent admit to [**Hospital 108**] hospital [**2120-3-18**] due to acute dyspnea.
He has a new onset A- fib, CHF, S/P jejunal resection on [**2120-4-5**], for bleeding diverticulae.
His respiratory status has remained tenuous and has been diagnosed with atypical pneumonia vs. early ARDs.
He was transferred to the surgical service of [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2120-4-12**] for failure to wean from vent.
He has completed courses of empiric antibiotics.
He has been slowly getting better since that time, and is being transferred to the MICU service [**2120-5-9**] for failure to wean from the ventilator.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: -s/p appendectomy -h/o polio as a child; wife tells me he was diagnosed in the [**2064**]'s during the polio epidemic; had a headache at the time; no  weakness or diarrhea -recent new atrial fibrillation -h/o recent pneumonia    Social History: Social History: -married and lives with wife -no tobacco or alchol use -worked as a machinist    Family History: Family History: -father had a stroke at 90 -mother died of old age -no h/o neuromuscular problems  Physical Exam: V: Tm 99.2 115/52 (98/45-146/75) 82 (66-83) SIMV/PS 450x23 [**10-27**] 40% 7.38/50/183 breathing at 36 PIP 25 Plat 29 (yesterday) I/O 990/970 (urine) Gen: no apparent distress.
HEENT: OP clear, MM dry Neck: no JVD Resp: clear bilaterally CV: irreg, tachy normal S1s2 no murmurs Abd: soft NTND midline incision well healed.
No cyanosis, clubbing, edema Neuro: Responsive to voice.
[**2120-4-14**] BAL no growth and neg cytology [**2120-4-22**] LP negative for infection and cytology [**2120-4-30**] BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE no growth and neg cytology [**2120-4-30**] 9:46 am Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture [**2120-5-10**] Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test: negative VIRAL CULTURE CYTOMEGALOVIRUS-LIKE CYTOPATHIC EFFECT .
[**5-13**] PCXR Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has improved over the past five days.
Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
There is no focal pulmonary abnormality to suggest pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
[**5-8**] CXR: global interstitial abnormality, low lung volumes .
[**5-7**] EKG Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Downsloping ST segment depressions in leads V4-V6 suggest the possibility of lateral ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2120-4-29**] the rate is diminished and the downsloping ST segment depressions in the lateral precordial leads are slightly more prominent.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities, fibrotic changes, pleural effusions and possible lower lobe consolidations.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism within the limitations of the study.
[**4-24**] US L LE: Left lower extremity DVT extending from the common femoral vein to the popliteal vein.
[**4-23**] EEG: No actual sharp or epileptiform discharges were seen.
No electrographic seizures were recorded.
This EEG is most consistent with an encephalopathy.
[**4-22**] CT Head: No intracranial hemorrhage.
No evidence of a major vascular territory acute infarct .
[**4-15**] Upper ext U/S negative for DVT  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 80 year old man with a h/o recent onset atrial fibrillation, GI bleed, and ARDS now presents with continued respiratory failure.
His neurologic exam demonstrates obtundation--perhaps related to multiple sedating meds.
The neurologic differential for respiratory insufficency would include: muscle- critical illness myopathy; NMJ: myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], nerve: AIDP (had reflexes), critical illness polyneuropathy; cord: high cervical cord injury (does not seem paraparetic); anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] cell- AlS, west [**Doctor First Name **], enteroviruses (does have h/o questionable h/o polio).
Impression is for a non-neurologic cause of his respiratory failure (pna, ards).
Pt secondary to His respiratory failure underwent tracheostomy on [**4-17**]/5.
#) Respiratory failure - Patient was trached [**4-17**].
Increased secretions but afebrile, [**3-15**] CXR with improved edema and no PNA.
#) Hyprenatremia - Patient developed hypernatremia of unclear etiology.
#) Encephalopathy and agitation - d/ced standing haldol, use sparingly PRN.
Minimize sedation for now and AVOID BENZOS or narcotics.
No PE on CTA.
#) H/o CHF - Echo EF60%/2+MR/1+TR with PA diastolic hypertension.
#) Atrial fibrillation - supratherapeutic INR initially upon transfer to MICU.
#) Prophylaxis - Continued prevacid, bowel regimen, supratherapeutic INR.
#) precautions - for VRE colonization .
