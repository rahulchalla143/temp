Admission Date:  [**2157-4-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-4-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-8-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Bare Metal Stent insertion x2 to proximal and distal RCA  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 64 yo man with h/o hyperlipidemia and chronic low back pain who presented with chest pain.
On the way back to bed, he experienced [**7-20**] burning substernal chest pain, radiating to his left jaw and mid sternum.
He felt associated diaphoresis and shortness of breath but decided to go back to bed.
He tried finding a comfortable position to relieve the pain but it was in vain.
He did not experience nausea and vomiting but instead felt a sensation of 'belching'.
When he got out of bed a few hours later for work, he felt weak, lightheaded and had some blurring of vision.
He felt more weakness than pain in the ED.
He did not try any pain relief medications (especially aspirin) when he felt the chest pain as he felt he shouldn't compromise his chances on doing the scan.
He has had some shortness of breath on exertion for the past 4 weeks but did not think much of it otherwise.
EKG showed STEs in II, III, AVF, V3-V6, ST depressions in I, AVL, and TWIs in V1,V2.
In the cath lab, the patient was found to have a total occlusion of the proximal RCA and a distal RCA lesion, which were both stented with BMS.
He then had a right heart catheterization, which showed elevated RA pressures (18) and mildly elevated left-sided pressures.
He otherwise had no acute complaints.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, headaches, myalgias, cough, rhinorrhea, hemoptysis, acid brash, abdominal swelling, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Hyperlipidemia 2.
Chronic Low Back Pain 4.
His father passed away from complications of Parkinson's disease at the age of 72.
No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, sudden cardiac death or strokes.
VS: Afebrile , BP 135/94, HR 95, RR 14, O2 sat 100% on 4L GENERAL: Pleasant man in NAD.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTA anteriorly, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTA anteriorly, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.

No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: Trace pretibial edeema GROIN: soft, non-tender, no femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LAD had a less than 50% stenosis after S1.
The LCx had no angiographically apparent disease.
The RCA had a total proximal occlusion with collaterals from the LCA.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 20 mmHg.
The PASP was slightly elevated at 32 mmHg.
ECHO ([**2157-4-13**] 3:54:12 PM): - Mild symmetric LVH.
- Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the septum and inferior wall.
- RV mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
- Aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with regional LV systolic dysfunction and RV dysfunction consistent with RCA ischemia/infarction.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction with deep Q waves in inferior leads as well as tall R wave in lead V2 suggesting posterior myocardial infarction.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Compared to the previous tracing ST segment elevation in the inferior leads is reduced.
Findings are consistent with evolving  inferior-posterior myocardial infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 40860**] is a 64 yo man with h/o hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain and was found to have an inferolateral STEMI who subsequently underwent PCI with BMS X 2 insertion to RCA with uncomplicated post-cath course.
STEMI: The patient presented with SS chest pain, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and SOB at home.
His cardiac catheterization demonstrated two occlusions of the RCA, for which he had two BMS placed, and his hemodynamics were concerning for a RV infarct.
Follow-up TTE demonstrated mild symmetric LVH with regional LV systolic dysfunction, RV dysfunction consistent with RCA ischemia/infarction and no significant valvular abnormality.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable and chest pain free post-PCI.
Was taking ibuprofen, changed to standing tylenol dut to chronic kidney disease.
During admission, pain controlled with PO acetaminophen PRN and oxycodone PRN.
BPH: Patients takes Alfuzosin at home, but was stopped during hospitalization since was at risk for developing hypotension in the setting of his RV infarct.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES -- Follow-up blood pressure as outpatient; if stable and patient without symptoms of orthostasis can be restarted or may consider alternative BPH medication without side effect profile of hypotensive.
