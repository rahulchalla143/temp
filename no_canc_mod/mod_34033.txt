On exam, there was cellulitis around g-tube.
Mildy wheezing on exam with decreased breath sounds on the left.
The resident tried to do an ABG, but he had a tremor on the right and contractures on the left so he was unable to do so.
# Tachypnea: Patient with low grade fever, increased cough, more shortness of breath than baseline and possible worsening of CXR on the left which is consistent with pneumonia.
However, patient also with other reason to have low grade fever (cellulitis), and shortness of breath (restrictive lung disease and improvement with nebs), chronic aspiration.
On physical exam his wheezing was found to be mostly upper airway so we treated him for pneumonia (VAP and pseudomonas) with Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]/Cipro.
His sputum culture was difficult to obtain and grew mixed respiratory flora.
Cipro was stopped the next morning as it was felt unlikely that the patient had pneumonia given his rapid improvement.

He denied urinary symptoms.
He was on meropenem for his possible pneumonia and cellulitis which should cover his pseudomonas.
