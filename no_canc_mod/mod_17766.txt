Past Medical History: 1)Ventillator dependence since [**1-5**] s/p trach (perhaps due to GBS), successfully decanulated in [**10-7**], however readmitted [**Date range (1) 76415**] for evaluation of small tracheal mass and desaturated in the setting of bronchoscopy and trach was replaced.
The appearance of the lungs appears grossly stable to that from [**2103-2-24**], with central pulmonary vascular prominence.
There is no right effusion and the left extreme costophrenic angle is not included in this radiograph.
2)CT head ([**3-25**]): No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 78yo with chronic ventilator dependence who presents s/p respiratory and PEA arrest and mental status changes.

Pulse returned quickly and there were no post-ischemic changes.
3)Mental status changes: Patient found to have new mental status changes after respiratory and PEA arrest.

6)Anxiety/depression: Patient has history of night time anxiety.
