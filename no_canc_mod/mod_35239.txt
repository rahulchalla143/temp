AXR [**2115-5-25**]: HISTORY: 87-year-old man with sepsis, recovering, but more distended with diarrhea, evaluate for colonic distention.
No evidence for small- bowel obstruction.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION:  Multiple healed right rib fractures.
CT abdomen/pelvis with oral contrast [**2115-5-26**]: CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: In the visualized lung bases, there are new small bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right.
There are associated atelectasis in both bibasilar region, however, cannot rule out superimposed infectious process.
The liver appears unchanged, without focal abnormality.
The pancreas slightly appeared to have fatty replacement but otherwise within normal limits.
In the left lower pole of the kidney, there is a calcific exophytic density, likely represents a calcified renal cyst, unchanged in appearance.
There is no evidence of extraluminal oral contrast leak.
The stomach, duodenum, loops of small bowel and colons are patent with oral contrast, without evidence of bowel obstruction.
There is interval minimally increase of the bilateral pericolonic fat stranding, left more than right, but no evidence of colonic wall thickening to suggest acute colitis.
A small region of fat stranding is also seen subjacent to the aortic bifurcation, also non- specific.
A small amount of stool is noted in the rectal vault, with unchanged appearance of perirectal fat stranding and minimally prominent rectal wall.
Evaluation of the collapsed bladder is limited, but no gross abnormality is identified.
There is no free fluid or air in the intra- abdominal cavity or the pelvis.
Several small, scattered lymph nodes are seen in the messenteric, retroperitoneal and inguinal regions, but no lymphadenopathy is identified.
There is no fluid collection in either the abdomen or pelvis suspicious for abscess.
BONE WINDOW: There is an unchanged L2 compression fracture, but no acute fracture or dislocation.
Significant vascular calcification is seen along the descending aorta and its major branches.
No lytic or blastic lesion suspicious for metastasis is identified.
No definite evidence of acute colitis.
Nonspecific mild pericolonic fat stranding in the descending colon, without colonic wall thickening.
No fluid collection suspicious for abscess.
The PEG balloon is malpositioned, partially dislodged in the subcutaneous track, but no evidence of oral contrast leak.
Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion accompanied by small increasing right pleural effusion suggests that the basal predominant opacification in the lungs is due to pulmonary edema and not pneumonia.
Mild cardiomegaly stable.
TTE [**2115-5-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No obvious echocardiographic evidence of valvular vegetations.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Right ventricular dilation with borderline normal function.
Mild mitral and aortic regurgitation.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo M with recent stroke admitted to the medical floor for fever and hyperglycemia.
ICU Course The patient was transferred to the ICU after hypotension on the floor.
The patient did not require pressor support or intubation.
He was found to have an E.Coli/Staph Aureus UTI which was initially covered with Vanc/Zosyn/Cefepime and transitioned to Bactrim prior to transfer back to the general medical floor.
After initial volume repletion, the patient was transitioned to an insulin gtt and D5W to correct hyperglycemia and hypernatremia.
Prior to callout, the patient developed a 4 second pause with intermittent sinus bradycardia on telemetry.
Pt was treated with Vanc/Zosyn/Cefepime initially in the ICU,and then tailored to bactrim to treat his staph aureus/E Coli UTI.
Repeat CXR showed a possible new LLL PNA, however subsequent CXR relayed that this was more likely effusion/atelectasis in the LLL.
Given his abdominal distension and diarrhea, CT abdomen/pelvis was performed.
This showed no obstruction, colitis, or abscess.
He also had no noted sacral osteomyelitis or abscess.
TTE on [**5-28**] showed no vegetations and EF of 55%.
He was continued on Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl to cover for potential aspiration PNA (as pt was noted to be aspirating while here), and to cover his UTI.
He was afebrile for 48 hours at the time of discharge and will complete 8 days of Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl .
# Bradycardia: The patient has developed pauses, sinus bradycardia to the 50s, and bursts of tachycardia in the high 90s while in the ICU.
This rhythm is preliminarily consistent with sick sinus syndrome.
Once transferred back to the floor, the pt continued to have pauses up to 2 seconds and HR in the 50s.
Discussion of pacemaker was not pursued at this time in the setting of infection, but if pt has persistent pauses or symptoms, then pacemaker discussion may need to occur in the future.
# Hypovolemic Hypernatremia:  Due to on-going insufficient free water repletion.
# E. Coli & Staph Aureus UTI:  Pts urine grew E Coli and Staph aureus, both sensitive to bactrim.
Given staph aureus in the urine, blood cultures were checked but were negative.
# Hyperglycemia/DMII: Pts lantus dose was increased as needed for initial fingersticks in the 400s.
Likely lethargic due to infection/dehydration in setting of underlying dementia.
Confirmed with family that his mental status while here was at baseline.
# Pulmonary edema: Pt had noted edema on CXR on [**2115-5-26**] after 4 L NS fluid resuscitation.
No Lasix was given due to low BP initially.
On day of discharge [**5-29**], pt had increased wheezing and crackles in his lungs on exam (still satting 98% RA), so given Lasix 10 mg IV x1.
As BP tolerates, pt may need some gentle diuresis after the aggressive fluid resuscitation he received here.
# Acute renal failure:  Admission Cr had been 1.5, up from baseline of 0.9.
# History of traumatic subdural:  Continued keppra for seizure prophylaxis .
# decubitis ulcer:  Pt has a stage III ulcer on his upper R trochanter and a stage II on his sacrum.
Also has a R heel ulcer.
# Anasarca: Albumin low at 2.7.
# Atrial fibrillation: Currently not anticoagulated due to SDH, supposedly from falls.
Can consider anticoagulation as outpatient given that his greatest risk of fall is with the [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] lift, which is a modifiable risk factor.
No rate control given h/o bradycardia.
# Diarrhea/abdominal discomfort: Pt had diarrhea while here, requiring rectal tube.
Pt had some tenderness on exam with palpation.
This showed no obstruction, colitis, or abscess.
He also had no noted sacral osteomyelitis or abscess.
CT abdomen did note foley in prostatic urethra, so pts foley was advanced and his abdominal pain resolved.
# BPH: Flomax was stopped due to hypotension.
If a voiding trial is to be performed in the future, would resume flomax 1 week prior.
It has been held due to recent hypotensive episodes.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with confusion, high sodium, dehydration, acute renal failure, and a urinary tract infection.
The following medication changes have been made: Your lisinopril and norvasc have been stopped due to low blood pressure.
Your baclofen and flomax have also been held due to low blood pressure.
Your aricept has been stopped in case this was causing your low heart rate.
Call your doctor or go to the ER for any worsening confusion, recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, vomiting, persistent diarrhea, or any other concerning symptoms.
