During workup for several months of anginal symptoms that included cath showing 3 vessel disease, pt underwent carotid doppler study on [**12-6**] that showed complete occlusion of the R ICA and >70% occlusion of the L ICA, though the pt c/o no HA, TIA, vision, dizziness or other neurologic sx.
The procedure was completed without complication and without evidence of distal embolization.
On arrival in CCU, pt was maintained on .3mcg/kg/min of phenylephrine and pt was without complaints.

Angiography of the aortic arch with a pigtail catheter in ascending aorta showed a Type 1 arch without lesions.
Angiography of the right carotid artery with Berenstein catheter in right common carotid artery showed patent right external with occluded  right internal carotid artery.
Angiography of the left carotid artery with Berenstein catheter in the left common carotid artery showed the left common and external to be normal.
The left internal carotid had a ulcerated 80% lesion best seen in LAO 45 view.
This left internal carotid fills the ipsilateral and contralateral ACA and MCA.
Given severity of lesion and upcoming surgery we elected to proceed with stenting.
We exchanged for a Shuttle sheath 6F into the left common carotid and started heparin with therapeutic ACT.
The filter was recovered without incident and presence of small amount of atheromatous material.
Final cerebral angiography without evidence of embolization or vessel occlusion.
Occluded right internal carotid artery.
80% stenosis of left internal carotid artery.
Stenting of left internal carotid artery with distal protection.
