WBC count and diff c/w bacterial meningitis, as well as very elevated protein, though gram stains from OSH have been negative thus far.
Meningococcus less likely as no rash and extension from otitis media would be an unlikely route of infection from meningococcus.
Doubt Lyme given extension from otitis media and wrong time of year.
- cont with ceftriaxone and vanco for now to cover bacterial pathogens - pneumococcus seems most likely given origin of otitis media - cont with IV decadron 10mg IV q6 as OSH + S.Pneumo - HSV PCR/Lyme pending - if gram negative rods show up on gram stain, would give intrathecal gent - U HCG - @ OSH - ID on consult, appreciate recs - [**5-10**] PICC for outpt.
# L mastoid opacification - - ENT on consult, appreciate recs - surgical intervention likely not needed per ENT as not c/w mastoiditis per se - no further interventions, pt will f/u with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] OM already drained per ENT recs.
you were given antibiotics and steroids and your symptoms improved drastically.
You will get antibiotics (ceftriaxone) twice a [**Known lastname **] for 11 [**Known lastname **] and you should return IMMEDIATELY to an emergency room for any worsening of change in your improvement.
