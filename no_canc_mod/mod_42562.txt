Left bundle-branch block.
Interval increase in pulmonary vascular markings, right more than left, likely representing asymmetric pulmonary edema.
More focal opacity within the right upper lobe may also reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but pneumonia is also a possibility.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Respiratory distress: Received vancomycin and cefepime in the ER, but these were held as she had no WBC elevation, fever, or cough to suggest pneumonia.
She initially was hypercarbic and required BiPAP in the ICU, although was quickly weaned.
However, she redeveloped respiratory distress with SBP of 205, and was again treated with BiPAP and IV furosemide with good response.
Her SBP improved and averaged 140-160, but with occasoinal transient elevation to 180-190.
Her hydralazine was changed from q12 to q6, nifedipine held for low HR, and lisinopril started and increased to 10mg daily.
3) UTI: Treated empirically with a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin for a floridly positive UA and history of sensitive E coli.
Urine culture showed contamination and repeat culture was negative.
4) Aortic stenosis / chronic diastolic HF: Repeat echo showed aortic valve area 1.0-1.2 cm2.
Her home meds were continued with the hydralazine change and new ACE-I as noted above.
Retics were low, B12 and folate normal, and iron studies nonspecific, although perhaps suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
7) Metabolic alkalosis: Likely from contraction alkalosis from furosemide +/- posthypercapneic alkalosis.
8) Goals of care: Patient expressed repeated desire to die, although denied depression or suicidality.
Also, she no longer enjoys the things she used to with her poor hearing and vision.
