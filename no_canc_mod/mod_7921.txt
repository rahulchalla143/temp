History of Present Illness: Patient is an 80 year old man with history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and stent, systolic congestive heart failure, and stage 4 chronic renal insufficiency who was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit after presenting to the emergency room after cardiac arrest.
He was at home today when his wife heard a loud thump, and he was found down unresponsive in the kitchen with the refrigerator door open with his Procrit in his hand.
Past Medical History: # DM Type 2 - dxed [**2071**]; insulin since [**2081**].

Cardiac History: CABG ([**2087**]) with anatomy: LIMA --> LAD, SVG -->  OM2, SVG --> OM3, SVG to mid-RCA jump to PDA .
Percutaneous coronary intervention: [**2097-1-8**]: BMS x 1 --> SVG to PDA [**2097-2-14**]: BMS x 3 --> distal anastamotic site SVG to PDA, prox PDA, mid PDA [**2105-1-14**] - cath without intervention .
Social History: Per his wife, patient does not use tobacco or alcohol.
Telemetry strip from EMS shows VT, post shock there is a period of asystole, followed by a slow wide complex rhythym (approximately 40), followed by an accelerated wide complex rhythym, which then converts to Atrial Fibrillation with a narrow QRS complex.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2105-5-14**]: CT C-Spine without contrast IMPRESSION: Moderately severe DJD.
No definite fracture.
There is a 6.6-mm possible nodule in the left lung apex which is only seen on one image.
No stone, hydronephrosis, or mass is identified.
There is a simple cyst within the lower pole of the left kidney measuring approximately 1.5 cm, not significantly changed from [**2105-1-15**].
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis .
Cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution but no overt pulmonary edema.
Apparent elevation of right hemidiaphragm, probably due to subpulmonic right effusion, but right lateral decubitus chest radiograph may be considered for confirmation if warranted clinically.
Persistent small left effusion.
[**2105-5-23**] CHEST PA AND LATERAL Pacer/ICD device has been placed with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, and no pneumothorax.
Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and a moderate-sized right pleural effusion appears slightly larger.
Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Upper zone vascular redistribution is present, but no overt pulmonary edema is evident.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Blood culture [**2105-5-10**]: No growth final  Brief Hospital Course: # Ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest: Patient was without spontaneous circulation for approximately 10 minutes, possibly longer.
It is difficult to exclude an acute ischemic event but the monomorphic ventricular tachycarida on rhythm strip and known history of coronary artery disease was suggestive of a scar-mediated arrhythmic sudden cardiac death.
Patient initally demonstrated some cognitive deficits, especially in short term memory, however these improved greatly during his stay.
In regards to his arrhythmia, he did have another episode of ventricular tachycardia on evening after he was extubated for approximately 2 1/2 minutes.
It was initially it was felt that the patient had evidence of congestive heart failure, however on [**2105-5-12**] he had an episode of hypoxia.
A chest x-ray at that time revealed RUL/RML collapse secondary to mucous plugging which likely caused the acute hypoxic event, which was responsive to suction.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage (Vancomycin and Zosyn) given concerns over possible pneumonia based on imaging studies and hypotension.
He had no further respiratory complaints and continued to have a normal oxygen saturation on room air.
# Coronary artery disease: It was not suspected that inciting event was ischemic in nature.
His EKGs were consistent with his prior EKGs, without any findings concerning for acute ischemia.
He had no symptoms of ischemia during his stay.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on chronic anticoagulation for this.
During his stay, his rhythm alternated mainly between atrial fibrillation and a junctional rhythm.
He was kept on a heparin drip during his stay while decisions were being made regarding placement of a defibrillator or other interventions.
# Hypotension: Patient initially presented with hypotension after his arrest and required pressor support.
It was felt his hypotension may have been secondary to his arrest.
He had no evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
He was treated with antibiotics for his pneumonia as well.
# Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient, per report from family and outpatient cardiologist, was functioning well prior to his cardiac arrest.
His home diuretics (torsemide and chlorothiazide) were held during his stay for this reason, as well as his renal insufficiency and initially poor urine output.
The 24 hours prior to discharge he was negative 1 liter; he was asymptomatic and saturating >97% on room air.
Given the increasing size of the right pleural effusion upon discharge, he will likely need diuresis soon; however, the administration of diuretics must be delicately balanced with his renal insufficiency until his renal function returns to baseline (Creatinine ~3).
*He was instructed to weigh himself daily, limit his sodium intake to 2 grams daily, and to monitor for signs of heart failure (dyspnea, peripheral edema, etc.).
He was instructed to contact his physician if he became symptomatic prior to reporting to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] for his appointment on [**6-25**] for renal followup; his VNA was also his oxygen saturation decreased below 93%.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Patient was treated with lantus and a humalog sliding scale.
# Renal Failure: Patient has chronic stage 4 renal insufficiency.
The renal team was consulted, and it was suspected that the patient had ATN secondary to his circulatory arrest and hypotension.
It was felt that his renal function would continue to improve, and that he had no indications for dialysis.
# Anemia: Patient has history of chronic anemia and is on Procrit as an outpatient.
While on the heparin drip, he had mild epistaxis and bruising, but otherwise had no evidence of bleeding.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Cardiac Arrest Secondary diagnoses: - ICD placement - Ventricular tachycardia - Chronic renal insufficiency - Anoxic brain injury - Diabetes mellitus - Systolic congestive heart failure - Anemia - Coronary artery disease - Chronic stage 4-5 renal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Stable, ambulating with assistance of walker.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit after having a cardiac arrest at home.
You did well post extubation, with some cognitive deficits and worsening renal function.
A defibrillator was placed to prevent further dangerous continued arrhythmias.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1395**], or go to the emergency room if you experience any chest pain, palpitations, difficulty breathing, bleeding, swelling or redness at site of defibrillator insertion, firing of your defibrillator, decreased or no urination, or other concerning symptoms.
This medication has been stopped due to your renal function being worse than your baseline.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is important to understand that this medication helps rid your body of excess fluid due to chronic systolic congestive heart failure, or decreased pumping ability of your heart.
If you develop symptoms of shortness of breath, inability to lie flat due to shortness of breath, swelling in your feet or ankles, or shortness of breath with exertion, please contact your physician as these are signs of excess fluid which may be affecting your lungs and other organs.
It is also recommended that you followup with your PCP prior to this, if possible, so he can monitor your volume status as well.
- Potassium (Klor-con powder) has been stopped due to your worsened renal failure.
His office is aware you have been hospitalized and will be calling you with an appointment.
