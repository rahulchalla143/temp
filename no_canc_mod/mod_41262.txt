No LOC, no CP, no SOB.
Presented to LGH where a CT head showed a possible frontal contusion vs bleed.
CT C spine showed grade 1 anterolithesis of C6 on C7 by 3mm, no acute fracture.
CXR showed mildly displaced fractures of lateral aspect of L fourth, fifth, sixth ribs.
Interstitial changes with probable mild superimposed pulmonary edema.
The pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for trauma evaluation.
The pt was seen by neurosurgery for her closed head injury.
their recommendations included close neuro checks.
Pt was admitted to the TSICU for polytrauma in stable condition.
small post head laceration Neck: Supple.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac normal bilaterally  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Exam on discharge [**2189-3-18**]: VS: 98.4 62 160/64 16 96% on 2L NC Neuro: A&OX3, PERRLA, +MAE, speech fluent and clear CV: RRR Pulm: crackles @ bases bilaterally, left chest wall tender to palpation laterally Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended Extr: No edema, +PP.
No pneumothorax.
Small bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
BL pulmonary nodules, larges measuring 6x 7mm, f/u CT in [**4-28**] mo if low risk pt.
4. cholelithiasis no cholecystitis.
5. extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease, no aneurysms.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Inferior and lateral ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2189-3-12**] inferior myocardial infarction pattern is less evident but ST-T wave abnormalities are more pronounced.
[**2189-3-15**] Chest x-ray: Since the previous study, there has been worsening of the pulmonary interstitial densities likely related to pulmonary edema.
Underlying infection is not excluded.
There is increase in the left-sided pleural effusion since the previous study.
There has also been development of a small right-sided pleural effusion.
Calcification in thoracic aorta is identified.
[**2189-3-16**] Chest x-ray: Acute interstitial pulmonary abnormality that worsened appreciably between [**3-13**] and 29 has subsequently improved.
The course is most consistent with pulmonary edema, cardiogenic or otherwise.
Persistent consolidation at the lung bases could be due to atelectasis.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has decreased since it progressed between [**3-13**] and 29.
No pneumothorax.
Bilateral simple renal cysts, measuring up to 1.4 cm in the right lower pole.
No evidence of renal calculi, hydronephrosis, or mass.
She arrived awake and alert with left chest pain her primary complaint.
To address her left chest pain, she was given tylenol and oxycodone with good result.
She was encouraged to deep breathe with incentive spirometry and had a minimal oxygen requirement (0-2L).
On presentation she had a small elevation of troponin.
This peaked at 0.57 at EKG showed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depression V3-V5.
The V3-V6 leads showed deeper ST depressions soon after, then resolving.
She was followed closely by cardiology who recommended restarting her home aspirin but no further intervention.
By HD 2, she was fully oriented, tolerating a regular diet, on minimal oxygen and with pain well controlled.
Given her age and high risk of developing pulmonary complications, she was further monitored in the hospital on the surgical floor but was transferred out of the TICU to the floor on [**2189-3-13**].
Also of note, her troponin continued to rise to 0.93, but this was in the setting of acute kidney injury with elevation in creatinine and thought to be unlikely to do a cardiac etiology.
With the IV fluids she developed flash pulmonary edema and was transferred back to the TICU on [**2189-3-15**] with respiratory compromise.
Neurosurgery was consulted on admission for her right frontal IPH who recommended no need for antiseizure prophylaxis and outpatient follow up one month from discharge.
Her pain level was routinely assessed and controlled with an oral pain regimen.
A renal ultrasound was obtained which showed simple renal cysts but no evidence of renal calculi, hydronephrosis, or mass.
Given that the patient had prior evidence of chronic renal insufficiency with a documented creatinine of 1.6 one year a few months ago and was clinically "dry" on exam, it was recommended that she be given IV fluids at a slow rate in order to rehydrate and avoid pulmonary edema.
On [**2189-3-17**] she was ordered for a 500 cc bolus of normal saline of 8 hours, which she tolerated without respiratory compromise.
Incentive spirometry and pulmonary toileting were continued, along with scheduled nebulizer treatments.
On [**2189-3-18**] she is afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Her pain is well controlled and she is tolerating a regular diet.
8. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
11. sodium chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**11-17**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed for congestion.
13. nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Left lateral rib fractures [**2-20**] 2.
Small Right frontal IPH  Acute Kidney Injury Acute Pulmonary Edema   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You sustained multiple left-sided rib fractures and a small bleed in your head which is stable.
Some of your medications have been changed because of your kidney function while you were in the hospital.
You sustained rib fractures which can cause sever pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
You should take your pain medicine as as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedation, take half the dose and notify your physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is a complication of rib fractures.
You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short periods may ease the pain.
Return to the ED right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your rips (crepitus).
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
