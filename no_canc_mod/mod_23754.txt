No acute traumatic injury within the chest.
Fractures of both superior pubic rami, and right inferior pubic ramus.
Mild retrolisthesis of C3 on C4, which is likely degenerative in etiology.
Paraseptal emphysema.
Mild cervical spondylosis  [**2156-6-5**]: cat scan of the head:  IMPRESSION: 1.
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
No pneumocephalus is identified.
Nondisplaced fractures of the right zygoma and frontal process of the maxillar.
Minimally displaced fractures of both nasal bones.
[**2156-6-5**]:  cat scan of sinus, mandible   IMPRESSION: Multiple facial fractures as described above including fractures involving the frontal bone, the anterior process of the maxilla, both nasal bones, and right zygoma.
Extensive hematoma surrounding the frontal bone and extending into the right periorbital region.
Extraperitoneal hematoma involving the space of Retzius with no areas of active contrast extravasation.
However, extraperitoneal bladder injury cannot be excluded on this study and a CT cystogram is recommended for further evaluation.
Multiple pelvic fractures as described including bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, and a right sacral fracture which is nondisplaced.
No traumatic injury seen within the chest or abdomen.
No evidence of leak or urethral disruption.
Likely type 1 (stretching) injury of the prostatic urethra.
[**2156-6-5**]: x-ray of the wrist:   Comminuted fracture of the distal radius with intra-articular extension.
Mildly displaced right ulnar styloid fracture.
Comminuted and displaced fracture of the base of the first left metacarpal.
[**2156-6-5**]:  x-ray of left ankle:   IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation within the left knee or ankle.
[**2156-6-5**]: x-ray of the hands:  THREE VIEWS LEFT HAND: Evaluation is somewhat limited by a cast overlying the first digit.
Again seen is a comminuted intra-articular fracture of the first metacarpal base in unchanged alignment.
There is mild diffuse demineralization.
No additional fracture is identified.
THREE VIEWS RIGHT HAND: There is no acute fracture or dislocation in the hand.
There is background of demineralization and mild degenerative change at the first carpometacarpal joint.
Known distal radial and ulnar styloid fractures are best evaluated on the same day wrist radiographs.
Left anterior fascicular block.
No previous tracing available for comparison  [**2156-6-7**]:  chest x-ray:  New heterogeneous opacification in the right lower lung without clear evidence of atelectasis is most likely pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses.
No new significant hematoma identified.
There is less blood in the space of Retzius but increased blood more cranially within the posterior retroperitoneum, felt to represent redistribution of previous hemorrhage.
The amount of hematoma about the fracture sites has decreased from prior exam.
Probable punctate 3-4 mm pseudoaneurysm adjacent to the bony fractures of the right superior ramus.
Again, no significant surrounding hematoma identified to suggest active or recent bleeding.
Equivocal additional punctate 1-2 mm pseudoaneurysm versus prominent vessel within the medial compartmental thigh musculature on the left.
Interval development of bilateral lower lobe, right greater than left, consolidation with suggestion of early cavitation on the right highly suggestive of an infectious pneumonia, presumably aspiration related.
[**2156-6-10**]:  Venous duplex studies:  Bilateral assessment of both legs was ordered; however, indication for exam gives only symptomatology on the left.
Duplex and color Doppler show no evidence of acute or chronic DVT involving either lower extremity from the common femoral through to the proximal tibial veins.
Upon admission, he was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, and underwent radiographic imaging.
He sustained fractures to his face, pelvis, and upper extremities, in addition to a loss of consciousness.
He also sustained a scrotal laceration.
To rule out an extra-peritoneal extravasation, he underwent a retro-urogram which did not show any ureteral disruption or leak.
He did have an episode of chest pain and ruled-out with cardiac  enzymes.
His imaging did show a frontal sinus fracture involving both the anterior and posterior table.
As a result of the accident, he did sustain a minimally displaced fracture of the inner table of the frontal bone.
He has not had any evidence of CSF leakage, so this will be monitored.
During his hospitalization, he did have a drop in his hematocrit and required a blood transfusion.
He was reported to have a right lower lobe pneumonia and was treated with a 3 day course of levaquin.
During his hospital course, he did report a new onset of left thigh pain.
Orthopedics was consulted for his right distal radius fracture and left [**Doctor Last Name **] fracture.
He was taken to the operating room on [**6-11**] for ORIF right distal radius fracture and repair of left 1st MC fracture.
He is tolerating a regular diet and voiding without difficulty.
He will need to return on [**6-16**] for repair of his facial fractures.
