It was unknown whether the patient had loss of consciousness, but he states he does not remember the accident.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Closure of a left flank wound and left femur fracture repair.
He was alert in no acute distress with a GCS of 15.
He had a stellate laceration on his scalp.
Abdomen was distended with moderate diffuse tenderness, no guarding.
Extremities showed bilateral lower extremity tib fib deformities with road rash on the right hip and thigh.
His pelvis was nontender and stable.
The back showed no deformities.
The neck did have midline tenderness.
Although he was complaining of tingling of both hands, there was no objective sensory deficits.
Chest x-ray and pelvis films were without abnormality.
CT Scan of the head showed intracranial bleed, shift or mass effect.
There was an lateral occipital subluxation of approximately 3 to 4 mm.
There is a hangman's site fracture of C2 and C3.
There was massive fracture distraction injury at C6 and C7 with approximately 30 degree rotation of C6 on C7.
CT Scan of the chest showed bilateral apical contusions and bilateral rib fractures.
CT Scan of the abdomen showed fluid in the left pericolic gutter as well as mesenteric stranding and a small amount of pelvis fluid.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken from the Trauma Resuscitation Bay to the Operating Room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy which revealed mesenteric hematoma and omental bleeding.
Of note, the patient was performed on a hard backboard, although just prior to initiation of anesthesia, the demonstrated weakness in his lower extremities bilaterally.
He went to the Operating Room on [**12-23**] the day following his admission for repair of his bilateral tib fib fractures and a right lateral compartment fasciotomy for elevated compartment pressures.
NEURO:  The patient underwent early stabilization both anteriorly and posteriorly of his cervical spine fractures.
His initial CT Scan of his head showed no intraparenchymal or intracranial process.
Four vessel carotid and vertebral angiogram on [**12-22**] showed no abnormality.
He has flexor strength of his upper extremities, but no movement of his lower extremities bilaterally.
Of note, he also had a question of L4 fracture on his initial CT Scan of his spine.
He also has spinous processes fractures of T6 and 7 which were not felt to be significant.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  He has no history of cardiac disease.
Had no evidence of cardiovascular injury with his trauma and has had no active issues with his heart throughout his ICU stay.
RESPIRATORY:  Has been ventilator dependent since his arrival.
He also has developed a right lower lobe pneumonia which has cleared on recent x-rays.
Sputum cultures were significant only for Methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, however there is a high suspicion of gram negative co-infection and he has been on appropriate antibiotic coverage.
He has required significant respiratory support thought to be secondary to not having an intercostal contribution to inspiratory phase.
He tolerate postpyloric tube feeds without difficulty.
He has had no evidence of urinary tract infection throughout his hospital stay and has not had any spontaneous voiding since the Foley was removed.
HEMATOLOGY:  After his initial resuscitation, [**Known firstname **] hematocrit has been in the upper 20 range without need for transfusion in the last several weeks.
For DVT prophylaxis, he was initially maintained on pneumatic boots, however a temporary IVC filter was placed on [**12-28**] and then removed on [**1-8**].
He was initially not thought to be a candidate for subcutaneous heparin or Lovenox due to the question of an epidural hematoma along his cervical spinal cord, however in consultation with the Ortho Spine Service, he was started on subcutaneous heparin the week of [**1-4**] and then changed over to Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneous q.
He has had bilateral lower extremity duplex studies on [**11-12**] and [**1-5**] and they were all negative for deep venous thrombosis.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Through his hospital course, [**Known firstname **] has had sputum cultures that grew Methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus most recently on [**1-5**].
He then received Vancomycin from [**12-31**] to [**1-4**] for Methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus and then was resumed on [**1-8**] after a fever spike.
He had a blood culture that was positive for coag negative staphylococcus on [**1-8**] as well, two out of four bottles.
The Vancomycin dosing was changed over to q. day dosing on [**1-10**] and he will be due for a level on his dose on the evening of [**1-12**].
Our plan is to continue Vancomycin, Gentamycin and Ciprofloxacin until his white blood cell count normalized.
TUBES, LINES AND DRAINS:  [**Known firstname **] currently has peripheral IVs, PICC placed in his left antecubital fossa on [**1-11**], post pyloric feeding tube confirmed on [**1-11**], tracheostomy placed on [**1-7**] with a #8 [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex and a condom catheter with intermittent bladder catheterizations.
