Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 54696**] Admission Date: [**2153-3-16**] Discharge Date: [**2153-4-4**] Date of Birth:  [**2086-11-8**] Sex:  M Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old male with history of COPD and alcoholic hepatitis, recently discharged from the [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2153-3-8**] with diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis, who was found with complaints of shortness of breath and change in mental status x1 day.
During his admission at the VA, he developed a non-oliguric acute renal failure with a discharge creatinine of 1.8.
The patient initially admitted to an outside hospital where he was found to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 143/70 with a respiratory rate of 36, sating a 100 percent on 10 liters nonrebreather.
He was intubated for unclear reason, suspect for [**Month (only) 46569**] protection in the context of poor mental status.
History of hepatic encephalopathy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Dry mucous membranes.
Neck:  No JVD or LAD.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen:  Decreased bowel sounds, soft, but distended with a fluid wave.
Positive palpable liver edge, no splenomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurologic:  No tone.
UA:  Negative nitrite and leukocyte esterase, 0-2 white blood cells, no bacteria.
Chemistry is notable for potassium of 5.6, creatinine of 2.1, ALT of 58, AST of 117, total bilirubin of 17.4 down from 21.9 when he signed himself out AMA from the VA.  Liver and gallbladder ultrasound: Coarse and nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
No ductal dilatation.
Slightly thickened gallbladder wall.
CT of the head without contrast:  No shift or intracranial bleed.
Chest x-ray:  ET tube 4 cm above the carina, NG tube in place, 1-cm nodule in the right mid lung zone, bibasilar atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 66-year-old male with history of COPD and alcoholic hepatitis, who recently signed himself out against medical advice from the [**Hospital **] Hospital following an admission for acute alcoholic hepatitis with a peak bilirubin of 38.8, re-presented to an outside hospital with complaints of shortness of breath and Delta MS, transferred here for continued care.
Acute alcoholic hepatitis:  The patient presents with Delta MS likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
His Lasix, spironolactone and propranolol were held due to hypotension and hyperkalemia.
The patient's liver function worsened over the course of this admission and likely was the underlying cause of his demise.
He was continued on thiamine and folate and showed no evidence of withdrawal.
However, the patient tachypneic and thus may have been compensating for a metabolic acidosis due to possible excessive lactate.
Initial ABG consistent with a persistent respiratory acidosis, thus his ventilator settings were manipulated overnight to improve ventilation and his pH subsequently responded.
His admission was complicated by episode during which he bit his tube and required reintubation, during which he had vomiting and likely aspiration.
He was noted to have ongoing paradoxical breathing, likely due to his abdominal hypertension.
In addition, Lasix diuresis caused elevation of the creatinine and thus was not tolerated.
However, no interventions during the course of admission permitted extubation from the ventilator.
Initial concern for prerenal failure due to hypovolemia in the setting of hypotension, however, as his urine output improved with fluid resuscitation and pressor support; however, his creatinine again later in the course of his hospital stay began to rise.
His bladder pressure at that time was noted to be 23, a large volume paracentesis failed to result in a improvement in his creatinine and thus he was started on midodrine and octreotide for likely hepatorenal syndrome.
His urine output subsequently improved with hope for renal recovery.
He ultimately required hemodialysis for an increasing metabolic acidosis.
His worsening renal failure was attributed to likely a dense ATN in the setting of his hypotension requiring pressor support.
Sepsis:  The patient initially started on ceftriaxone and Flagyl for concern for SBP versus aspiration pneumonia.
His initial paracentesis was not consistent with SBP and his chest x-ray remained negative for infiltrate.
Blood cultures remained negative until later in his hospital admission following successful wean off of his initial pressors including dopamine and vasopressin, at which time, his blood cultures became positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
Of note, an initial [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test was done to rule out adrenal insufficiency and stimulated appropriately to 33.2.
Also, likely underlying his hypertension is systemic vasodilation secondary to hepatic disease.
He was restarted on Levophed as blood and urine subsequently grew out vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
He was thus continued on linezolid and Ceptaz for a possible SBP and Flagyl for a possible Clostridium difficile in the setting of ongoing diarrhea.
CT of the abdomen was negative for perforation and ERCP was negative for cholangitis.
His fungemia was likely secondary to severe immunocompromise due to his ongoing VRE sepsis.
Altered mental status:  The patient's altered mental status was likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
He was continued on lactulose with minimal improvement.
Paracentesis was done to rule out SBP and remained negative.
Steroid-induced hyperglycemia:  The patient continued on a Regular sliding scale insulin for blood sugar control.
Elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase:  During the course of the patient's admission, his bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase increased concerning for obstructive-like picture.
Ultrasound negative for portal vein thrombosis or common bile duct dilation.
Likely these laboratory abnormalities are secondary to severe sepsis.
He received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia and was started on Renagel for hyperphosphatemia.
He required frequent free water boluses for hyponatremia.
