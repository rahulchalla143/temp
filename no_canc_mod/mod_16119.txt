HISTORY:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 48394**] was brought to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of respiratory distress in the peripartum period.
She delivered by cesarean section for failure to progress with result of Apgars of six and seven.
Baby was given positive pressure ventilation in the DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] Anesthesia staff.
In the NICU, the baby was well saturated on room air initially with moderate tachypnea and distress.
Respiratory:  Infant had a chest x-ray which demonstrated a right pneumothorax.
She remained in room air with no symptoms.
Cardiac:  There were no cardiac issues.
This corrected from one in the mid 70s to 88 for saturation and then remained essentially normal.
Occasionally at the very beginning of the feed, her sat drifted to the high 80s because of the vigorousness for which she was sucking.
