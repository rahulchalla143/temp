This is a 48 year-old male with a history of ischemic CM (EF 15%), s/p CCY 5 years ago who initially presented to [**Hospital3 25354**] with mid abdominal pain and jaundice, found to have CBD dilated to 8mm on ultrasound.
He reports that he developed mid severe abdominal pain ("gassy") beginning after dinner on [**10-6**].
He denies N/V/diarrhea prior to admission, but notes few nonbloody loose stools since admission because he has not been able to eat.
He has had no dysuria or urinary frequency.
Subsequent CT abd/pelvis at [**Hospital3 **] showed CBD dilated to 2cm.
He was started on IV unasyn and flagyl was added for c. diff coverage given recent hospitalization and abdominal pain.
Additionally, the patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change.
No melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath.
No lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash (does endorse diffuse pruritis).
Past Medical History: CAD; s/p multiple MIs ([**2112**] and [**2116**]) s/p stents Ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 15% and severe MR s/p ICD s/p cholecystectomy Hyperlipidemia Anemia Peptic ulcer disease  Social History: Quit smoking approximately 5 years ago; 30+ packyear history prior to that.
No other illicits.
Previously had his own construction business, but has been on disability since most recent MI.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: GEN: Well-appearing older than stated age HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, + scleral icterus, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Left lung base with fine rales 1/3 up.
EXT: Trace edema bilaterally.
Strength and sensation to soft touch no cyanosis.
No ecchymoses, no petechiae.
[**2118-10-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly without CHF or pneumonia.
Large right pleural effusion.
Minimal perihepatic ascites.
Extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, distal common duct not visualized due to overlying bowel gas.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 year-old male with a history of CAD and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) who presented with abdominal pain and jaundice with CBD dilatation on imaging.
Jaundice:  Possible etiologies included acute hepatitis C versus cholangitis versus choledocolithiasis.
There was evidence of CBD dilatation on OSH imaging.
Interestingly however, he wa found to be only mildly tender over RUQ rather the majority of his discomfort is mid abdomen.
No schistocytes were seen on smear.
Unclear whether he received SC heparin at OSH, but likely used there for prophylaxis.
Heme/Onc feels this is most c/w ITP given lack of schistocytes on peripheral smear.
Concerning in the setting of his thrombocytopenia and fever would be TTP-HUS, but appears to be pre-renal.
SBPs currently low 90s but suspect this was related to his severe cardiomyopathy.
Had previous concern for infectious cause with fever at outside hospital but afebrile since admit here.
Chronic systolic CHF secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%):  Appeared to be well compensated.
The patients antihypertensive meds and diuretics were initaially held because of relative hypotension.
CAD: Held beta blocker b/c of hypotension, held ASA for ERCP, held statin d/t LFT abnormalities.
I explained to the pt that an ERCp could not be done because of the risks associated with his low platelet counts and that an MRCP could not be done because of his pacemaker.
I warned him that he was at very high risk of spontaneous bleeding, or that his liver might fail further.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hyperbiliruninemia Hepatitis A Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Unstable.
