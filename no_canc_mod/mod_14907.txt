MICU Course- Patient admitted to the MICU after becoming tachycardic to 160 and transiently dropping BP to the 70s.
Pressure normalized without intervention but he remained tachycardic to 120s on admission to the floor.
Tachycardia resolved overnight and he remained hemodynamically stable the next day.
Regarding his weakness, it seemed to be related to his CP and not to an CNS infection as imaging was negative for any acute infectious process.
.# Fever:  Likely related to UTI and new LLL infiltrate (suspect CAP).
No signs of intraabdominal or pelvic process.
MRI did not show any acute process.
LP showed no sign of transverse myelitis.
Neurology felt that this would be an exacerbation of his underlying CP in the setting of acute illness.
The patient has had recent workup for similar symptoms with head CT and LP in [**4-10**] which did not reveal etiology.
# Tachycardia:  Resolved with IV fluids.
Most likely secondary to fever, pain, infection and dehydration.
Pt denies chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath.
Cortisone 1 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itchiness.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: Seventeen (17) grams PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

You came into the hospital because you had a fever, headache, nausea and leg weakness.
You had bacteria in your urine and a possible pneumonia when you arrived.
There was NO bacteria in your blood.
Your leg weakness may be due to worsening of your cerebral palsy due to your UTI and possible pneumonia.
Based on MRI and CT scans, the weakness and sensory changes were NOT due to anything pressing on your spinal [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] abscess, a fracture or other problems with your spine.
