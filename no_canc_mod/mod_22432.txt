Admission Date:  [**2167-2-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-3-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-12-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Thoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old male, retired fighter pilot, with a medical history significant for advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety and depression who has deteriorated significantly over the past two months requiring hospitalization.
He was separated from his wife in [**2163**] and has been living alone on [**Location (un) **] in an isolated situation, diagnosed with depression several years ago by his primary care physician and has undergone a slow decline over the past several years.
He has had several episodes of pneumonia but was doing reasonably well until [**Holiday **] of last year when he developed bronchitis which progressed to pneumonia and he was admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
Since that point his decline has resulted in traumatic weight loss and the development of skin necrosis and ulceration in the bilateral lower extremities and tips of his fingers during his last hospital stay.
The patient denied any fevers, chills or sweats, hemoptysis, new neurological, musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal complaints.
History of atrial fibrillation; 2.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient was afebrile with vital signs stable, sating 93% on room air.
Neck was soft, supple with no masses noted and no carotid bruits.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, however, breath sounds were slightly decreased, no wheezes noted.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmur.
Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, however, they did show larger areas of ulceration and necrosis, right greater than left in the lower extremities, upon which the skin appeared to be sloughing off of his body.
The patient also had some areas of punctate ulceration necrosis on his hands as well.
Neurologically, the patient had no deficits.
Further detailed lower extremity ulcerations, the patient had two large necrotic ulcerations directly inferior to the right kneecap and then from approximately mid calf down the patient had large reddish ulcerations with minimal bleeding in a patchy distribution.
On the left lower extremity the patient had minimally bleeding ulceration on the left forefoot that did not extend superiorly to the ankle.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 68 year old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malnutrition, lower extremity ulcerations of unknown etiology who presented to the Thoracic Surgery Service for further evaluation and treatment of multiple problems.
On hospital day #2, the patient went for chest x-ray which demonstrated no definite pneumonia or cardiac failure, prominence of the right aortic contour concerning for ascending aortic aneurysm.
The patient then went for a computerized tomography scan on hospital day #3 which revealed head computerized tomography scan which showed no intracranial pathological process, computerized tomography scan of the torso which demonstrated no evidence of malignancy, diffuse extensive emphysema with small peripheral patchy opacities, extensive vasculopathy with suggestion of infrarenal aortic stenosis and post traumatic dilatation, an ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 4.2 cm and a prominent left adrenal gland.
Pulmonary consultation evaluating the patient's pulmonary function tests were performed which demonstrated severe emphysematous pattern consistent with the patient's disease process.
On [**2167-2-24**], the patient was seen by Psychiatry for increasing anxiety, depression and possible delirium change in mental status.
Psychiatry recommended Haldol prn for agitation and also recommended checking TSH, B12 and Folate levels which were all normal.
There were no further recommendations made at this time, and the patient's mental status had improved over the course of the hospital stay.
Also on [**2167-2-24**], the patient was seen by the Dermatology Service who made an assessment of vasculitis of unknown origin or an embolic phenomenon.
On [**2167-2-25**], Vascular Surgery saw Mr. [**Known lastname 25699**], recommendations included noninvasive arterial studies of the lower extremities which demonstrated significant arterial disease on the right lower extremity with flexions of 9 and 6 at the ankle and metatarsal areas respectively on the right lower extremity.
In addition Vascular Surgery recommended Silvadene and adaptic dressings to the lower extremity ulcerations b.i.d.
The patient was demonstrating a steady weight gain.
On [**2167-2-27**], the patient went for bilateral lower extremity angiogram by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.
The patient was found to have near total occlusion of the right common iliac artery and two stents were placed after angioplasty of this area as well as two stents placed in the left common iliac artery.
The patient did well post procedure with no groin hematoma, no bruit in the groin.
Skin cultures at this point came back only positive for Corynebacteria.
On [**2167-2-28**], the patient's punch biopsy by Dermatology returned negative for vasculitis in the lower extremity biopsy sample, but the left index finger was positive for vasculitis with definite changes in the small/medium sized arteries.
At this time, differential diagnosis included systemic vasculitis or drug vasculitis.
The patient was seen by Plastic Surgery on [**2167-3-2**] for possible skin graft treatment for her lower extremity ulcerations which were somewhat improving.
Secondary to the patient's persistent high white count the patient was sent for bone scan to rule out osteomyelitis and on [**2167-3-2**] the patient was sent and test was negative.
Post intervention PVRs demonstrated increased flow of arterial supply in the right lower extremity.
Tentative diagnosis at this time of the etiology of lower extremity ulceration was drug vasculitis due to Vancomycin.
Unfortunately, he was then was found down and hypotensive and required intubation and resusitation and transfer to the ICU.
Severe pulmonary emphysema.
Peripheral vascular disease.
6 hours prn for pain 13.
