The patient had a bowel obstruction [**5-6**] leading to ischemic bowel and perforation c/b septic shock.
Her reported improvement for one month after returning home then developed dyspnea, sputum production and wheezing.
The patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy [**2-7**] which demonstrated a proximal trachea fracture and moderate tracheomalacia.

MODERATE GROWTH.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
There is a tracheostomy tube with distal tip at the level of the clavicular heads.
There is diffuse pulmonary interstitial prominence, particularly at the right base.
There is volume loss on the right side.
The left lung is well aerated without focal consolidation or pleural effusions.
[**5-10**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**5-8**], there is little change.
Continued hyperexpansion of the lungs with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and prominence of the ascending aorta, raising the possibility of hypertension.
Diffuse prominence of interstitial markings is again consistent with chronic lung disease.
This is somewhat more prominent at the right base, which could be a manifestation of superimposed pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old man with a PMH of COPD and tracheomalacia status post tracheostomy [**2115**] admitted for bronchoscopy and tracheostomy.
# Tracheomalacia: S/p rigid bronchoscopy in the OR with tracheostomy placement.
Pt with significant obstructive airways disease.
Pt tolerated the procedure well and had no complications.
# Hospital-acquired pneumonia: Pt developed leukocytosis and low grade fever after the procedure.
This was felt to be possibly inflammatory in setting of recent procedure, however CXR was suspicious for a RLL infiltrate and the patient had a large amount of tracheal secretions.
WBC returned to [**Location 213**] and he had no further fevers.
Sputum culture was consistent with likely oropharyngeal contamination.
# HTN: Continued HCTZ.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin.
# BPH: Continued terazosin.
# Anxiety/Depression: Continued Lexapro and trazodone.
