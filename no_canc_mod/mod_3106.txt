Admission Date:  [**2122-6-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-7-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-10-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: Bright red blood per rectum  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right heart catheterization  History of Present Illness: 66M patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who presented to the [**Hospital1 **] ED today c/o poor UOP for 3 days.
Weights in our system are difficult to follow, and the patient has readings of many  He notes that he has had a normal bowel movement this morning and has never noticed red blood around stool, red blood in the toilet bowl, or black-tarry stools.
He explicitly denies CP, or an increase in his baseline shortness of breath.
The patient briefly endorsed respiratory distress, and cxr was checked revealing a mild increase in interstitial edema and 160mg of IV lasix were given with 100cc of UOP and resolution of symptoms.
Durring the infusion of vancomycin he developed hives on his arm and the infusion was stopped.
On arrival to the floor the patient is clear, not complaining of any dyspnea, and feels very comfortable.
Severe CAD s/p 4vCABG [**2107**] 2.
V-Fib arrest 4-days post-CABG s/p pacemaker/ICD [**2107**] - Generator change and pocket revision in [**2120-1-14**] to right side of chest secondary to pain 3.
Ischemic cardiomypoathy / systolic CHF, EF 25% 4.
Peripheral vascular disease s/p bilateral femoral-popliteal bypass 5. multiple lower extremity catheterizations 6.
Diabetes Type II - followed at [**Last Name (un) **] 7.
Obstructive sleep apnea 8.
Asthma 10.
Mild sigmoid colonic thickening on recent CT-Abd/Plv, colonoscopy showing sessile polyps, biopsy will have to happen off plavix 11.
Esophagitis, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease 12.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
+ h/o stomach cancer.
Sclera mildly icteric.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Mild crackles at the bases clearing with deeping breaths, diffuse inspiratory wheezes doing the same.
No HSM or tenderness.
No fluid wave, Abd aorta not enlarged by palpation.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: stasis dermatitis, no pitting edema, bilateral scars of saphenous harvest.
Trace perihepatic fluid noted tracking along the right paracolic gutter as well as trace retroperitoneal fluid and a small amount of simple pelvic fluid.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Right lower lobe 5mm pulmonary nodule.
Recommend non-emergent chest CT to assess for other possible pulmonary nodules and establish frequency of surveillance.
Extensive vascular calcifications.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the interventricular septum and anterior wall (LVEF= 20-25 %).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study dated [**2122-1-8**] (images reviewed), the degree of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse.
There is no hydronephrosis.
No cyst or stone or solid mass is seen in either kidney.
Cardiac catheterization ([**2122-7-3**]):  Response to inhaled NO         PVR 3.9 to 1.3         C/I 3.5 to 3.9         PCWP 34 to 42  Discharge labs ([**2122-7-7**]): WBC 5.7  Hgb 8.9  Hct 28.2  Plts 220 PT 14.6  PTT 30.5  INR 1.3  Na 137 K 4.3 Cl 100 HCO3 25 BUN 67 Cr 2.0 Gluc 116  Brief Hospital Course: 66M with CAD s/p CABG, VF arrest s/p AICD, ischemic CMP (EF 20-25%), AF/flutter s/p ablation with recent admission for acute systolic CHF with aggressive diuresis admitted with hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **].
# Hypotension: Suspect hypovolemic shock in the setting of GI bleeding vs. efficatious response to torsemide.
Symptoms not consistent with cardiogenic shock given his excellent oxygenation, very mild insterstitial marking, and baseline pro-BNP.
In addition, echocardiogram performed on HD1 was not consistent with cardiogenic shock.
The patient did not meet any SIRS criteria currently as he was without fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia or tachypnea throughout admission.
Metoprolol and torsemide were restarted on HD4 as blood pressures were stable and patient began to appear volume overloaded with increased weight, fluid wave in abdomen, elevated JVP and lower extremity edema.
#Right>Left heart failure- Patient's ongoing signs of lower extremity edema, abdominal distension and elevated JVP on exam indicating right>left sided failure.
The right heart catherization showed elevated pulmonary pressures with good response to NO.
Most likely etiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension is underlying obstructive sleep apnea.
# ARF - Low FeUrea reflected current clinical suspicion that patient had pre-renal azotemia, whether the etiology is poor forward flow or dehydration.
Renal ultrasound showed no signs of hydronephrosis.
# GI bleed - Patient with no obvious predilection to bleeding on upper and lower endoscopy in '[**20**].
He does have diverticulosis which is the most likely source of bleeding.
On initial exam, patient had bright red blood per rectum on digital exam.
He continued to have blood streaked stools intermittently, but hematocrit remained stable following initial transfuion.
GI was consulted and felt that patient should be prepped for colonoscopy pending resolution of acute renal failure.
However, as ARF improved, patient became volume overloaded and the decision was made to diurese patient over hydrating for bowel prep.
Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient had no signs of volume overload at the time of admission.
Echocardiogram performed on HD1 showed higher pulmonary pressures and worse MR in comparison to prior TTE performed in [**2121-12-16**].
Torsemide was held initially, and restarted on HD4 as patient began to show signs of volume overload.
CAD s/p 4V CABG: Patient was without chest pain or EKG changes at the time of admission.
Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter s/p Ablation: HR control excellent.
# Neuropathy:  Patient was continued on home pregabalin 75 mg PO BID throughout admission.
Gout: No acute flare during admission.
Recommend non-emergent chest CT to assess for other possible pulmonary nodules and establish frequency of surveillance.
Pt did not have a date for the colonoscopy at discharge but will be contact[**Name (NI) **] at home by the gastroenterology department.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Multicultural VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute On Chronic Systolic congestive heart failure Lower gastrointestinal bleed Acute on chronic kidney failure Pulmonary hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had bleeding from your lower intestines, likely this is due to hemorrhoids.
Your blood counts have been stable and the bleeding seems to have stopped.
You had an acute exacerbation of your congestive heart failure and needed high doses of diuretics to take off the extra fluid.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Start taking protonix to prevent bleeding in your stomach  Followup Instructions: You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by the gastroenterology department to schedule a colonoscopy in about 3 weeks.
