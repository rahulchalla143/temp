Surgery was consulted and followed for PV concern for ischemic colitis.
Serial abdominal exams were done notable for distension, but non-tender.
He was non-tender, but had intermittent complaints of nausea.
On [**10-8**], he had worsening abdominal pain with a guaiac positive stool.
CT demonstrated hyperdense clot noted in the proximal superior mesenteric vein just before the confluence, large ascites, thickened small bowel wall and sigmoid.
There was a large right pleural effusion.
No free air, mesenteric air or pneumatosis noted.
On exam, pain was improved.
Gram stain had 2+ pmn with no organisms.
Lower extremity duplex was positive for a non-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein and  a 3.7-cm [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst in the right popliteal fossa.
Per report: These results argue against, but do not completely rule out a diagnosis of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT).
2) Progressive dilatation of the proximal small bowel with marked proximal and mid jejunal small bowel thickening and further thickening throughout the colon with no pneumatosis or free air which in the presence of portal venous thrombosis is most likely due to venous congestion/obstruction 3)Large right pleural effusion with right lower lobe atelectasis.
