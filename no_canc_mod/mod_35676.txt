Admission Date:  [**2127-12-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-12-31**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfonamides / Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: Femur fracture s/p fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ORIF for left inter/sub troc.
fracture Intubation Central Line placement   History of Present Illness: 86 year-old male who presented to the ED s/p mechanical fall with left hip Fx.
Was at his daughters house walking from bathroom and fell as he walked through the door.
No LOC, no CP , No SOB.
While on floor, found to be in respiratory distress with SaO2 85% on NRB.
He was intubated and transferred to MICU for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He was tachycardic and had a negative CTA on [**12-24**].
He does not report pain but, according to his family, this is easily assessed by watching his face.
Past Medical History: R TKR in [**2117**] L TKR in [**2127-4-27**] (c/b post-op confusion and AF-RVR) [**11-30**] to OR for L hip repair CAD s/p CABG times two with sternal ostia as a complication.
Parkinson's with [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body Dementia c/b Visual Hallucinations.
He has difficulty walking [**1-29**] leg stiffness due to Parkinsons.
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical  quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
At least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
EKG: AF with VR 130's and evidence of right hrt strain .
Moderately severe to severe diffuse osteopenia.
Head CT ([**12-20**])- no acute intracranial findings -prelim.
C-spine CT ([**12-20**])- no fractures or prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis with small effusion.
Patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral lungs, probably representing pulmonary edema.
Marked enlargement of right atrium, IVC and hepatic veins, representing right-sided heart failure.
Small low-density area in the left lobe of the liver, which cannot be further characterized on this chest CT. 6.
Low-density areas in the right kidney, which is only partially imaged.
Some evidence of atalectasis and fluid in lungs.
R sided opacity mid-lung.
CXR [**12-26**]  There is a nasogastric tube whose distal tip and side port are not included on the study and are below the inferior margin of the film.
There is again seen an opacity at the left base most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis as seen on the recent chest CT.
There is no evidence for overt pulmonary edema or focal infiltrate.
Elbow x rays [**12-28**] FINDINGS:  Three views of the right elbow are limited secondary to difficulty in positioning the patient.
No true lateral radiograph has been provided, thus assessment for joint effusion cannot be performed.
There are several densities seen in the joint space suspicious for loose bodies.
One density is seen just volar to the distal humerus and a second density is seen adjacent to the radial head.
No clear fracture is identified.
[**12-31**] CXR, official read pending but no gross evidence of opacity (wet read)  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 86 yo male with AF on Coumadin, CAD s/p CABG, s/p ORIF for left hip fracture [**2127-12-24**] after a fall on [**2127-12-21**].
Hip Fracture s/p fall: In the ED, CTA was negative for PE, and showed some pulm edema, RLL opacity read as likely atelectasis.
He was kept non-weight bearing and went for ORIF of his fracture on [**12-23**].
The patient was transfered to the MICU on [**12-24**] after his post-op course was complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure (ABG 7.09/94/91), thought to be secondary to obstruction vs. aspiration vs. sedation on meds.
His hypercarbic respiratory failure resolved within a day, and he was extubated without event.
He was subsequently transferred to the floor and followed by ortho and PT who were pleased with his progress despite some persistent edema in the surgical leg and oozing at the wound site.
Elbow pain:  The patient developled elbow pain after transfer to the floor.
Concern was for previously undiagnosed fracture from his fall.
Elbow films were negative for fracture and ortho considered this a frozen elbow.
PT worked with him and he had marked improvement in ROM and pain prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular: He has a PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG times two with sternal ostia as a complication which was stable without active ischemia.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] also has an aspirin allergy, so his health care providers may consider plavix as outpatient once his fracture heals.
# Labile WBC count: Four days prior to discharge the patient's WBC began to trend upwards in the absence of fever.
His Levo/Flagyl was continued for 5 days and then discontinued in the absence of symptoms (had been started [**12-24**] for presumed aspiration pneumonia).
On the day of discharge, WBC count was elevated at 14.
#Anemia - Baseline low 30s per old records.
This is probably anemia of chronic disease with superimposed iron defficiency anemia.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was guaiac positive on [**12-29**].
#[**Last Name (un) 309**] Body Dementia: No antipsychotics.
Pt passed a speech and swallow eval on [**12-29**] with recommended soft diet with nectar thickened liquids.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Femur fracture s/p fall Hypercarbic respiratory failure CAD AF Anemia Dementia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please take all meds as prescribed.
Seek medical attention immediately if you experience new symptoms including leg pain, shortness of breath, bleeding, lightheadedness, fainting, falls, etc.
