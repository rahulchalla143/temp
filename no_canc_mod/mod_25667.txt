History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 33 yo M with a history of EtOH use to [**6-20**] drinks/week admitted yesterday to OSH with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for acute pancreatitis.
He began to feel diffuse abdominal cramping with "tightness" in his back.
He initially brushed off the pain until it began worsening over the next two hours.
His abdominal pain was crampy and diffuse radiating to his back.
During this time, he felt febrile and had chills, body aches and shortness of breath with abdominal pain.
He was transported by his girlfriend to OSH at midnight for his symptoms.
His labs were significant for 21.2, no bands.
A CT scan done showed pancreatitis and "equivocal partial splenic vein thrombosis at the portal confluence and diffuse hepatic fatty infiltration."
On the floor, patient complains of [**4-22**] epigastric pain radiating to his back.
He says the pain was relieved by his last dilaudid dose but is beginning to worsen.
He feels short of breath occasionally as limited by pain.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied diarrhea or constipation.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Family History: He has no family history of pancreatitis or biliary disease that he knows of.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.2 HR: 112 BP: 142/100 RR: 20 O2: 96RA General: In pain, not diaphoretic, dry heaves HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, sclera anicteric, mucus membranes dry, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, thyroid wnl Lungs: CTAB, no wheezes, rales or ronchi CV: Tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no m/r/g Abdomen: tense, distended, diminished bowel sounds, tender to percussion and light palpation in midepigastrum > RUQ, no guarding or rebound, negative Cullen's and Grey [**Doctor Last Name 27210**] sign Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: A + O x 3.
No focal deficits.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration; more serious forms of liver cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be ruled out on the basis of this study.
Small amount of ascites around the gallbladder and in the right and left lower quadrants consistent with free fluid seen on recent CT scan.
OSH CT Abd/Pel: ([**2108-7-29**]) moderately severe pancreatic bed inflammtory soft tissue stranding.
No pancreatic bed fluid collection.
No ST changes.
Brief Hospital Course: # Acute pancreatitis: Pt had acute onset abdominal pain, N/V with elevated lipase and OSH CT with pancreatic inflammation, tissue stranding, no fluid collections.
It also shows a possible partial splenic vein thrombosis.
This presentation was consistent with acute pancreatitis.
He was not felt to have necrotizing disease, so meropenem was not indicated.
He denied a history of biliary colic and he reported [**6-20**] drinks weekly.
An abdominal U/S was limited due to pain and body habitus, but no gallstones were visualized on exam.
After he received these fluids, his abdomen became very distended, which was thought to be most likely secondary to third spacing in the setting of his pancreatitis.
The evening of MICU transfer, the night team had concern for desats to 88% on RA and started him on a course of vanc/cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia.
During rounds the following morning, the patient triggered for nursing concern of coffee-ground emesis to 100ml.
That morning, he had increasing tense abdominal distention with diffuse tenderness.
Additionally, morning labs were concerning for hypocalcemia to 6.4 down from 7.1 the previous day, hyperbilirubinemia with a bump from 2.1 to 7.1, low phos at 1.0, and a Hct drop of 7 points from 45 to 37.9.
In the ICU, he was noted to have abd distension and tension, worsen transaminitis that was  concerning for 3rd spacing and ascitis, progression to necrotizing pancreatitis and splenic artery aneurism.
He had a repeat CT abd with contrast that showed are of necrotizing pancreatitis, and extend of splenic thrombus now completely obstructing his splenic vein and extending into portal vein.
He was also noted to have non-occlusive thrombus of his SMV.
Pt also had significant drop on his HCT 45->35->31 that was concerning for retroperitoneal bleed and he was given 1 unit of PRBCs.
Hepatology did an EGD in the AM for evaluation of esophageal bleed.
The EGD did not show varices or active bleeding, but did showed diffused ulcerations.
Hepatology discussed his case during the liver board and the recommendation was made to not anticoagulate given his risk of bleeding and the fact that pt is a heavy drinker and would not be a good candidate for anti-coagulation.
He was started on clears today and his pain has been controlled with dilaudid, now transitioned to oxycodone.
His pain is now controled with morphine Q3H, although he is not having so much abdominal pain as he is having lower back pain that is likely secondary to his chronic low back pain that he has had since prior to his hospitalization.
A repeat CT scan was done prior to discharge which revealed fluid around the pancreas that was immature and not organizing; surgery evaluated the patient and did not feel it was necessary to drain.
# GI Bleed: Pt had a Hct drop from 45 to 39->37 with hemocult positive coffee ground vomitus.
He likely has a GI bleed.
Initiall Ddx includes bleeding esophageal varices from previously undiagnosed liver disease, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19916**] tears from vomiting.
Later in the evening this HCT trendeded down to 31 which was concerning for acute bleed including retroperitoneal and he was given 1unit of PRBCs.
Hepatology did an EGD in the AM for evaluation of esophageal bleed.
The EGD did not show varices or active bleeding, but did showed diffused ulcerations.
2 small isolated gastric varices in the fundus of the stomach with NO stigmata No evidence of ulcers, AVM's, active bleeding or masses ulcers in the distal bulb.
Two small clean base superficial ulcerations were identify in the 2nd portion of the duodenum with no recent bleeding stigmata.
#) Hepatitis: This is likely acute ETOH hepatitis with increase in transaminitis and increase in tbili.
Pt however complains of increase in abd girth and 45lb wt gain in the last year w/ decrease in appetite and PO intake.
The iron was low and ferritin was elevated which in the setting of acute illness, makes difficult to interpreter results.
His LFTs are also quickly trending down so there is also a possibility of a change in labs were due to biliary stone that was passed.
# Hypoxia: On the floor, there was concern for PNA in the L retrocardiac area and so was started on Vanc/Cefepime.
However, this is unclear and it seems more likely that abdominal distention and IVF's/3rd spacing are creating basilar atelectasis and L effusion.
Once on floor, his oxygen sats resolved to 96% RA after he no longer required fluid resuscitation.
# SIRS: Patient still meets [**4-16**] of SIRS criteria, likely due to his acute pancreatitis and a possibility of acute alcoholic hepatitis.
His hypoxia is more likely secondary to his apparent third spacing/ascites and contributing pulmonary edema, although retrocardic opacity was seen on CXR last night.
# Hyperglycemia: Patient had hyperglycemia at the OSH to 300.
This was thought to be secondary to his pancreatitis.
He was place on insulin sliding scale for FS > 200 until his hyperglycemia resolved.
# HTN: HTN at admission in the OHS and he was given a dose of labetolol.
His BP remained elevated and the atenolol dose was increased to 50mg.
Discharge Medications: 1. morphine 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain for 4 days.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 3. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Outpatient Lab Work please check basic metabolic panel (on new lisinopril medicine and was on lasix) as well as CBC (to trend WBC count)   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: severe acute pancreatitis .
Secondary diagnosis alcoholic hepatitis hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to this hospital because you were found at your outside hospital to have acute pancreatitis with signs of severe disease on CT scan.
You also had a high blood sugar that we thought was because of your pancreatitis.
You were also found to have some liver disease.
You were noted to have high blood pressures during your admission.
You also need to see your primary care doctor to follow up lab work because you had a high white count at the time of discharge (16-20) and recently started a new medicine that can lower your potassium.
