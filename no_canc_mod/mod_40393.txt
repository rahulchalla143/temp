Mild cardiomegaly and vascular congestion.
TTE [**2171-2-13**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Moderate right ventricular dilation with severe global hypokinesis.
Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Otherwise, no evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
Mild cardiomegaly.
No definite evidence for CHF or pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD on 3L home oxygen therapy, OSA, unknown type of CHF, OSA, cor pulmonale, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hypercarbic respiratory distress.
COPD EXACERBATION:  he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for management of hypercarbic respiratory distress in the setting of recent and likely ongoing acute exacerbation of COPD.
He received azithromycin in the ED and was broadened to levaquin, vancomycin, and cefepime in the ICU when chest X-Ray showed evidence of possible pneumonia, though this was narrowed back to levaquin given his rapid  clinical improvement.
He had leukocytosis that was felt to be a steroid effect.
Due to mild pulmonary congestion in the setting of known CHF, he was diuresed with IV lasix with good effect.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  His admission CXR showed evidence of mild pulmonary congestion.
His right ventricle was dilated and hypokinetic.
We obtained lower extremity ultrasounds, then a CTA to rule out PE given his recent respiratory distress, tachypnea, hypotension (in the setting of new ACEI) and dilated RV.
METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  he had significant alkalosis with bicarb ranging 35-40 due to his C02 retention and diuresis.
HYPOTENSION:  he had asymptomatic hypotension to SBP 80 during the day prior to discharge.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  he was somnolent initially in the ICU which was felt to be due to hypercarbia.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 89737**],  You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of respiratory distress that was likely due to an exacerbation of your COPD.
You were briefly in the ICU overnight on a BiPAP machine, but your symptoms rapidly improved with steroids and nebulizer treatments, and you were transferred to the medicine floor.
This could be driven by a blood clot in the lungs causing strain on the heart.
Ultrasounds of your legs and a scan of your lungs showed this was not the case; you do n ot have a blood clot in your legs or your lungs.
