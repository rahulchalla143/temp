Erythema was likely secondary to patient's struggle against restraints as the erythema resolved with sedation.
He was treated with clindaymycin for 36 hours and then discontinued as no active sign of infection.
# Etoh abuse: Per patient and family he has been binge drinking recently in the setting of his manic symptoms, but they deny any history of etoh dependence or withdrawal symptoms so unlikely to have withdrawal and low risk for Wernicke's.
