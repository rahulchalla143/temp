Admission Date:  [**2184-6-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-6-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-7-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspartame  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent placement [**2184-6-19**] intra-aortic balloon placement [**2184-6-19**] EP ablation of atrial flutter [**2184-6-24**] - noted to have both typical and atypical / bidirectional flutter - typical atrial flutter ablated   History of Present Illness: This is a 71 yo F h/o mitral valve repair with annuloplasty band in [**2180**],pre-op c.cath in [**2180**] showing 30% mid-LAD stenosis, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with chest pain.
Patient notes that she first experienced a substernal burning pain around 0130 on [**6-19**] that awoke her from sleep.
The pain at that time radiated down to her hands.
This pain resolved over the course of about one hour and she was able to fall back asleep.
She awoke later that morning and was feeling in her usual state of health other than a cough which she believes may have been productive of blood tinged sputum on one occasion.
At around [**2174**] the same day she had just finished dinner when she began to feel intense substernal burning that again radiated down both arms and this time also radiated to her back and up both sides of her neck.
She thought it was reflux and that vomiting might improve the pain so she induced vomiting x 1 but the pain continued.
She began to feel diaphoretic so she took a cold shower.
After nearly an hour of chest pain that escalated to a [**10-9**] she decided to drive herself to the ED.
She was noted to have an ECG with ST elevations in V2-V6 and recipricol depressions in II, III, aVF.
Her cardiac cath demonstrated total occlusion of the LAD just after the first diagonal.
There were some luminal irregularities in LCx and RCA.
On arrival to the CCU, patient was hemodynamically stable and chest pain free.
She describes mainly feeling very tired but otherwise had no complaints.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: --Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation for years, was on coumadin until [**2180**] at which time mitral valve repaired and PAF became much less frequent --MVR with annuloplasty band [**2180**] --h/o rheumatic fever --h/o Lyme disease --?
sleep apnea  Social History: -Tobacco history: Smoked [**1-2**] ppd but quit 14 yrs ago -ETOH: rare shot of wermouth -Illicit drugs:none  Family History: Father died of MI at 57  Physical Exam: GENERAL: Well appearing caucasian female, NAD.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple without elevation of JVP.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There are ST segment elevations in leads I, aVL and V1-V6 with slight ST segment depressions in leads II, III and aVF.
Left atrial abnormality.
The anterolateral ST-T wave changes are consistent with active ischemic process.
Rule out myocardial infarction.
CARDIAC CATH [**2184-6-19**]: CARDIAC CATH: LMCA: no apparent CAD LAD: total occlusion proximal/mid just after diagonal 1 LCx: Mild luminal irregularities RCA: Mild luminal irregularities  CXR [**2184-6-20**]: Intra-aortic balloon pump is present with radiodense tip terminating approximately 3.8 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob.Heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged, and pulmonary vascularity is engorged.
Bilateral upper lobe airspace pattern is present, accompanied by a peripheraland diffuse interstitial opacities, likely reflecting an asymmetricdistribution of pulmonary edema, although other superimposed process at theapices such as aspiration or eosinophilic pneumonia are also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
TTE [**2184-6-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the anterior septum and mild hypokinesis of the anterior wall and apex.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dyfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution).
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Non-obstructive MV ring without signficant mitral regurgitation.
CXR-PA/lateral [**2184-6-22**]: Mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the aortic contour is unchanged.
Hyperinflation of the lungs suggests underlying COPD.
No new pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
Pleural thickening in the lung apices is unchanged.
There has been interval removal of the IABP.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly.
Interstitial opacities are similar to that seen 7 hours prior, and may relate either to chronic lung disease or mild interstitial edema.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 71 year old female with a history of MVR, [**Month/Day/Year **], and CAD who presented to the ED with chest pain and found to be having anterior STEMI requiring BMS to LAD and placement of IABP post procedure.
# CORONARIES: Patient presented with chest pain to the ED where it was determined she was having an anterior STEMI.
She went to the cardiac catheterization lab where she was found to have total occlusion of the LAD just after the first diagonal branch.
Given that patient had a cardiac index of 1.7 and anterior wall motion abnormality was observed during the cath an IABP was placed and kept in for 36 hrs.
An ECHO on [**6-21**] showed regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD of mid-LAD distribution (severe hypokinesis of distal [**2-3**] ant septum and mild hypokinesis of ant wall/apex).
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
#PUMP: As noted above, anterior wall motion abnormalities and poor cardiac index were noted during cardiac cath, prompting IABP post-cath.
# RHYTHM: The day following cardiac cath patient had episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
After recurrent episodes of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, she was started on amiodarone and coumadin, with continued beta blockade.
On [**6-23**], EP was consulted for continued, and she underwent EP study on [**6-24**] that showed her to have bidirectional flutter (typical and atypical), and the typical flutter tract was ablated without complication.
# LOW GRADE FEVER: On [**2184-6-22**], the patient was pan-cultured for a low-grade fever of 100.7 F. Blood cultures are still pending on discharge but her UA and urine cultures were negative and CXR was unremarkable.
She remained afebrile thereafter.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Anterior STEMI - Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter .
Secondary: - Dyslipidemia - Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Improved.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital with chest pain and we determined you were having a heart attack.
Because you now have a stent it is important that you take Aspirin and Plavix (another blood thinner) everyday.
You were also found to have atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and you underwent and EP study to ablate the atrial flutter.
You should call your doctor or return to the Emergency Room for evaluation if you develop any recurrent chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, feeling faint, or any other concerning symptoms.
If you have any problems arranging this, do not hesitate to give Dr.[**Name (NI) 5907**] office a call.
