Extinction x  NIHSS Total 23 GCS 9  Head CT performed at 8:32am without obvious signs of acute stroke or bleed, +dense L-MCA sign and CTA perfusion shows no [**Doctor First Name 3098**] and decreased vessels particularly in left superior division of MCA.
No known clotting/bleeding disorders.
Physical Exam: Exam: T- AF 98.5 BP- 148/75 HR- 71 RR- 18 100 O2Sat RA Gen: Lying in stretcher flailing, mild distress HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa, frothing Neck: supple, no carotid bruit CV: irreg irreg, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Opened eyes to voice, not following commands, moaning, not regarding.
Left pupil 2mm sluggish nonreactive.

No observed myoclonus or tremor.
No noxious stim, decreased L sided movement in arm and leg.
Perfusion-weighted images showing a large left middle cerebral artery territory infarct.
Tapered narrowing of the lumen of the proximal cervical left internal carotid artery is suggestive of a dissection.
Complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery at both its cervical and intracranial portions distal to the dissection.
Abrupt cut off of the contrast column within the A1 segment of the left ACA, which is being filled by a prominent anterior communicating artery.
This abrupt cut off is suggestive of an acute thromboembolism.
Reconstitution of the M3 and M4 branches of the left middle cerebral artery presumably from leptomeningeal collaterals.
MRI/A [**7-2**]: Limited evaluation showing occlusion of the cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery.
Signal is seen within portions of the intracranial left ICA and the proximal left MCA, which may represent reconstitution of flow since the preceding CTA versus signal from thrombosis.
CT Head [**7-4**]: Marked progression to parenchymal edema involving the entire left cerebral hemisphere with new 16 mm subfalcine herniation and uncal herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 100203**] was an 83-year-old man who presented with aphasia and right hemiparesis, and who was found to have a left MCA stroke.
Repeat CT scans showed involvement of the entire L MCA territory.
