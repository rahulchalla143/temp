HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old male with no history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction or angina, who developed an uncomfortable around 2 PM on the day of admission.
There was no radiation to the jaw or arms, no shortness of breath, no diaphoresis.
His wife convinced him to go to the Emergency Department, and there he was found to have an inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction at [**Hospital3 31084**] Hospital.
He was given aspirin, TNK and was found to developed a tachyarrhythmia consistent with ventricular tachycardia and was shocked at 100 joules with resumption of normal sinus rhythm.
On transfer he was chest discomfort free and has been free of chest discomfort since receiving the thrombolysis.
Prostate carcinoma status post brachytherapy.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient had no shortness of breath, no dyspnea on exertion, no orthopnea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
In general he was pleasant, alert and oriented x 3 in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed anicteric sclerae, dry blood around mouth, no oral lesions, moist mucous membranes.
Lungs had bibasilar rales halfway up the chest posteriorly.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities had no edema.
EKG showed sinus bradycardia with normal axis, inferior ST elevations and anterior ST depressions; no resolution of ST depressions or ST elevations post thrombolysis.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 74-year-old male with inferior posterior ST elevation myocardial infarction status post thrombolysis admitted to the coronary care unit for monitoring and cardiac catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular:  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2118-11-15**] which showed right-sided pressures, right atrium 7, right ventricle 26/7, pulmonary artery pressure 26/11, pulmonary wedge of 8, left ventricular systolic pressure 112, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 8.
Qualitative wall motion showed inferior severe hypokinesis otherwise normal wall motion.
The right coronary lesion was successfully treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stented with resulting TIMI 3 flow, no evidence of dissection.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
The patient no longer had any symptoms of chest tightness or chest discomfort at all.
He underwent echocardiogram on [**2118-11-16**] which showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities including basal inferoseptal akinesis, mid inferoseptal akinesis, basal inferior akinesis, mid inferior akinesis, basal inferolateral akinesis, mid inferolateral akinesis, inferior apex hypokinetic, lateral apex hypokinetic.
Inferior myocardial infarction.
