There was no CP/SOB, palpitation.
No loss of continence or confusion.
Head CT showed 8mm subdural hematoma in right parietal lobe and likely a small R frontal parenchymal hemorrhage.
No cervical trauma.
Pt was seen by neurosurgery and sent to floor for further conservative management and hemodialysis.

Pertinent Results: STUDIES: CT head non-con ([**9-28**]): In the extra-axial space overlying the right lateral parietal cortex, there is a hyperdense focus measuring 8 mm in thickness, corresponding to an acute subdural hemorrhage.
In the superior right frontal cortex is a 4-mm focus of hyperdensity, which likely reflects an acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is no edema or midline shift associated with either focus of hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of infarction.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with age-related involution.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
There is no fracture.
Paranasal sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening of the nasal cavity and left maxillary sinus, and there is soft tissue density material nearly filling the right maxillary sinus.
The maxillary sinus walls are diffusely thickened and increased in density.
this may be a consequence of chronic inflammation, but given his history of renal failure, this may also reflect renal osteodystrophy.
Acute right subdural hematoma overlying the right lateral parietal cortex measuring 8 mm.
4-mm focus of hyperdensity in the right superior frontal cortex, likely indicating parenchymal hemorrhage.
No fracture or scalp hematoma.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2113-9-29**] IMPRESSION: Abnormal routine EEG due to the slow background with occasional suppressive bursts.
These findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Hypoxia is another possible explanation.
Nevertheless, there were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
CT-HEAD [**2113-9-30**] FINDINGS: There has been no interval change in right parieto-occipital subdural hematoma, again measuring 7 mm at its deepest, and again extending around the occipital cortex posteriorly.
The intraparenchymal focus of bleeding in the right frontal cortex is unchanged.
There are no new areas of bleeding.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or herniation.
Ventricles and sulci are again prominent, consistent with age-related involution.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent withchronic small vessel ischemia.
Basilar cisterns and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation are patent, and there is no evidence of infarction.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: No interval change in right parieto-occipital subdural hematoma and right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage, and no midline shift or herniation .
MRI AND MRA OF THE BRAIN AND MRA OF THE NECK WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2113-9-30**].
The known extensive, but relatively thin acute subdural hematoma overlying the right cerebral convexity and tentorium is, overall, unchanged, with a similar degree of mass effect and slight flattening of the subjacent gyri.
There is no significant shift of the normally-midline structures or evidence of herniation.
There are scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage, particularly in right frontal sulci and right frontovertex, as on the serial CTs; no true hemorrhagic parenchymal contusion is identified.
There is multifocal confluent and punctate FLAIR- hyperintensity in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular, as well as central pontine white matter, representing chronic microvascular infarction, related to the patient's numerous chronic medical illnesses.
However, apart from the susceptibility artifact originating from the extra-axial hemorrhage, there is no evidence of restricted diffusion to indicate acute infarction.
There is also no white matter abnormality to specifically suggest the presence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
The major intracranial vascular flow-voids, including those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved (see MRA, below).
Incidentally noted are mild-moderate chronic inflammatory changes in the paranasal sinuses with bilateral maxillary mucus- retention cysts.
There is normal flow-related enhancement in the included intracranial portions of both internal carotid and proximal middle and anterior cerebral arteries, with normal symmetric arborization of MCA branches and no flow-limiting stenosis.
There is normal flow-related enhancement in distal vertebral arteries with dominant left and hypoplastic right vessel, as well as the basilar artery, which is markedly tortuous, and bilateral superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries, with no flow-limiting stenosis.
Anterior and left posterior communicating vessels are demonstrated, and there is no aneurysm larger than 3 mm in diameter.
The axial 2D time-of-flight sequence is somewhat limited; however, there is normal flow-signal in bilateral common and proximal internal and external carotid arteries, which are grossly normal in caliber and contour, with no flow-limiting stenosis.
There is normal flow- signal in the cervical vertebral arteries with markedly dominant left and hypoplastic right vessel, as on the cranial MRA, with no discrete flow- limiting stenosis seen.
Stable extensive but thin subdural hematoma layering over the right cerebral convexity and that portion of the tentorium, with no significant change in the degree of mass effect or shift of the midline structures.
Likely post-traumatic small subarachnoid hemorrhage at the right frontovertex, with no new hemorrhage seen.
No evidence of acute infarction and no specific finding to suggest PRES.
Unremarkable cranial and limited cervical MRA, with no flow-limiting stenosis.
LUMBAR SPINAL PUNCTURE Study Date of [**2113-10-1**] 11:21 AM INDICATION: 79 y/o female with end stage renal disease, hypertension, fever, mental status changes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.
Increasing bibasilar atelectatic changes.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2113-10-4**] 3:16 AM REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with pneumonia after IMPRESSION: No significant appreciable change compared to the prior study.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease seen (reasonable-quality study).
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.
[**2113-10-8**] HEAD CT: FINDINGS: Right parieto-occipital subdural hematoma measuring 6 mm in greatest dimension is not appreciably changed in size since prior study.
Focus of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is not well appreciated on current study.
Subarachnoid vs. parenchymal hemorrhage within the right temporoparietal region (2:15) demonstrates little change from [**9-30**].
Prominent ventricles and sulci bilaterally are consistent with age-related parenchymal atrophy.
Periventricular white matter confluent hypoattenuation is also noted and unchanged, consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
There is worsening of right maxillary sinus disease with near complete opacification on current study.
No significant change in intracranial hemorrhage since prior study.
Worsening right maxillary sinus disease with near complete opacification.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Brief Hospital Course: 79 F admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2113-9-28**] after a fall, found to have SDH and IPH, which were managed conservatively by neurosurgery.
On [**9-29**] she developed acute mental status changes, and witnessed seizure, resulting in transfer to ICU and subsequent intubation for further imaging, and LP.
# altered mental status - likely due initially to subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal bleed.
After returning the medical floor from Head CT, her BP was noted to be 189/84 with stable mental status, however she then was noted to have oxygen desaturation to the 80's.
At that time she had a witnessed 30-second generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
SBP became elevated to 210.
She had a witnessed aspiration in this setting.
She was noted to be unresponsive after tonic-clonic activity, without stereo-typed movement, with coarse breath sounds.
Subsequent EEG showed no NCSE.
Per Neurology her exam was described as follows: She opens her eyes to loud voice but requires frequent physical stimulation to keep them open; she produces only unintelligible sounds but no speech.
Her pupils are small but equal and reactive (2 -> 1 bilaterally); her face appears symmetric; She moved all extremities spontaneously antigravity except her left UE, which she withdraws antigravity from pain;  She has symmetric but diminished reflexes in her LEs and normal reflexes in the RUE, and possibly hyperreflexic in the L UE; she has flexor plantar responses (no TFL contraction on right as her toes have been amputated on that side).
She remained only minimally arousable.
Given difficulty with peripheral IV placement, a right femoral CVL was placed under USN guidance for urgent administration of phenytoin.
the etiology of her mental status changes was ultimatley attributed to SDH/IPH with a superimposed toxic-metabolic component.
EEG without seizure activity.
MRI without evidence of infarction and MRA shows no stenosis.
She was continued on dilatin with goal level between [**11-6**] after correcting for her albumin.
# pneumonia - pt s/p witnessed aspiration event in the setting of tonic clonic seizure.
Mini-BAL and BAL were performed and revealed MSSA (>100K), multiple species of klebsiella and psuedomonas (<10K, not felt to be pathogenic).
given her ongoing mental status changes, she was maintained on aspiration precautions.
# nutrition - NG tube was placed at the time of intubation.
# hypertension - Temporally related to hemorrhage, though unclear if preceeded or followed hemorrhage.
Relatively significant increase from her documented baseline of 130-150.
Elevated pulse pressure may be [**2-18**] decreased compliance in light of DM and PVD.
SBP goals were 120-160 upon discharge from ICU given SDH and concern for HTN as possible cause of seizure.
# Toxic Mulitinodular Goiter:  TSH <0.02 which is usual; FT4 1.5.
# Diabetes: Pt with elevated BS around 200s  Her sliding scale was titrated up, and she was started on lantus 10U.
She continued [**Date Range 2286**] without difficulty.
# CAD - pt initially had aspirin held given SDH, however this was restarted after discussion with neurology, along with atorvastatin.
Pt w/ no CP no EKG changes on admission.
She was noted to have a single bradycardic episode on [**2113-10-5**] during [**Date Range 2286**] and rectal tube placement, which resolved spontaneously, likely vagal event.
# Peripheral vascular disease - pt continued on home regimen of aspirin.
# Arthritis - pt treated symptomatically with tylenol prn.
# anemia - hct 42 on admission, likely hemoconcentrated, gradual decline to 32-34. no active bleeding during this hospitalization.
no transfusions required.
# loose stools - pt notes loose stool on [**10-11**], her standing colace and senna were discontinued.
# PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, SSI, Ranitidine, Heparin SQ (SQ heparin confirmed OK with neurosurgery).
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Phenytoin 125 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for seizure.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Sub-dural hematoma/intraparenchymal brain bleed -Aspiration pneumonia -Seizure secondary to brain bleed .
Secondary: -Diabetes (last HgbA1c 01/08=6.7) -Hypertension -Peripheral vascular disease -Arthritis -Lumbar disc disease -Coronary Artery Disease -Chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis -Pulmonary hypertension -Toxic Multinodular Goiter -Anemia- low iron and EPO -status post breast biopsy -status post Hysterectomy, -status post excision of a left ear mass -status post right toe amputation of digits one, two, three, four, and five   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, all vital signs stable, improving mental status (conversive)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after a fall and loss of consciousness.
A CT scan of your head detected a small area of bleeding in your brain.
Unfortunately, you did have a seizure, likely because of the small brain bleed, and you were transferred to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring.
You ultimately required intubation for a breif period of time given your altered mental status.
You were transferred back to the regular medical floor, where your mental status gradually improved although you remained slightly groggy, likely because of your recent head injury and pneumonia.
You were switched to a diet of soft foods and thin liquids with nutritional supplements, with strict aspiration precautions.
2)We have made the following changes to your medications: -We started dilantin to help prevent seizures due to the small bleed in your brain.
-We started labetalol for high blood pressure.
Please continue this medication, and discuss management of your blood pressure with your primary doctor at your follow-up appointment.
3)Please call your doctor or go to an emergency room if you have fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, confusion, changes in your vision, severe headache, nausea and vomiting, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
