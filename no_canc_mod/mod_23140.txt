There is a small ankle joint effusion.
There are mild degenerative changes at the tibiotalar joint and talonavicular joint.
No acute abnormality is noted.
No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening is present.
Lateral view shows a very small pleural effusion collected posteriorly.
Heart size normal, probable small pericardial effusion projects to the left of the cardiac apex, but there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement to suggest that this is hemodynamically significant.
Vascular deficiency in the right upper lobe is probably due to emphysema.
No focal pulmonary abnormality is seen elsewhere.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo F with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic HBV without ESLD, presenting with BRBPR s/p colonoscopy one week ago.
# BRBPR.
Presenting with 2 days of painless rectal bleeding, in the setting of having a colonoscopy one week ago - high suspicion for post-polypectomy bleed in the setting of re-starting Coumadin as an outpatient, particularly since pt had been having smaller amounts of bleeding since the procedure.
No evidence of ischemic colitis.
Patient had one additional episode of bloody BM on the general medicine floor in the setting of PTT >150 while on Heparin drip bridging to Coumadin, and this resolved when Heparin was discontinued.
# Atrial fibrillation.
Given the patient was only symptomatic from her a fib/flutter was during the initial episode on the floor, and remained asymptomatic with stable BPs during her subsequent episodes of a fib/flutter, it was decided to hold off on attempt to rate control prior to placement of pacemaker.
After the pacemaker was placed she continued to have afib with RVR without a good response to Metoprolol.
Her INR was not therapeutic at discharge however there was concern of bleeding into the pacemaker pocket if she were bridged with Heparin.
# Hypertension.
# Osteoporosis versus osteopenia.

A pacemaker was placed in your chest on [**2-15**] since the medications for the atrial fibrillation were causing your heart to beat too slowly.
You should START: -Cephalexin, an antibiotic which is given to prevent infection after a procedure.
