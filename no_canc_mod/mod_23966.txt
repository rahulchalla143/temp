Hyperesthesia in hands.
No clonus   Pertinent Results: [**2139-4-18**] CT Torso: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intra-abdominal, pelvic or thoracic trauma.
Burst fracture of C5 vertebral body with mild, 3 mm retropulsion and mild vertebral body height loss; there is no associated signficant epidural hematoma, spinal canal stenosis or mass effect on the thecal sac.
Right C5 lamina and articular process fracture, without subluxation, and left C5 lamina/spinous process fracture with no extension into the foramina transversaria.
[**2139-4-18**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality  [**2139-4-18**]: MRI Cspine: IMPRESSION: 1.
Extensive bone marrow edema involving much of the C5 vertebral body, corresponding to the known burst fracture, with anterior compression and no more than 3 mm retropulsion of, particularly, its inferior endplate, as on the CT. 2.
No definite associated epidural hematoma.
Extensive edema throughout the C3 through C6 supraspinous ligaments, reflecting acute injury with marked bowing of the stretched posterior longitudinal ligament, which appears intact.
There is no evidence of asssociated interspinous ligamentous or facet articular capsular injury.
Equivocal faint T2- and STIR-hyperintense focus within the left paramedian central cord substance, which may reflect acute edema, related to the acute flexion-sprain injury; however, there is no evidence of the presence of deoxyhemoglobin to suggest hemorrhagic cord contusion.
Otherwise, normal cervical spinal cord caliber and intrinsic signal intensity.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 85633**] is a 23 yo gentleman who sustained a C5 fx and spinal cord contusion after diving into shallow water.
