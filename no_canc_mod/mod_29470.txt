Minimal stranding adjacent to sigmoid colon is more likely chronic changes from prior diverticulitis and less likely to be mild uncomplicated diverticulitis.
Mildly dilated bile ducts with smooth tapering at the ampulla.
There is likely sphincter dysfunction or papillary stenosis, but if labs show a cholestatic picture further evaluation with MRCP would be recommended.
Cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas measuring up to 2.5 cm is likely side branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.
Mild pulmonary fibrosis.
Lungs are essentially clear bilaterally without definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Degenerative changes are noted in the T-spine with small endplate spurs noted.
No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
Sigmoidoscopy ([**2170-11-12**])- -Stool in the colon -Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon -Mild focal erythema in the rectum and sigmoid colon (biopsy) -Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure Recommendations: 	 -Await biopsy results -No clear etiology of her symptoms were found.
Bleeding may have been related to diverticula or mildly abnormal mucosa may be related to resolving ischemic colitis.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a pmh of HTN and osteoarthritis who presented to an OSH with bright red blood mixed with brown stool and large dark stool at OSH ED consistent with LGIB.
# LGIB: New onset without pro-dromal symptoms.
Patient was evaluated by GI who recommended starting moviprep for possible colonoscopy and CT scan to evaluate for ischemic colitis.
She under went a flexible sigmoidoscopy, which did not show additional bleeding, but also did not reveal a clear bleeding source.
The etiology of her bleeding remains unclear, likely [**1-24**] diverticuli or episode of resolving ischemic colitis.
# HTN: Home antihypertensives were held in MICU given current bleed, and possible ischemia in the setting of GIB.
========================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ========================== # Cystic lesion of pancreas - likley IMPN, can get outpatient work-up # Mild pulmonary fibrosis - patient is not reporting any respiratory complaints, can also get outpatient work-up.
