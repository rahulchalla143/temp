Admission Date: [**2121-7-24**]        Discharge Date: [**2121-7-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2046-7-28**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old Hispanic male patient who underwent an exercise tolerance test as part of an annual physical which wound up being positive, and he was referred for cardiac catheterization as a result of his positive stress test.
The cardiac catheterization revealed significant 3-vessel coronary artery disease with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction.
ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.
Later that afternoon, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response in the 140s.
He subsequently converted back a normal sinus rhythm later that day, but over the next 48 hours or so had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation.
It was then decided that because the patient was tolerating his atrial fibrillation from a hemodynamic standpoint that the best course of action would be to continue his amiodarone and metoprolol but to anticoagulate him for the atrial fibrillation.
An intravenous heparin drip was initiated on postoperative day five due to continued episodes of atrial fibrillation, and Coumadin was also begun at that time.
The patient then stayed in the hospital for the next few days on the intravenous heparin drip waiting for his INR to increase with the Coumadin so that he could go home anticoagulated because of his atrial fibrillation.
Today, on postoperative day seven, the patient continued to have episodes of atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 90s and a blood pressure in the 120 range.
On physical examination, the patient was neurologically grossly intact with no apparent neurologic deficits.
This cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rate and rhythm.
The incisions to both of his legs - as well as to his sternum - were intact with no erythema or drainage.
The patient was given a dose today of 3 mg, and he was to have an INR drawn tomorrow by the visiting nurse who will call the results to Dr.[**Name (NI) 55426**] office and obtain further dose recommendations from him.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
