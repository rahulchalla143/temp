Although he has nocturia at baseline (usually wakes 3-4 times per week to use the bathroom at night), he began to use the bathroom during the day with increasing frequency, every 15-20 minutes.
The weakness came on all of a sudden and he felt a cramping fatigue worst in his calves.
He had no trouble understanding others or finding words, but noticed his pronunciation of words was impaired.
In addition, he also felt intermittently very cold and then very hot.
He was observed to have altered mental status, raising suspicion for possible TIA or stroke.
He was found to be in acute renal failure with hyperkalemia, with EKG changes notable for peaked T waves.
He was transfered to the MICU and treated medically without need for hemodialysis.
He proceeded to have brisk urine output.
He has had chronic knee pain for which he takes acetaminophen; he also takes a nightly ibuprofen-containing sleep aid for insomnia.

No previous tracing available for comparison.
Compared to the previous tracing of the same date, there is no significant change.
Bilateral tiny simple renal cysts noted.
Incidentally noted, the liver is diffusely echogenic, consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o African American male with a PMH of DMII and HTN who presented with generalized weakness, altered mental status, slurred speech and increased frequency of small amounts of urination.
He was found to be in acute renal failure at an OSH and transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible hemodialysis.
**ACUTE ISSUES** # Acute Renal Failure: He presented in acute renal failure with creatinine of 10.4 (baseline 0.9), hyperkalemia, and EKG changes.
His ARF was largely attributed to obstruction as he was retaining over 500cc urine and found to have large symmetric prostate on DRE.
However, no hydronephrosis seen on ultrasound.
Renal function gradually improved over several days following catheter placement, fluid support, and discontinuation of nephrotoxigenic drugs.
#Hyperkalemia: He was found to have an elevated K 8 with associated peaked T waves.
Serial EKGS also showed resolution of peaked T waves.
He will be followed by his PCP in the next 2-3 days for follow-up  of this new diabetes regimen.
#BPH:  As above, his BPH contributed to urinary obstruction and ARF.
-Renal outpatient follow up to readdress kidney function and possibility of restoring prior home meds: quinapril, metformin, glipizide -PCP follow up in the next couple days to follow up glucose control on newly started insulin regimen and antihypertensive regimen, and side effects to newly started Tamsulosin.
Glargine 2 units SQ qhs  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Renal Failure Hyperkalemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were hospitalized because of changes in mental status, decreased urine output, generalized weakness, and decreased functioning of your kidney.
Your kidney injury was most likely caused by an obstruction of the bladder as a result of your large prostate.
A foley catheter was also placed to bypass the bladder obstruction caused by the enlarged prostate.
If you notice an increase in pain around the catheter, pain with urination, change in urine color, or fever please contact your PCP or return to the Emergency Room.
