In the ED patient was found to be hypotensive and in profound renal failure with creatinine 10 and K of 6.1 and hyperkalemia, no EKG changes seen.
Hyperkalemia was treated with both kaexylate as well as bicarbonate and calcium.
Laboratories also notable for elevated CK peak in 900s and FeNa of 140.
Nephrology consulted--at this point post-obstructive nephropathy, myoglobinemia (possibly secondary to succinylcholine-related myolysis), ATN from low blood flow.
On HD2, echocardiography revealed hyperdynamic EF and IVF inititated.
He denies fever, chest pain, easy bruising or swelling in legs and ankles.
Past Medical History: 1) Diabetes type II 2) Hyperlipidemia 3) HTN 4) Hypothyroid, on replacement 5) BPH 6) elevated amylase, unclear etiology 7) Question coronary artery disease, has mild inferior wall reversible defect seen on [**1-/2145**] P-MIBI  Social History: No alcohol or tobacco use.
Eyes: Mild exophthalmos.
Cor: RR, 3/6 SEM, no gallop, no rub Chest: Lungs CTA b/l Abd: Obese, Non-tender, tympanic, no peritoneal signs Genital: Foley in place, yellow clear urine, penile edema.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation on mitral valve.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
No mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Compared to tracing of [**2145-6-29**] sinus tachycardia has replaced sinus bradycardia.
Redemonstration of a simple-appearing, large right renal cortical cyst.
No evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi.
LINE PLACEM Study Date of [**2145-7-27**] 4:58 PM  IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-20**] and 13:  Lung volumes have improved, right pleural effusion and basal atelectasis nearly resolved.
Hyperkalemia was treated with both kaexylate as well as bicarb/ca.
Hypoglycemia was initially treated with dextrose boluses and then with D10 gtt until it resolved.
DDx post-obstructive nephropathy, myoglobinemia, ATN from low blood flow.
Esmolol gtt was started to control tachycardia in the setting of recent stress test showing a reversible defect.
On HD4 was started on caspofungin for yest in [**12-10**] bottles of clood cultures - later grew out c. glabralta - ID team was consulted.
Internal Medicine Transfer Course:  Briefly, this was a 74 year old diabetic gentleman admitted in renal failure s/p penile implant.
He remained afebrile throughout his stay.
#) Distended abdomen: Patient has mildly distended abdomen.
Patient reports no nausea or vomiting.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for acute renal failure.
You were also found to have high potassium, low urine output, and bacteremia.
Your acute renal failure was probably secondary to post-operative obstruction from your penile implant and complications from the antibiotic treatment for your bacteremia.
If you are still having abdominal distention once discharged, please increase the fiber in your diet, as well as, keep using laxatives such as senna or colace.
If you notice any substernal chest pain, extreme shortness of breath, mental status changes, headache, dizziness, acute scrotal/penile swelling, fever, chills, sweats, or abdominal pain please return to the nearest emergency room.
