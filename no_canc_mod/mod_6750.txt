Admission Date:  [**2167-6-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-7-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2097-10-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  TRANSPLANT SURGERY SERVICE Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 30250**] ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: End stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C.  End stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C status post orthotropic cadaveric liver transplant.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 69 year-old male who is a patient of both the liver team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who had a past medical history significant for hepatitis C, hypertension, psoriasis and chronic low back pain secondary post TIPS procedure on [**4-/2166**] with revision on 11/[**2166**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
One was that there was a arterial branch patch in the recipient to the donor.
He had 5 liters of Cell [**Doctor Last Name **] and 3500 of crystalloid in the form of Plasma-Lyte.
On [**2167-6-9**] he was returned to the Operating Room for an exploration and was found to have an area of bleeding from the posterior vena cava.
It should be noted that during this time the patient did, however, rule in positive for myocardial infarction by perioperative troponins elevated to 5.7.
The thought by cardiology evaluation to be a non Q wave myocardial infarction versus an isolated troponin leak and the patient was maintained on Lopressor.
This was repeated several days later and it showed that the patient's EF had returned to 50% and he had no thrombus in his atrium.
At this time the patient was found to just have a significant intra-abdominal hematoma on exploration.
The patient's biopsy revealed that there was no rejection and no ductal cholestasis.
On primary evaluation in the Operating Room he did not appear to have any ductal leak, but the surgeons were maintaining a close eye for this finding.
For this reason neurology was consulted and he was thought to have a electroencephalogram not consistent with seizure activity and MRI with old periventricular white matter changes.
He was not thought to have had any acute neurological event.
He did from cultures grow out E-coli from wound fluid and was treated with appropriate antibiotics, Levofloxacin, but since he had a distant sensitivity to such Ceftazidine per infectious disease.
The patient also had nutrition consulted at this time and this was to be a big issue in terms of his recuperation and his recovery and was started on total parenteral nutrition, again with close following for potential signs of infection and close maintenance of wound and continued line care.
His hospital course outside of the Intensive Care Unit was characterized by continued surveillance of his liver function.
On [**2167-6-29**] the patient underwent an ultrasound, which revealed that he had normal pulsatile flow through the porta and on [**7-2**] he had a cholangiogram, which indicated that he had a dilated proximal duct with some extravasation.
It should also be noted that on all imaging formats the hepatic artery was viewed as patent as well and it was not thought that ischemia was a concern at this point contributing to the patient's status.
He underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2167-7-7**], which showed that he had an anastomotic leak and evidenced such clearly enough to place a stent that was 7 cm by 10 French Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent through the site of anastomosis.
Cholangiogram repeated on [**2167-7-8**] evidenced no leak at the anastomosis.
The patient had this followed by a HIDA scan, which again evidenced no leak and had minimal 16 minute normal transient time of contrast to the small bowel.
It should be noted that during the time the patient was having these resolving liver function issues his Cyclosporin level was elevated as high as 563.
The patient had also tolerated his T tube being clamped for greater then 48 hours without any temperature spikes or any abdominal discomfort.
Hepatitis C significant for his Child's B cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma status post OLT with postoperative course as noted above.
Status post umbilical hernia repair.
He was to be seen by physical therapy and was full weight bearing, ambulated for stability with a walker, but this could be transitioned as per the consult service.
He had the above noted imaging studies that confirmed that he no longer had any biliary system leak and his hematocrit had been stable for some time.
