Since the previous tracing of [**2156-5-4**] there is no diagnostic interval change.
CXR [**5-15**]:  Low lung volumes, without an acute cardiopulmonary process.
b/l LE dopplers [**2156-5-16**]:  No evidence of DVT  CTA Chest [**2156-5-16**]: 1.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Moderate to large pericardial effusion, a new finding since [**2156-5-3**].
Bilateral basal pulmonary atelectasis and pleural effusions, which have also increased since the previous CT. 4.
Bilateral upper pole renal cysts.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized (1-1.5cm) circumferential pericardial effusion with sparing along the inferior and inferolateral walls.
There is mild right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired filling/tamponade physiology.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential with a layer of echo dense material, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements anterior to the RV.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Pericardial Fluid Cytology [**2156-5-18**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
There is a small echo dense pericardial effusion, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is residue echo dense material mostly anterior to the RV.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo F w/ htn, hyperlipidemia, chronic c.diff, recent admission for pericarditis presents with recurrent pleuritic chest pain after discontinuing her NSAIDS admitted with recurrent pericarditis.
Upon admission to cardiology, patient was noted to have pleuritic chest pain with poor oxygen saturation.
LE dopplers were negative and CTA chest did not show PE but was significant for new pericardial effusion.
Echocardiogram on [**2156-5-17**] showed large pericardial effusion with some RV collapse.
Repeat echocardiogram [**5-18**] showed continued evidence of tamponade and she underwent pericardiocentesis.
220 cc of bloody pericardial fluid was drained.
Post procedure echo showed resolution of the effusion and residual fibrinous material.
Cytology was negative for malignancy.
Strep viridans pericarditis is highly unlikely clinically in the absence of endocarditis, and the patient has had negative blood cultures and no clear evidence of valvular disease.
# Acute diastolic heart failure: Patient showed clinical evidence of volume overload, most likely from the fluids she received in the hospital.
# Chronic c. difficile: Pt was continued on her course of PO vancomycin per outpatient medications.
# Arthritis: Held mobic while on ibuprofen.
# Subclinical Hypothyroidism: The patient was noted to have sinus tachycardia around 100 even after her pericardiocentesis.

Hypertension 2.
Hyperlipidemia 3.
Chronic Clostridium Difficle diarrhea 5.
Zoster   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain after a recent admission with similar pain.
Echocardiogram showed accumulation of fluid around the heart that was not present on your previous admission.
