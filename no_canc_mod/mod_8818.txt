Mr. [**Known lastname 2093**] has had history of numerous strokes on presentation.
In 4/98 he had a right sided hemorrhagic stroke in basal ganglia with extension to the ventricles.
Then in 9/00 he presented with right sided ataxic hemiparesis and was found to have a left internal capsule basal ganglia infarct on MRI.
Per old hospital record the patient recovered from a motor standpoint but was was placed on antihypertensives and Aggrenox at some point in his past history.
The patient subsequently presented on [**8-27**] with an acute onset of right sided weakness.
MRA and MRI showed moderate global atrophy with diffuse extensive small vessel disease.
His neck vessels were intact with question of mild stenosis of left carotid.
Based on the study results, differential diagnosis was made to include small vessel disease vs vasculitis.
This was reported to be a moderately traumatic tap with only one out of four tubes sent where there were 110 red blood cells, 30 monocytes, no polys with a glucose of 69, protein 167.
Gram stain was negative and culture showed question of coag negative staph aureus which was thought to be a contaminant.
Fungal AFB and cryptococcal antigens were negative in the CSF.
Based on this result the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for positive angiography and biopsy for work-up of possible CNS vasculitis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, GI bleed, retinal emboli, glaucoma, hyperbilirubinemia, [**Doctor Last Name 9376**], history of hypokalemia, history of low platelets on Heparin, history of mild ITP, no history of diabetes or MI.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has no history of nicotine or etoh use.
The patient showed slight perseveration.
There was mild degree of echolalia.
He had difficulty following multi-step commands, mild grasp glabellar bilaterally.
Extraocular movements show no nystagmus nor diplopia.
On motor exam there is increased tone in the lower extremities.
On upper extremity exam there is questionable deltoid weakness on the left, otherwise full strength on the left upper extremity.
On repeat lumbar puncture the patient still was found to have an elevated protein of 133 in his cerebrospinal fluid.
Cerebral angiogram showed narrowing of the P1 segment in his posterior circulation which was uncommon for atherosclerotic disease.
Results of the brain biopsy were consistent with a microangiopathic vasculitis.
Meeting with the patient's wife and brother was held to discuss this diagnosis of CNS vasculitis as well as treatment options and future prognosis.
The patient had microscopic hematuria noted two days after starting Cytoxan therapy with 6-10 red blood cells per high power field.
On [**9-25**] the patient had one transient episode of [**Known lastname **] hematuria which was thought to be traumatic as it was noted during movement and the Foley catheter might have been pulled.
The patient received regular fingersticks to monitor for blood glucose level while on Prednisone.
The patient showed no sign of hyperglycemia on Prednisone and this was stopped.
During his hospital admission the patient had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] of mental status.
On [**9-21**] the patient had one episode of tremor of left extremity with eye deviation to the right side times five minutes per report.
The patient was loaded on Dilantin and CT of head was immediately obtained to evaluate intracranial status and ruled out any postoperative bleeding.
The patient had no more episodes of seizure during this hospitalization and remained therapeutic on Dilantin.
Of note, during his hospitalization the patient was also treated for one bout of urinary tract infection with Ciprofloxacin.
EKG obtained also suggested the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy with ST changes that are chronic.
The patient showed marked mental status improvement since starting on Dilantin.
The patient will also need to be aggressively hydrated while on Cytoxan therapy to prevent potential toxicity including hemorrhagic cystitis.
The patient will require regular urine dipsticks to monitor for any microscopic hematuria while on Cytoxan.
