Bibasilar opacities, could represent a combination of atelectasis and small effusions, however, superimpsed infection cannot be excluded.

Left upper lobe and lingular ground-glass opacities with smooth septal thickening.
Differential diagnosis includes atypical infection, hemorrhage, or an unusual distribution of pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar atelectasis with possible coexistent aspiriation given plugging of the lower lobe bronchi and fluid-filled upper esophagus.
Stable appearance of soft tissue mass in the azygoesophageal recess since [**2148-2-24**].
Further evaluation with MRI may be helpful to distinguish duplication cyst from solid mass such as lymphadenopathy.
Right hilar lymphadenopathy, increased since the prior study, and likely reactive.
