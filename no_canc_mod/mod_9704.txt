On admission she was tachycardiac and tachypneic and febrile.
She had significant abdominal tenderness at this time.
She was resuscitated with fluids but became hypotensive and required 9 L of Crystalloid on [**8-3**].
She developed significant bandemia to 33.
Given the severity of her pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis, the patient was started on Imipenem.
She required an Insulin drip for hyperglycemia.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Total hip replacement.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
Heart:  Tachycardiac but regular.
Abdomen:  Distended and tympanitic.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment for pancreatitis.
The patient continually spiked fevers with a T-max of 102??????
She also had decreased PA O2s during her hospital stay.
Sputum cultures grew Haemophilus influenza and Imipenem was continued for her pancreatitis and pneumonia.
Repeat CT scan was also performed which revealed no evidence of pancreatic necrosis.
Due to her continued pulmonary issues, on hospital day #4, an esophageal balloon manometer was used to calculate transpulmonary pressures.
The patient was also started on TPN for nutritional supplementation.

Cultures were obtained with these fever spikes; however, no organisms were isolated.
Pulmonary status did progressively improve; however, it remained very serious with the appearance of ARDS.

Acute pancreatitis likely secondary to hypertriglyceridemia.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Haemophilus pneumoniae.
Clostridium difficile colitis.
