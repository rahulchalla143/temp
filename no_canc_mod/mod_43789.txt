TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan followed by CT angiography of the intracranial vasculature.
FINDINGS:  There is a huge hemorrhage within the left basal ganglia/internal capsule and thalamic region extending into the mesencephalon.
There is a prominent degree of intraventricular hemorrhage as well extending throughout the supratentorial ventricular system and likely the aqueduct of Sylvius as well.
The hemorrhage creates prominent mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle and there is a prominent degree of rightward subfalcine herniation.
There are streak artifacts arising from aneurysm clips in the region of the anterior communicating artery.
There is a left frontotemporal craniotomy.
The CT angiogram discloses several small vascular structures along the lateral aspect of the left lentiform nucleus portion of this hemorrhage.
CONCLUSION:  A few small vascular structures along the lateral aspect of the large left lentiform nucleus component of this hemorrhage raise the question for an underlying vascular lesion, such as a vascular malformation.
There is no pleural effusion.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
FINDINGS: Following injection of tracer, multiple planar images of the brain were obtained and show no evidence of perfusion to the cerebral hemispheres on both flow and static imaging.
The perfusion abnormalities noted above are consistent with no brain activity.
Brief Hospital Course: Given the severity of the intracranial hemorrhage, the patient was admitted to the Neurologic ICU for further evaluation and management.
Her exam was notable for loss of brain stem reflexes, including pupillary, oculocephalic, corneals, and gag.
A brain scan showed no cerebral flow or activity in the brain.
