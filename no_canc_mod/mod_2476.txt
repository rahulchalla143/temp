Admission Date:  [**2140-1-18**]       Discharge Date: [**2166-2-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2102-12-24**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiac [**Doctor First Name **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 63 year-old gentleman with a known history of aortic valve disease, atrial fibrillation and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with recent worsening of congestive heart failure.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2166-1-17**] which showed severe aortic regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis, left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% with an elevated left ventricular and diastolic pressure and no significant coronary artery disease.
Aortic valve disease.
Rheumatic heart disease.
History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
History of congestive heart failure with decreased ejection fraction.
History of syncope thought to be due to arrhythmias.
Questionable Amiodarone toxicity.
LABORATORY DATA:  EKG is sinus rhythm with elevated PR interval.
The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day one for hemodynamic monitoring.
On postoperative day three electrophysiology service was consulted due to the patient's history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia as well as atrial fibrillation.
IT was decided at that time since the patient had a history of questionable Amiodarone toxicity with decreased pulmonary function, Amiodarone would not be started.
The patient will be started on Digoxin for rate control of atrial fibrillation.
The patient had episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone.
The patient also had multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia for which the patient was asymptomatic.
When the patient was examined by Neurology he was found to have no visual changes.
It was thought that the right ptosis could be due to a hematoma on the right side of his neck where his central line was placed.
He was also noted to have right finger extension abductor weakness and right ulnar sensory loss which subsequently improved.
It was felt thought to be a mild peripheral neuropathy.
The patient continued to have rhythm disturbances with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Although the patient continued to have episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as well as nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which the patient was asymptomatic.
The patient has mild ptosis of the right eye.
The patient reports improved weakness and numbness in his right hand.
Breath sounds are clear bilaterally without wheezes or rhonchi.
The wound is clean and dry, no erythema or drainage.
The patient is to continue to use his BiPAP machine for his obstructive sleep apnea as he did preoperatively.
History of atrial fibrillation.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction.
Obstructive sleep apnea requiring BIPAP.
