He was in his usual state of health on the morning of admission when he had a 15-minute period of scant hemoptysis (~2 tablespoons of blood).
He denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for CTA out of concern for PE and the likely management deciions that could ensue from the diagnosis.
CTA of the chest demonstrated bilateral pulmonary embolism.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the pt denies chest pain, shortness of breath or recurrent hemoptysis.
He denies any recent travel or illnesses.
He denies recent surgery or immobilization.
Past Medical History: - Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, type 4 ([**Hospital1 1106**] type) with GI bleeding and multiple aneurysms - multiple GI bleeds: 17 Unit bleed (rectal bleeding) in [**11-1**], tagged scan +RUQ.
treated with DDAVP and bleeding eventually  stopped.
- h/o right colectomy for ischemic right colon - s/p multiple SB resections - short bowel syndrome - h/o GERD - Gallstones - celiac artery aneurysm - bilateral club feet, with ankle surgeries - spontaneous RP bleed in [**2119**], no intervention - HTN - Left inguinal hernia repair - h/o TIA w/ temporary Left eye blindness - Bilateral carotid artery aneurysm, h/o bilateral carotid artery thrombi (most recent [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] study only shows L ICA thrombus) - s/p bilateral ankle reconstructions  Social History: No smoking, no drugs, no EtOH, works in computers.

Massive bilateral acute pulmonary embolism with no CT evidence of right heart strain.
Focal consolidation at the mediastinal aspect of right upper lobe.
This appearance is most likely related to focal atelectasis.
Unusual aneurysmal of the celiac trunk, with possible dissection of the common hepatic artery, unchanged, related to underlying connective tissue disease.
bilateral LE ultrasound: Left popliteal varix, likely related to underlying Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, containing non-occlusive thrombus, with no more central thrombus seen.
There is no change in the mediastinal contours compared to the prior study.
Right hemidiaphragm is elevated with adjacent pleural thickening, findings are unchanged since [**2124-1-22**].
There is no evidence of failure as well as there is no increase in pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 42667**] is a 46yo Man with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type 4), h/o multiple lower GIB requiring transfusions, s/p R colectomy for ischemia, carotid artery aneurysms, who presented with hemoptysis and was found to have bilateral massive pulmonary emboli as well as left poplieal nonocclusive DVT.
# Pulmonary embolism: This patient did not at any time have clinical evidence of hemodynamic compromise or RV dysfunction.
There was no evidence of right heart strain on CT scan; troponin of <0.1 and BNP of 79 placed him at low risk stratification.
Per [**Known lastname 1106**] surgery ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 11805**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29316**]), the pt was not a candidate for IVC filter given the risk of erosion into the vessel wall with his underlying Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.
The patient will call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3060**] for an outpatient hematology appointment during the next 1-2 months to discuss whether he will need further work-up for etiology or prolonged anticoagulation.
The etiology of thromboembolism remained uncertain.
The patient reported a remote h/o injury to the posterior L knee resulting in significant hematoma for which he did not seek medical help.
He has not been immobilized or undergone surgery.
He does not have a history of malignancy, and he has had no recent trauma to the L leg.
[**First Name (STitle) **] for additional follow up, including ordering an echocardiogram to evaluate for right heart strain at a local hospital, as it is difficult for him to come to [**Location (un) 86**].
# HTN - His HTN was well controlled at the time of admission on metropolol XL 50mg PO BID and valsartan.
# Anxiety - the patient was kept on his usual ativan prn anxiety throughout his stay without further problem.
# chronic pain - the patient was kept on his usual percocet prn pain throughout his stay without further problem.
# gallstones - the patient was kept on his usual ursodiol throughout his stay without further problem.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for anxiety.
