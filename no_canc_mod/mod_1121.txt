Admission Date:  [**2154-10-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-10-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**] Chief Complaint: hypernatremia, change in mental status, c. diff, ARF  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 9834**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male hypertension, atrial fibrillation and multiple recent hospitalizations since [**Month (only) 547**] [**2154**] for infections who presents from Rehab with delerium, hypernatremia and acute renal failure.
The patient has been suffering from a significant decline since [**2154-4-23**] and has been admitted on numerous occassions for infections including MRSA and enterococcal bacteremia, fungemia, bacteroides prostatitis, pseudomonal UTI, obturator internis abscess and right gluteal fluid collection.
Throughout this time, per his family, he has been making slow progress at rehab and working with physical therapy.
Since diagnosis with c. diff, however, he has been showing a decline in his mental status.
He also has had an increase in his serum creatinine from a baseline of 0.8 to 3.8.
He had a CT of the abdomen performed as an outpatient on [**2154-10-10**] to reassess for intraabdominal abscess.
This showed bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter with a 4mm obstructing stone seen at the left ureterovesical junction.
Given his significant electrolyte abnormalities he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
His EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 98, norml axis, normal intervals, right bundle branch block deep TWI in III, aVF, V3-V4, unchanged from priors.

Slight interval increase in size of a spiculated mass in the left upper lobe concerning for primary lung cancer.
No significant change in additional left upper lobe noncalcified nodule and in right-sided granulomas.
New bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
New bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter with obstructing stone seen at the left ureterovesical junction, but no obvious etiology for right-sided hydronephrosis.
Marked interval improvement in bilateral hydronephrosis compared to prior exam.
Minimal to mild hydronephrosis is still present within the left and right kidneys.
Focal hypodensities present anterior to and lateral to the Foley catheter balloon, which could represent stones still present within the ureteropelvic junction, however, the pelvic ureters are not dilated to suggest a further obstruction.
There are no stones present within the kidneys or proximal ureters.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Marked diffuse soft tissue edema.
Renal US [**10-19**]: Bilateral moderately severe hydronephrosis, slightly more severe on the left than on the right.
[**10-22**]: stable mod R and small L hydro .
EKG: atrial fibrillation at a rate of 98, norml axis, normal intervals, right bundle branch block deep TWI in III, aVF, V3-V4, unchanged from priors  .
CXR [**2154-10-12**]: AP chest radiograph compared to [**2154-8-23**] shows slight increase in bibasilar opacity likely representing atelectasis.
The right CP angle is mildly blunted.
There is no pneumothorax.
The aortic arch shows atherosclerotic calcification.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo male with h/o AFib, progressive aphasia s/p G tube, multiple hospitalizations for infections, and progressive debilitation since [**4-30**], initially admitted from [**Hospital 100**] rehab on [**10-12**] to ICU for delerium, acute renal failure, and hypernatremia.
Got IVFs for dehydration and Na improved.
However, Creat continued to rise and since recent CT scan [**10-10**] had shown new b/l hydronephrosis and possible L UVJ stone, urology was consulted.
Alongside this, his urine cx persistantly were positive for klebsiella and thus urology was reccommending PCN for decompression.
Repeat renal US showed worsening hydro and bladder scan had >1L urine, thus urology once again adjusted foley and placed larger catheter with larger baloon to hold in place.
Per urology, sill some concern for obstructing stone since L hydro has previously failed to completely resolved.
Acute renal failure, likely postobstructive ATN.
Anemia: [**2-23**] ACD and Fe def, no evidence of bleeding -daily Fe supp, hgb stable in 7-8s, will t/f if <7 .
The right gluteal fluid collection has decreased in size on CT scan since his previous imaging study.
Abnormal CT scan: ?RUL spiculated mass with satellite lesion suspicious for cancer.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 169**] [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypernatremia from dehydration Acute renal failure from volume depletion and obstruction Hydronephrosis from malpositioned foley catheter Mental status changes C-Diff Diarrhea Debilitation   Discharge Condition: Improved, stable.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] Please repeat Renal US in 2weeks Please do not manipulate foley and he should follow up with urology for replacement and adjustments, especially if ultrasound shows worsening hydronephrosis Please have patietn follow up in 2 weeks with PCP,[**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**].
If he continues to have diarrhea after PO Vanc is completed, restart it and continue for 1month, then ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] to direct afterwards   Followup Instructions: Please call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1407**] for follow up in 1-2weeks.
