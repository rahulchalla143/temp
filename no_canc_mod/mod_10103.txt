She appeared confused and received naloxone with no improvement.
During ED course, she apparently became increasingly confused and agitated and was intubated for combativeness and "airway protection".
She reportedly had an episode of bradycardia to the 30s.
MRI appears to shows severe biparietal occipital and cerebellar T2 FLAIR bright lesions and tonsillar herniation.

No DWI restriction.
Mild leptomeningeal enhancement in posterior brain.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo female with history of severe COPD, Hep C, IVDU, and recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-4-29**] for COPD was re-admitted from the ED on [**2186-4-30**] with headache, altered mental status, and blurred vision, now with MRI suggesting PRES related to Methylprednisolone-induced HTN, similar to prior episode.
1) PRLES: Posterior Reversible Leucoencephalopathy Syndrome Patient had initially been admitted to the MICU service where concern was for infectious encephalitis vs. meningitis.
No DWI restriction.
There was evidence for descending cerebellar tonsillar herniation with peri mesencephalic effacement.
In the ICU pt demonstrated widely labile BP's and tachycardia.
This was thought secondary to opiate withdrawal (on methadone).
Methadone was restarted and pt became hypotensive to SBP's 90's requiring brief period on neosynephrine.
Her neurologic exam improved markedly with only persistent hyperreflexia and upgoing toes.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] pharmacologic action of the corticosteroids may have been prolonged in the setting of the patient's Hep C infection, though LFT's were only mildly elevated.
She was started on Keppra given her history of seizure during her prior episode and she should [**Last Name (un) 7387**] on 500 [**Hospital1 **] until f/u in neuro clinic.
2) Right ICA aneurysm- Aneurysm at the junction of the cavernous and supraclinoid portions of the right internal carotid artery measures 6 x 4 mm on axial views with MRI.
Prednisone was held given probable etiology for hypertensive crisis.
4) Opioid [**Name (NI) 46887**] Pt was on 60 mg of Methadone at home but this was decreased to 40mg daily in the ICU due to blood pressure issues, and she tolerated that dose well with no symptoms of withdrawal so we have discharged her on that diminished dose after discussion with her.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Posterior Reversible Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome   Discharge Condition: neurologically intact, mild headache   Discharge Instructions: You developed Posterior Reversible Leukoencephaly Syndrome from high blood pressure due to high-dose steroids given for your COPD exacerbation.
You should call your PCP or present to the nearest Emergency Department if you have any worsening of your symptoms or new concerning symptoms such as severe headache, visual changes, imbalance.
