He had noticed increasing lower extremity edema over the previous few months.
LMCA and LCx had no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
RCA was a large dominant vessel, with a 90% stenosis in the PDA branch.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severe pulmonary hypertension, with markedly elevated filling pressures and low cardiac output.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20 percent) secondary to severe global hypokinesis with some relative preservation of the basal and midventricular segments of the inferior and posterior walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Overall improved degree of failure compared to [**2177-9-14**].
LE A-gram [**2177-11-21**] IMPRESSION: 1) Aortogram with right lower extremity runoff performed.
2) High grade right common femoral and proximal superficial femoral artery stenosis.
3) Distal superficial femoral artery stenosis.
4) Proximal peroneal reconstitution as the sole runoff with reconstitution of the anterior and posterior tibials at the ankle.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include septal akinesis, apical akinesis, lateral hypokinesis/akinesis, and inferior hypokinesis/akinesis; the basal inferior segment contracts best.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Ventricular systolic function appears similar.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) [**Year (4 digits) **]: He was admiited to the surgical service and worked up for peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] catheterization due to ischemic lower extremities, with necrotic toes on the right foot.
He underwent lower extremity angiography which revealed proximal superficial femoral artery stenosis, and distal superficial femoral artery stenosis.
However, due to subsequent fluid overload and renal failure from the contrast dye, no further procedures were performed.
2) Pump - Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed acute decomensated heart failure with renal failure from the contrast used for the angiogram.
He had increasing respiratory distress and changes in mental status consistent with decreased cardiac output from worsening CHF.
He failed to respond to lasix and was intubated for respiratory distress the morning of [**11-24**].
After this, he became hypotensive with SBP to the 80's.
He received fluid and the CHF service was consulted, who felt that the hypotension was secondary to the propofol and CHF.
2) CAD - The patient had an anterior [**Hospital1 **] with cardiac catheterization and Cypher stenting in [**9-17**].
His troponins were elevated to 0.25 during hospitalization which were likely due to renal failure.
4) ID - The patient was put on empiric abx by [**Date Range 1106**] surgery, but these were discontinued as the patient was afebrile during hospitalization.
5) DM - The patient was maintained on regular and sliding scale insulin.
This was attributed to a low flow state from decreased cardiac output.
