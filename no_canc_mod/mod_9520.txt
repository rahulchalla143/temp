The patient has also had nausea and vomiting which has also lasted about three to four days, although the patient is not the best historian.
The pain is not worse with food and currently she has no nausea.
She does complain of some leg pain also.
She has not passed any stool since the day prior to presentation at which time she says she had a somewhat firm bowel movement.
The patient also denies chest pain and shortness of breath.

Hypertension 2.
Hypothyroidism 3.
Abdominal abscess ?
Alphagan 0.15% one drop each eye tid  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
It is somewhat distended, but no peritoneal signs.
Mild to moderately tender, non localizing.
PERTINENT X-RAYS IN EMERGENCY ROOM:  She received a KUB which showed findings suggestive of an earlier partial small bowel obstruction.
She also received a CT which showed complete small bowel obstruction with a transition point appearing to be in the right lower quadrant.
There is a small amount of free fluid within the abdomen, but no masses or lesions identified.
There were also diverticula throughout the colon without evidence of diverticulitis.
[**Hospital 1749**] HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the morning of [**2155-11-19**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room at which time she underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection.
She had minimal blood loss.
Pathology shows a segment of ileum with focal mucosal hemorrhage and serosal changes consistent with adhesions.
She was placed on intravenous metoprolol and hydralazine prn for high blood pressure and she was also having troponins checked to rule out for a possible myocardial infarction.
These troponins never raised around 1.7 and the level of 2 at which we consider a myocardial infarction has occurred.
Her pupils were 2 mm and nonreactive.
The head CT showed no blood or mass effect.
The patient received an EEG with only mild diffuse slowing and anything remarkable.
Neurology's recommendations were to obtain an MRI to better evaluate the posterior circulation which was also done which showed no evidence of occlusion in any of the major intracranial vessels or stenosis.
Over the next day, the patient was slowly regaining her consciousness and was extubated and she soon returned to her baseline most likely without any focal deficits.
Neurology's final recommendations for her becoming acutely somnolent in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and with a negative work up felt that it was possible that the combination of recent surgery and possible pain ............... for encephalopathic picture although it was unusual for this to occur as acute as it did.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Small bowel obstruction, status post exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
