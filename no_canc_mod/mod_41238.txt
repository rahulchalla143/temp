spanish speaking female with a history of panhypopituitarism, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary artery, obesity-hypoventilation, and diastolic heart failure who presented from home with hypotension and lethargy.
Per notes, she came in with HA and lethargy initially, but was found to be hypotensive and febrile and eventually developed hypercarbic respiratory distress requiring intubation and transfer to the unit.
Pt has had multiple hospitalizations, most recently [**Date range (1) **] ([**1-5**] prior to that), for hypercarbic respiratory failure complicated by hypotension, often in the setting of fever without definite source of infection.
Recently admit for hypercarbic respiratory failure felt to be d/t progression of obstructive sleep apnea and hypoventilation syndrome.
Also was hypotensive transiently, felt to be d/t hypoadrenalism, volume depletion, and propofol during intubation.
Also had E.coli UTI resistent to cipro and was treated with CTX.
In setting of hypotension and suspected infection, concern was for early sepsis.
