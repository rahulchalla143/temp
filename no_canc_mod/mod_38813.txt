She was hospitalized for CHF 4 years ago when the diagnosis was revealed.
Interestingly her last echocardiogram in [**2160-11-13**] showed moderate to severe aortic stenosis with mild to moderate aortic insufficiency and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, however, her cardiac catheterization revealed mild aortic stenosis and severe mitral regurgitation.
