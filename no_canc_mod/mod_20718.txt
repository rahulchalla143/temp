The patient presented to the outside hospital one day prior to admission with fevers by report, lethargy which was noted at her nursing home.
The patient also was complaining of diffuse myalgias.
She had no emesis.
No upper respiratory symptoms.
No complaints of headache.
At [**Hospital **] Hospital, the patient was diagnosed with urosepsis from the nephrolithiasis.
The patient was started on IV antibiotics with Oxacillin, gentamicin, and Flagyl to treat a Proteus urosepsis.
Recurrent urinary tract infections.
Question of coronary artery disease.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother passed away from diabetes mellitus and uterine cancer.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted.
Abdomen:  Diffusely tender, increased tenderness in the right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant.
Extremities:  There was 2+ pitting edema to the midcalf bilaterally as well as in the arms bilaterally.
The urinalysis was notable for [**5-4**] red blood cells, greater than 50 white blood cells, no epithelials, many bacteria, a pH of 9, 30 protein, positive for nitrate, and large leukocyte esterase.
The CT of the abdomen at the outside hospital showed a large staghorn calculi at the right ureteropelvic junction with resultant right hydronephrosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 53-year-old female with advanced multiple sclerosis was initially admitted to the Medical Service for management of her urosepsis and percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement.
Post the percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement in the right kidney, the patient was noted to become more tachycardiac as well as to have episodes of hypotension with her systolic blood pressure dropping to the 80s, requiring fluid rescuciation.
Blood cultures confirmed a proteus and pseudomonas bacteremia, the former with multidrug resistance.

MRCP was suggested to better evaluate the liver but was impossible due to metal ureteral stents.
Urosepsis with Proteus and Pseudomonas bacteremia.
