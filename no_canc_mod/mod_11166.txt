Admission Date:  [**2163-1-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2163-1-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2132-10-6**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 30-year-old gentleman with a history of autoimmune chronic acute hepatitis with cirrhosis with a recent admission to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for increased bilateral lower extremity edema.
During the admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 42226**] became progressively more lethargic with ammonia increasing to 63, CO2 decreasing to 14, and white blood cell count increasing to 21.
A Pulmonary consultation was obtained, and an abdominal computed tomography revealed bilateral airspace disease with significant effusions.
Chronic active autoimmune hepatitis with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2161-11-9**] revealing varices, gastritis, and encephalopathy.
Pneumonia times three.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed scleral icterus.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary examination revealed diffuse upper airway rhonchi.
Abdominal examination revealed a soft and distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds.
Microbiology of [**1-15**] revealed stool was negative for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Escherichia coli.
Sputum Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on [**1-18**] was negative urine.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 65% with left ventricular hypertrophy.
A computed tomography of the abdomen revealed perihepatic ascites with positive dilated umbilical veins, bilateral airspace disease in the lungs, and positive bowel wall thickening.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and was intubated subsequently for noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and impending respiratory failure.
The patient was followed closely by the Hepatology Service, but it was felt that the patient had a very poor prognosis and was thought to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
He had worsening mental status, febrile episodes, and worsening hypotension.
The patient continued to be coagulopathic secondary to liver dysfunction.
The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells and vitamin K on numerous occasions without resolution of his coagulopathy.
The Hepatology Service deemed that the patient was not a candidate for a liver transplant and advocated less aggressive measures given his progressively deteriorating condition; including his worsening encephalopathy.
The patient continued to be hyponatremic throughout his hospital stay; which was thought to be secondary to volume retention, and the patient could not be volume restricted secondary to low blood pressures.
The patient was given bicarbonate 150 mEq over four to five hours to compensate for his metabolic acidosis, and Amphojel was administered (per the Renal Service recommendations) for his hyperphosphatemia.
The patient became asystolic without any measurable blood pressure at 4:55 p.m.
There was no audible heart beat or breath sounds.
The patient was not responsive to sternal rub or pinprick.
