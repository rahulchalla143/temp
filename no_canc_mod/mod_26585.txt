TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.  CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is subarachnoid hemorrhage within the posterior right temporal lobe, right occipital lobe, and within the frontal lobes bilaterally.
There is no evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage.
No extra-axial fluid collections are identified.
The ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is soft tissue swelling and subgaleal hematoma overlying the left frontal region.
No definite fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION: There is bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, as described above.
There is soft tissue swelling over the left frontal region.
Note added at attending review: Some of the findings in the left frontal lobe and right parieto-occipital area may also represent hemorrhagic contusion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval interval change  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 56 year old woman with SAH s/p fall, stable clinical exam REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval interval change CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage status post fall with stable clinical exam, evaluate for interval change.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.  CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage layering within a sulcus in the left frontal lobe appears slightly decreased in extent, since the examination of [**7-4**].
Additional foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage within the sulci of the right and left frontal lobes and right temporal and occipital lobes demonstrate near resolution in the interval.
There is no evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or mass effect.
A left frontal subgaleal hematoma is decreased in size in the interval.
Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of fracture.
IMPRESSION: Regression in extent of subarachnoid hemorrhage, with near resolution of blood products relating to the right cerebral hemisphere, and with slightly decreased left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Sinus rhythm.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
RIGHT ELBOW: There is a joint effusion.
There is a minimally displaced fracture seen of the radial head, best seen on the oblique view.
Intraarticular extension of the radial head fracture is present.
LEFT WRIST: There is a markedly impacted fracture of the distal radius.
There are no definite signs for intraarticular extension.
There is also positive ulnar variance secondary to the impaction.
Radial head fracture with elbow joint effusion.
Impacted fracture of the distal radius with extreme dorsal angulation of the radial articular surface.
Orthopedics and Neurosurgery were consulted because of her injuries.
Her Orthopedic injuries were nonoperative; the left radial head fracture was reduced and splinted; she continues to have considerable swelling but with intact sensation in her LUE.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 486**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Fall Bifrontal SAH Right occipital contusion Left distal radial fracture Right radial head fracture   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Return to the emergency room if you develop severe headaches, dizziness, visual disturbances, fevers, nausea/vomiting, increased pain swelling, numbness of either extremity and/or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
Inform the office that you will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
