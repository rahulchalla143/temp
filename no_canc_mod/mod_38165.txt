Subsequently at rehab she developed stridor, cough and worsening dyspnea on exertion.
She was found to have a full tracheal stenosis measuring 3-4 cm.
She did have some distal malacia most notably in the bronchi.

HEENT: neck w/ incisional erythema and swelling below surgical incision.
neuro: intact   Pertinent Results: CXR [**5-25**] Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
There is enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
Multiple small subsegmental atelectasis and linear atelectasis are in the right upper and lower lobes and in the posterior segment left lower lobe.
If any there is a small right pleural effusion.
Left subcutaneous emphysema in the neck is better seen in prior CT neck from [**5-23**].
barium swallow [**5-23**] There is marked subcutaneous emphysema seen in the left side of the neck and supraclavicular soft tissues on the scout image.
Barium passes freely through the esophagus, with no evidence of a leak.
There is no significant retention in the valleculae or piriform sinuses.
No structural abnormalities are noted in the region of the pharynx and upper esophagus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of esophageal perforation as discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4129**] on the day of the study.
Marked improvement in subcutaneous emphysema along the left neck.
Interval development of soft tissue density along the anterior midline soft tissues of the lower neck, which may represent dense secretions versus inflammatory changes.
No simple fluid collection or region of abnormal enhancement is seen to suggest abscess formation.
Interval partial resolution of increased attenuation along the paratracheal fat in the superior mediastinum.
Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes, right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, and reticular/peribronchial opacities in the right upper lobe, unchanged.
Tiny 5mm hypodense nodule in the left lobe of thyroid, not adequately assessed.
OR course uneventful.

Pain controlled w/ PCA.
POD#3 Transfused PRBC for Post op anemia and hypotension.
Echo was done and revealed EF 25% d/t cardiomyopthy- acute on chronic heart failure.
POD# 4 incisional erythema was noted, low grade temp and WBC increased to 14- IV vanco was started.
POD#5 wound remained erythematous and mild crepitus was noted.
POD#6 increased crepitus noted and neck CT and barium swallow done to eval for fluid collection in the neck and possible esophageal leak.
POD#9 wound erythema improved.
POD#10 neck wound opened - minimal amt of serosang drainage.
POD#11 d/c'd w/ [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes and IV vanco, po cipro and flagyl.
