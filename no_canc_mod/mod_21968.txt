Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cerebral Angiogram   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 49 year old RH woman with a history of NSCLC diagnosed in [**2140**] and resected (LUL) as well, now presenting on transfer from an OSH ICU with a possible diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis.
She presented to the OSH on [**2144-12-27**] complaining of a headache and numbness/tingling in the hands.
She was admitted and by the next day had developed a prominent left facial droop and hemi-paresis.
An MRI was done that showed multiple strokes "mostly in the right hemisphere, but involving the left hemisphere as well."
She underwent a TEE which by report did not show any evidence of a cardio-embolic source of her stroke.
She also underwent a cerebral angiogram which again was suggestive of a cerebral angiitis.
Her laboratory values there showed a thrombocytosis (peak = 681), an ESR of 17, negative [**Doctor First Name **], and unrevealing hypercoagulable workup.

The findings are suggestive of acute infarcts.
There is also an infarct in the right posterior temporal region.
There is no evidence of blood products within the infarct.
No mass effect or hydrocephalus is seen.
EEG12/11:This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of  intermittent bursts of high amplitude delta frequency slowing that were generalized.
In addition, occasional mixed delta and theta frequency slowing was seen over the right anterior quadrant.
No epileptiform abnormalities were seen.
No definite evidence for recurrence or occult malignancy.
Nodular pleural thickening along the left hemithorax, while nonspecific, also likely represents scarring.
Redemonstration of diffuse ground glass opacities in the right lung of uncertain etiology.
More pronounced areas of ground glass opacity are appreciated in the right base which were not imaged on the prior study.
This again may reflect smoking-related lung disease, pneumonitis, or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Nonspecific pleural-based nodules in the right lung.
Brief Hospital Course: She was initially admitted to the MICU, but subsequently transferred to the Neuro-ICU for close further workup for her multiple, bilateral strokes.
MRI/MRA was repeated (previously done at outside hospital) and showed multiple areas of restricted diffusion in both parietal-occipital regions, both frontal regions, and also along the deep watershed distributions of both hemispheres.
There is also an infarct in the right posterior temporal region.
EEG was done and showed no evidence of epileptiform activity, but did reveal bursts of generalized slowing.
LP was done to screen for vasculitis and showed no pleocytosis, glucose and protein were normal, CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells, and CSF ACE level and CSF lyme are still pending at time of discharge.
She was started on high dose steroids, Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd for presumed vasculitis.
On [**1-4**], she underwent cerebral angiogram which was consistent with vasculitis.
Given the characteristic appearance of her angiogram for CNS angiitis and her response to treatment, it was felt that the most likely diagnosis was CNS angiitis.
Brain biopsy was not done since she had been treated with steroids for 5 days and therefore the procedure would be low yield and would not likely change the course of treatment.
Prior to starting Cytoxan, she had a CT of chest/abd/pelvis to screen for occult malignancy or recurrence of NSCLC.
No evidence of malignancy was seen.
