Admission Date:  [**2157-3-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2157-4-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2080-5-23**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**] CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension and bradycardia with electrocardiogram changes post laminectomy procedure.
The patient was initially evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] for progressive calf pain with ambulation and was noted to have severe spinal stenosis at L3-L4-L5 and as such laminectomy was undertaken.
Immediately, postoperatively, the patient became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s and bradycardic with a pulse in the 40s with lateral electrocardiogram changes.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2137**] with cardiac catheterization in [**2137**] and [**2151**].
Persantine thallium in [**2156-2-5**] reportedly negative for reversible defects with an ejection fraction of 53%, however, mild inferior thinning was noted.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Bilateral carotid stenosis.
Hernia repair in [**2151**], now with recurrent abdominal hernia.
Spinal stenosis as noted in the history of present illness.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has a sensitivity to opiates which cause severe confusion.
He is a pleasant elderly appearing man in no acute distress.
Oropharynx was clear without erythema.
His neck was supple, no lymphadenopathy.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur.
His abdomen was soft, nontender with notable abdominal hernia.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 54 and axis of 100, intervals of 164, 110, [**Street Address(2) 98150**] depressions in II, III and aVF and new ST depressions in V4 through V6 when compared to previous tracing of [**2157-3-21**].
Cardiac:  The patient was initially admitted to the Medical Service after he was noted to have electrocardiogram changes in the setting of hypotension and bradycardia.
His electrocardiogram changes resolved with normalization of his blood pressure.
The majority of his CK leak was believed secondary to his surgery.
On [**2157-3-28**], the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit secondary to difficulty in controlling hypertension and started on intravenous nitrates at that time.
He was again noted to have lateral electrocardiogram depressions, now in the setting of hypertension and heartburn.
The catheterization showed native two vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to D1 grafts.
No significant lesions were noted.
Decision was made to medically manage his hypertension and as such his beta-blocker was increased and an ACE inhibitor was initiated.
Infectious Disease:  The patient had an acute elevation in his white blood cell count to 23.1 with a possible left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray on the day after his laminectomy.
He was pancultured and given his recent decreased level of consciousness, and recent surgery, the decision was made to give broad spectrum antibiotics.
Coverage with vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover a possible aspiration pneumonia or infection at the site of surgery.
As it became clear that he did not have a wound infection and the blood cultures returned without growth, the vancomycin was discontinued.
Renal:  The patient has known chronic renal insufficiency believed secondary to his diabetes and hypertension; baseline creatinine is approximately 1.3.
Through the episode of postoperative hypotension described above, the patient went into ATN with muddy brown casts on his urine.
He also had a mild elevation in creatinine after receiving the dye load of cardiac catheterization.
Nasogastric lavage revealed coffee grounds.
On [**2157-3-29**] esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a single nonbleeding duodenal ulceration.
His epidural was immediately discontinued with gradual clearing of his mental status.
It is believed that he had an acute delirium in the setting of narcotic use, hospital infection, recent myocardial infarction, renal dysfunction and possibly hypoxic brain injury in the setting of severe hypotension and bradycardia.
By time of discharge, the patient was close to his baseline mental status.
Spinal stenosis, status post L3-L4-L5 laminectomy.
Status post demand induced ischemia with myocardial infarction.
Acute on chronic renal failure, resolving.
Aspiration pneumonia.
