She also told her providers in the primary care clinic that she has been vomiting and having abdominal pain and urinary frequency.
Exam was notable for vital signs as above, cool extremities and tenderness over LLQ and RLQ over her transplanted kidney.
She was sent to the ED to evaluate for an intra-abdominal, genitourinary, or respiratory source of SIRS/sepsis.
Exam notable for rigoring, tachycardia, 2/6 systolic murmur, +RLQ TTP without rebound tenderness or guarding.
There was no perinephric stranding or abscess.
Ultrasound of the transplanted kidney showed increased resistive indices but no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collections.
She was given 1g each of vancomycin, cefepime, and acetaminophen.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient had a low-grade fever to 100.2.
She says she is feeling much better than earlier, and her shaking and chills have stopped.
She denies ever having had a cough or dyspnea.
Denies urinary frequency, polyuria, or difficulty voiding.
Denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.

No rebound tenderness or guarding.

Stable chest x-ray exam  Renal U/S: [**10-5**] No evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
Increased resistive indices since prior exam in [**Month (only) 216**], correlate with renal function.
No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis to explain patient's fevers, within the limits of this non-contrast enhanced technique.
Tip of the Foley catheter within the distal ureter of the transplanted kidney causing mild hydroureteronephrosis.
No perinephric collections or masses.
No evidence for abscess.
Fecal loading in the rectum without bowel obstruction   Brief Hospital Course: *Please note that pt left against medical advice* .
Sepsis secondary to ecoli bacteremia: On presentation, meet SIRS criteria with fevers, tachycardia and mild bandemia from suspected infectious source especially given immunosuppression.
To evaluate for etiology, CXR and CT scan of abdomen was performed with no apparent abnormality besides stool impaction in the rectum.
Urinalysis did have minimal blood and white blood cells, but culture returned negative.
Stool cx returned positive for cdiff and patient was started on flagyl.
Blood cx from [**10-5**] grew pansensitive ecoli and antibiotics were subsequently narrowed to ciprofloxacin (and flagyl).
The most likely source of ecoli bacteremia was thought to be translocation from gut in setting of mild colitis.
With antibiotic therapy, she defervesced, tachycardia resolved, and subjective complaints of chills improved.
Surveillance blood cx from [**10-6**] were negative for 48 hrs, pt was continued on cipro/flagyl but developed leukopenia and flagyl was discontinued (bc can contribute to leukopenia) and changed to PO vancomycin.
At time of discharge, pt was abebrile >72 hrs, had no diarrhea, no abd pain, no N/V.
Most likely leukopenia was due to recent initiation of flagyl, and should improve on cipro/vanco regimen.
ESRD s/p transplant: History of lupus nephritis s/p renal transplant on cellcept, tacrolimus and prednisone.
Etiology of developping renal insufficiency is unclear: CT scan with no evidence of obstruction, urinalysis without active sediment to suggest recurrent lupus nephritis.
The patient may have chronic volume depletion, she is on bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] which may artifactually increase creatinine.
Antiphospholipid syndrome:  on longterm anticoagulation with warfarin for history of APLS (Anticardiolipin Ab's showing elevated IgG and normal IgM in [**3-17**] and [**7-17**]) with multiple prior thrombotic occlusions of dialysis fistula.
Last [**Hospital1 18**] rheumatology clinic visit [**1-20**], documenting history of lupus nephritis and AVN of ankles  with last documented [**Doctor First Name **] positive 1:160 in [**2169**], though dsDNA Ab's have been negative when checked since [**2171**].
No findings on history or physical consistent with lupus flair.
Hypertension: Pt has history of hypertension treated with metoprolol only, with past systolic blood pressure measurements documented in the 110-140 range, per OMR.
Hyponatremia: Mild, without alterations in mental status.
Likely poor PO intake over past days-weeks would suggest hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Disp:*100 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: E coli bacteremia C diff .
Secondary: SLE Antiphospholipid antibody s/p renal transplant   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with fevers and chills.
You were found to have bacteria from your blood (E. coli) which likely came from your bowel tract.
You have an infection in your bowels called C diff which can be contracted while on immunosuppression and during hospitalizations.
