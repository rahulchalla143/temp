Over the past one and a half months his legs would given out under him, no LOC/syncope or other signs.
Because of this weakness he now uses a walker, weakness in the buttock.
No numbness/tingling/bowel/bladder problems.
Baseline DOE with 20-30 ft. Had a cough today and fever.
A neuro consult was obtained who reccomended an MRI, however pt was too large, in order to r/o an epidural abscess.
He did recieved a CT spine/chest which showed a PNA and r/o PE.
For CT scan he got bicarb and mucomyst.

No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Non-contrast head CT scan: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
Hypodensity in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres is seen suggesting chronic microvascular ischemia.
Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
No definite enhancing lesions identified, however at best CT is a low sensitivity study and epidural abscess cannot be excluded on this study.
MRI is more sensitive in evaluation for epidural abscess.
Right lung consolidation concerning for pneumonia, better assessed on dedicated chest CT of the same day.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, possibly reactive.
Timing of contrast bolus is not adequate for evaluation for potential leak.
Coronary artery calcifications noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Pneumonia: Though initially admitted with concern for weakness, it seemed that the patient had a right lower lobe pneumonia in addition.
The cause is likely community acquired as he did not have signs of aspiration on evaluation.
He has increased white count and concerning CXR findings for RLL pneumonia.
Therefore, will continue nebs, antibiotics for community/aspiration pneumonia (levofloxacin/metronidazole).
Lower extremity weakness: Initial description was concerning for disc herniation or epidural abscess and he was evluated by neurology.
However his symptoms improved very rapidly and a WBC scan was negative.
Given these, an epidural abscess was ruled out.
The patient's strength improved with the improvement in his pneumonia and with diuresis (decrease in LE edema) making deconditioning a possible cause.
Acute on chronic CRI: Appears to have a baseline around 2 that was initially elevated but improved during his hospital course.
Causes include medication related, progression of diabetic neprhopathy, or IV contrast, though initially thought seconary to dehydration.
Diabetes mellitus: He was continued on his home NPH and SS insulin, have decreased dosages as he had episodes of hypoglycemia (likely secondary to his decreased intake in the hospital).
Have discussed having smaller intake and need to have tight blood sugar control.
Coronary artery disease:He was continued outpt meds,initially he had an elevated tropinin but in the setting of RF, CK/MB normal.
No symptoms of chest pain or significant ECG changes.
HTN: Was restarted on lisinopril and changed to metoprolol given poor renal function  LE edema: Was diuresed with lasix and had improvement in edema with simultaneous improvment in renal function.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 6136**] Home Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia, community acquired Lower extremity edema Secondary COPD Restrictive lung disease Spinal stenosis   Discharge Condition: Improved strength, no oxygen requirement  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with weakness and pneumonia.
