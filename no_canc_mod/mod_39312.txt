Patient was in her normal state of health until this am when she developed acute onset chest pressure that awoke her from sleep at 6am.
Describes retrosternal chest pressure accompanied by tachycardia and headache.
Patient given ASA 325mg and SLN x 3 which brought pain from [**8-26**] to [**3-26**] but also caused hypotension to SBP of 74.
EKG showed old LBBB with no other evident ST changes, CXR wnl.
Due to uniterpretable EKG in the setting of elevated cardiac enzymes, patient taking emergently to cardiac catheterization.
Catheterization showed diffuse atherosclerosis with likely acute occlusion of left circumflex OM2, and significant stenoses in distal LAD and Diag 1.
Angioplasty of OM2 branch was complicated by dissection (no evidence of perforation) and attemts to stent thrombosed area were aborted.
Following catheterization, patient had residual [**2-26**] chest discomfort with unchanged EKG.
Thorough evaluation revealed renal artery stenosis with normal urinary metanephrines and aldosterone.
She is currently followed by a nephrologist with no planned intervention.
She previously tolerated atorvostatin but when she was changed to simvastatin for insurance purposes, she developed dark urine.
Otherwise, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

Left bundle-branch block.
Right infrahilar/perihilar opacity most likely relates to slight prominence of the vasculature, although an underlying minimal consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.

Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and needed a cardiac catheterization to assess your heart arteries for blockages.
One artery was thought to have caused the heart attack and was opened with a balloon.
There was a small tear called a dissection that has not caused any complications.
You had some chest pain after the procedure and a medicine called isosorbide mononitrate was started to prevent more chest pain.
Start Isosorbide mononitrate to prevent chest pain.
Start nitroglycerin under your tongue if you have chest pain similar to the pain during your heart attack.
You can take up to 2 tablets 5 minutes apart but please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] right away if you have any chest pain and take nitroglycerin.
Call 911 if you take two nitroglycerin tablets and you still have chest pain.
Start taking Plavix to prevent blood clot formation in your coronary arteries 5.
