Per d/c summary of OSH, patient was in good health until earlier this summer when she had an acute GIB and hct drop to 23.
At that time, she was found to have ascites and liver failure.
The patient was then seen in the office and was noted to have cellulitis on the dorsum of the first metatsarsal head.
She was noted to have marked ascites, edema, LFT abnormalities and was also worked up at this time.
On the first day of her hospitalization, her genetic test for hemochromatosis was positive and was homozygous for C282Y.
She went home but still had a low hct and was to begin iron chelation therapy.
Source of bacteremia unclear.
She subsequently dropped her SBP and was transferred to the ICU with a drop in her UOP.
Due to ongoing coagulopathy and anemia, has recieived at least 3 PRBCs, 3 FFP, 1 plt.
Breathing is OK. No pain anywhere but just doesn't want to talk anymore.
Liver cirrhosis from hemochromatosis 2.
Duodenal ulcer in early [**8-16**].
Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: PE: VS T 97.9 ax HR 95 BP 99/57 RR 20 93% 4L NC GEN: chronically ill, disheveled, moaning, alert to place, slightly jaundiced, diffusely tender and sensitive to palpation  HEENT: PERRL, Icteric sclera, o/p with evidence of dried blood on lips Neck: R IJ in place Chest: bruising on chest, no spiders RRR S1S2 no mrg LUNGs: Clear anteriorly (limited exam) ABD: distended, + ascites, no HSM palpated, slightly tender EXT: [**2-16**]+ pitting edema, left first metatarsal with evidence of incision and suturing, no erythema or drainage, heel ulcer on right with some serous drainage.
echo IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
Mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Heterogeneous hepatic echo texture, consistent with the patient's given history of hemachromatosis.
No biliary dilatation.
Evaluation of the hepatic vasculature is markedly limited due to patient inability to tolerate the examination.
Questionable focal scar in the upper pole of the right kidney.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  58 F w/ recently diagnosed hemochromatosis and resulting cirrhosis, with OSH course c/b ARF, worsening liver failure and ascites, serratia bacteremia of unknown source.
Etiology of cirrhosis known to be from hemochromatosis, was originally transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tranplant workup, but has decompensated in the MICU, with liver failure and HRS/renal failure.
Renal failure: Differential of renal failure includes ATN from borderline hypotension, AIN (on keflex), prerenal, HRS.
-U lytes, U eos, Uosms, look at sediment, SPEP/UPEP (renal failure and anemia).
Will need at least 2 week course for bacteremia but if related to an osteo, would need longer course.
-Continue Levofloxacin, Will not double cover for now especially as patient stable and afebrile but can d/w ID in AM as serratia a resistant bacteria.
-UA/Ucx, Bld cx (surveillance and obtain OSH results), CXR -Consider echo (will likely need as part of transplant eval -Will obtain left foot x rays.
SPEP/UPEP for anemia/renal failure.
Likely related to renal failure.
Foot: Check foot films on left, will continue for possible osteomyelitis with keflex, renall dosed.
Vit K 10 mg on [**9-29**]   Discharge Medications: n/a  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory arrest Liver cirrhosis d/t hemochromatosis End stage renal disease .
