[**6-19**], the patient presented to the ED  with a severe headache.
At follow up she did "complain of stuffy nose and pain behind her right eye like an ice pick.
She states that she also has a pressure in her sinuses bilaterally."
At that point (early [**Month (only) **]) she was given a 10 day course of Augmentin, and her symptoms improved somewhat.
She did have photo- and phonophobia at that time, no muscle aches.
The headache became progressively worse.
She was evaluated in the ED and a CT head was normal except for sinusitis involving the sphenoid sinus (maxillary sinuses not in view).
The Medicine attending persuaded her to undergo an LP, which had increased WBC (Lymphocytic predominant).
She has been having night sweats, and a chronic cough.
No weightloss.
No rash or itching.
No insect bites.
No jaw claudication, but does remember scalp tenderness upon touch.
No transient visual loss.
She also noted that she would say the wrong words occasionally and that she had difficulties thinking smoothly (this morning).
About 10 years ago, she had similar headaches, fever and was diagnosed with sinusitis.
ABDOMEN: normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended EXTREMITIES: some clubbing, no cyanosis, ecchymosis, or edema  MENTAL STATUS: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect, very slow thinking.
3D-construction: poor clock, could not draw handles; did not want to proceed with copying; No Apraxia.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline, no fasciculations.
Increased tone in LE more on the R than the L. No adventitious movements, no tremor, no asterixis.

No dysmetria or pastpointing.
However, slight action tremor bilaterally in UE.
Polymorphous population of lymphocytes and monocytes   consistent with a reactive process.
In the viable lymphoid gate, CD19 positive B-cells are extremely scant (less than 1% of lymphoid gated events ) and clonality cannot be reliably assessed.
CD5 positive T cells comprise 82% of lymphoid gate.
INTERPRETATION    Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile.
B-cell clonality could not be reliably assessed due to scant numbers.
There is diffuse disc desiccation without evidence of disc bulge, spinal stenosis, or foraminal narrowing.
There is no evidence of abnormal signal within the conus or cauda and no evidence of abnormal epidural collection.
No areas of abnormal enhancement are identified on post-gadolinium images.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of epidural abscess.
Multilevel degenerative disc desiccation.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]: FINDINGS: There is increased T2 signal on the FLAIR sequence within the subdural space as well as pachymeningeal enhancement.
These findings could be due to a recent intervention such as lumbar puncture, intracranial hypotension, or meningitis.
However, there is no evidence of intraaxial enhancement.
There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
There are multiple foci of increased T2 signal within the periventricular and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres consistent with chronic microvascular infarcts.
There are no areas of significantly abnormal magnetic susceptibility.
There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral increased T2 signal within the subdural space with pachymeningeal enhancement is new from the prior examination of [**2125-8-10**].
Intracranial hypotension or meningitis could also give a similar appearance.
There is no evidence of an intraaxial enhancing lesion.
There is no acute infarct.
MRV negative  Hip x-ray: There are some mild degenerative changes with medial joint space narrowing seen bilaterally and some osteophytes, but no fractures identified.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 73 yo R-handed woman with CAD, GERD, sinusitis, and emphesema who presented with HA to the ED on [**8-9**] for a severe headache.
Her LP (63 wbc, lymphocyte predominant, high protein, low glucose, GS negative) has shown lymphocytic pleocytosis and is overall suggestive of an aseptic meningitis.
The dexamethasone was discontinued on [**8-10**] given the low suspicion for a bacterial process.
The antibiotics were discontinued after the lab results returned and were negative for bacteria and HSV.
Cytology showed a hypercellular specimen, most likely reactive.
She was also noted to have hip pain but x-ray was negative other than degenerative disease.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have any worsening headache, any fevers, chills, neck pain, change in vision, weakness, numbness, tingling, change in bowel or bladder function, change in thinking, unresponsiveness, or any other concerning symptoms.
