HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 83-year-old woman with known CAD status post angioplasty in the [**2106**], subsequently treated medically with recurrent angina.
Admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**1-17**] for cardiac catheterization, which showed three vessel disease and an EF of 45-50% with 1+ MR.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Carotid stenosis 60-80% on the right and 40-60% on the left.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  A father, who died at the age of 79 from heart disease and a brother who died in his 70s also from heart disease.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:  Showed heavily calcified coronaries.
LAD with diffuse disease, D1 with a total occlusion, left circumflex with a mid 70% lesion and a distal 70% lesion, RCA with diffuse disease.
Chest x-ray at that time showed no pneumonia, CHF with positive COPD changes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  In no acute distress.
Mucous membranes moist, no erythema.
Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy and positive bruits on the right.
Extremities:  Right is warm with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
Left is cool with unpalpable pulses, dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses.
In summary, patient had a coronary artery bypass graft x3 with a free LIMA to the acute margin, a saphenous vein graft to the distal LAD and saphenous vein graft to the OM.
The patient was noted to have short bursts of SVT versus VT, and was started on amiodarone drip, which successfully eradicated that issue.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.
Right lower extremity incisions with Steri-Strips open to air, clean and dry, small blister on the calf of the right leg with a small amount of serous drainage.
Left leg remains cool without dopplerable pulses.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with a free left internal mammary artery to the acute margin, saphenous vein graft to the distal left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.
Peripheral vascular disease.
