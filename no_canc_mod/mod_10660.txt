Admission Date:  [**2162-6-12**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2094-6-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] for workup of right-sided heart failure and evaluation for possible mitral valve replacement.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old male with an extensive cardiac history including CABG times three, mitral valve repair in [**2159**], ejection fraction 30-40%, [**2-1**]+ MR, [**3-2**]+ TR, dilated right and left atria and right ventricle, history of V tach arrest, now status post AICD placement, history of sick sinus syndrome, now status post pacer placement, pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, and chronic renal failure, who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2162-6-8**] complaining of nausea, vomiting, and increasing abdominal girth.
He was found to be hypotensive (questionable) presumably by overdiuresis and was treated with IV fluids, packed red blood cells and was briefly on pressors.
A CT of the abdomen showed abdominal ascites with pooling of IV contrast in the right heart and IVC.
Workup of liver etiology of ascites has been negative.
Paracentesis here withdrew 750 cc of transudative fluid.
Cardiac Surgery consult was placed to evaluate the patient for a possible mitral valve replacement.
The TTE was performed on [**2162-6-14**] and was mostly consistent with the TEE findings as will be described below except that the mitral regurgitation was qualified as 3+ and the tricuspid regurgitation was 4+.
The TEE was performed on [**2162-6-15**] and showed a markedly dilated right atrium, dilated right ventricle, [**12-31**]+ MR, 2+ TR, markedly dilated left atrium, severely depressed left ventricular function, and a well-seated mitral valve ring.
During that cardiac catheterization the patient was found to have elevated bilateral filling pressures.
The patient's only patent graft was found to be his LIMA to LAD and he also had a patent left main stent which is supplying his left circumflex.
Cardiac catheterization in [**11-30**], during which the patient's left main underwent rotational atherectomy and PTCA with stent placement, slowly with evidence of competitive flow, midvessel, after takeoff.
AICD placement in [**2162-4-29**] for a V tach arrest which was DC cardioverted to sinus rhythm during an admission for CHF exacerbation and hemoptysis.
The pacer placement was for sick sinus syndrome.
Chronic atrial fibrillation, ejection fraction 25-40%.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.3.
Status post right neck mass excision.
No focal neurological deficits.
No rubs or gallops.
A positive IV/VI holosystolic mitral regurgitation murmur.
HEENT:  No icterus.
Right femoral arterial line.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In addition to the above described in the history of the present illness, it should be noted that on a CAT scan performed at an outside hospital there is evidently a small mass on one of the patient's kidneys which will need further evaluation after the patient's acute episodes are resolved.
