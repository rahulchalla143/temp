Admission Date:  [**2107-6-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2107-7-5**]   Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, and subdural hematoma diagnosed in [**2104-6-24**].
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital for slurred speech and right sided weakness noted by a health aide following the patient's hemodialysis.
The patient was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for workup of confusion and fever with his history of subdural hematoma.
The CT scan showed minimal change in the patient's known subdural hematoma.
Chest x-ray, however, showed bilateral consolidation, with gram positive cocci in the sputum.
The patient was dialyzed 2.5 liters for concern of fluid overload.
Following hemodialysis, the patient became hypotensive to the 70s, tachypneic and diaphoretic with electrocardiographic changes showing diffuse ST-T wave changes.
His heart rate subsequently increased and his ST-T wave changes worsened, so his Dopamine was stopped and these changes resolved.
The patient was subsequently seen by cardiology in the Emergency Room and an echocardiogram was done, and his ischemia was felt to be consistent with demand ischemia.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four vessels in [**2101**], percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2097**].
Congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction 20% to 25%.
End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.
Subdural hematoma in [**Month (only) 216**] 200, status post drain.
Peptic ulcer disease.
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, II/VI holosystolic murmur at left lower sternal border, positive S3 which resolved over this admission.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities: Right below the knee amputation, 2+ left posterior tibialis pulse, cool, no mottling.
Neurologic examination:  Alert and oriented times three, strength 4/5 in upper extremities bilaterally, moved left lower extremity without difficulty.
Sputum from [**2107-6-29**] showed greater than 25 polymorphonuclear neutrophils and 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
Chest x-ray from [**2107-6-30**] showed bibasilar consolidation, no congestive heart failure.
The CT scan from [**2107-6-29**] showed a subacute subdural hematoma, left lateral, slightly increased since [**2104-11-10**] but no herniation and no acute hemorrhage.
Echocardiogram done in the Emergency Room showed inferior, inferolateral hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% to 25% with 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, systolic pressures of 38.
Sepsis:  The patient was admitted with sepsis presumed secondary to pneumonia.
The plan is to continue antibiotics for a 12 day course of levofloxacin and vancomycin for a chest x-ray with bibasilar consolidation and a sputum culture positive for gram positive cocci in pairs in clusters.
Hypotension:  The patient had an acute blood pressure drop following hemodialysis in the Emergency Room, requiring pressor support.
The Dopamine was stopped for demand ischemia.
The patient was subsequently changed from Neo-Synephrine to Levophed and Vasopressin for suspected sepsis as the cause of his low blood pressure.
His blood pressure has remained stable over the course of today in addition to his challenge with hemodialysis today.
Cardiac ischemia:  The patient had a positive troponin leak on admission.
An echocardiogram done in the Emergency Room, ischemia thought to be secondary to demand ischemia.
The patient was carefully bolused to maintain his blood pressure due to the fact that he is at extreme risk for congestive heart failure.
Pneumonia:  The patient had bibasilar consolidations on chest x-ray, with sputum culture positive for 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
He is being maintained on a 12 day course of levofloxacin and vancomycin considering his history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Change in mental status:  The patient was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for a change in mental status.
There was minimal further improvement in the patient's mental status following the improvement of his fever.
Discussions with the patient's family revealed that he is at his baseline, and no further management of his mental status is indicated.
shortness of breath or wheezing.
