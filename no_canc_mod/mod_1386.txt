10 days ago, he developed b/l LE edema that has gotten progressively worse until now.
Three days ago, he developed dyspnea on exertion when climbing stairs, assoc w/ 2-pillow orthopnea and PND.
He denies any recent chest pain, palpitations, headache, confusion, weakness, numbness, abd pain, or hematuria.
No recent viral syndromes or URIs.
CXR revealed evidence of cardiomegaly and pulm edema.
He responded well to lasix w/ good UOP, but diastolic BP remained elevated at 170, prompting initiation of nitroprusside gtt.
Drinks 3-4 beers a few times weekly, no h/o withdrawal symptoms, seizures or DTs.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
CV: reg s1, loud s2, + 2/6 systolic murmur radiating to axilla, no s3/s4/r Pulm:  CTA b/l w/ no crackles or wheezing Abd:  obese, +BS, soft, NTND.
Ext:  warm, 2+ DP b/l, 2+ pitting edema to knees b/l Neuro:  a/o x 3, CN 2-12 intact   Pertinent Results: [**2173-6-14**] 05:30PM   WBC-7.7 RBC-5.00 HGB-15.0 HCT-42.8 MCV-86 MCH-30.0 MCHC-35.0 RDW-14.6 [**2173-6-14**] 05:30PM   PLT COUNT-315 [**2173-6-14**] 05:30PM   CK-MB-4 proBNP-7489* [**2173-6-14**] 05:30PM   cTropnT-0.02* [**2173-6-14**] 05:30PM   ALT(SGPT)-77* AST(SGOT)-60* CK(CPK)-195* ALK PHOS-104 AMYLASE-100 TOT BILI-0.4 .
EKG demonstrated NSR at 87 bpm, nl axis, nl int, LVH w/ strain pattern, no ischemic changes.
CXR:  Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, and  particularly the left atrium accompanied by pulmonary vascular  congestion and mild pulmonary edema consistent with heart failure.
Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity dilation and severe global hypokinesis.
No left ventricular thrombus is seen.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe free wall hypokinesis.
No aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric eft ventricular hypertrophy with severe global biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, cannot exclude myocarditis; in the absence of LVH on ECG, an infiltrative process should also be considered).
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Very small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Possible abnormality on the aortic valve as described above without aortic regurgitation.
If clinically indicated a TEE would be better able to define an abnormality of the aortic valve.
Brief Hospital Course: 46-yo-man w/ cocaine abuse presents w/ LE edema and DOE likely from diastolic heart failure in the setting of cocaine use complicated by hypertensive urgency.
Hypertensive urgency:  BP 230/170 on presentation, most likely from chronic HTN exacerbated by cocaine use.
No signs of end-organ damage at present except for elevated creatinine, which is more likely a chronic problem.
His lower extremity edema improved with diuresis.
Renal Failure: creatinine on admission was 1.6 Likely acute hypertensive nephropathy plus probalbe long-standing hypertensive disease.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - hypertensive emergency - ARF - mild transaminitis likely [**2-19**] etoh and cocaine abuse - cocaine abuse - lower extremity edema improved  Discharge Condition: well  Discharge Instructions: You came in with hypertensive emergency.
Please return to the ED if you experience SOB, chest pain, fevers, chills, dizziness, decreased urine output.
