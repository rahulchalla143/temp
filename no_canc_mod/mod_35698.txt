In the ED, the patient was noted to have no fevers, chest pain or abdominal pain, but he did complain of mild chills.
EKG revealed increased prominence of previously appreciated ST elevations and a heparin drip was started per a cardiology consult.
Chest xray revealed no significant changes compared to prior studies, the findings of which were bilateral perihilar haziness and slight peritrachial cuffin, mild upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature, and a small right effusion.
Because of crescendo respiratory decline, the patient was evaluated by the ICU team who felt the patient required emergent intubation.

ST-T wave configuration suggests early repolarization pattern - clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2116-7-17**], no significant change  ECHO [**2116-7-17**] Conclusions: 1.
Inferior hypokinesis is probably present.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of [**2115-9-6**], there has been no significant change.
There is bilateral perihilar haziness and slight peribronchial cuffing.
There is also mild upper zone redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
There is possibly a small left pleural effusion.
This finding is suggestive of mild CHF.
There are no focal consolidations.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with mild CHF.
Brief Hospital Course: * Pulmonary: As discussed above, the patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED in acute respiratory distress, requiring intubation to maintain adequate oxygen saturation.
Chest xray revealed no infiltrates.
The patient's respiratory status gradually improved and he was able to be extubated without complication after 5 days of ventilator dependence.
Smoking cessation was repeatedly encouraged but the patient expressed frustration with multiple previous attempts at quitting.
* Cardiovascular: On presentation to the ED, the patient's EKG revealed more prominent ST elevations that were previously seen at baseline.
The patient continued to deny chest pain and when all cardiac markers were flat, the patient's heparin drip was discontinued.
With respect to blood pressures, the patient was noted to be hypertensive during the duration of his stay in the ICU.
* Endo: While on steroid therapy, the patient was found to have persistently elevated blood sugar levels.
