Admission Date:  [**2149-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-4-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13685**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 37 yo F w h/o endocarditis after PICC placement veg on AV, AI, stroke who presented with chest pain.
She reports that she was in her usual state of health recently,without limitation by symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain.
On the morning of admit, she awoke with "tightness" in herleft arm and shoulder which steadily progressed throughout the day.
Then around 6 pm on the day of admission she developed severe, substernal, spasm-like pain in the anterior chest with radiation to the back and presented to the ED within 2 hours.
The pain is worse lying down or sitting forward and is pleuritic in nature.
No back pain.
CTA showed no no PE or aortic dissection.
Unchanged 19 mm outpouching from the anterior portion of aortic root is most likely a pseudoaneurysm based on prior imaging.
Multifocal ground glass and peribronchovascular ground glass opacities consistent with pneumonia.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems she denies any history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Past Medical History: AORTIC VALVE INSUFFIC- Long history: - [**2142**]: Had PICC line placed for hyperemesis gravidum--> bacteremia which caused meningitis, septic emboli to kidney's and aortic valve endocardidits.
- [**7-/2144**]: SOB led to dx of aortic insufficiency.
Had st Jude valve replacement.
- [**12/2144**]: Again SOB led to echo which showed insuff + cavity adjacent to aortic valve.
There was reconstruction of the anterior mitral leaflets, aortic annulus, and proximal ascending aorta with a patch.
Post op course complicated by stroke with left sided hemiparesis (resolved throughout hospitalization), SVT.
- Spring [**2144**]: The patient was readmitted with findings suggesting a perivalvar abscess and a perivalvar leak along with partial aortic valve dehiscence.
Samples were sent no organisms and rhemu consult was obtained that was reportedly negative.
Operation complicated by perioperative MI on [**2145-4-28**] with reintubation necessary.
Emergent cardiac cath revealed high-grade stenosis at the ostium of the left main artery (?secondary to aortic wall edema) which required stenting of the left main and placement of intraaortic balloon pump, which was subsequently weaned.
STROKE with residual left hemiparesis CONDYLOMA ACUMINATUM HERNIA - INGUINA HERNIA - UMBILICAL   Social History: Lives with 2 daughters age 4 and 17.
Family History: Brother  Diabetes - Type II; Hypertension Maternal Aunt  [**Name (NI) 3730**]; Diabetes-Adult Onset Maternal Grandmother  Diabetes-Adult Onset; Mental Disorder Mother Alive Diabetes - Type II; Hypertension Grandmother had stroke at 28 years of age  Physical Exam: VS: T=97.9 BP=136/82 HR=76 RR=20 O2 sat=97% RA GENERAL: WDWN female in NAD.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
EKG:  EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm with incomplete RBBB, nonspecific ST and T wave changes.
Compared to most recent prior tracing ([**2149-2-4**]) the ST and T wave changes are more pronounced.
Compared with prior from [**2148-10-15**], there is no change.
No pulmonary embolism.
Multifocal pneumonia.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is a 1.2 x 1.0 cm pseudoaneurysm along the anterior aspect of the LV outflow tract immediately below the aortic valve.
No high-velocity flow is seen in to/out of the psuedoaneurysm (suggesting it has not ruptured).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular outflow tract pseudoaneurysm as described above without color flow Doppler evidence of rupture.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Brief Hospital Course: 37 yo woman with complicated history of aortic valve endocarditis requiring ultimately a homograft with stroke and perioperative MI requiring left main stent, with evidence of a possible pseudoaneurysm of the anterior LVOT who presents with chest pain.
# Chest Pain: The patient has a long cardiac history but no documented CAD.
The current chest pain is not associted with CE elevation and the EKG is unchanged from a seperate admission for chest pain in 10/[**2147**].
At that time it was felt that the chest pain atypical chest pain in the setting of anxiety.
The CTA done in the ED demonstrated no PE or aortic disection.
The chest pain was reduced with dilauded in the ED.
Given the negative CTA, unchanged EKG, negative cardiac enzymes, and echo that showed no change in the LVOT pseudoaneurysm and the patient had resolution of her chest pain without reoccurance with activity she was discharged home.
#PNA: The CTA reported multifocal ground glass and peribronchovascular ground glass opacities consistent with pneumonia and she was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the ED.
The patient denies cough or fever at this time but does report pleuritic chest pain.
Given the multifocal ground glass and peribronchovascular ground glass opacities a repeat chest CT as an outpatient may be warranted with outpatient evaluation by pulmonary if there is not resolution or progression of the chest CT findings.
You may need to have a repeat CT scan of your lungs and a follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist if the abnormalities on the CT do not resolve with treatment.
Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO Q8H Duration: 5 Days   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Community Acquired Pneumonia Seconday Diagnosis: Aortic Insufficiency s/p St Jude's Valve in past  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital due to chest pain and concern for cardiac origin of the pain.
However, testing showed no evidence that there was a problem in your heart or with your heart stent.
The CT scan of your lungs did show evidence of a possible infection at the base of both your left and right lungs.
YOu may need to have a repeat CT scan of your lungs and a follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist if the abnormalities on the CT do not resolve with treatment.
