CXR [**8-22**]: ======== FINDINGS: There has been no significant change in the tracheostomy tube or the left subclavian line with tip projecting over the SVC.
The heart size appears mildly enlarged.
There continues to be opacity at the left lateral lung base which may represent atelectasis, consolidation or effusion.
There is patchy area of increased opacity in the right lower medial lung as well.
Otherwise, there is no significant change.
Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory secretions.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o F w/ trach, found to have bloody secretions, fever and proteus bacteremia.
Suspected source is her urine, given her floridly positive urinalysis on admission.
However initial urine culture was contaminated, so there is no positive urine cultures to support this.
She has had no evidence of shock, remaining hemodynamically stable, with good urine output, mentation, and baseline renal function.
# Pneumonia- Left lung opacity on initial CXR.
Clinically with increased secretions from trach, diffuse ronchi on lung exam.
# Bloody secretions- Small volume blood from trach site, likely secondary to bronchitis vs tracheal irritation/inflamed granulation tissue.
No further bleeding from trach over next 48 hours and hematocrit remained stable.
Initial plan was for bronchoscopy to evaluate bleeding source, however patient refused procedure.
# CHF- She was continued on her b-blocker and lasix.
Re-started prior to discharge given h/o recent CVA.
