The pt was initially admitted on [**2-1**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for CHF exacerbation and PNA.
The pt was subsequently placed on antibiotics, resulting in an elevation in INR to approx 10 and GI bleeding requiring transfusions.
His coumadin was stopped due to his GIB, in light of his chronic afib and AVR.
Apparently pt had black stool 2 days ago, but it is now brown.
Past Medical History: - AF on coumadin - Mechanical AVR (bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis) [**2182**] - h/o GIB secondary to AVM s/p thermal therapy [**2194-10-24**] (first GIB in [**Hospital1 46**] 6 months ago) - Ascites (first noted 4 months ago) - CKD (baseline in recent months 2.2-2.6) - CHF (EF 25%) - Cirrhosis - ?clean cath prior to AVR  Social History: From [**Last Name (un) 26580**], Arabic speaking only.

Studies: [**2195-5-2**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response and occasional ventricular premature beats.
Low limb lead voltage.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Small right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo M with dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), mechanical AVR, cirrhosis thought to be secondary to right heart failure, h/o recurrent GIB mostly secondary to angioectasias of the stomach/UGI tract, who presents with persistent anemia and melena.
# GI bleed: Likely secondary to known angioectasias of the upper GI tract.
GI was consulted and performed push enteroscopy on [**5-5**] with cauterization of a gastric angioectasia.
No other source of bleeding was identified and the GI team was able to visualize to the proximal jejunum.
#Anemia: Likely secondary to slow GIB as well as chronic renal insuffiency.
# Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Known EF of 20-25% and currently is chornically volume overloaded with ascites and LE edema (right-sided failure).
The patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of 40mg lasix po BID for most of the hospitalization, however was decreased the day prior to discharge to 20mg po BID given a slight rise in serum creatinine.
Per prior cardiology notes, toprol XL was held given tachy/brady syndrome and lisinopril was held given renal insufficiency and hypotension.
However, given significant NSVT (see below) EP was consulted and toprol XL 25mg was restarted which he tolerated well without bradycardia.
# Chronic Afib: Per cardiology, pt needs to be anticoagulated given high stroke risk.
# Ventricular ectopy: Pt has frequent PVCs and NSVT (up to 40 beats) on tele.
Given significant comorbidities and high risk of peri-procedure mortality, the EP service stated that an ICD is contraindicated.

Cirrhosis NOS - Portal HTN and Ascites.
Your blood count stabilized with blood transfusions and an enteroscopy was performed with cauterization of an area in the stomach that may have been responsible for the bleeding.
It is very important that you have your coumadin level (INR) checked on Saturday, [**2195-5-16**], at your outpatient laboratory.
You will need to have this checked every 2-3 days until it is stable at the appropriate level (2.5-3.0) in order to eliminate risk for further bleeding.
