Left hepatic lobe atrophy and segmental biliary duct dilatation, with suggestion of hypodense perihilar lesion, concerning for biliary or hepatic neoplasm.
Numerous enhancing lesions are noted throughout the liver.
This can be further assessed with MRI or multiphase CT.    Brief Hospital Course: A 68 yo gentleman with progressive decline transferred from [**Location (un) 95454**] after PNA/AMS with an acute change in mental status during/after [**Location (un) **].
The patient has underlying dementia as evidenced by family & recent notes.
He was unresponsive and intubated on arrival to the MICU but improved over the first hospital day.
EEG was negative for seizure activity, but seizure was thought to be most likely cause given improvement over a day and seizure-lowering properties of lidocaine and alkalosis.
Head CT showed nothing concerning for an acute intracranial process.
The day after call-out to the medical service, the patient was found unresponsive and pulseless, ~15 minutes after having been seen well.
This was a PEA arrest, with rapid atrial fibrillation on the monitor.
Arrest was thought to be secondary to an aspiration event.
The patient was initially agitated but then became unresponsive despite no sedation.
Continuous EEG monitorring revealed no epileptiform activity.
Mental status improved over several days, and patient was able to follow commands.
However, he became intermittently quite agitated requiring anti-psychotics and eventually resumption of sedation.
He was difficult to wean from the ventilator, becoming uncomfortable after a few hours on pressure support, and it was clear that he had substantial respiratory muscle weakness.
