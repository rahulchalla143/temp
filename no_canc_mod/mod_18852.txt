ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old woman with history of aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis secondary to history of rheumatic fever who was admitted electively preop for a valve replacement.
She had been hospitalized 3 weeks prior to admission with an episode of congestive heart failure which had required her to be intubated, but had recovered from this episode.
When she presented preoperatively, she was afebrile with a pulse in the 70s, blood pressure 140s and her O2 saturation was 98% on room air.
She had a few psoriatic plaques over her joints, but otherwise she had no ecchymosis.
She had a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
She had 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema and slight erythema of the lower extremities, but she was certain it was not secondary to any cellulitis as she said it had been longstanding and unchanged.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted, the patient was admitted on [**2201-5-24**] and subsequently taken to the operating room on [**2201-5-25**] where she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm Magna Supraannular CE pericardial valve and a mitral valve replacement with a 25 mm Mosaic porcine valve.
Physical therapy saw her throughout the course of her hospitalization for active rehabilitation.
Interestingly, intraoperatively, it was noted that there was what appeared to be possibly purulent material around the aortic valve when it was excised and fluid from this was sent for gram stain.
The gram stain evidenced no microorganisms, but nonetheless, we consulted the Infectious Disease service for a question of perivalvular abscess.
She was afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically normal and her remaining hospitalization focused on diuresis.
By postoperative day 7, the patient was afebrile with a pulse that ranged between the 70s to 90s with a blood pressure in the 150s.
Her lungs had decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally with a few crackles, but she was otherwise regular.
Chest x-ray showed the presence of bilateral effusions for which she was being diuresed with Lasix.
