New large left basal ganglia bleed with midline shift.
New bilateral intraventricular hemorrhages.
New right subarachnoid bleed.
Upon reviewing these images, the size of the infarction was felt too large to consider IA tPA, given the risk of hemorrhage.
He was ruled out for an MI with 3 sets of CE and monitored on tele.
Within the first 24 hours of his admission, a repeat HCT was performed which showed a new large L basal ganglia bleed with midline shift as well as new bilateral intraventricular hemorrhages and a new right subarachnoid bleed.
