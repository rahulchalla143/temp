is a 68 year old with a history of aortic dissection s/p arch repair and fem-fem bypass, started on coumadin [**7-19**] for clot in the bypass, who presents with nausea/vomiting, and feeling off balance since friday (3 days PTA), found to have a cerebellar hemorrhage on OSH head CT.  Pt.
He had a headache in the morning that was bifrontal and achy, which resolved by the afternoon.
On ROS he denies (and his family concurs) any facial droop, diplopia, blurry vision, dysarthria, word finding or comprehension problems, dysphagia, weakness, numbness, tingling, headache, or bowel or bladder incontinence.
At OSH Head CT was performed and showed an 18 mm midline cerebellar hemorrhage.
On their exam he had a surgical non-reactive pupil on the L, reactive on the R, intact strength and sensation, intact FNF bilaterally, and moderate to severe gait ataxia.
He was evaluated by Neurosurgery, who felt he required no acute neurosurgical intervention.
Past Medical History: - aortic dissection with aortic hemiarch repair, aortic root repair, femoral to femoral bypass, and RLE fasciotomy for compartment syndrome - multiple bilateral strokes (right parietal and bilateral frontal) thought to be embolic from aortic arch repair, initially with some residual L facial droop and L hand weakness, now resolved per family and pt.
- Left ear surgery for decreased hearing - L vitreous hemorrhage, L retinal detachment s/p surgical repair   Social History: Pt is a retired machinist.

Pertinent Results: CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2131-7-30**] 9:20 PM NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Again demonstrated is a round area of increased attenuation consistent with hemorrhage which appears to displace the fourth ventricle to the right and therefore could be located within the cerebellar vermis.
The area of hemorrhage measures 1.6 x 1.7 cm which is stable to both prior comparison CT's.
No hydrocephalus is seen.
No other new areas of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
Re-demonstrated are stable foci of hypoattenuation in the frontal lobes bilaterally and in the right parietal lobe consistent with chronic lacunar infarcts.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the right maxillary sinus and ethmoid air cells.
CTA HEAD: There is no evidence of arteriovascular malformation in the area of hemorrhage or elsewhere in the brain.
No aneurysms and no areas of stenosis are identified .
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the left cavernous internal carotid artery.
IMPRESSION: 1) Stable size of hemorrhage in the posterior fossa, likely centered within the cerebellar vermis with effacement of the fourth ventricle.
No hydrocephalus.
2) Unremarkable CTA without evidence of arteriovenous malformation or aneurysms.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2131-7-30**] 4:10 PM CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a round area of hyperattenuation consistent with hemorrhage (series 2, image 8) measuring 1.6 x 1.7 cm.
There is no significant change from the exam six hours earlier, but this area is new when compared to the previous neck CT.
There is no hydrocephalus, although the fourth ventricle appears nearly completely effaced.
No other intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
There are focal small areas of hypoattenuation within the frontal lobes bilaterally and in the posterior right parietal lobe at the level of the centrum semiovale, consistent with small old infarcts.
No significant change from the recently previous head CT. No definite evidence of intraventricular extension or hydrocephalus at this time.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2131-7-31**] 8:16 PM There is minimal atelectasis at the lung bases, there are no worrisome lung lesions.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
There is no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There are multiple calcified granulomas projected over the liver surface which may be diaphragmatic versus hepatic parenchymal.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: Coarse trabecular pattern is seen in the thoracic vertebral bodies and a hemangioma is seen in the mid thoracic spine.
There is slight differential flow within the false lumen.
There is no pulmonary embolism.
Aortic dissection from the level of the aortic root with extension into the left subclavian artery and extension into the descending thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta and the celiac axis.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2131-7-31**] 9:56 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for extension or hemorrhage or evidence of hydrocephalu  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old man with midline cerebellar hemorrhage in the setting of coumadin use REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for extension or hemorrhage or evidence of hydrocephalus given mass effect on 4th on OSH CT CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 68-year-old man with midline cerebral hemorrhage in the setting of Coumadin.
Assess for interval change.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: Again demonstrated is a rounded focus of increased attenuation in the midline of the posterior fossa between the cerebral hemispheres, consistent with hemorrhage.
No other foci of intracranial hemorrhage are seen.
No evidence of interval development of hydrocephalus.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2131-8-1**] 1:17 PM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
There are no dilated small bowel loops or air-fluid levels to suggest small-bowel obstruction.
Increased density of kidneys are seen bilaterally, raising question of persistent nephrogram from contrast administration on [**7-31**], concerning for renal failure.
The thoracic aorta is increased in diameter, better evaluated on the recent CT.
No evidence of a bowel obstruction.
Persistent nephrograms bilaterally, concerning for renal failure.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a very pleasant 68 year old gentleman with history of aortic dissection s/p arch repair and fem-fem bypass, multiple embolic strokes felt to be due to the surgery, with no residual deficits per the patient prior to this admission, also hypertension, hyperlipidemia, who presented with 3 days of nausea, vomiting, and gait ataxia.
He was found to have an 18 mm hemorrhage in the cerebellar vermis with some mass effect on the 4th ventricle.
On exam his mental status testing was intact, and he was without focal weakness; he was clumsy with rapid alternating movements bilaterally (L > R), and most significantly his gait was ataxic.
The most likely etiology of his hemorrhage is due to the recent initiation of Coumadin and hypertension, however an underlying mass lesion could not be ruled out.
1) Cerebellar Hemorrhage- The patient was symptomatic for 3 days prior to presentation, and likely had already reached the peak of edema, however there was evidenc by CT for pressure on the 4th ventricle.
He did not require surgical decompression or other surgical intervention.
Repeat head CT revealed stable size of hemorrhage without significant mass effect.
Follow up MRI/MRA +/- gadolinium should take place in a few weeks to further evaluate the site of hemorrhage for possible underlying mass lesion.
2) Aortic dissection- Cardiac surgery was consulted for possible widened mediastinum by admission chest xray.
CTA revealed 1cm worsening of pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the ascending aorta with the graft.
This was considered to be an expected finding with aortic grafts and no further intervention was warranted.
He lacked any abdominal pain or other signs of bowel ischemia.
His abdominal xray was without signs of bowel obstruction.
Aggressive bowel regimen relieved his symptoms significantly.
Persistent nephrograms on abdominial xray likely incidental finding, but could related to altered vascular anatomy s/p aortic graft.
Further follow up to take place with vascular and cardiac surgery.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain, T > 100.4.
Persistent cerebellar gait ataxia.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a cerebellar hemorrhage.
Call your doctor or 911 for chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening dizziness, weakness, numbness, tingling or any other concerning symptoms.
