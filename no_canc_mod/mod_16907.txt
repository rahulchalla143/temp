Admission Date:  [**2169-12-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2170-1-11**]   Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year-old woman with known coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction times two in [**2156**] and [**2158**] who reports having occasional chest pain and pressure on exertion and at rest over the past several years, always relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin and associated with diaphoresis.
Her pain began to worsen over the holidays causing her to visit her primary care physician on [**12-28**] following an episode of substernal chest pain, which lasted ten minutes and was also relieved by two sublingual nitroglycerins at that time.
It was also associated with blurry vision and diaphoresis.
Her primary care physician referred her to [**Hospital3 **] where she ruled out for an myocardial infarction and had a stress test that was positive.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction times two in [**2156**] and [**2158**].
Lower back pain causing left lower leg numbness.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Bilateral breast fibroids.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Diovan prn for lower extremity pain.
At catheterization the patient was found to be left dominant with 70% left main occlusion, left anterior descending coronary artery had complex calcified 90% stenosis mid vessel and 90% at the origin of her major diagonal branch.
Her circumflex had a 60% stenosis at obtuse marginal one and 80% stenosis at obtuse marginal two and an 80% stenosis at obtuse marginal three.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies palpitations, shortness of breath, upper respiratory infections, cough or hemoptysis.
The patient with known gastroesophageal reflux disease with occasional constipation.
No ulcer disease.
No hematochezia.
No hematuria or urinary tract infections.
No kidney disease.
No thyroid dysfunctions.
No vascular problems.
[**Name (NI) **] cerebrovascular accidents or psychiatric disorders.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General, alert and oriented woman in no acute distress.
Partial dentures upper and lower.
Neck si supple with no JVD and no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Well healed mid abdominal incision scar.
Extremities are warm with no edema or cyanosis and no varicosities.
Pulses carotid 2+ bilaterally, radial 2+ bilaterally, femoral 2+ on the left, right has an indwelling catheter, dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse both 2+ bilaterally.
Left leg with mild numbness.
Cardiac echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater then 55%, mild to moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
The MRI showed no evidence of acute infarct with mild to moderate changes of brain atrophy and medial temporal atrophy.
In summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the PLD and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one.
She was weaned from the ventilator, however, showed a mild respiratory acidosis and was therefore kept intubated.
She did, however, remain in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, because following extubation the patient experienced some rapid atrial fibrillation at which point she was loaded with Amiodarone.
On postoperative day two the patient remained in atrial fibrillation.
Her chest tubes were also removed, but she was kept in the Intensive Care Unit, because of her atrial fibrillation and poor urine output requiring a renal consultation.
Once on the floor the patient continued to show slow progress.
General no acute distress.
Incision with Steri-Strips.
Extremities are warm and well perfuse with 2+ edema bilaterally.
Left lower extremity incision with Steri-Strips open to air, clean and dry.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three with left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the PDL and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.
