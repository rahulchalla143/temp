Pt reports lightheadedness yesterday but is otherwise asymptomatic.
He reports increased abdominal girth over the last 3 days.
GI fellow felt melena was likely secondary to recent AVM in setting of elevated INR.
Past Medical History: - AF on coumadin - mechanical AVR (bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis) [**2182**] - h/o GIB secondary to AVM s/p thermal therapy [**2194-10-24**] (first GIB in [**Hospital1 46**] 6 months ago) - ascites (first noted 4 months ago) - CKD (baseline Cr unknown) - CHF EF 25% - ?clean cath prior to AVR  Social History: -From [**Last Name (un) 26580**], Arabic speaking only.
-No known liver disease in the family  Physical Exam: Tc 98.1 BP 95/66 HR 81 RR 20 Sat 99% RA Gen: well appearing male, NAD HENNT: dry MM, anicteric, EOMI, conjunctival palor Neck: no LAD, JVD elevated past ear CV: irregulary irregular, harsh systolic murmur heard best at apex radiating to axilla, loud S2 Lungs: crackles left base o/w clear Abd: distended, +fluid wave, nontender, +BS, liver span ~12 cm Ext: 3+ pitting edema, strong DP/PT pulses bilaterally Neuro: A&Ox3, moving all extremities Skin: no stigmata of chronic liver disease   Pertinent Results: GI Bleeding Study: INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 120 minutes were obtained.
Blood flow images and dynamic blood pool images show no evidence of GI bleeding.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bleeding .
CXR [**2194-11-14**]: Cardiomegaly with mild CHF.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Nodular echotexture of liver with irregular contour suggestive of cirrhosis.
Moderate ascites.
Bilateral simple renal cysts.
No evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis, or epidural abscess.
Moderate spinal stenosis due to disc and facet degenerative changes at L3-4 level.
Mild spinal stenosis at L4-5 level with right foraminal disc herniation with cystic degeneration resulting in severe narrowing of the foramen, which could result in irritation of the right L4 nerve root.
Multilevel degenerative changes at other levels as described above.
TEE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left  atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic prosthesis leaflets appear thickened but move normally without impaired excursion.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic, mitral or tricuspid valves.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No endocarditis or aortic root abscess identified.
Moderate, fixed inferior and inferolateral wall perfusion defects.
Left ventricular enlargement with global hypokinesis and depressed ejection fraction of 34%.
Innumerable bilateral ground-glass nodules within the lungs.
These opacities may be related to pulmonary edema or infection,, less likely cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, in keeping with the patient's clinical history.
Small right pleural effusion.
Evidence of cirrhosis, with ascites and a probably enlarged spleen.
There is a hypodense liver lesion which is not characterized on this non-contrast exam.
Hypodense lesions of the upper poles of the kidneys, some of which represent cysts.
Some of these lesions are not fully characterized.
RUQ U/S: 1) No evidence of biliary ductal dilatation.
2) Perhaps minimally echogenic liver with a small to moderate amount of ascites, consistent with the given history of cirrhosis.
3) Right simple renal cysts.
Brief Hospital Course: # GIB: In setting of elevated INR likely secondary to known AVM treated 2 wks ago with thermal therapy.
EGD on [**2194-11-15**] showed nonbleeding ulcer and AVM.
Patient is s/p capsule study which showed active bleeding in duodenum but no source identified.
From GI perspective, pt with multiple AVMs who will likely be transfusion dependent as these AVMs will rebleed as patient is on anticoag.
# CHF: Patient with very poor EF 25% and mild failure on chest xrays secondary to blood transfusions and volume resuscitation.
# MRSA bacteremia: felt to be due to source from hand wound.
TEE was negative for endocarditis, was seen by ID and recommended treatment empirically for 4 weeks and f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic.
# Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%).
- Metoprolol, Lasix, dig - strict I/O's - No ICD indicated at this point, per recent EP consult .
# Mechanical AVR: - Anticoagulation with heparin and coumadin.
# lip hematoma: Pt.
developed rapidly enlarging hematoma on his lower lip with overlying necrotic tissue.
He was seen by both surgery and dermatology who felt  there was no need for intervention.
Got albumin after procedure, no complications.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: MRSA Bacteremia Systolic CHF Acute Renal Failure Gastrointestinal Bleeding Atrial Fibrillation Lip Hematoma Non Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
You will need to discuss when to restart your lasix and lisinopril as these were held due to poor kidney function.
