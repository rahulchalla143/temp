History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 5730**] is a 22 yo F with a history of asthma who presents with worsening shortness of breath, cough, and R-sided pleuritic chest pain since awakening early this morning.
She reports that she has had URI symptoms of rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough for the past couple of days, which dramatically worsened this morning.
The pt denies any history of blood clots or recent air travel, prolonged car travel, trauma to the LEs, or swelling in the legs, but does report that she has been taking OCPs for the past couple of months.
Pt given prednisone 60 mg, as well as combivent & albuterol nebs, for presumed asthma exacerbation, and ibuprofen for R-sided chest pain.
However, CXR was indicative of RLL pneumonia for which pt was started on 750 mg of levofloxacin.
Pt developed fever to 102.2 following nebs, and also developed worsening tachypnea to 24, with O2 sat 95% on RA (99% on 2L NC).

ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Chest x-ray ([**4-1**]) #1: Increasing pneumonia and pleural effusion at the right base.
Chest x-ray ([**4-1**]) #2: There is interval increase in right pleural effusion and ajacent lung consolidation.
There is also increase in left pleural effusion with left retrocardiac consolidation.
Chest x-ray ([**4-2**]): No short-term interval change was demonstrated in the bibasilar right significantly more than left consolidations and bilateral pleural effusions also right more than left.
Chest x-ray ([**4-3**]): No significant interval change of the bibasilar opacities, right greater than left.
Chest CT [**4-7**] - Severe multifocal pneumonia, with complete heterogenous consolidation of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe, associated with necrotizing component in right lower lobe.
Obstruction of the bronchus intermedius with peribronchial nodal tissue could be due to mucous plugging and less likely inflammatory reaction to a foreign body.
Improvement in right lower lobe collapse and consolidation, left lower lobe consolidation and collapse, and aeration of multiple bronchi as described above.
Improvement of bilateral pleural effusion, especially on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 5730**] is a 22 yo F with a hx of asthma found to have severe community-acquired pneumonia, transferred to MICU on HD#1 with increasing dyspnea and O2 requirement, with slow improvement on empiric vancomycin/levofloxacin; transferred to medicine floor on HD#3.
1) Severe community-acquired pneumonia: Pt was initiated on levofloxacin for CAP, but continued to progress during hospital day #1 with worsening tachypnea, new O2 requirement, and splinting due to severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain.
Initial ABGs in the MICU demonstrated respiratory alkalosis, but lactate was elevated as well indicating a superimposed metabolic acidosis in the setting of sepsis.
Sputum samples with no definitive microbiology, but rather moderate oropharyngeal flora, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued.
Respiratory viral panel as well as urine legionalla were negative, and BCx were with no growth to date.
Serial chest x-rays demonstrated rapid progression of right lower lobe consolidation from HD #1- HD #2, but no interval change following that time period.
U/S in the MICU was negative for a loculated or drainable pleural effusion.
Pt slowly improved clinically on antibiotics with morphine PRN for right-sided pleuritic chest pain, and was transferred to the medicine floor on 4L O2 on HD #3.
On [**4-8**] a right pigtail catheter was placed in an attempt to drain the large effusion, CT scan showed significant loculations as well as a thick pleural rind, the decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for a formal decortication and drainge.
Post-operatively the patient was admitted  to the floor on telemetry, antibiotics were continued pain was controlled with a PCA, all 3 chest tubes were left to sution.
CXR were checked daily to evaluate for recurrence of effusion, pneumothorax as well as appropriate chest tube position.
Diet and activity were advanced, although the patient did have difficulty with nausea and vomiting early in her post-operative course, this was managed with anti-emetics, and resolved.
Intra-operative cultures became positive for MRSA, Vancomycin and levaquin were continued as abx coverage.
On POD 4 patient noted some swelling in her right arm a venous duplex was performed to evaluate for DVT given her PICC line, the study was negative for thrombosis.
On POD 5 repeat CT scan was performed, showing; " Overall improvement.
Improvement in right lower lobe collapse and consolidation, left lower lobe consolidation and collapse, and aeration of multiple bronchi as described above.
Improvement of bilateral pleural effusion, especially on the right."
The patient also began to have vision changes, opthamology was consulted, and commented this was likely secondary to the anti-cholinergic effects of her anti-emetics.
On POD #6  repeat bronchoscopy was performed, this demonstrated improvement of edema in RML/RLL, with no evidence of obstruction.
2) Asthma: Pt demonstrated no physical exam evidence of wheezing, suggestive against an acute asthma exacerbation.
Systemic steroids, which were given in ED, were not continued given known infection and no evidence of asthma exacerbation.
3) Sinus tachycardia: Heart rate 110 bpm at admission; most likely secondary to fever and pleuritic chest pain, as well as s/p albuterol nebulizers, both of which can produce tachycardia.
Heart rate only mildly elevated at admission, and improved with defervescence and improved respiratory function.
Baseline unknown, likely component of hemodilution given IVFs.
No clinical evidence of bleeding.
