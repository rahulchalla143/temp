He was transferred to an outside hospital where on CT scan, he was found to have a grade IV liver laceration.
On arrival to the Trauma Bay, he was found to be hemodynamically unstable and was taken immediately to the Operating Room where he underwent packing of his bleeding liver.
He was then transferred to the Angiography Suite where he underwent embolization of a right hepatic artery which was bleeding from three different sites.
The packings were removed and he was found to have a bleed from the spleen and underwent a splenectomy.
Following these procedures, the patient gradually developed a picture consistent with ongoing sepsis.
He was third-spacing and became hemodynamically unstable and had worsening renal function and respiratory failure with ARDS.
On repeat CT scan, he was noted to have increasing collections in his abdomen around the liver and the splenic bed.
By that time, he had completed multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics and his only positive cultures were from his sputum and those were growing Pseudomonas which was progressively becoming more resistant and for which he was covered.
It was, therefore, decided at that point to proceed with re-exploration and on [**2136-5-20**], he was taken to the Operating Room for abdominal washout and debridement of necrotic liver.
Although this wound gradually granulated quite well, he had opened an enterocutaneous fistula from one of the small bowel loops.
On [**2136-6-1**], it was decided to place a right chest tube due to a growing right pleural effusion.
This procedure was complicated by significant bleed from a vessel over the thoracic wall.
As his multiorgan failure continued to progress, including worsening renal failure, he underwent a trial of CVVH which he tolerated well and after which he seemed to be improving for a short period of time.
The Pseudomonas from his sputum was resistant to many antibiotics including Imipenem in which he was on and multiple other antibiotics.
He was hemodynamically unstable and growing doses of Levophed despite all treatments.
Right rib fractures.
Sepsis with multiorgan failure.
