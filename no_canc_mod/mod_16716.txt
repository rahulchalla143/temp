Presented to [**Hospital3 36606**] Hospital where noncontrast CT showed possible leaky abdominal aneurysm.
Of note, pt recently started HD, and earlier in summer pt had been noted to have right renal mass on CT and tried multiple times to undergo an MRI but was unable to tolerate it.
He was transferred to ED here for further workup, and contrast CT showed large perirenal/RP bleed on R as well as kidneys with multiple cysts, stable 4cm nonruptured nondissected AAA.
Work-up also significant for wbc of 14 with left shift, new onset afib, hyperglycemia, and slightly elevated troponin.

Large right perirenal hemorrhage with extension into the retroperitoneal	 space as described.
There is	 no active extravasation of contrast or demonstration of a vascular	 pseudoaneurym.
Marked atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta; a suprarenal aortic	 aneurysm measuring 4.3 cm in diameter is noted.
No evidence of aortic	 leak or rupture, or acute dissection.
Calcified right hilar lymph nodes and calcified granulomas in the spleen	 likely relate to prior granulomatous disease.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Diagnostic	 possibilities include IPMT or choledochal cyst.
Small lymph nodes are noted within the area of the right	 renal vein measuring up to 5 mm.
Hct stable and patient was hemodynamically stable throughout HD 1, however pt with increasing abdominal pain and distension despite attempted pain control.
HD 2 and 3, pt required 3 units total of prbcs for continued drop in Hct although pt with subjective improvement of symptoms; pt recieved hemodialysis on HD 3 but RIJ tunnel cath is poorly functioning.
IR evaluated pt for possible intervention but decided to observe unless brisk (ie Hct drop >5) active bleed or hemodynamically stable.
The patient repeatedly became confused after taking ambien/benzos so these medications were discontinued.
Interventional radiology was reconsulted in light of the continuing bleed, and offered the option of a total embolization of the right renal artery to stop the bleeding, but the patient decided to take a watchful waiting approach for now.
Pt had new onset atrial fibrillation at presentation.
He was noted to be intermittently in and out of atrial fibrillation throughout hospitalization.
HTN: He was periodically hypertensive during hospitalization but was managed with metoporolol and captopril, then changed to enalapril for QD dosing at discharge.
ESRD: the patient had recently been diagnosed with renal failure.
PPX: The patient was maintained on a PPI, pneumoboots were used to prevent DVT, and colace and senna were used to prevent constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: retroperitoneal bleed, likely from right renal mass right renal mass, cannot rule out renal cell carcinoma renal failure, on dialysis   Discharge Condition: Pt had no pain and hematocrit was stable above 30 for two days.
Call your doctor or return to the ED if you have increased abdominal pain, bruising on your flank or stomach, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath or other concerns.
