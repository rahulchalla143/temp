Admission Date:  [**2157-2-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-3-2**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: Trf from OSH with ICH - L posterior parietal IPH with mental status changes   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ?
none  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman who presents with acute mental status change this AM.
She lives at home with her son, who noticed that she was becoming increasingly agitated and was having word finding difficulties and slurring her speech this morning.
She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department where she was found to be HTNsive initial BP unknown with Afib in RVR so pt placed on a Diltiazem gtt at 5mg/hr.
HCT showed a 4x3x3 L posterior parietal lesion which was believed to be intraparenchymal bleed.
Past Medical History: Atrial flutter HTN Glaucoma Severe deafness s/p appendectomy   Social History: Lives at home with son who reports that his mother is high functioning - normal AAOx3 able to balance her checkbook   Family History: Stroke - sister at 33 y/o ICH - mother Retinal detachment - daughter   Physical Exam: PE on admission:  T:97  BP: 93/55     HR: 72    R 16      O2Sats 97% RA Neck: Supple.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Stable hyperdense focus in the left posterior parietal lobe with surrounding edema.
Differential diagnosis includes a cavernoma that has hemorrhaged, amyloid angiopathy, or an underlying neoplasm.
There is no evidence of aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.
No acute territorial infarction.
Marked central and cortical involutional changes in keeping with the patient's age of [**Age over 90 **] years.
Diffuse microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
Moderate-severe narrowing of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with post-stenotic dilatation and adequate distal flow.
No additional areas of high-grade narrowing are identified  CT [**2-16**] IMPRESSION: Stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage in left parietal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and mild mass effect.
Given that the prior CTA was negative for AVM, an underlying mass and amyloid angiopathy are the major diagnostic differential considerations.
Recommend MRI for further evaluation, if there are no contraindications.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2157-2-17**] 2:05 PM IMPRESSION: Evolving subacute/acute hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and mild mass effect.
Multiple potential causes include hypertension, AVM, cavernoma, masses, coagulopathy, trauma, and focal amyloid angiopathy.
Compared with 02/11, there has been interval obscuration at the left lung base, raising the question of a left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
If clinically indicated, lateral view may help for further assessment.
Interval improvement in CHF findings.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hypertension and atrial flutter who presented with agitation, word finding difficulties and headache, was found to have a large Left posterior parietal lobe hemorrhage at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
NEURO: Etiology of hemorrhage unclear: either an amyloid or cavernoma related hemorrhage or neoplasm related bleed.
CTA head did not show a venous abnormality.
The patient was initially admitted to NeuroICU for persistent agitation with intermittent somnolence.
Dilantin was used for Seizure ppx and she was treated for 4 days after which this was discontinued give agitation, confusion and no actual seizure history.
Anticoagulation was not considered given that her hemorraghe was likely due to amyloid.
The patient's neurologic exam at the time of discharge was limited by inattention but notable for disorientation to place and mild anomia.
There was no pronator drift.
CARDIOVASCULAR: She was treated with IV diltiazem for Afib with RVR noted at OSH but was found to be in SR on initial presentation, however, was intermittenly in atrial fibrillation while in the ICU.
Upon arrival to the neurology floor, she also intermittantly had atrial fibrillation with RVR with heart rates into the 170s.
ID: Ms. [**Known lastname 4702**] was noted to have intermittant low grade temperatures.
Chest x-ray was concerning for a left lower lobe pneumonia.
Olanzapine 10 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left posterior parietal Intracranial hemorrhage Hypertension Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, phlebitis Aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Heart rate was well controlled, averaging in the 90s.
Neurological examination at time of discharge was limited by inattention but noteable for disorientation to place and mild anomia.
There was no pronator drift.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with an intracranial bleed.
The reason for your bleed was most like a due to a condition called amyloid angiopathy, which can occur as the brain ages.
You required medications to control your heart rate due to your atrial fibrillation.
Your course was complicated by an infection in your left arm (phlebitis) and a possible aspiration pneumonia.
Should you experience any of the symptoms listed below or any other symptom concerning to you, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
