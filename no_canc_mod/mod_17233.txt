Pregnancy was a spontaneous monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation with concordant fetal growth.
There was spontaneous onset of labor which was refractory to tocolysis and progressed to cesarean section for breech presentation of both twins.
There were no other sepsis risk factors, and rupture of membranes occurred at delivery.
The baby was [**Name2 (NI) 43619**], palate intact, red light reflex equal bilaterally, moderate costal retractions with fair breath sounds, regular, rate and rhythm, no murmur, no femoral pulses, benign abdominal exam with three-vessel umbilical cord, no organomegaly, anus patent, normal female genitalia for gestational age, normal neurologic exam for gestational age, hips stable.
Respiratory:  Twin #2 was initially intubated for moderate respiratory distress and was given two doses of surfactant.
Caffeine was initiated at the time of extubation for apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
There was a dramatic increase in her apnea of bradycardiac episodes on day of life #8 for which a sepsis evaluation was initiated.
This evaluation revealed Staphylococcus epidermitis bacteremia and anemia.
The apnea and bradycardiac episodes improved after treatment of the bacteremia and anemia.
Cardiovascular:  There was a murmur noted on day of life #1 that was consistent with a PDA, and Indomethacin therapy was initiated; however, after a single dose of Indomethacin, there marked oliguria, and the Indomethacin was discontinued.
The murmur persisted, and an echocardiogram on day of life #3 revealed a moderate size patent ductus arteriosis measuring 3.3 mm with continuous left-to-right flow.
Given her persistent oliguria, Indomethacin was not restarted; however, the murmur spontaneously decreased in intensity, and a repeat echocardiogram on day of life #5, showed a small patent ductus arteriosis that intermittently closed during the echocardiogram.
Twenty-four hour electrolytes were normal except for an elevated sodium at 148.
A total of three sodium bicarbonate boluses were required to treat this metabolic acidosis.
Also during this time, oliguria was present secondary to Indomethacin.
There have been no subsequent problems with metabolic acidosis.
Infectious disease:  Sepsis evaluation was initiated on admission for prematurity and respiratory distress.
On day of life #8, there was marked increase in her episodes of apnea and bradycardia.
Antibiotics were not initially started given the benign differential, but were started when the blood cultures grew out Staphylococcus epidermitis at approximately 24 hours.
Antibiotics were initially given through a PICC line; however, the line was discontinued after a repeat blood culture also grew an identical organism with identical sensitivities.
Lumbar puncture was performed on [**1-28**] which showed no evidence of meningitis, and the repeat blood cultures had no growth.
The patient over the past several days has had some clear eye drainage which has been treated with warm soap.
No culture has been sent, and no antibiotics have been started.
Status post metabolic acidosis.
Apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
