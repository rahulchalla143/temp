Admission Date:  [**2188-4-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-4-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-8-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors / Neurontin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: positive stress test, respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: 75-year-old female with ESRD, hypertension, status post LRRT from her grandson in [**2180**] p/w positive stress test.
Since her abdominal hernia repair c/b UTI and c. diff colitis, the pt has been back and forth between rehab and the hospital.
Her most recent admission to [**Hospital1 **] was for COPD exacerbation/pneumonia requiring intubation.
She was discharged to an ECF, but presented to [**Hospital1 882**] on [**3-28**] with sharp left-sided CP and arm pain.
She was diaphoretic w/o SOB or n/v.
The pain was unrelieved w/ SLNG x3, but in the ambulance she received 2 nitro sprays and 4 baby ASA and her pain resolved.
No EKG changes and enzymes negative.
This pain was much worse than her typical anginal symptoms.
Chemical ST yesterday showed defects suggesting 3 vessel disease w/ no EKG changes.
Of note, the pt had some SOB earlier today which resolved w/ nebs.
Vitals on transfer were 98.8 60 sr no ect resp 18 139/77, 97% 2l nc 0/10 pain  Patient was seen in the cath lab holding area and denied any CP, SOB, nausea, or any other symptoms at this time.
Cardiac cath showed 3 vessel disease -> 60% mid lad, 70% circ, and subtotal RCA.
On arrival to the floor, patient comfortable w/ no complaints.

EXT: wwp, no edema.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LCx had a 70% mid and distal stenosis.
The RCA had subtotal distal stenosis with left to right collaterals.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertension with central aortic pressure of 156/46 mmHg.
Systemic arterial hypertension.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] redistribution.
Likely pulmonary arterial hypertension  Carotid [**4-3**]: Impression: Standard velocity criteria yield the following: Right ICA 40-59% stenosis.
However, there is substantial calcification bilaterally that limit the ability of duplex to accurately predict theseverity of stenosis.
CXR [**4-5**]: IMPRESSION:  CHF with predominant interstitial edema, which is new compared with [**2188-4-2**] at 17:00 p.m.  Small bilateral effusions and patchy bibasilar opacity.
CXR [**4-8**]: FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**4-5**], there is increased engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with worsening [**Date Range 1106**] congestion.
Probable small pleural effusions with bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
CXR [**4-9**]: In comparison with the study of [**4-8**], there has been substantial clearing of the bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
There is still some indistinctness of engorged vessels, consistent with some residual elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, though there still may well be some small pleural effusion and atelectasis at the left base.
ECHO [**4-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is borderline/mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-2-5**], findings are similar, and suggest significant diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle coupled with borderline/mild mitral stenosis, with the predictable consequence of severe pulmonary hypertension.
CXR [**4-10**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, likely to reflect improved ventilation.
There are still signs indicative of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, but these have improved as compared to the previous examination.
No evidence of newly occurred parenchymal opacities.
Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially indicative of a small left pleural effusion.
CXR [**4-11**]: New asymmetric opacification in the lateral aspect of the left mid and lower lung zones and perhaps a smaller area in the right upper lobe highlighting the minor fissure, in the absence of mediastinal or pulmonary [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] engorgement is most likely pneumonia.
Airspace disease with air bronchograms in the left lower lobe with associated small left-sided pleural effusion and also nodular airspace process in the right middle lobe and ground glass opacity in left upper lobe lingula periphery may represent multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Grossly stable calcified soft tissue nodule in the left central breast, may represent a fibroadenoma.
Consider correlation with dedicated mammography for further assessment.
Mild centrilobular emphysematous changes in the lungs.
CXR [**4-14**]: IMPRESSION:  Improving multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
Microbiology: urine [**4-3**]: no growth stool [**4-3**]: c. diff negative    Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2188-4-17**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2188-4-15**]):       Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75-year-old female with ESRD, hypertension, COPD, status post LRRT [**2180**] w/ cardiac cath showing 3VD who was deemed a non-surgical candidate for her coronary artery disease, and was managed for respiratory distress, likely secondary to COPD and dCHF.
Also has COPD vs. PNA, which is likely contributing to respiratory distress.
# CORONARIES: positive stress test concerning for 3 vessel disease sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
cath showed LMCA without angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis, LAD had a 60% mid-vessel stenosis, the LCx had a 70% mid and distal stenosis, and the RCA had subtotal distal stenosis with left to right collaterals.
However, in the setting of pneumonia and poor respiratory status, patient was determined not to be a surgical candidate at this time.
ABG was done and did not show that pt was chronic retainer.
she also completed a z-pack, a few days of levaquin and a few days of broad spectrum antibiotics.
# Diastolic CHF: Chronic compensated with LVEF 55%.
Diastolic disease [**12-27**] htn & DM.
the pt became hypoxic w/ O2 sats in the 70s and BP went up to 220s.
# Hypertension:  Patient blood pressures were quite elevated with SBPs in the 170s.
# Pneumonia: Found to have potential RLL pneumonia on CXR and CT chest.
Started on Vancomycin/Cefepime on [**4-12**] for HCAP, but discontinued as no fevers, or WBC elevations, and most likely etiology of pulm issues CHF and COPD.
# RHYTHM: NSR .
# Acute on chronic kidney disease s/p transplant: stable from a renal standpoint currently.

A cardiac catheterization showed some blockages in your heart arteries but you are not a candidate for surgery and given your pulmonary problems, a procedure to open the arteries was not attempted at this time.
