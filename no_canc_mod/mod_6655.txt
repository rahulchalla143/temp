Per the patient's wife the patient has had progressively worsening SOB over the last few days so that now even at rest he is SOB.
He has also had increased weakness and fatigue, including difficulty with walking which happens when he becomes ill.  His wife notes reduced secretions and increased congestion.
This has not been associated with CP, palps, PND, orthopnea, or fevers however he has had a cough.
On admission to ED triggered for respiratory extremis.
Lungs with wheezing and crackles.
Dry MM and cachectic.
PCXR - no fluid overload on ED's read despite crackles in lungs.
They also started a hep gtt for both NSTEMI as well as presumed PE given hypoxia, clear CXR and elevated cardiac markers without ST/TW changes on ECG.

There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
Stable appearance of small hiatal hernia s/p fundoplication.
ECG: NSR at 85, Normal axis, normalization of anterolateral T wave inversions noted on prior dated [**2199-8-23**].

Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed with mid to apical hypokinesis (LVEF= ?40 %).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There was significant premature spillover of material during the oral phase of swallow for other consistencies.
Brief Hospital Course: 83yo M with h/o NSTEMI, AF with RVR, CHF (EF 40%) admitted to CCU with hypoxic respiratory failure.
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Initially thought to be secondary to both acute decompensated heart failure in the setting of an NSTEMI and mucus plugging seocndary to chronic aspiration.
Patient diuresed well to IV Lasix on the first day of admission and CXR showed no signs of an aspiration pneumomia.
He continued to have episodes of witnessed aspiration events after becoming euvolemic, see below.
Aspiration: Patient has chronic aspiration and dysphagia secondary to neurologic disease.
He continued to have several episodes of hypoxia assocated with aspiration events.
A speech and swallow evaluation showed that he is at high chronic risk for aspiration, especially thin liquids.
NSTEMI/CHF: Patient with elevated troponin in setting of normal creatinine (although likely decreased GFR given age and degree of cachexia) as well as elevated CK and CKMB.
ECG notable for prior infact, though no acute change.
Chronic lung disease - continued home nebulizer treatments and discharged on Combivent nebulizers every 4-6 hours as needed  .
Hypothyroidism - continue home Levothyroxine.
