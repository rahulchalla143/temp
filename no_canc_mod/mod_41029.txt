Admission Date:  [**2103-4-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-4-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2025-11-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: morphine / Oxycodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: left heart cardiac catheterization Coronary Artery Bypass x 3 (LIMA-LAD, SVG-diagonal, SVG-OM) [**2103-4-10**]   History of Present Illness: 77 year old female has a cardiac history notable for a remote MI in [**2071**].
She had been doing well from a cardiac standpoint over the years until about 3 weeks ago when she started to notice exertional chest burning.
More recently, she has also had a few episodes of chest pain occurring at rest that have woken her from sleep and lasted for 10 minutes.
She was referred to cardiology and had a nuclear stress test done that was notable for lateral ischemia.
She was then referred for a cardiac catheterization and was found to have coronary artery disease and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.
Past Medical History: CAD PMH: MI [**2071**]-age 45; had a temporary pacemaker/?

hx of falls, uses a cane PRN TIA Past Surgical History: c section x 3 hysterectomy parathyroid tumor resection s/p left knee replacement s/p left carotid endarterectomy bowel resection with partial removal of right colon and cecum for benign mass left eyelid surgery Cholecystectomy   Social History: Widow, son currently staying with her.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
[**3-12**] holosystolic murmur best heard at apex.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The Lcx had an 80% eccentric lesion that wasn't ammenable to PCI.
THe RCA was non-obstructed with a mild amount of proximal plaque with a possibe non-flow limiting chronic dissection in the proximal portion of the vessel.
Limited resting hemodynamics reveal elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 17mm Hg.
Left ventriculography demonstrated an ejection fraction of 65% with no wall motion abnormality.
Moderately elevated left sided filling pressure.
CXR [**2103-4-4**]: No previous images.
Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
Opacification in the supraclavicular region on the right medially could be an artifact or represent some area of calcification.
[**2103-4-10**] Intra-op TEE Conclusions Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB: The patient is AV-Paced, on no inotropes.
Brief Hospital Course: MEDICAL COURSE: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 77yoF with h/o remote MI in [**2071**], HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism, gout, who presented with worsening chest pain, found to have 3 vessel disease on [**2103-4-3**] cath, admitted for management prior to CABG.
She initially was doing well, chest pain free.
However on [**4-8**] she started developing chest pain after going to the bathroom, EKG unchanged.
On [**4-9**] she developed chest pain at rest, EKG with ST depressions in lateral leads.
This pain was responsive immediately to nitro 0.4mg SL x1, and a heparin gtt was started.
This represents a mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis.
Differential for non-AG metabolic acidosis is GI losses of HCO3- (possible, given 18" colon resected [**2101**] for villous adenoma, when this issue arose, and has chronic watery diarrhea as a result), renal tubular acidosis (potential), early renal failure (less likely as GFR is in 30's).
Persistent hyperkalemia suggests type IV, as type I usually has hypokalemia.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: baseline creatinine 1.4, briefly up to 1.7 during admission.
# PUMP: no evidence of CHF.
# HTN: held carvedilol, amlodipine, and benazapril during admission for mild hypotension and bradycardia.
# GOUT: continued allopurinol 100mg PO daily ================================ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # incidentalomas on CT chest: 1) Multiple hypodense kidney lesions, statistically likely cysts, but not fully characterized on this non-contrast study.
2) Bilateral adrenal adenomas.
#  SURGICAL COURSE: Pulmonary was consulted preoperatively for elevated AA gradient.
There were no recommendations for further testing or treatment.
She remained in the CVICU a few days for hemodynamic support.
Renal was consulted for history of renal insufficiency.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 7 the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
