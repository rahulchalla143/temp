[**Hospital1 18**]: NG lavage and Ileoscopy through ostomy site [**2155-6-10**]   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old man with history of PUD, recurrent diverticulitis s/p illeostomy with history of illioconduit in [**2145**] then colostomy in [**2152**], recent history of GI bleed 5 weeks ago complicated by retained small bowel camera who presents with an acute GI bleed.
3-5 days prior to admission he noticed blood filling his ileostomy bag.
He and his wife tried to apply pressure to the bleeding on the day of admission ([**2155-6-9**]), which only temporarily helped.
He arrived at [**Hospital **] Hospital and underwent an EGD through the ileostomy stoma which only revealed blood and no obvious source of bleeding.
He did get fent/versed and for unclear reasons sux/etom (although not intubated) for sedation for this procedure.
Of note, patient had a recent hospital stay for GI bleed at [**Hospital **] Hospital with a small bowel camera retained in small bowel from [**Date range (1) 89310**] for N/V and ?GI bleed c/b retention of small bowel camera c/b SVT and fever.
S/p subtotal colectomy in [**2152**] for diverticulosis 4.
S/p partial small bowel resection with ileostomy and ileal conduit in [**2145**] for diverticulosis 5.
H/o prosate CA s/p radiation in [**2134**] 7.

Probable left anterior fascicular block with right bundle-branch block.
Diffuse baseline artifact on the first half of the tracing marring interpretation of ST segments for ischemia but no gross abnormalities appreciated.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Multiple bowel surgeries, with right lower quadrant ileostomy.
No evidence of vascular extravasation, obstruction, or leak.
Rectal Hartmann pouch, with apparent mild wall thickening that could reflect proctitis.
Renal atrophy and mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, likely reflecting chronic reflux.
Cholecystectomy, with moderate intrahepatic and common biliary ductal dilation.
Emphysema and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis although pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis cannot be excluded.
Pulmonary vascular congestion without evidence of pulmonary edema.
Small left pleural effusion.
The pattern and distribution of the changes suggest pulmonary edema of moderate severity.
In addition, the pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis and right basal parenchymal opacity persists  Ileoscopy [**2155-6-10**] Normal mucosa in the ileum without blood.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to ileum (20cm examined)  Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE Mr. [**Known lastname 6632**] is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o gentleman with history of PUD, recurrent diverticulitis s/p illeostomy with history of illioconduit in [**2145**] then colostomy in [**2152**], recent history of GI bleed 5 weeks ago complicated by retained small bowel camera who presented with an acute GI bleed.
This may have been due to a stomal tear, which was repaired at the OSH.
Acute GI bleed: Resolved.
Lower GI source most likely given that he was briskly bleeding with clots yet remaining hemodynamically stable.
Since he has been here, he has had no active bleeding.
Next step would be capsule endoscopy, which Pt declined due to his h/o obstruction from retained camera.
Occurred while in ICU, most likely due to pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation.
[**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Cr peaked at 1.4, was likely prerenal in the setting of acute blood loss.
Unclear why not on diuretics or antihypertensives, although fludricortisone suggests h/o orthostasis.
Our gastroenterologists and surgeons felt comfortable discharging you from the hospital given that you blood levels were stable, and you did not want to have any further workup at this time.
