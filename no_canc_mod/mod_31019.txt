He was scheduled to have elective TURP and stopped ASA and Coumadin for 1 week (had stopped Plavix 3 mos prior) and presented to ED with exertional chest pain, found to be hypotensive and in cardiogenic shock.
Given concern for in stent restenosis, he was taken to catheterization lab where he was found to have ISR and new stent was placed to open up area to OM1.

Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation demonstrated severe native three vessel disease.
The LIMA had a distal 70% in stent restenosis vs thrombosis.
LAD had diffuse 70-80% proximal and mid disease.
The LCX into the major OM branch had a 99% proximal instent restenosis vs thrombosis with TIMI 2 distal flow.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated filling pressures.
There was moderate reactive pulmonary hypertension.
Significant V wave in the wedge tracing was indicative of severe ischemic mitral regurgitation.
Successful stenting of OM1 with three overlapping 2.5 mm MiniVision stents and PTCA of the LMCA in-stent restenosis with a 3.5 mm balloon.
Successful PTA of the right external iliac artery with a 7.0 mm balloon and placement of a 7Fx30 cc IABP.
[**2124-1-28**] Echocardiogram:  There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior akinesis, inferolateral hypokinesis, inferoseptal akinesis and anteroseptal hypokinesis.
Anterior and anterolateral systolic function appears preserved in focused views.
Intrinsic function may be more significantly depressed given the presence of significant mitral regurgitation.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened (aortic valve gradient not assessed); aortic regurgitation and stenosis were not adequately assessed.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen in focused views (parasternal long axis view only; may be underestimated).
There is no pericardial effusion detected in focused views.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is increasing pulmonary edema and bilateral small effusions.
There is persistent cardiomegaly.
2) Small bilateral effusions and persistent cardiomegaly.
No pneumothorax.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2124-2-2**]: INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Hemodynamic instability.
Coronary angiography of the left coronary artery showed a 60% distal LMCA stenosis, diffuse disease with up to 30% stenoses in the previously treated OM1 and a 90% ostial stenosis of the jailed LCX (which only supplied small OM2/3).
Resting hemodynamics showed mildly elevated right and left heart pressures with a preserved cardiac output.
Labs: [**2124-2-8**] WBC 10.5  Hct 36.5  Plt 258 INR 1.2 Na 138  K 4.1  Cl 104  Bicarb 25  BUN 25 Cr 1.1  Glucose 89 AST 50   ALT 251   Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old male with CAD s/p CABG '[**16**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-ramus) PCI with stent from LMCA to LCx presents with ISR after stopping ASA, coumadin x1 week for elective TURP (Plavix off for 3 mos).
ACS:  Ischemia - s/p cath with In stent rethrombosis of LMCA/LCx stent.
The thought was that possibly ischemia from remaining vessel disease vs MR could be contributing to his lack of tolerating extubation.
Pump - Patient was requiring Dopamine and Dobutamine but he was no longer requiring these stopped prior to extubation.
Nitro gtt was used for preload reduction when he became short of breath post-extubation, however, Nitro stopped the following day.
Given wall motion abnormalities (although apex not visualized) considered anti-coagulation with Coumadin.
Discussed this with patient's outpatient cardiologist, and it was decided to be not necessary from a cardiac standpoint.
If blood pressure increases a an outpatient, he may benefit from beta-blocker.
Rhythm - patient in sinus rhythm with occasional ectopy (premature atrial and ventricular conractions), monitored on telemetry.
He did have an episode of SOB and agitation likely pulm edema and was reintubated for resp distress and diuresed.
Added Vanco on [**1-30**] due to fever and elevated WBC, and concern for sepsis.
He was given stress dose steroids given an inadequate cortisol rise with stimulation and concern for sepsis and weaned completely off on [**2-4**].
Elevated transaminases: Likely in setting of poor perfusion with cardiogenic shock.
Renal: Patient with oliguria on admission likely secondary to poor renal flow, U/S of kidneys to evaluate perfusion within normal limits.
Proph: Heparin sc for DVT proph .
