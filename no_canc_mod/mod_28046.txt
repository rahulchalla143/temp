History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 16646**] is an 83 year old female admitted for right lower extremity bypass after presenting with painful/necrotic 4th right toe.
She has a [**3-26**] year history of heart murmur.
She also admits to claudication symptoms and some pedal edema.
She denies chest pain, orthopnea, PND, syncope, presyncope and palpitations.
She was admitted for preoperative cardiac evalauation and vascular intervention.
Family History: No premature coronary disease  Physical Exam: Vitals: Temp 99.4, BP 112/54, P 74, Sat 96% on RA General: Elderly female in no acute distress HEENT: Oropharynx benign.
Neck: Supple, JVP 11 cm Lungs: Clear bilaterally Heart: Regular rate, S1s2, 3/6 SEM throughout precordium Abdomen: Benign Extremities: 1+ edema Pulses: Decreased distal pulses.
Transmitted murmur vs carotid bruit.
Grossly intact, MAE well, good strength, no focal deficits noted.
Pertinent Results: [**2190-7-29**] 03:55AM BLOOD WBC-18.5* RBC-3.77* Hgb-11.5* Hct-35.0* MCV-93 MCH-30.5 MCHC-32.8 RDW-15.4 Plt Ct-291 [**2190-7-29**] 03:55AM BLOOD Glucose-114* UreaN-70* Creat-1.7* Na-140 K-4.0 Cl-105 HCO3-24 AnGap-15  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 16646**] was admitted and underwent persantine MIBI on [**2190-7-16**] which revealed a moderate fixed perfusion defect of the inferior wall - no reversible perfusion defects were identified.
The EKG portion showed approximately 1 mm lateral and apical ST depressions which were 0.5 mm additional over baseline ST depressions.
She experienced no angina or shortness of breath.
Further evaluation included an echocardiogram which found a severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets, severe AS with mild AI.
There was severe mitral annular calcification with mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation.
The ECHO was also notable for mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation.
Subsequent cardiac cathterization on [**2190-7-19**] revealed severe three vessel disease and severe AS.
Angiography showed a 60% ostial left main stenosis; 50% lesion in the mid LAD, 90% obtuse marginal stenosis, and 80% lesion in the RCA.
Given her renal insufficiency, no LVG was performed.
Further evaluation included vein mapping and carotid ultrasound which found no significant disease of the internal carotid arteries.
There were no complications.
She maintained good hemodynamics but initially experienced low urine output.
She was noted to be in a first degree AV block with occasional junctional episodes - beta blockade was therefore initially withheld.
Periods of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were noted for which low dose betablockade was resumed.
