Admission Date:  [**2177-5-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-6-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-2-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from OSH for possible trach by thoracics.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 **] intubated  History of Present Illness: 73 year old man with history of obesity, diabetes, unspecified chronic lung disease who initially presented to [**Hospital3 12594**] on [**5-22**] with acute respiratory distress.
Prior to presentation he was reportedly sick for a couple of days and became short of breath on [**5-21**] almost to the point of developing stridor.
Also complaining of pain with swallowing, right ear pain and right neck pain.
In the ED ENT performed an indirect laryngoscopy which revealed edema and exudate of the posterior trachea.
He was given Unasyn and Ceftriaxone in the ED for swelling and crusting of his right ear, and started on steroids for concern of laryngeal edema.
He had warmth and edema on the right side of his face and neck along with induration that obscured the angle of the mandible.
He was felt to have acute pharyngitis with angioedema, right external cellulitis (sparing ear canal and TM), right upper cervical lymphadenitis, right supraglottitis with a probable soft tissue infection of the right neck.
A CT scan on [**5-22**] revealed swelling in the retropharyngeal area.
At that time there was a concern for a LLL infiltrate on CXR.
On [**2177-5-23**] he began to retain C02 and later had an ABG of 7.11/144 (attributed to underlying lung disease and increased amounts of morphine); at that time he went to the OR for an ET tube placed by ENT.
A repeat CT on [**5-24**] showed extensive infiltrate and/or hematoma in the retropharyngeal area.
CT on [**5-26**] showed decreased swelling.
During his MICU stay he underwent acute renal failure (Cr to 3.5).
ENT felt that he was ready to be extubated with anesthesia present in case of stridor.

right facial erythema and inducation.
Right sub-mandibular induration.
LUNGS - CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh, HEART - RRR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - + Edema, LE.
NEURO - Sedated indubated.
The endotracheal tube also shows normal course, its tip appears to project approximately 3.5 cm above the carina, the definite tip position is difficult to determine because of projection effects.
Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis.
Suspicion of moderate left sided pleural effusion.
No evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
MRI Neck ([**5-30**]): Diffuse oropharyngeal mucosal enhancement and subcutanous edema, consistent with cellulitis with a 1.6 X 1.0 cm right mylohyoid muscle collection and other smaller microabscesses.
Incidental note of partially imaged right pleural effusion.
Abscess adjacent to the right mylohyoid muscle is not clearly defined on this noncontrast study.
Extensive edema centered in the right submandibular space is similar to [**2177-5-30**].
Opacification and air-fluid levels in all sinuses may represent sinusitis in the correct clinical context.
Borderline enlarged cervical nodes are likely reactive.
Saber sheath trachea, possibly secondary to collapse of the tracheal cartilage, as there is no evidence of COPD on CT chest performed concurrently.
MRI [**2177-6-10**] (follow-up) FINDINGS: Again soft tissue edema is identified in the right side of the oro- and hypo-pharynx.
A 14 x 11 mm hyperintense area on T2-weighted images is seen in this region indicative of a small fluid collection.
Since the previous study, the endotracheal tube has been removed and the soft tissue edema is considerably decreased with slight decrease in size of a fluid collection.
No new fluid collections are seen in the neck.
There is no lymphadenopathy or new mass lesion identified.
Soft tissue changes are seen in both mastoid air cells.
Compared to the previous MRI of [**2177-5-30**], there is considerable decrease in swelling of the oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal soft tissues with slight decrease in size of the previously noted fluid collection.
No significant new abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: A 73 yo man with history of obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who developed respiratory distress and right sided cellulitis/soft tissue infection now transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for failure to extubate and possible trach placement by thoracics.
# Cellulitis/soft tissue infection:  He received 7-days of broad spectrum antibiotics at an outside hospital prior to transfer.
Per ENT notes his infection was improving.
Although S. aureus and Group A strep grew from culture data, the referring hospital's ID team felt that it was likely a polymicrobial infection that required broad spectrum coverage.
An MRI of the neck soft tissue showed diffuse oropharyngeal mucosal enhancement and subcutanous edema, consistent with cellulitis with possible right mylohyoid abscess.
ENT was consulted, as well as thoracic surgery.
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: He is not on home medication for COPD.
After extubation, he continued to have a high oxygen requirement, and ABG demonstrated chronic CO2 retention.
# Extubation:  Patient has been difficult to extubate initially secondary to sedation then later due to lack of a cuff leak.
Thoracic surgery and ENT were consulted as above, and felt that tracheostomy was necessary due to prolonged intubation.
However, bronchoscopy revealed a very narrowed trachea (saber-sheath), and operative report obtained from outside hospital showed that his trachea was under the manubrium.
After discussion with thoracic surgery, this would make tracheostomy very difficult and not easily reversible.
# Hypertension:  Blood pressures were not elevated initially, and anti-hypertensives were held.
However, he later became hypertensive requiring the initiation and uptitration of hydralazine, lisinopril, and amlodipine.
# Chronic kidney disease:  His baseline creatinine is approximately 1.3-1.5.
Acute renal failure from OSH resolved.
# Decubitus ulcer:  This was present on admission and unchanged [**Last Name (un) 22034**] this hospitalization.
# PPx: He was given Subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots for prophylaxis, in addition to PPI for gastritis prophylaxis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary:  cellulitis leading to upper airway obstruction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute on chronic kidney failure, hypertension secondary:  diabetes   Discharge Condition: Medically Stable for transfer to Rehab, with O2 requirement of 60% FiO2, 15L hi-flow   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because you had a breathing tube because of an infection in your neck.
