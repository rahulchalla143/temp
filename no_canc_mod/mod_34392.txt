Intubation ([**2161-6-7**])  History of Present Illness: 82yo female with a PMH notable for anxiety and depression, HTN, bilateral PE s/p IVC filter on coumadin, aortic stenosis (valve area 0.8), CAD s/p BMS to LAD on [**2161-2-3**] presenting to an outside s/p fall witnessed by her daughter.
On CT from the outside hospital, there was an acute on chronic subdural hematoma.
She was anticoagulated on Coumadin for a PE in the past and her INR=2.97.
While in the ER, she had a hypoxic episode and required intubation and subsequently was admitted to the ICU.
CAD s/p stent placement, bare metal stent [**1-/2161**] 2.
HTN 6.
GERD 7. anemia 8.
Aortic stenosis  Social History: Patient walks with a cane.
HEENT: Nasal fx with multiple facial lacerations.
No JVD Lungs: CTA bilaterally.
Neuro: Mental status: Anxious & agitation is escalating.
No abnormal movements,tremors.
Moves all extremities symmetrically without difficulty  Sensation: Intact to light touch, pain bilaterally.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2161-5-26**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
No other evidence of acute fracture.
NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD ([**2161-5-23**]): There is a large subdural hematoma covering the entire right convexity, which measures up to 2 cm from the inner table, which causes 6 mm shift of normally midline structures, unchanged since [**2161-5-23**].
There is mild compression of the right lateral ventricle without evidence of subfalcine or uncal herniation.
Increased leftward shift of midline structures, with increased subfalcine and stable transtentorial herniation.
Stable appearance to right convexity subdural hematoma without evidence for new foci of hemorrhage.
Non-contrast CT of the head ([**2161-6-5**]):  Status post evacuation of right frontal subdural hematoma with improvement in mass effect with reduction in subfalcine herniation with an improvement in leftward midline shift, now 9 mm.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Non-contrast CT head ([**2161-6-8**]):  Status post right craniotomy for evacuation of right frontal subdural hematoma, now with improvement of midline shift, now only 4 mm in leftward direction.
There is no evidence of an acute hemorrhage.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
CXR 2V ([**2161-6-8**]):  Interval improvement in bibasilar atelectasis or consolidation, and pleural fluid.
Small right pleural effusion.
Mild calcifications of the abdominal aorta, without aneurysmal dilatation.
Calcified granuloma within the liver.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year-old female with history of pulmonary embolism and atrial fibrillation on coumadin admitted [**2161-5-23**] following fall.
On admission, she was found to have a subdural hematoma which was evacuated.
Hospital course was complicated by respiratory distress requiring intubation, ventilator associated pneumonia, and UTI.
She was intubated in the ED for respiratory distress and increasing agitation.
Head CT revealed acute on chronic SDH on the right.
Extubation was considered on hospital day #2 however she went into pulmonary edema and the extubation was not attempted.
Another CT scan on [**2161-6-3**] showed increased midline shift of the brain.
She was noted to have continued delirium which is much improved on discharge.
If patient has any evidence of neurological decline, her neurosurgeon should be [**Date Range 653**] immediately.
Neurological deficits on discharge: Minor parathesia in left hand, non-dermatomal distribution.
The cough persisted, but she remained afebrile.
Patient is afebrile and without productive cough on discharge.
Episode of rapid A. fib vs. A. flutter:  Prior to extubation in the ICU, the patient did have an episode of rapid a-fib which she was given Diltiazem/Lopressor and converted back to sinus rhythm.
Following craniotomy, patient again had episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Patient was subsequently noted to have a transaminitis (see above).
A culture revealed E. coli which was sensitive to ceftazidime.
Hypertension:  Given that the patient has severe aortic stenosis and therefore preload dependent, the patient was discontinued on Isordil.
Asymptomatic aortic stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.6 cm2, but does not have any symptoms related to AS.
Partial complex with secondary generalization, six days post-craniotomy.
Likely contributors were some mild trauma to the brain upon falling, with the development of the subdural hematoma and the subsequent craniotomy.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID:PRN as needed for anxiety.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for Possible fungal infection in mouth.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 34004**] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 14663**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: -Subdural hematoma, right-sided after fall that also resulted in nasal fracture.
Secondary diagnoses: UTI, now resolved Atrial fibrilation with rapid ventricular rate Pulmonary edema, now resolved Pneumonia - ventilator associated, now resolved Transaminitis, secondary to amiodarone; improved Brief diarrhea, now resolved Seizure, secondary to fall/sdh/craniotomy  Discharge Condition: There are some minor neurological deficits at present: There is some parathesia of the left hand, likely of cortical origin and secondary to the subdural hematoma.
The right pupil is sluggish, but this is likely due to a relative sensory afferent defect caused by macular degeneration.
The bone flap is slightly pulsatile.
The wound is healing well.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 39602**] is capable of taking a full diet, but has had reduced intake of food and water.
You were found to have a bleed inside of your head.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection and pneumonia, so you needed antibiotics.
You underwent a craniotomy on [**2161-6-5**] for the bleeding around your brain and currently are doing well.
While recovering you developed an abnormal heart rhythm which was treated.
There was also one day of diarrhea which has now resolved.
On the day of intended discharge, you had a seizure.
This seizure is sometimes a consequence of subdural hematoma (the bleed that you had) as well as craniotomy.
If you develop weakness of an arm or leg, worsening abnormal sensation in the left hand, involuntary movements, particularly of the left hand or arm, seizure, difficulty with speech, fever, inflammation of the wound site, headache, confusion, or any other concerning symptom, please return to hosptial.
We will give you a letter describing your care here that will be helpful in his ongoing management of your arryhthmia and medications.
