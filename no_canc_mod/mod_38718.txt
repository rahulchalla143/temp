He then reportedly collapsed at the office with a question of seizure like activity, and possible left eye deviation.
At the OSH they got a head CT which apparently was normal and then a CTA which showed an occlusion of the right vertebral artery, and an occlusion in the top of the basilar artery.
There endovascular service was not available and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for endovascular intervention.

Q-T interval prolongation.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Complete occlusion of the basilar artery with multiple acute infarcts in the right cerebellum, right vermis, and bilateral paramedian pons.
Top of the basilar artery, including bilateral posterior cerebrals and superior cerebellar arteries appear patent.
Complete occlusion of the right vertebral artery with intrinsic high T1 signal may represent occlusion secondary to dissection.
MRI/MRA ([**2127-10-19**]): Extensive acute infarctions in the bilateral pons, right superior vermis, and right superior and inferior cerebellum, and small acute infarction in the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere, with expected temporal evolution.
New small acute infarction more superiorly in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Minimal effacement of the right lateral wall of the superior fourth ventricle, new since the prior exam.
Persistent occlusion of the right superior cerebellar artery.
Persistent abnormal irregularity and narrowing of the intracranial right vertebral artery.
Persistent nonvisualization of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
Brief Hospital Course: For two days prior to seeking medical attention, he was experiencing symptoms of nausea, vomitting and headaches.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU following an interventional procedure which recanalized occluded vessels in the posterior circulation (right vertebral artery and top of the basilar artery).
- He was plavix loaded in the interventional suite and while he was receiving both plavix and heparin, he was noted to have some oropharyngeal bleeding that was formally addressed by a bronchoscopic evaluation showing the presence of a traumatic lesion in the soft pharynx.
He does have some very slight volitional movement of his upper extremities along the plane of gravity but this comes with a prolonged reaction time.
- He had a repeat MRI on [**2127-10-19**] which showed completion of his stroke with extensive areas of infarcts in the region of the midbrain and right cerebellum as well as partial recanalization of his right vertebral and basilar artery - His family has remained at his bedside throughout his stay.
- He did spike some fevers during his ICU course associated with a slight elevation in WBC and foul smelling sputum.
Cultures have eventually grown out Coag positive staph aureus for which he is currently receiving IV vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
He is also receiving aztreonam so as to cover for coag negative staph bacteremia.
CV: Regular heart sounds, without murmurs or rubs Pulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: Soft without tenderness or distention Extremities: Without edema or clubbing  Neurological Examination: Mental Status: Eyes are open at baseline.
There is no apparent facial droop or ptosis.
There is no VOR.
Motor: Extensor posturing to pain in both upper extremities.
Some right sided volitional movement along the plane of gravity but is slow.
These are designed to treat a coag positive staph pneumonia and coag negative staph bacteremia.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **], you received treatment at the Intensive Care Unit of the [**Hospital1 69**] for a stroke in the back portion of your brain.
This caused your symptoms of nausea and vomiting for two days, followed by your collapse at your physician's office.
The region of your brain infarcted is called the brainstem, which can control a variety of functions including swallowing, breathing and has passing through connections that control movement.
- Since you have significant swallowing dysfunction, you received a PEG tube that inserts directly into your stomach.
- We initiated you on a medication called IV heparin to keep your blood thin and [**Hospital1 90846**] and prevent future clots.
- You will receive antibiotics for a limited period of time to treat a blood stream infection as well as a pneumonia that you developed while in the ICU.
- We have scheduled an appointment for you to see one of our stroke specialists on the [**10-24**] at 1:00PM.
- In addition to these, you will continue to take CITALOPRAM for depression WARFARIN for blood thinning LISINOPRIL for hypertension SIMVASTATIN for high cholesterol INSULIN as needed for high blood sugars FAMOTIDINE twice daily to prevent stress ulcers in your stomach   Followup Instructions: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 830**], [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 718**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3445**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**] Date/Time:[**2127-12-24**] 1:00                                [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 162**] MD [**MD Number(2) 2575**]  Completed by:[**2127-10-25**
