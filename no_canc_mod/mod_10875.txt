-Hepatitis: Patient reports possible Hep A and Hep B infections in past, reports that follow-up testing showed no chronic infection -Renal insufficiency- began recently.
-Angiography in [**2192**] showing only patent LIMA-LAD  PSH: -CABG [**2191**] -L 3rd toe amp [**2193**] -L SFA angioplasty [**2195**] -L 4th toe amp [**2195**] -L SFA angioplasty and stent [**2196**] -L CFA-AK [**Doctor Last Name **] with vein then PTFE -R 4th toe partial amp [**2197**] -Thrombectomy of L BPG revision with bovine pericardial patch of the distal anastomosis [**9-27**] -Angioplasty of common femoral artery and proximal anastomosis.
Angioplasty of above-knee popliteal artery and distal anastomosis.
Stenting of above-knee popliteal artery for residual stenosis.
[**1-/2198**] -AngioJet thrombectomy and rheolytic thrombolysis of the left common femoral artery to above-knee popliteal artery PTFE bypass graft with Balloon angioplasty of the left popliteal artery stent [**6-/2198**] -Incision and drainage of left leg abscess [**7-/2198**]   Social History: The patient is a make-up artist in a department store.
Tob: Neg EtOH: Occasional EtOH use Drugs: Denies IVDU (history when he was in his 20's)   Family History: CAD with MI in father in his 50s and mother in her 60s DM in both parents HTN in both parents.
Sister also has diabetesCAD with MI in father in his 50s and mother in her 60s DM in both parents HTN in both parents.
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, Pupils equal, round and reactive to light, Extraocular muscles intact His neck is supple, no JVD Chest: Lungs are clear bilaterally Cardiovascular: Normal S1-S2 Abdominal: His belly is soft, nontender, nondistended.
He does not have any guarding or rebound.
No peritoneal signs Rectal: Brown stool that is heme positive GU/Flank: No CVA tenderness Extr/Back: No lower extremity edema and his legs are warm Neuro: Speech fluent Psych: Normal mood, Normal mentation Heme/[**Last Name (un) **]/[**Last Name (un) **]: No petechiae .
ECHO [**7-9**]: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction.
Moderate right ventricular systolic dysfunction in a rather small RV cavity.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
At least mild pulmonary hypertension.
The TandemHeart catheter now terminates in the right atrium and a small residual ASD is seen.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is consistent with pulmonary edema.
Retrocardiac opacification with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with some combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe, pleural effusion, and possible superimposed pneumonia.
GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2199-7-8**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] was a 48 yo M with CAD, DMII, ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p CABG [**2191**] (EF25%), [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease + mild CRI.
He also reported chest pain that was non-pleuritic.
The pt became bradycardic and lost his pulse, and was subsequently coded for 30minutes in the ED with two returns of spontaneous circulation receiving 5 shocks for vfib/vtach, as well as epi, lido, ca, amio, bicarb, then norepi, dobutamine, 5L NS.
60 additional minutes of ACLS ensued with high pressure chest compressions.
He received several rounds of epi, atropine, 4 u of pRBC; also norepi and vasopressin.
Over the course of the pt's admission he developed signs of severe multi-organ system failure (DIC / coagulopathy, shock liver, ARF, cardiogenic and likely distributive shock with Group C Strep) and had a CXR with evidence of massive acute alveolar filling and ?
pleural effusions and ventilator mechanics c/w severely reduced resp system compliance.
