Admission Date:  [**2110-11-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-11-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-7-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Blurry vision in right eye, vertigo, nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cerebral Angiography Intubation/Extubation   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 60 year-old right handed man with a past medical history significant for HTN, hyperlipidemia who presented to the [**Hospital6 3872**] on [**2110-11-12**] with complaints of transient vision loss, vertigo, and dysarthria who is transferred now for management of possible right vertebral artery dissection.
At 10:30am he experienced vertigo and had to hold on to the wall on the right in order to ambulate.
He made it back to his office where he developed slurred speech and a dissociated sensation.
He reports hearing his slurred speech and wondering who sounded like that even though the words were clearly the ones he was trying to say.
There he had an MRI/MRA head and neck which demonstrated an area of restricted diffusion in the right vermis, decreased flow in the right superior cerebellar artery, a 3mm segmental area of high grade stenosis or dissection of the proximal left vertebral artery and a right vertebral artery that terminated in the PICA vs. distal stenosis.
Other than his vision, which remains blurry, his symptoms have resolved.
He denies any recent head or neck trauma, or chiropracter visits.
The patient denied fever, wt loss, appetite changes, cp, palpitations, DOE, sob, cough, wheeze, diarrhea, constipation, abd pain, fecal incont, dysuria, nocturia, urinary incontinence, muscle or joint pain, hot/cold intolerance, polyuria, polydipsia, easy bruising, depression, anxiety, stress, or psychotic sx.
No history of stroke, bleeding aneurysm or heart attacks in the family.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
Attentive, able to name [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] backward without difficulty.
was able to name both high and low frequency objects.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.
There were no paraphasic errors.
There is no ptosis bilaterally.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No asterixis noted.
-Coordination: No intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally.
Able to walk in tandem without difficulty.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation.
No definite structural cardiac source of embolism identified.
Small subacute right cerebellar vermis infarct.
This may be due to technical factors.
No evidence of carotid artery or vertebral artery dissection.
Subtle hypodensities indicating acute infarct at the superior aspect of the right cerebellum.
CTA neck demonstrates non-visualization of the proximal left vertebral artery indicating occlusion/thrombosis with collateral filling of the distal left vertebral artery from V2 segment to vertebrobasilar junction without abnormality.
Normal bilateral carotid and right vertebral arteries with small right vertebral artery as a normal variation.
Nonvisualization of the right superior cerebellar artery.
New occlusion of the distal basilar artery extending into the proximal left PCA and superior cerebellar artery.
The source of this occlusion is unclear, though emboli from the occluded left vertebral artery origin is a possibility.
Right superior cerebellar hypodensity consistent with recent infarct.
CXR ([**11-17**]): FINDINGS: No previous images.
The heart is normal in size and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
An area of increased opacification behind the heart could represent some atelectatic change.
MR/MRA Head ([**11-18**]): IMPRESSION: Bilateral occlusion of the distal vertebral arteries as well as the basilar artery as described in detail above.
Both internal carotid arteries are patent as well as the anterior circulation with poor collateral flow through the posterior communicating arteries demonstrated on the axial source images.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 60 year old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented with a 1 day history of decreased vision from right eye, vertigo, and dysarthria, and was transferred from an OSH with after MRI/MRA head showed infarct in the right cerebellar vermis and absent signal in the proximal left vertebral artery.
The OSH had concern for vertebral dissection, and started him on a heparin gtt.
MRI/A head and neck with T1 fat sats showed small subacute right cerebellar vermis infarct, non-visualization of the proximal left vertebral artery and the V4 or distal segment of the right vertebral artery, and no evidence of carotid artery or vertebral artery dissection.
CTA head/neck to further evaluate the vertebrals showed subtle hypodensities indicating acute infarct at the superior aspect of the right cerebellum, non-visualization of the proximal left vertebral artery indicating occlusion/thrombosis with collateral filling of the distal left vertebral artery from V2 segment to vertebrobasilar junction without abnormality, normal bilateral carotid and right vertebral arteries with small right vertebral artery as a normal variation, and nonvisualization of the right superior cerebellar artery.
He was initially on a heparin gtt, which was discontinued [**11-15**] after MRI/A and CTA showed no vertebral artery dissection.
TTE showed LVEF >60%, no ASD or PFO, mild (1+) MR, no definite structural cardiac source of embolism identified.
On the morning of [**11-17**], he required urgent evaluation for dizziness, mental status changes, and dysarthria.
Upon evaluation, he was found to have right eye ptosis, right facial droop, decreased sensation in right arm/leg, and diplopia.
STAT repeat head/neck CTA showed new occlusion of the distal basilar artery extending into the proximal left PCA and superior cerebellar artery.
This was thought to be due to emboli from the occluded left vertebral artery origin.
Later that afternoon, he decompensated with decreased level of consciousness, dysarthria, and left hemiparesis, so neurosurgery took him for cerebral angiography.
He regained full strength in his bilateral UE and LE, and he is now left with only slight right ptosis and slight right pronator drift.
He was started on Midodrine 5 mg PO bid given his low blood pressure, and this can be weaned in [**3-25**] weeks as tolerated.
Medications on Admission: ASA 81 daily, started 3 days PTA Lisinopril-HCTZ 10-12.5 mg daily Simvastatin 20 mg qhs, hadn't taken in the 1 month PTA  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 392**] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Stroke - right cerebellar vermal infarct, occlusion of the left vertebral artery with progression to occlusion of the basilar artery  SECONDARY: Hypertension alternating with low blood pressure Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: No dysarthria, slight right eye ptosis, visual fields full, smile symmetric, slight right pronator drift, full muscle strength, reflexes brisk but symmetric in the knees and ankles   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with decreased vision in your right eye, dizziness, and nausea.
MRI showed a stroke in your cerebellum, and MRA showed occlusion of your left vertebral artery.
During this hospitalization, you developed worsening dizziness and drooping of your right face, and it was found that the clot extended to your basilar artery which required you to be transferred to the NeuroICU.
You underwent cerebral angiography, but the neurosurgeons were unable to get past the occluded left vertebral artery.
If you develop dizziness or gait imbalance, nausea or vomiting, vision changes or double vision, weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP or return to the ED.
