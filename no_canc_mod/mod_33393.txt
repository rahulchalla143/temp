Patient was admitted on [**2147-5-16**] with a variety of abdominal symptoms.
He developed melena on [**5-17**] and was transferred to the MICU for EGD, which demonstrated Grade II esophageal varices that were banded x 2.
On [**2147-5-19**], he developed sudden onset of large rectal bleed, found to have lost about 900cc of venous blood.
Hct dropped from 30.5 to 21.5, and was transferred back to the MICU for further management of this GI bleed.
In the ICU, he intubated for emergent EGD, which showed frank blood in the esophagus.
Following procedure, the patient has not had a recurrence of UGIB.
He was extubated following improvement in his mental status.
However, mental status continued to wax and wane, and he was treated for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose.
He states he felt weak with abdominal discomfort during his UGIB.
He denies abdominal pain/lightheadedness/weakness currently.
Also denies chest pain/SOB.
No n/v/d/f/c.
Last BM one hour ago, loose, light brown, non-bloody, no melena.

Evidence of hepatic cirrhosis and portal hypertension, with moderate ascites, paraesophageal varices, and marked splenomegaly.
No focally arterial enhancing lesion is identified within the liver parenchyma.
No other hepatic parenchymal lesion is seen to correlate with finding on prior ultrasound study [**2147-4-24**]  Renal u/s IMPRESSION:  1.
Moderate right hydronephrosis with no identified cause.
No hydronephrosis on the left.
A site suitable for percutaneous aspiration of ascites was marked on the right lower anterolateral abdominal wall with patient supine and probe held perpendicular to the skin surface.
There is elevated velocity at the distal portion of the TIPS with peak measurement 151 cm/sec.
There is probable slow reverse flow in the anterior right portal branch, but Doppler tracing is suboptimal, probably as the vessel is diminutive in size as demonstrated on MR study [**2147-5-16**].
The gallbladder is mildly distended with echogenic debris in its dependent portion.
No intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation is seen.
No other focal parenchymal abnormality is identified in the liver.
The pancreatic head and body appear unremarkable, but the pancreatic tail is not fully visualized.
Small bilateral basal pleural effusions are seen.
Site suitable for aspiration of ascites marked on right lower anterior  abdominal wall as indicated above.
Patent TIPS, with flexed appearance and elevated flow velocity at its  distal portion.
Short interval followup is advised.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 53 yo male with hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, encephalopathy admitted on [**2147-5-16**] with abdominal pain secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, treated with ceftriaxone, with hospital course complicated by esophageal variceal bleed x 2.
EGD showed grade II varices with cherry red spots, likely bleeding from esophageal varices.
Performed band ligation x 2.
Called out to floor on [**2147-5-18**]  MICU Course II- Patient transferred back to the MICU with massive GI bleed on [**2147-5-19**].
He underwent urgent EGD which showed a bleeding gastric varices.
He had altered mental status which was thought to be secondary to a combination of hepatic encephalopathy and sedation.
He had no new episodes of GI bleed and did not require any additional blood products while here.
# Variceal hemorrhage- status post TIPS, tolerated procedure well, with decrease in portocaval gradient from 28 mmHg to 10 mmHg (still elevated).
No recurrence of melena/BRBPR since TIPS, hematocrit stable at 28-31.
Received 11 units PRBCs, 10 units of FFP, 2 bags of platelets during course.
#) Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Cell count consistent with SBP on diagnostic paracentesis on [**5-16**], first episode.
#) HCV with cirrhosis: right upper lobe hypoechoic lesion noted on imaging [**4-/2147**], for which MRI was recommended.
Thrombocytopenia and INR also at baseline, suspected to be due to poor synthetic function.
Evidence of prior hepatitis B exposure.
Restarted diuretics prior to discharge, continued nadolol, decreased lactulose.
#) Thrombocytopenia: Stable from last admission, presumably from chronic liver disease.
#) Lower back pain: Appears chronic in nature, no reported new neurologic concerns.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis Upper gastrointestinal bleeding Esophageal varices Abdominal ascites  Secondary: Hepatitis C cirrhosis IVDA with heroin   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain secondary to an infection in the fluid in your abdomen.
You also had a serious gastrointestinal bleed that required placement of a shunt in your liver called a TIPS.
The bleeding stopped and your condition stabilized.
On the day of discharge we removed a little over 3 liters of fluid from your abdomen.
