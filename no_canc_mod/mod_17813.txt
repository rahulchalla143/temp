Of note, this is the third admission in the last 3 weeks for these complaints.
From [**Date range (1) 31835**], patient admitted at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**], with same complaints, found to have lipase 380, thought to be post-ERCP pancreatitis; Per [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] discharge summary, she was found eating despite refusing PO pain medicine or PO antiemetics and requesting IV Benadryl; GI evaluated her at that time who felt that there was no clear GI reason for her nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain at this point.
At that time it was recommended that she not be given narcotic pain medications, and that she continue on her current regimen of.
In summary, the patient is a 29-year-old female with chronic idiopathic pancreatitis with normal ERCP [**2153-3-20**] at [**Last Name (un) **], who reports with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting??????
She has a very specific request for her pain and antiemetic regimen, including 50 mg of IV Benadryl that she only wanted pushed.
It is unclear if this was true vomiting versus vomiting that was induced by the patient or possibly even food that was mixed with water.
She was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 23804**] from Gastroenterology who felt there was not a clear GI reason for her nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain at this point.
She has had a mild lipasemia in the past.
She that she then underwent another upper endoscopy at [**Hospital3 1280**] and diagnosed with duodenal ulcers.
She is not maintained pain on narcotics at home.
?One could certainly question a pancreatitis flare; however, given that she has been found twice trying to sneak food on the floor despite her n.p.o.
status, with ongoing request for nausea and pain medication, I suspect that there is an element of secondary gain overall?????

Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 29yo F PMHx chronic abd pain w serial hospitalizations for same complaints, p/w abdominal pain/nausea/vomiting, requesting IV medications, without radiologic evidence of acute or chronic pancreatitis, hospital stay complicated by respiratory distress in the setting of IV contrast administration, discharged home without narcotic scripts.
Abd pain / nausea / vomitting - Patient with multiple recent admissions for abdominal pain at multiple hospitals.
Did not display signs of acute abdomen on exam; secondary to nausea and pain, patient refused all PO medications, including PPI, narcotics, and requested only IV benadryl/dilaudid.
There was a high concern for chemical abuse; Per GI c/s, CT pancreas ordered to determine if signs of acute/chronic pancreatitis were present; it did not demonstrate signs of acute or chronic pancreatitis, and GI recommended stopping narcotic pain medications.
Abdominal pain was therefore thought to be of non-acute nature, likely [**2-21**] to peptic ulcer observed on EGD at [**Hospital1 **].
# Respiratory Distress - CT pancreas was c/b acute onset SOB, wheezing, for which patient was transferred to ICU.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable, but there was concern for anaphylactoid reaction to contrast.

You were admitted with abdominal pain.
CT of your pancreas did not demonstrate any signs of acute or chronic pancreatitis.
We believe that your abdominal pain is NOT due to pancreatitis, but is instead due to an ulcer that was previously visualized on endoscopy.
This type of pain should NOT be treated with IV narcotic medications or NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen).
During your stay, you developed wheezing in the setting of receiving intravenous contrast.
We are not certain if this represents an allergic reaction, but would recommend caution when considering future use of IV contrast.
