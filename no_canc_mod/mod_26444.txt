Admission Date:  [**2199-8-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-8-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 83M with hx of COPD, afib who was sent to the ER from [**Doctor Last Name **] House after he was found to be tachypneic to the 40s.
Pt states that over the past two weeks, he has been having loose stools and crampy, squeezing abdominal pain.
He has been eating normal meals but his pain worsens after eating.
He describes some nausea but has not had any emesis.
Pt states his breathing has felt fine until the last day when it started to feel labored, associated with productive cough.
He was given solumedrol, albuterol and atrovent nebs to cover for COPD flare.
And he was given 10mg of Lasix for possible CHF but also had received 2L of NS earlier.
Past Medical History: * HTN * COPD, unknown FEV1 * CHF, EF unknown * Afib * Spinal stenosis * anemia * hx of pneumonia * hx of PVD   Social History: 2-3ppd x 48yrs, lives in [**Doctor Last Name **] house; not married, no children; nephews are very involved  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Exam: temp 98.4, BP 110/40, HR 67, R 15, O2 94-98% on 4L Gen: NAD, pleasant, AO x 3 HEENT: MM dry, EOMI, left pupil 4mm and reactive, right pupil 2mmand reactive neck: JVD to 8cm CV: regular Chest: crackles at bilateral bases but otherwise clear Abd: hypoactive bowel sounds, nontender, soft, nondistended, no rebound ext: feet cool; 2+ pitting edema, nonpapable and nondopplerable pulses; dopplerable popliteal pulses, 1+ radial pulse; fingers blue neuro: CN 2-12 intact, 5/5 strength bilaterally   Pertinent Results: ** ADMIT LABS ** WBC-13.6* HCT-31.2* NEUTS-85.7* LYMPHS-9.8* MONOS-3.9 EOS-0.4 BASOS-0.1 PLT COUNT-294 INR(PT)-1.2* .
There is a left lower lobe opacity and small left pleural effusion.
Left lower lobe opacity could represent atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 83M with hx of COPD, afib now in ICU for hypotension found to have abdominal pain and elevated LFTs .
# Shock: Volume depletion vs sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency or combination.
Volume depletion likely due to 2 weeks of loose stools and decreased po intake.
Sepsis also likely given lactate of 4.8, possible pneumonia and possible intra-abd source.
Adrenal insufficiency was impossible to test given that pt received solumedrol in ED.
Cardiogenic shock not likely given lack of EKG changes and negatige enzymes and TTE showed preserved systolic function.
Pt remained afebrile with elevated WBC count, attributed to possible PNA and steroids.
# Transaminitis: ALT and AST equally elevated to the [**2193**] on admission.
Ddx of this includes right heart failure (which may explain elevated BNP), shock liver, viral hepatitis (which could explain pt's abd pain, nausea, diarrhea), med related (he is on 650mg standing tylenol TID), budd chiari.
RUQ US was normal without evidence of clot and tylenol level was neg.
# Abd Pain/diarrhea: Stool was sent for E. coli 0157 given h/o diarrhea and ARF.
It may be secondary to hepatitis A but IgM was pending on time of discharge.
# Tachypnea/COPD: Likely that pt has an underlying pneumonia causing an exacerbation of his underlying COPD.
BNP elevated to 18,000 on admission but appeared dry on exam so he improved with fluids.
He is not anticoagulated likely due to fall risk.
Urine lytes showed FeNa of 0.9% indicating pre-rernal etiology verses acute tubular necrosis from hypotension.
# Glucse Intolerance: Pt was covered with insulin sliding scale but required none.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Atrovent 18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Sepsis 2.
Community Acquired Pneumonia 3.
Diarrhea, ?
Acute Renal Failure [**3-7**] acute tubular necrosis .
COPD 2.
Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: good, afebrile and oxygenating well on 3L   Discharge Instructions: Take all medications as prescibed and go to all follow-up appointments.
Return to the ER or call your PCP if you experience any dizziness, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
