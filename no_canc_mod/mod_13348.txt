No evidence of left hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 61yo female with mental retardation, DM II, HTN, nephrolithiasis was brought from the [**Hospital 17065**] hospital ED to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for acute renal failure (Cr 11.6) and hypotension on dopamine gtt.
A renal U/S showed R kidney stone with mild hydronephrosis.
Nephrology was consulted and decided that the patient has no acute need for dialysis despite a  very elevated creatinine.
In the ICU she received a 3 day course of levofloxacin for possible urinary tract infection and a single dose of vancomycin for a single coag-neg Staph negative culture bottle from the outside ED from where she was transferred.
Her renal function improved rapidly and she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable in the ICU.
CXR showed questionable opacification at the L and R bases and she was continued on levofloxacin (for total 10d course) for empiric coverage of community-acquired pneumonia.
Her medications for hypertension and diabetes were reinstituted without complication.
Psychiatry consultation recommened the addition of remeron and seroqual for depression and and anxiety respectively.
Quetiapine Fumarate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5-1 Tablet PO BID PRN () as needed for anxiety.
Acute Prerenal Failure 2.
Hypotension 3.
Recurrent UTI's, with nephrolithiasis and right sided nephrolithiasis causing mild hydronephrosis 4.
Type II Diabetes 5.
Hypertension 6.
Mental Retardation 7.
Depression and Anxiety 8.
Superficial thrombophlebitis   Discharge Condition: Fair  Discharge Instructions: Please return to the emergency room should you experience high fever > 101F and shaking chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or other alarming symptom.
Followup Instructions: 1) Please follow-up with your Urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59213**] for planned treatment for your renal calculi.
