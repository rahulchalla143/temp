Irrigation and debridement of open tibia fracture site.
Relocking of tibial nail distally with additional     locking screws for rotational control.
He was brought to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital where he reportedly had a GCS of 11 and was intubated after he became combative.
He was found to have SDH and ICH on CT scan and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: Upon arrival T:97.4     BP:116/61     HR:80    RR:15    O2Sats:100% intubated Gen:Intubated, sedated, paralyzed with vecuronium HEENT: Pupils: PERRL         EOMs-unable to test No otorrhea or rhinorrhea.
Multiple subdural hematomas as described above, without mass effect and subarachnoid hemorhage.
9 x 8 mm intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left temporal lobe, stable in size when compared to outside hospital head CT. Hemorrhagic contusions noted in the frontal and temporal lobes bilaterally.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage noted in the frontal regions bilaterally.
Occipital bone fracture extending down to the foramen magnum.
Extensive mucosal thickening of all paranasal sinuses.
Air-fluid level in sphenoid sinus, skull base fracture cannot be excluded.
Partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells without evidence of underlying fracture.
[**2170-12-20**] Repeat Head CT scan IMPRESSION: 1 New surrounding edema associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe.
New areas of hyperintensity tracking along the vermian cistern that represent new subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect or herniation.
Occipital bone fracture extending down to the foramen magnum.
No evidence of flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm; contour irregularity to suggest dissection noted in the carotid and vertebral arteries in the head and neck.
However, MRA of the head with fat- sat sequences is more sensitive study in the detection of dissection if there is continued concern.
Slightly prominent left lobe of the thyroid, not adequately assessed on the present study.
There is also occlusion of the ostiomeatal units on both sides.
He was also evaluated by  Neurosurgery for his traumatic brain injury; this was non operative.
While on the nursing unit he was intermittently agitated requiring 1:1 sitter.
He pulled his Dobbhoff and peripheral line.
Sitters have remained in place due to his poor safety awareness and impulsivity associated with his brain injury.
He was noted with an erythematous area along his distal right lower extremity incision.
Milk of Magnesia 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML's PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
