In general, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27983**] he was in his normal state of health two days prior to admission; the day prior to admission he felt fatigued, but didn't develop CP or SOB until lying in bed the night prior to admission.
At this time, he had difficulty lying flat.
This morning, he continued to have CP and started having N/V- according to his wife this is not characteristic for his usual CP.
Mr. [**Known lastname 27984**] wife explains that his functional capacity had been decreasing over the past year in the setting of multiple CHF exacerbations.
However, he had been doing well since he was last hospitalized in [**6-20**] for gouty arthritis and aspiration PNA.
He does not get chest pain or shortness of breath with either activity.
He describes occasionally getting chest pain at home, the last time two months ago, that always resolves with sublingual nitro.
He weighs himself daily and is usually around 164-166 lbs; he has not noticed this increasing lately and weight on Saturday was 167 lbs.
He denies any recent swelling in his legs.
He did develop a dry cough this am, but did not have a cough prior.
No fever, no recent illness.
Admission to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**6-20**] for fever and joint pain that was attributed to gouty arthritis.
EKG showed intraventricular conduction delay with ST elevations but no intervention per cards fellow.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Carotid stenosis 60-69% right ICA stenosis, 70-79% left ICA stenosis in [**7-/2125**] DMII- last HgA1C 7.7 Gout PVD Depression and Anxiety  Social History: Retired.
He typically is able to walk short distances in his house.
Family History: B: Died of MI at 42, B: had multiple MIs; F, M: died.
Extrem: No erythema, warmth or prominent effusion in any joint.
Some pain to manipulation of elbow joints, R>L.
Thick fingers with multiple small nodules on L DIPs that appear to be tophi.
Full ROM in knees and ankles without pain upon manipulation.
No pain with pressure to muscles in calves, thighs or arms.
Dark discoloration on anterior lower legs bilaterally consistent with venous changes.
CV - S1, S2 with 2-3/6 systolic murmur at the LUSB.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**1-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with marked global hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-3-12**], the severity of aortic regurgitation is increased (may be related to much higher systemic blood pressure).
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Multifocal pneumonia and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema are unchanged.
Moderate cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
No pneumothorax.
The lung volumes continue to be low, with an unchanged aspect of the bilateral, predominantly basal parenchymal opacities, likely to reflect a combination of pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
Video Swallow study: IMPRESSION: Aspiration with thin liquids and penetration with nectar consistency.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year old gentleman with a history of 3 vessel CAD s/p CABGx3 and multiple stents, CHF, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, CRF who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain and worsening SOB.
Respiratory failure thought to be secondary to septic shock from PNA with additional element of CHF; patient had recurrent fevers and  He was intubated and Swan was placed showing increased wedge and decreased SVR, confirming septic shock as well as CHF component.
# Pneumonia/Septic Shock: Pt found to have multifocal pna on CXR and sepsis.
Initially intubated and swanned which showed cardiac pressures consistant with septic shock.
Pt was treated with a course of Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin and Flagyl for pneumonia and transitioned to Vanc/Zosyn to end of course.
CXR on [**2126-11-5**] showed no change in pneumonia but pt was weaned off O2 and has had no significant cough or SOB.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF:  Known diastolic and systolic CHF with EF 35% on ECHO [**11-4**].
Given history of multiple CHF exacerbations, spironolactone was started at low dose.
On discharge his weight was 68.8 kg or 151 pounds  # Leukocytosis and Fever: WBC peaked at 18 and decreased to 11.7 by discharge.
Despite improvement of the pneumonia, WBC continued to be elevated and pt had recurrent fevers.
Recurrent low grade fevers were attributed to gout flair with elevated UA and arthralgias and warm joints.
Pt has been afebrile for the 4 days prior to discharge.
# Delerium: Likely [**2-12**] hospitalization, acute illness and disrupted sleep schedule.
Cleared somewhat before discharge although pt continues to have mild confusion.
Clonazepam was not continued during hospital stay because of somnolance and confusion.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr 1.5-1.7, creatinine as high as 3.0, decreased to 1.8 by day of discharge.
History of acute onset CP in the setting of pulmonary edema concerning for MI on admission.
No cardiac cathatheterization done.
# Gout: Arthalgias and a few warm joints and low grade recurrent fevers.
Rheumatology consult felt pain and stiffness was was multifactorial including arthritis, torn rotator cuff and gout.
