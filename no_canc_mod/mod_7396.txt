FINDINGS:  There has been interval worsening of CHF pattern in both lungs with increased alveolar and interstitial markings.
In addition, there appears to be an increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
An underlying consolidation at the right lung base cannot be excluded.
No pneumothorax is identified on this radiograph.
IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of CHF and possible new right lower lobe infiltrate.
No pneumothorax is seen on this study.
Left sided pleural based catheter.
Follow up CXR showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
Resp Distress: She has had an acute decompensation due to mucous plugging.
Bronch at the [**Hospital1 **] revelaed tracheomalacia with dynamic collapse and right lower lobe obstruction.
Bronchoscopy was repeated in the ICU, and showed no evidence of tracheomalacia, but dynamic collapse throughout likely related to her COPD; as well as evidence of friable mucosa.
Continued chest PT, Azithromycin and Zosyn for possible pneumonia as seen on chest x-ray.
She continued to be diuresed, albeit gently given her history of metabolic alkalosis, and her persistent hypotension.
On discharge, her CT continued to show evidence of pulmonary edema, and she was continued on PRN Lasix with goal I/O of negative 1 L/day as her BP tolerated.
Decrease in Hct: The patient's Hct slowly decreased over a few days after admission, from 37 to 33 to 29.
Retic count was 3.0%, with elevated LDH and haptoglobin of 103.
There was no evidence of hemorrhage, and this drop was thought to likely be secondary to some dilution with the IVFs given for hypotension.
Coumadin was held since she was having a bronch, but was restarted prior to discharge, and should be titrated to an INR of 2.0 - 2.5.
Glucose: She had elevated blood sugars and was started on an Insulin SS.
Albuterol-Ipratropium 103-18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Four (4) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for hypoxia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: CHF COPD pneumothorax   Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
