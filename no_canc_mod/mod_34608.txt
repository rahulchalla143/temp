The patient was recently admitted (discharged on the 16th), with ESBL E. coli urosepsis, treated with meropenum x 14d (finished course on [**1-4**]), started developing weakness and lethary and mild confusion simliar to his prior UTIs.
But reports lethargy and fatigue since last hospitalization.
Of note, he has had 3 prior hospitalizations this year for UTI, encephalopathy, and transaminitis ([**Month (only) 547**]); neuro ICU for sepsis with unresponsiveness and "shaking" ([**Month (only) 116**]); and ESBL E.coli urosepsis ([**Month (only) **]).
Patient was given linezolid 600mg and imipenem 2g for broad coverage and allergy to Vancomycin (pancytopenia).
UA was positive, but no bacteria present.

10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. [**1-16**] Urine culture: final, no growth [**1-18**] urine culture: >100K colonies GPCs, likely alpha-hemolytic strep or lactobacillus [**1-14**] Blood culture: final, no growth 12/5,7 Blood cultures: pending, NGTD  IMAGING: [**1-14**] CXR: There are low lung volumes.
No focal consolidation is appreciated on this limited view.
A small left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.
Compared to prior exam, there is decreased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.
No evidence of abscess.
Trabeculated bladder with pseudodiverticulum, likely sequela of neurogenic bladder.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.
No hydronephrosis or masses.
There is no evident pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There are low lung volumes.
(PICC repositioned by IR following this CXR)  Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old male with multiple sclerosis (MS), neurogenic bladder with [**Month (only) **] [**Month (only) 54192**] foley and [**Month (only) 16169**] urinary tract infections (UTIs), recently admitted three weeks ago with ESBL E.coli UTI, who presented with weakness/lethargy, consistent with past episodes of urosepsis.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Presumed urosepsis:  The patient presented with weakness and lethargy, consistent with initiating symptoms of urosepsis, as per the patient's wife.
[**Name (NI) 227**] the patient's history and [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 54192**] Foley for spastic bladder, likely urinary source of infection.
In the past has grown MRSA and ESBL E. coli from urine.
Chest xray with no obvious infiltrate.
He was treated with Meropenum and linezolid given historical infections and pancytopenia last admission with vancomcyin treatment.
He had a subsequent urine culture that grew GPCs, likely alpha hemolytic strep or lactobacillus.
It was unclear at the time if these were true pathogens or colonizers, but no antibioitic change was made because meropenem would cover these organisms as well.
He will plan to see him after this acute illness resolves and pull his foley, have him fitted for a condom cath, and recieve botox injections to the bladder.
# Pancytopenia:  Has had pancytopenic reaction to vancomycin in the past, noted to have downtrending WBC count during this stay while on linezolid.
# Transaminitis:  Patient's transaminitits elevated from baseline on admission, initially thought to be possibly secondary to hypotension with some element of shock liver.
# Seizure disorder: Continued Dilantin 200 mg qhs.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 932**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS urinary tract infection pancytopenia transaminitis  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES multiple sclerosis seizure disorder hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital because you were having sleepiness and fevers.
We think that you had bacteria spreading from an infection in your urine into your blood which caused these symptoms.
You were treated with antibiotics and lots of fluids in your IV and your blood pressure slowly got better and your sleepiness improved.
