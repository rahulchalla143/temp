History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in [**2109-8-3**].
Diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
History of wound abscess in the right lower extremity which grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
History of cesarean section.
Questionable history of Penicillin allergy, but she does state otherwise that she has no known drug allergies.
Epogen 20,000 units q Monday, Wednesday and Friday with hemodialysis as well as using MSIR 50 mg q12hours.
The patient was admitted with increasing right lower extremity pain and low grade temperature.
She was otherwise feeling OK except complaining of persistent right lower extremity pain.
She had no jugular venous distention and no carotid bruit.
The lungs were clear but decreased throughout.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, scaphoid, no hepatosplenomegaly, no pulsatile masses and no bruit.
She had some dry and wet gangrene involving the right forefoot with a failed right first toe amputation site that clearly had some purulent exudate.
Her phosphate was noted to be elevated at 11.8.
Therefore, in hospital medications, she had her Calcitriol stopped and she was started on Amphojel and PhosLo.
Over the next couple days, her pain was appropriately controlled with Dilaudid PCA although the patient demanded that the Dilaudid did not work for her.
This was given concomitantly and resulted in some mental status changes and confusion which quickly resolved upon removal of her narcotic.
She had a foot culture from [**2110-8-25**], that grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Her fingerstick was mildly elevated but she was noncompliant and was not taking a diabetic or renal diet.
At this time, her stump which had been resected back to the level of the proximal one third of the right lower extremity was clean, dry and intact with staples in place, no erythema, no exudate, no evidence of hematoma and the flaps were warm.
The patient is deemed appropriate and stable for discharge.
