Antenatal testing included a normal triple screen and normal fetal survey noticing microsomia at 21 weeks gestational age.
Premature delivery occurred secondary to premature labor.
The week prior to delivery this infant was noted to have fetal dysrhythmias.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory - Post natal course was complicated by respiratory distress syndrome.
She is currently on Diuril  20 mg/kg/dose b.i.d..  She has been maintained on 250 cc of oxygen FiO2 100% and continues to have mild subcostal retractions.
She had a capillary blood gas drawn on [**2195-6-18**] to rule out carbon dioxide retention which was normal (7.43/49/56/34).
Originally concerns were for frequent premature atrial contractions and bigeminy with a low resting heart rate, often times, in the 70s.
In addition to the premature atrial contractions, a  persistent III/VI holosystolic murmur was identified as a persistent small patent ductus arteriosus as well as two small mid muscular ventricular septal defects.
There was also an aneurysm of the septum primum without shunt.
Cardiology did not feel that this patient's respiratory status or oxygen requirement was realted to her cardiac lesion.
She is on potassium supplementation because of her diuretic therapy.
Renal - [**Known lastname 6624**] remains on Amoxacillin prophylaxis for moderate left hydronephrosis.
Gastroenterology - [**Known lastname 6624**] has a large epigastric fascial defect.
On [**6-2**] she had an episode of pallor and abdominal distention.
Genetics - Because of [**Known lastname 56238**] cardiac defect as well as her epigastric wall defect, Genetics was consulted for a suspicion of a [**Doctor Last Name 37202**]-Wiedemann variant.
Newborn screen - A follow up newborn screen was sent for a slightly elevated 1708 progesterone level and was within normal range.
Neurology - A [**Known lastname **] ultrasound was performed on [**5-7**] and was normal.
There is persistent concern about muscular hypotonia in this infant.
Chronic Lung Disease  Initial hypoglycemia resolved.
Nonconductive premature atrial contractions, resolved  Small persistent ductus arteriosus.
Two small muscular ventricular septal defects.
Left-sided renal hydronephrosis.
Large epigastric fascial defect.
