Admission Date:  [**2171-5-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-10-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: fish / Spiriva with HandiHaler / Lithium  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 91849**] is a 66 year old male with history of COPD, recurrent pneumonias in setting of Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], multiple sclerosis, and recurrent aspiration.
He was admitted on [**5-15**] to the MICU for hypoxemia and hypotension.
Per previous notes, he has a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias of unclear etiology - he has a G tube in place through which he gets tube feeds nightly.
His history is significant for esophageal dysmotility of unclear etiology; furthermore, he carries a diagnosis of Churg [**Doctor Last Name 3532**] vasculitis and multiple sclerosis.
He also has COPD and is on 2 L of oxygen at home that he uses inconsistently.
In the past, he also had a pulmonary embolus for which an IVC filter was placed.
His prior history of his recurrent pneumonia is as follows, taken from hospital records: in early spring of [**2169**], the patient was well enough to have a vacation in the [**Country 13622**] Republic, swimming, etc.
Over the past 16 months, however the patient has had multiple bouts of pneumonia that number 15-20.
He first presented in the spring of [**2169**] with cough, shortness of breath, yellow thick sputum, chest tightness, weakness and wheezing.
He was treated with antibiotics and prednisone with a presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia and improved, only to have a relapse of symptoms within days to week or so.
This happened several times in the spring of [**2169**] and by mid spring of last year, he was noted to have high levels of peripheral eosinophils as well as eos in his sputum (BAL [**7-/2169**]), and the patient was treated for worms given his exposure abroad.
In the summer of [**2170**], given gastroesophageal reflux disease and significant esophageal dysmotility, potentially leading to his recurrent pneumonias, a decision was made to place a G-tube, through which he now gets his tube feeds and medications.
Several motility and EGD studies have not revealed a clear cause for his dysmotility.
On the day of admission, he developed a fever to 101; the night prior he said he felt short of breath after his evening tube feed.
He says his aspiration events occur at night, after he lays down, following his G tube feedings.
In the ED, his systolic blood pressure fell to 89; he had 2 L of fluid given with improvement in his pressure to 100 systolic.
Chest x-ray was obtained showing bilateral lower lobe infiltrates that remain unchanged from prior chest x-ray and likely are secondary to his underlying eosinophilic process.
His outpatient pulmonologist was consulted and the suspician was for aspiration pneumonia related to tube feeds as a precipitation for this acute presentation.
The patient has a history of chronic lower back pain on morphine, however this was held out of concern for respiratory failure.
On the floor, patient is without complaint.
His back pain has returned, and he would like morphine.
He also notes some chronic b/l lower leg pain.
Past Medical History: Suspected Churg [**Doctor Last Name 3532**] Recurrent aspiration pneumonia h/o PE s/p IVC filter MS (diagnosed in [**2158**], presenting with optic neuritis and lower extremity weakness) chronic back pain s/p spinal fusion depression bipolar disorder hypothyroidism henia repair multiple spinal compression fractures (thought to be secondary to prednisone use) COPD with 2L NC at home OSA with CPAP at home  Social History: 75 pack year h/o smoking; quit several years ago.
[**5-16**] CXR: There is significant bibasal infiltrate, much of which is linear suggesting an atelectatic component.
Poor inspiratory effort and low lung volumes.
Discharge labs:   Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY:  Mr [**Known lastname 91849**] is a 66 year old male with history of COPD, recurrent pneumonias in setting of Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], multiple sclerosis, and recurrent aspiration, admitted to MICU [**5-15**] and treated for aspiration pneumonia.
# Cough/Fever: Given his history, the most likely etiology was aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, as time course and presentation fits with this.
# Chronic lung disease: Patient has suspected Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], for which he is on a prednisone taper, and azathioprine.
# Weight loss, eosinophila:  [**Month (only) 116**] be explained by Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], however there is a concern for potential underlying malignancy.
# Bipolar disease - continued quetiapine and citalopram .
# Hyperlipidemia - continued pravastatin .
# Back pain, leg pain - continued gabapentin, morphine, fentanyl  .
# Hypothyroidism - continued levothyroxine .
# Multiple sclerosis - continued immunosuppression as above .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -consider heme/onc referral for weight loss, persistent peripheral eosinophilia -consdier tube feeding during the waking hours (or as much during day hours as possible) to prevent aspiration (which typically occurs at night)  Medications on Admission: 1. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Doctor Last Name **]: One (1) Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Disp:*8 Tablet* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for fever, and this was most likely related to a pneumonia or inflammation in your lung from aspiration.
You should also attempt to keep your tube feeds running during the day, rather than at night, to prevent future aspiration.
