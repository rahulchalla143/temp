Admission Date:  [**2111-6-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-7-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Swollen foot, Renal failure, Diarrhea, anion gap acidosis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right ankle joint arthrocentesis  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 25301**] is a 55 year old male with h/o T2DM, chronic vasculitic renal failure, who presents with diarrhea and swollen foot, and question of DKA.
Mr. [**Known lastname 25301**] was in his USOH until 3 weeks ago when he developed cough, sputum, and vomiting (nonbilious, no blood or coffee grounds), approximately QOD.
Then three days prior to admission, he developed diarrhea ([**5-27**] BM/d, no blood, no melena, no floating, but foul-smelling, watery).
His symptoms progressed to weakness and dyspnea with climbing one flight of stairs.
His wife notes some decreased level of consciousness 2 days prior to admission and thereafter.
Incidentally also notes swollen R foot (lateral aspect) over last two days.
But, does note polyuria and polydipsia.
Past Medical History: Chronic urticarial vasculitis Hypocomplementemic vasculitis with chronic renal failure (Baseline Cr 1.9-2.4) H/o polymyositis T2DM Hypertension     Social History: Lives in [**Location 246**] with wife.
NECK: JVP flat, supple, but tender diffuse shotty lymph nodes.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia 105, T wave flattening in III, no STT changes.
Shotty lymph nodes noted throughout the mediastinum and hila and right axilla.
Single enlarged lymph node in the left axilla.
Echo Study Date of [**2110-1-9**] EF >70%, Mild LVH .
CXR [**2111-6-15**] 9:13 AM The heart size and pulmonary vascularity are normal.
There is a small calcified granuloma present in the left midlung region.
The lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions.
CXR [**2111-6-17**]:  New right lower lobe opacities which may represent atelectasis, infectious consolidation, or infarction.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Venous Dopplers, [**2111-6-18**]: CONCLUSION: 1.
Possible Pes Anserinus Bursitis or Bakers cyst.
Ankle Mortise, [**2111-6-18**]: The ankle mortise is definitely intact with no evidence of disruption and the cortical margin of the talus, tibia and fibula are unremarkable.
CONCLUSION:  Soft tissue swelling and question of slight widening of the first intermetatarsal space worrisome for early changes of osteoarthropathy.
[**2111-6-19**], Lung Scan/VQ Scan IMPRESSION:  No evidence of PE .
There are expansile lucent lesions involving the phalanges of the left fifth toe, which were also present previously but have apparently progressed.
These findings are concerning for osteomyelitis.
Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis was concerning for an aggressive infection in the setting of diabetes and relative immunosuppression from MMF.
Toxic granulations + dohle bodies were present in his CBC.
His cellulitis showed slow but steady improvement.
He was seen by rheumatology who performed an arthrocentesis on his ankle that was negative for crystals and negative for infection.
An MRI of the foot was concerning for osseous lesion of the 5th metatarsal which was evaluated by podiatry.
Podiatry felt that a biopsy and/or I&D was warranted but after talking with ID felt that it could wait until RLE cellulitis resolved.
He was started on his regular home insulin regimen and he had no further problems with anion gap acidosis during his hospitalization.
Diarrhea/vomiting: The etiology of Mr. [**Known lastname **] diarrhea and vomiting were unclear.
His diarrhea and vomiting also resolved shortly after admission and no source was identified.
Acute on chronic renal failure: Mr. [**Known lastname **] acute renal failure upon admission (Creatinine 3.2) was thought to be a pre-renal etiology in the setting of diarrhea, vomiting, polyuria, and possibly insensible losses at home from infection.
His hypocomplementemic vasculitic kidney disease was stable during this admission.
DOE/tachycardia: Mr. [**Known lastname 25301**] complained of dyspnea on exertion, required 2 L nasal cannula to maintain his oxygen saturation and was persistently tachycardia (HR 95-100) but both the DOE and tachycardia resolved.
Additionally, the patient complained of a tender, erythematous, indurated rash with question of a venous cord on the medial aspect of his left thigh which was concerning for DVT.
A CT angiogram was not performed to rule out DVT given the patient's chronic renal failure from kidney disease as well as the low probability result from VQ scan.
Rheum recommended a course of steroids if pain and inflammation worsened but it did not by time of discharged and he was discharged home on colchicine which he will be on until his follow up appointment with rheumatology.
Discharge Instructions: Please follow-up with your PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 311**] or return to the ED if you have high fevers, shaking chills, or worsening of your leg infection.
Please seek medical attention if you have the sudden onset of shortness of breath or chest pain.
