There is moderate-to-severe cerebral atrophy with associated prominence of the sulci and ventricles.
There is extensive low density in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease in a patient of this age.
Internal carotid arterial calcifications are again noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with pmhx parkinson's disease here with syncopal event and hypotension.
The patient remained stable throughout the night and did not require additional fluids and no additional episodes of hypotension/ snycope.
Pt was empircally started on Zosyn given previous urine cx data from previous admission in [**Month (only) **].
Likely combination of infection given positive ua that was untreated during last admission and hypovolemia, mildly orthostatic on initial exam and BP responded to fluids (3.5L in ED).
Additionally, autonomic dysfunction from Parkinsons and/or vasovagal episode while eating breakfast could have contributed.
The patients troponins mildly elevated initially, but flat CK and 2nd set negative.
no ekg changes on admission --> unlikely cardiac.
No evidence of pna on CXR and BC pending.
-treat UTI with zosyn based on urine cx during last admission - f/u on urine cx & sensitivities and blood cx -bolus with IVF prn, does not need maintenance fluids at this time -monitor bp, keep map > 65 -f/u CXR this AM -complete romi --> 3rd set pending -monitor on tele .
# UTI: Based on last urine cx, will treat with zosyn given previous resistance & sensitivity data.
-f/u urine cx and sensitivies and adjust antibiotics accordingly .
# Change in Mental Status: Pt was confused and disoriented overnight.
# Chronic pain/neuropathy: cont neurontin renally dosed .
