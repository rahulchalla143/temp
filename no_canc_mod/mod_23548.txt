Admission Date:  [**2153-7-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-7-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-11-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Chief Complaint: Seizure Reason for MICU transfer: s/p intubation for combative post-ictal state   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: This is a 58 year old gentleman with a history of recurrent syncope and systolic heart failure (EF 35%) who presented to the ED for pre-syncope w/u and was observed to have a tonic clonic seizure with combative post-ictal state who was intubated for airway protection.
His reported presentation appeared to be consistent with heat syncope.
This morning he was noted to have a generalized tonic clonic seizure that lasted approximately 5 minutes which resolved without intervention.
His post ictal state was notable for being unresponsive to verbal stimuli and significant combativeness.
A CT scan demosntrated no intracranial injury and mild age inappropriate prominenence of the sulci which appeared stable compared to prior imaging.
A serum and urine tox screens were added on to his prior samples and were notable for a positive urine cocaine and negative for etoh.
The description of prior episodes of syncope/presyncope were felt to unlikely represent seizures and did not appear to be related to the GTC today.
Given absence of findings on CT scan, his presenting seizure was felt to represent an induced event rather than primary epilepsy.
Menigitis/encephalitis was considered, however given the absence of infectious signs and absence of fever, a lumbar puncture was not immediately recommended or pursued.
Prior w/u at OSH and by his cardiologist have revealed evidence of cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) attributed to multivessel CAD vs etoh.
Also notes significant decrease in short term memory, family needs to write notes every where around the house for directions.
Chronic systolic heart failure (?
Hypertension 4.
Dyslipidemia 5.
Primary (vs. secondary) prevention of coronary artery disease 6.

Mild left basilar atelectasis.
The lungs are otherwise without a focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT ([**2153-7-5**], final): There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, large vessel territorial infarction, shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles and sulci again appear prominent for the patient's age, but stable.
No acute fractures are identified.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted in the ethmoidal and right maxillary sinuses.
Stable appearance in comparison to the prior study with no acute intracranial process identified.
If clinical suspicion for an acute infarction is high, MR is the recommended study of choice.
LIVER/GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND ([**2153-7-5**]): IMPRESSION:  Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 58 year old gentleman with a history of recurrent syncope and systolic heart failure (EF 35%) who presented to the ED for pre-syncope w/u and was observed to have a tonic clonic seizure with combative post-ictal state who was intubated for airway protection.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Seizure: Pt had generalized tonic clonic seizure in ED, most likely withdrawal seizure in setting of EtOH abstinence x2 days and polysubstance abuse (UTox positive for cocaine).
CT head without acute findings.
No prior seizure history but has h/o several recent unwitnessed syncopal episodes in setting of EtOH cessation.
Patient received one dose of ativan 4mg IV for agitation while still intubated in MICU; after extubation he did not require more ativan over next few hours.
Patient was continued on CIWA with ativan (can switch to Valium on floor given normal liver synthetic function and fatty liver but no obvious cirrhosis on RUQ ultrasound).
# Syncope: H/o recurrent pre-syncopal/syncopal events in past year which have all occured in setting of etoh cessation.
Some of the events have been witnessed but no evidence of tonic clonic activity during the past, no episodes of blacking out, no loss of bladder control, never had tongue bite or incontinence, or confusion post episode.
He was seen in the outpt setting by Neurology who felt his sx were not c/w seizure and ordered a CT scan of his which was unremarkable.
Recently had extensive w/u at [**Hospital 4199**] hospital including TTE and [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts which revealed cardiomyopathy and no evidence of malignant arryhthmia.
A follow-up TTE with Valsalva maneuver was negative for a left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
# EtOH/polysubstance abuse, elevated LFTs: Long h/o EtOH abuse, per wife cut down considerably in recent years w/ recent effort at abstience.
Etoh level 0 on arrival, UTox positive for cocaine.
LFTs elevated in 2:1 ratio consistent with EtOH hepatitis.
RUQ ultrasound showed fatty liver, no nodularity.
Patient received banana bag in ICU, to be followed by PO folate/MV and 3 days of thiamine 500mg IV BID (given altered mental status which could represent Wernicke's encephalopathy).
# Coronary Artery Disease: Systolic Heart Failure: Most recent TTE demonstrates global sysolic dysfunction w/ apical hypokinesis and EF 35%.
Etiology felt to be multivessel disease versus cardiomyopathy of etoh.
The cath lab will call Mr. [**Known lastname **] with formalized schueduling.
In the MICU he received ativan for agitation due to EtOH withdrawal, and was then extubated to room air without further issues, good oxygen sats.
# Memory loss: family reports patient has had progressive memory loss over several years.
# Hypertension: Longstanding hypertension.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department after a syncopal event (fainting) while at work.
In the setting of a recent seizure and active alcohol withdrawal, it was not considered safe to proceed with an invasive procedure during this admission.
