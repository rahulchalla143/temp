Admission Date:  [**2159-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-7-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-2-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**] Chief Complaint: non-healing ulcer LLE  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: LLE diagnostic angiogram 6/24 L SFA-->Peroneal bpg with R cephalic arm vein [**7-13**]   History of Present Illness: 83yo M, h/o IDDM, CKD (stage 3) and PVD, who presents for elective angiogram.
He has a history of calf claudication for which he received a right femoral to peroneal bypass with in situ saphenous graft in [**2153**].
He has done well until ~3-4 months ago when he noticed LLE pain in the calf and foot with an ulcer developing on the left outer border of the foot.
Given his renal insufficiency, he is being admitted pre-procedure for renal protective measures for a scheduled angiogram tomorrow.
Denies any EtOH use or recreational drugs.
Family History: Patient was an orphan and thus is not aware of family hx of cardiac diseases.
Physical Exam: AFVSS Gen: NAD CV: reg Chest: sternotomy incision well healed Pulm: no resp distress Abd: R sided vertical incision well healed, S/NT/ND Ext: bilateral edema R/L.
Renal protective measures included mucomyst and bicarbonate drip.
Post-procedure he developed midly elevated creatinine (1.7 on admission, 1.3 at nadir, then rose to 1.9), so his diuretic was held.
He therefore underwent a L Fem-->peroneal bypass with RUE arm vein on [**2159-7-13**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**], who was away at the time and the patient preferred to have the bypass performed asap).
He received a R IJ CVL due to limited venous access, and was monitored via a R axillary arterial line since further distal access attempts were unsuccessful and the other three limbs being unavailable (two involved in the procedure and the RLE having a prior bypass was contraindicated for femoral arterial line placement).
Procedure proceeded fairly straightforward; please see operative report for details; at the conclusion he had a palpable vein graft pulse medially and dopplerable signal distally.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative and repeat TTE was grossly unchanged without any focal wall motion abnormalities.
Podiatry consult recommended santyl cream, which is being implemented, and a foot XR showed no osteomyelitis.
He was noted by bedside RN to have difficulty swallowing, was evaluated by swallow consult and video swallow study who approved him for grounds solids, thin liquids, and crushed meds.
