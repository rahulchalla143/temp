Admission Date:  [**2148-8-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-10-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy and nausea   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2148-8-12**] External ventricular drain [**2148-8-15**] Redo stereotactic third ventriculostomy   History of Present Illness: The patient woke the morning of admission and had one episode of vomiting with breakfast and then went back to sleep.
At [**Hospital1 **] he got a head CT w/wo contrast that showed a possible rind enhancing lesion although as they didn't have his prior imaging they could not tell if this was surgical change vs residual/recurrent abscess, and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Per the patient and the family he has only had some increased sleepiness, and has not had the headaches, hallucinations and unresponsiveness he had when he was initially diagnosed with his brain lesions.
He was taken to [**University/College **] for evaluation when fluid filled cysts were noted on his imaging.

Additionally, there is a 5- mm subependymal nodule along the left lateral wall of the third ventricle, with nodular enhancement along the ependyma of the left lateral ventricular trigone, abutting the choroid.
The regions of enhancement are associated with restricted diffusion as well as extensive parenchymal signal abnormality within the right peritrigonal region.
There is an additional thin linear region of enhancement within the cerebral aqueduct.
There is a somewhat angulated configuration to the cervicomedullary junction without focal signal abnormality or syrinx.
There is marked abnormality of the right globe, which is deformed and demonstrates significant enhancement within the region of the anterior chamber.
Additionally, there is enlargement and irregular enhancement of the right lacrimal gland.
Of note, this does not appear to be associated with restricted diffusion.
Additional nodular enhancement is present throughout the quadrigeminal palte and superior vermian cisterns.
There is a questionable enhancing leptomeningeal nodule within the posterior surface of the thoracic spinal cord at the T2.
It is unclear whether or not this is venous enhancement.
There is extensive multifocal nodular ependymal and intraventricular enhancement, extending up to and through the right frontal prior  ventriculostomy catheter tract.
There is associated restricted diffusion and the findings likely relate to infectious ventriculitis, ependymitis and associated cerebritis with no discrete focus of liquefactive necrosis to suggest abscess.
Moderately severe hydrocephalus involving the lateral and third ventricles, with sparing of the fourth ventricle.
While this could be secondary to infectious material within the aqueduct, it is possible there are underlying adhesions/webs with chronic hydrocephalus, which would account for the lack of transpendymal migration of CSF; correlation with prior imaging is needed.
Marked abnormality and enhancement of the right globe, as well as enlargement and heterogeneous enhancement of the lacrimal gland.
Underlying tumor or infection cannot be excluded and should be correlated with patient's history and direct examination.
Additional enhancement within the quadigeminal cistern and possibly involving the dorsal surface of the cervical spinal cord, at the C2 level.
Craniocervical alignment abnormality with crowding at the craniocervical junction and "kinking" of the cervicomedullary junction, likely on a congenital basis, as discussed above which should be correlated with the patient's prior imaging and clinical history.
MRI Flow Study [**8-13**]: FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of the right frontal catheter and interval placement of a left frontal catheter which terminates at the level of the foramen magnum.
There has been slight interval decrease in size of the lateral ventricles when compared to the prior exam.
These regions are also associated with restricted diffusion as well as extensive perilesional FLAIR signal abnormality.
There is T2/FLAIR hypointensity involving the wall of the lateral ventricles which although without evidence for enhancement, suggest ventriculitis as well.
There is also a nodule of enhancement in the right temporal lobe.
Stable focus of enhancement within the inferior aspect of the cerebral aqueduct causing obstruction of outflow and therefore non-communicating hydrocephalus.
Minimal interval decrease in size of ventriculomegaly  Head CT [**8-15**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Post-surgical changes with small left frontal pneumocephalus without mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Unchanged hydrocephalus and right posterior occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] ventriculitis.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-8-16**] Again seen is bilateral frontal burr hole post- surgical change, with left lateral ventriculostomy with the catheter tip in unchanged position in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
There has been no interval development of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or shift of midline structures.
Debris within the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle is better characterized on previous MR studies, and there is continued hypodensity posterior to the lateral ventricle which is not changed.
Osseous structures and soft tissues appear otherwise unremarkable, with right globe changes including scleral band and increased density of the vitreous unchanged and better evaluated on previous MRI exam.
No interval development of hemorrhage, new site of edema, or shift of midline structures.
Additional stable abnormalities include debris in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, and scleral band and increased vitreous density of the right globe previously better evaluated on MRI.
No hemorrhage is appreciated.
Ventricles appear dilated but are unchanged from prior, measuring 39 mm versus 40 mm (bifrontal diameter).
The configuration of ventricular dilatation, out of proportion, is unchanged from prior with lateral and third ventricles dilated.
Altered attenuation material in the right lateral ventricle is unchanged.
A right frontal burr hole is also demonstrated.
Low lying cerebellar tonsils with small posterior fossa are better evaluated on prior MR studies.
There is mild ethmoidal sinus thickening.
IMPRESSION: Status post removal of left frontal-approach ventriculostomy catheter with no evidence for new hemorrhage.
Unchanged moderate dilatation of the third and lateral ventricles with effacement of the basal cisterns and cerebral sulci.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is admitted to the neurosurgical service for further evaluation of hydrocephalus in the setting of mental status change.
CSF cultures were finalized as negative for bacteria/fungus.. On [**2148-8-19**] the distal EVD catheter was removed as he exhibited no sign of hydrocephalus.
He was given a prescription for 4 weeks of Voriconazole and instructions to be seen by the infectious disease physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-14**] weeks.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**6-21**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
