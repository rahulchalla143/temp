horizontal 1.5mm STE in V1 and 1-2mm STE in V2-V3 that are upsloping and appear to be possible J point elevation.
CXR ([**12-1**]): There is a somewhat ill-defined, hazy airspace opacity in the left mid-lung zone, partially obscuring the left cardiac silhouette, suggesting consolidation in the lingula.
The right lung and left upper lung are clear, without other foci of consolidation or pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
The heart is not enlarged, and there is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with lingular pneumonia.
TTE ([**12-1**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe prolapse of the anterior leaflet with associated, posteriorly-directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Myxomatous mitral valve disease with at least moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Dilated left ventricle with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
CXR ([**12-2**]): Since the previous study, there has been development of consolidation at left base.
This is likely due to a combination of pleural effusion as well as focal infiltrate from pneumonia.
There are no signs of overt pulmonary edema.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis.
Myxomatous mitral valve disease with bileaflet prolapse and moderate to severe regurgitation.
Persistent lingular opacity.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo male with a history of MVP who presented with cough and L sided chest pain found to have PNA as well as chronic sever MR.  # Severe MR: The patient has a history of mitral valve proplase and was seen to have severe MR on a TTE with an elarged left atrium suggesting that this is a chronic process.
Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets were seen with Moderate/severe MVP.
No mass or vegetation was seen on the mitral valve.
Due to concern initally for endocarditis given his presentation with fevers and chills he was intially treated with vanc and gent, but given no vegetations on TEE, these were discontinued on HD2.
TEE also showed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 13385**], myxomatous MV, moderate MVP w/ severe MR w/ eccentric jet.
Given his tachycardia and elevated SBP's he was treated with nitroprusside for afterload reduction as well as lasix for diuresis.
# Coronaries.
# Pneumonia:  The patient presented with cough, pleuritic chest pain, and intermittent fevers and was seen to have a lingular infiltrate on CXR.
He then developed a left-sided pleural effusion the day after admission.
On HD4, CXR showed much improved L pleural effusion (likely improved from diuresis) and slightly improved L lingular infiltrate.
At time of discharge, patient was asymptomatic with oxygen requirement resolved.
He was placed on a CIWA scale w/ scocres consistently < 4, and diaphoresis as only sx.
This should be addressed as OP as well as during next admission for MV repair to prevent withdrawal and further manage abuse.
Patient was discharged home in hemodynamically stable condition, afebrile and with no oxygen requirement.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 798**] and Cardiologist: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia, Severe mitral valve regurgitation Secondary: Mitral valve prolapse, Alcohol abuse, Tobacco abuse   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with fevers, chills, chest pain and cough.
You were diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with antibiotics (Levofloxacin).
You were also found to have severe mitral regurgitation (valve problem), which will require surgery.
You also underwent cardiac catheterization which showed some plaques, but no flow limiting plaques.
You will need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] (Cardiologist) for this as well as further mangement of your heart condition (valvular disease and primary prevention).
Information was given to you on admission regarding smoking cessation as well as a nicotine patch.
Should you experience any new chest pain, fevers, chills, shortness of breath, leg swelling, difficulty with balance, changes in vision, new rash or any other symptom concerning to you, please call your primary care doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.
