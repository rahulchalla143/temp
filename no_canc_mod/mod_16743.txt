Admission Date:  [**2193-2-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2193-2-19**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old female with a past medical history significant for increased cholesterol who presented to our hospital who presented for several days of malaise, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and dizziness.
She denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.
Electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 11741**] depression in V2 and V4 and ST elevations in 2, 3, and AvF as well as complete heart block.
The patient was started on IV heparin and then became apneic and hypotensive in the emergency room.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization, but has now become hypotensive on admission and still in complete heart block.
She had a left heart catheterization which revealed 95% of left anterior descending stenosis and 100% occluded left circumflex which was stented.
She was also found to have a small RC not supplying a large part of myocardium.
After this cardiac catheterization, the patient has hypotension with an episode of supraventricular tachycardia.
In addition on doing cardiac catheterization, the saturations in the left and right side of the heart suggested presence of atrioventricular septal defect.
No smoking or alcohol.
No lymphadenopathy is palpable.
Abdomen: Soft and nontender and normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema.
Immediately upon admission, she had a TU which revealed anteroseptal defect.
The initial impression was to try to close this with a clam shell procedure which is going to offer her best chances of stabilizing a hemodynamics given that she became to be very hypotensive.
The patient's blood pressure remained extremely labile requiring a few pressors in the beginning with fair satisfactory result.
Initial subsequent echocardiogram revealed that she had global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Initially, we could not start a beta-blocker given her complete heart block and hypotension.
After while she became volume overloaded without evidence of compromising her oxygenation.
The balloon pump was stopped and had no significant effect on her hemodynamics.
On hospital day #4 and #5, it became apparent that the patient was aseptic which is the cause of her continued hypotension.
She required pressors for about 10 consecutive days, but eventually was able to be weaned off completely and maintained good blood pressure.
In terms of rhythm, the patient remained most of the time in first degree AV block and notable in complete heart block with tachycardia in the unit.
However, she did have one episode of atrial fibrillation in the context of ventilatory weaning.
She had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
She is also being anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation and for low ejection fraction with akinetic ventricle.
The patient was probably aspirated during episodes of nausea and vomiting in the outside hospital and particularly given the findings on x-ray.
Sputum showed multiple organisms including gram positive cocci and gram negative rods, but none of these were grown.
Additionally, the patient had 2 out of 4 blood cultures positive for staph.
Upon discharge, all of her infectious disease issues has been resolved and she has no evidence of being infected at this point.
Renal:  Upon admission, the patient may be in very mild acidosis which could have an myocardial infarction.
She had a mild increase of creatinine and this is probably normal and to be expected.
Endocrine:  The patient initially had very labile blood sugars in the 300 to 500 range.
It is quite likely that she has unrecognized underlying diabetes mellitus that has not been treated.
She had a very prolonged and complicated course including inability to wean over a week, pneumonia and fluid overload.
She has no acquired pneumonia and was able to breathe comfortably on room air at this point.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had some episodes of bleeding from the oropharyngeal tract, but this is believed more to be due to injury from the TE and intubation rather than any gastrointestinal bleed.
There is no continued gastrointestinal bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.
Acute myocardial infarction.
Diabetes mellitus.
Atrial fibrillation.
Aspiration pneumonia.
