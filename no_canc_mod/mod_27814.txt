Admission Date:  [**2104-4-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-4-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**] Chief Complaint: syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 85 yo male being transferred on [**4-11**]/6 from OSH after he had dizziness, syncope, and had fallen to the ground outside the [**Hospital1 1474**] VA.  A head CT showed subarachnoid blood.
Wife witnessed this and states there was no seizure activity.
Past Medical History: CAD, stent placed at the VA [**2104-3-7**] CHF hx of right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis a fib, DJD hypercholesterol anemia dysphagia of solids and liquids for couple months GI bleeding   Social History: Patient gets all care at the VA system.
He lives in a 2 story home with wife, still drives  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vit: 95.3   75   105/73  15   98% SM with 4L NC I/O: 24 hr 1750/2115, last 16 hr 2275/1515 Gen: elderly male, resting in bed, face mask in place HEENT: Bilateral eye bruising, dried blood at nares, no icterus, EOMI, PERRLA, neck supple, + jvd CV: RRR, s1s2, [**1-14**] SM at LUSB Pulm: Decreased breath sounds at bases, scattered wheezes and few crackles in lower lung fields, right worse than left ABD: + BS, soft, mild RUQ tenderness, no guarding EXT: no peripheral edema, 2+ radial and DP pulses NEURO: CN II-XII intact, alert and appropriate with exam/questioning  Pertinent Results: [**4-16**]: ECHO Conclusions: 1.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The  right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion  abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aorticvalve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
[**4-14**]: CXR: Moderate pulmonary edema and moderate right and small left pleural effusion along with cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement have all worsened.
Focal consolidation at the apex of the left lung could be pneumonia, appearing since [**4-10**].
[**2104-4-10**]: trauma CT torso: No evidence of acute traumatic injury or active extravasation.
Large right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
1.4 cm cystic-appearing lesion is seen in the head of the pancreas.
Large subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and suprasellar cisterns.
While this may relate to subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to trauma and anticoagulation, a CT angiogram would be necessary to exclude underlying aneurysm.
Third and lateral ventricular dilatation, raising possibility of early obstructive hydrocephalus.
Chronic small vessel ischemic change and involutional change, with old right cerebellar hemispheric infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: # SAH - CT scan in the ED showed large subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and suprasellar cisterns.
A CTA of the head showed no evidence of aneurysm, bleed was likely due to trauma from fall and anticoagulation.
Patient's neurologic status was stable and without deficit.
He completed one week of dilantin without any evidence of seizure activity.
# SOB - [**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by shortness of breath attributed to CHF and chronic pleural effusions.
He was ruled out for an MI, treated for possible aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin and flagyl, and had a diagnostic/therapeutic right sided thoracentesis.
Pulmonary felt his symptoms were due to fluid overload and the pleural fluid was consistent with a transudate with lymphocytic predominance.
Patient should follow up with his outpatient pulmonologists at the VA for further monitoring and management of his shortness of breath after discharge from rehab.
# CAD - Patient was s/p bare metal stent placement to left circumflex on [**2104-3-7**] at the [**Hospital1 59561**].
Plavix and aspirin were held initially due to concern for bleeding.
Patient had episodes of chest pain during this admission which were not correlated with any evidence of ischemic injury concerning for clotting of the stent.
Patient had a troponin leak to 0.07 on [**2104-4-13**], though his CKs remained normal.
# Syncope - Pt had no further syncopal episodes while hospitalized, but was noted to have up to 2 second pauses on telemetry.
He has been on a BB prior to admission and this may have led to prolonged pause causing his syncopal episode.
# Hypernatremia - Patient was hypernatremic initially, which resolved with hydration of D5W and remained normal once his diet was advanced and he was able to take PO liquids.
# AF - Patient was in NSR during this hospitalization.
# Anemia - Hct remained stable, was 30.4 at discharge.
# Dysphagia - Pt has had dysphagia for the past few months.
He had a video swallow which showed mild to moderate oral, mild pharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids which were prevented by chin tuck maneuver.
