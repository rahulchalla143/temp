Interval colectomy and colostomy takedown with a large amount of intraperitoneal free air and fecalized material throughout the abdomen, especially within the left paracolic gutter and pelvis, most consistent with anastomostic dehiscence.
Gas dissecting into the soft tissues of the pelvic side walls and extending into the left groin and anterior abdominal wall which may be related to extension of intraperitoneal gas; however, necrotizing fasciitis cannot be excluded.
Distended gallbladder containing layering high-density material, which may be related to milk of calcium.
Opacity within the left lower lung which may represent atelectasis versus airspace consolidation.
[**2182-11-2**] C.diff: positive .
Interval development of three dominant discrete abdominal fluid collections, which are suspicious for abscesses.
Interval increase in bilateral lower lobe consolidation, which is suspicious for pneumonia, given relative [**Name (NI) 20534**].
CT-guided procedure [**2182-11-12**]: Patient status post CT-guided catheter placement into right and left-sided fluid collections, the right suggestive of hematoma and the left compatible with abscess , without immediate complication.
Polypoid filling defect within the distal rectum, most likely representing sequlae of recent reanastomosis (possible blood clot), as it was not seen on the prior scan.
There is no definite evidence of a leak although the rectal contrast does not flow proximal to the anastomosis inspite of rectal distention with contrast and repeat/delayed scanning.
Interval decreased size of the abdominal collections are described above.
Very small right middle lobar pulmonary embolus unlikely large enough to account for the patient's clinical symptoms.
Dilated fluid-filled esophagus and stomach with patulous GE junction, and retrograde flow of contrast to the lung apices, placing the patient at risk for aspiration.
Extensive new portal venous gas.
Correlation with recent lactate, and abdominal exam.
No free air or pneumatosis.
Marked decrease in amount of portal venous air since [**86**] hours ago.
Interval decrease in size of abdominal collections as described above.
LENI [**2182-11-20**]: No evidence of DVT involving the right or left lower extremities.
[**2182-11-20**] C.diff: positive .
Pelvic US [**2182-11-28**]: Markedly limited examination due to the patient's clinical status and mobility as described above.
LUE US [**2182-11-29**]: Deep venous thrombosis involving the left basilic, brachial, and axillary veins.
LUE US [**2182-12-9**]: Recanalization of the brachial and axillary veins with chronic basilic vein occlusion.
No fracture detected.
Probable faint chondrocalcinosis, which can be seen with CPPD arthritis.
Findings included leakage between two sutures of the anterior wall of the anastamosis, a well-developed abscess cavity in the L pelvis, and fecal peritonitis.
She remained sedated & intubated, requiring HD support.
Metoprolol was added for tachycardia.
Her leukocytosis was persistent despite treatment for C.diff; a CT scan on [**11-11**] demonstrated 3 probable abscesses.
A repeat CT performed on [**11-17**] demonstrated interval improvement in the size of her abdominal fluid collections and no anastamotic leak.
On [**11-19**], she became tachycardic (120-135), hypertensive (180s/100s), and hypoxic (O2 82% on RA, 94% on 2L), wiht low UOP (10-15cc/hr).
A CTA torso demonstrated a new very small RML PE, unlikely to account for her presentation, and portal venous gas.
Ob/Gyn recommended outpatient endometrial biopsy upon [**Month/Year (2) **] to rule out endometrial cancer.
She had a questionable history of endometrial hyperplasia which is to be clarified by Ob/Gyn.
An ultrasound demonstrated DVT of the L basilic, brachial, and axillary veins.
ASA was also added for high platelet count.
A repeat ultrasound on [**12-9**] demonstrated recanalization of her brachial & axillary veins, with chronic occlusion of her basilic vein.
Coumadin became supratherapeutic and was held on [**12-13**].
On [**Month/Year (2) **], patient was afebrile off antibiotics, with stable vital signs.
