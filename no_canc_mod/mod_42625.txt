Admission Date:  [**2135-1-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-1-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-9-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Augmentin / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion and tamponade  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old female with history notable for breast ([**2111**]; s/p lumpectomy + XRT; ductal CA [**2132**]) and stage IIIa T2N2 NCLC s/p RLL resection in [**2132-10-17**] and chemo (cisplatin + taxol)/XRT in [**2132**].
Since [**2134-6-17**] she has had progressive dyspnea and has seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] to w/u this process.
And has had a bronch [**8-/2134**] negative for malignancy; + atypical cells suggestive of post-XRT change however; Cx + for MAC (grew out after 1 month).
2 weeks ago Ms [**Known lastname **] began having pleuritic chest pain and resting chest pain worse with lying supine and leaning forward.
She also experienced worsening dyspnea and fatigue, night sweats, cough productive of clear sputum, she denied fevers or chills.
She presented to an OSH where she was found to have a pericardial effusion (no tamponade) and she was treated with NSAIDS.
In the ED she was given flagyl to cover anaerobic infection and bedside eccho did not appear changed.
CTA chest showed potential RUL infection vs lymphangitic dz and large pericardial effusion.
A trigger was called and bedside eccho showed large 3cm effusion with RV collapse and emergent bedside pericardiocentesis was performed with 390 cc serosanguinous fluid drained.
She currently feels much better; she endorses constipation, + orthopnea, pain at site of drain.
Right lower lobe lung CA - found incidentally in [**2132**] on a preoperative chest x-ray in anticipation of surgery for a ductal carcinoma - Resected [**2132-10-17**], path: stage IIIa T2, N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer - s/p 3 cycles of adjuvant carboplatin and Taxol, complicated by  thrombocytopenia and anemia.
- serial CTs concerning for malignancy recurrence - [**Month (only) 404**]: CT with RML consolidation/effusion with PET correlation - [**Month (only) 205**]: CT with progressive cavitation in R lower lung field along with atelectasis and bronchiectasis - [**Month (only) 216**]: Bronch: Negative cytology, no micro - [**Month (only) 216**]: induced sputum MAC+, s/p 2 weeks levo #.
Right breast cancer, s/p lumpectomy and radiation therapy in [**2111**] - Ductal cancer diagnosed [**2132**], s/p lumpectomy alone #.
Urinary urgency #.
Hypertension #.
Lymph nodes: no axillary, supraclavicular or cervical LAd Breast: + R breast post-surgical scar; no discrete nodules felt.
Chest: + inspiratory dry crackles bilaterally anteriorly.
Posterior: rhonchi and crackles + bronchial BS over right mid and lower lung fields.
Large pericardial effusion.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Right upper lobe parenchymal opacities and interstitial thickening concerning for aspiration or infection.
No recurrent tumor evident.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Right breast soft tissue nodule which should be correlated with mammogram.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve  leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with  blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse, consistent with early cardiac tamponade.
postpericardiocentesis: A small, echodense residual pericardial effusion is present.
There is no evidence of cardiac tamponade.
[**2135-1-20**] CXR: Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion, stable.
Right perihilar mass longstanding.
No change in caliber of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
Labs: [**2135-1-17**] Pericardial fluid: 1100 WBC; [**Numeric Identifier **] RBC; 80poly, 10 monos, 10 lymphs  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2135-1-22**] head CT:  No acute intracranial pathology, no intracranial hemorrhage, no evidence of metastatic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old female with extensive Onc history as above who is admitted for progressive dyspnea and found to have pericardial tamponade.
Pericardial effusion - The differential diagnosis for her pericardial effusion included viral infection (EBV, coxackie, adenovirus) but given patient's history there is also possibility malignant effusion (breast or lung) or radiation induced pericarditis.
Cytology did not show malignant cells in the pericardial fluid.
Stains are still pending for AFB and viral serologies show no EBV.
Dyspnea - Her dyspnea on admission was most likely secondary to pericardial tamponade and pulmonary parenchmal etiology.
Her dyspnea improved greatly once the pericardial effusion was drained.
She was also sent home with home oxygen and nebulizer machine to help with her dyspnea.
She was given pepto bis for symptom relief with good effect.
She had low grade fevers, but her WBC has been trending down during the admission.
Possibly [**2-18**] drug effect or viral gastroenterology.
This was likely secondary to irritation of pericardial catheter initially.
Anticoagulation was considered but initally held off given question of need for pericardial window.
When effusion resolved, anticoagulation was still held given h/o cancer with no head scan recently to rule out mets to brain.
Onc - not an acute issue; to f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as outpatient.
Anemia - patient with admission Hct 25.8 on admission, from 30.6 on [**2134-10-14**] although of note patient with variable Hct previously 25 to 35 with dx of MDS on recent Onc note.
Anxiety - she was noted to be very anxious this admission, and has been responding to prn ativan.
Medications on Admission:  Patient stopped taking all meds 3 days ago given nausea and low BP at OSH, is taking Levoflox Levofloxacin 500mg daily, Day 3 of 14 Paxil 20 mg daily Prilosec 20 mg daily Ambien qhs Ditropan 5 mg daily Triamterene 1 a day   Discharge Medications: 1.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**1-18**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed for dry stuffy nose.
Ativan 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every 6-8 hours as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Cardiac tamponade pneumonia atrial fibrillation mycobacteria avium complexum infection radiation pneumonitis   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of pneumonia and because of fluid around your heart that caused a condition called "tamponade."
Because of your pericardial fluid you developed an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation; this may go away in several months.
You should also see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] in follow up for your cancer history and lung disease.
If you begin having fevers, chills, worsenining cough, or difficulty breathing this may be a sign that you need to be treated further and you should see a doctor.
If you have worsening dyspnea, fatigue, lower extremity swelling this could be a sign of reaccumulation of fluid around your heart and you should see a doctor.
You also have an abnormal heart rate called atrial fibrillation; if you begin having heart palpitations and feel light headed, this could be a sign that your heart is going too fast and you should seek immediate medical attention.
