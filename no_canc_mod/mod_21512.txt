Admission Date:  [**2108-4-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-4-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-11-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**] Chief Complaint: 65 y/o female who has developed developed severe scoliosis with draping of the right main bronchus and bronchus intermedius overlying the scoliotic spine.
This resulted in long-term compression with underlying malacia and septic bronchiectasis of the right lower and right middle lobe resulting in recurrent infections yearly and dyspnea requiring supplemental oxygen therapy when she is in her [**Location 27224**] of [**Location (un) 61361**].
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right bronchomalacia s/p Right thorocotomy,right middle/lower lobectomy, right bronchoplasty, T4 vertebrectomy ([**4-13**])  Flexible bronchoscopy with extraction of thick tenacious     sputum from right lower and right middle lobe and     evaluation of airways.
Multiple intercostal nerve blocks.
History of Present Illness: 65- year-old woman who has developed severe scoliosis with draping of the right main bronchus and bronchus intermedius overlying the scoliotic spine.
This resulted in long-term compression with underlying malacia and septic bronchiectasis of the right lower and right middle lobe.
She develops recurrent infections yearly and also becomes dyspneic requiring supplemental oxygen therapy when she is in her [**Location 27224**] of [**Location (un) 61361**].
We extensively evaluated her and ultimately felt the best approach would be to perform a right thoracotomy and likely a bilobectomy involving the right lower and right middle lobe.
Secondarily, we felt it was necessary to perform an anterior vertebrectomy to remove a chronic source of external compression and then to perform a bronchoplasty with mesh to reshape the airway to its normal configuration and strengthen its back wall.
Minimal smoking exposure as adolescent, nonsmoker since.
etoh=1-2 drinks/week, no recreational drug use.
There has been removal of a right-sided chest tube.
A right hydropneumothorax is without interval change with a small apical pneumothorax component and a small to moderate amount of pleural fluid on the right.
Focal opacity adjacent to surgical chain sutures in the right lower lobe is likely due to postoperative atelectasis and/or contusion.
Additional opacities in the right perihilar region may reflect asymmetrical edema, atelectasis, or infection.
Left pleural effusion decreased in size in the interval.
Finally, a relatively spherical opacity in the right suprahilar region is probably unchanged allowing for technical differences, and may reflect a loculated component of pleural fluid given its sharp but incomplete borders, and less likely focal parenchymal abnormality.
IMPRESSION: No change in right hydropneumothorax following right chest tube removal.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-12**] and 28: Mild pulmonary edema is improving, particularly in the left lung.
Small left pleural effusion has redistributed but not changed in overall volume.
There is only a small right basal pleural air collection drained by two looped pleural drains.
An apical drain is unchanged in position and a tiny apical pneumothorax persists.
Heart size is normal, shifted to the left because of severe thoracolumbar scoliosis.

IMPRESSION: No change in right hydropneumothorax following right chest tube removal.
Slight deformity of the mid tracheal zone with some     bowing in of the right anterior region, able to be easily     passed with the bronchoscope.
Malacia of the left mainstem bronchus over approximately     50-60%.
Pt tolerated procedure well, transferred to ICU post-op intubated w/ 1CT and 1 [**Doctor Last Name **] tubes to suction, pain management w/ PCA.
POD#2- REsp status and secretion clearance improving, no SOB but slight CO2 retention,CT cont to Sx-no air leak; I/O adequate; OOB,IS; PCA w/ occas toradol; antibx ceftaz x7d; Hct 25.5.
Slight deformity of the mid tracheal zone with some bowing in of the right anterior region, able to be easily passed with the bronchoscope.
Malacia of the left mainstem bronchus over approximately 50-60%.
