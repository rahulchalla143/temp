There were no complications.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2195-10-21**] 9:24 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: R/O ANY free air, no PO or IV contrast please Field of view: 40  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 83 year old woman with acute cholecystitis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: R/O ANY free air, no PO or IV contrast please CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: CRI  TECHNIQUE: 64-MDCT axial images of the abdomen were obtained without oral or IV contrast.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL OR IV CONTRAST: There are bilateral moderate- sized pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are multiple gallstones within gallbladder and thickening of the wall and inflammatory changes around the gallbladder consistent with the known diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.
There is no evidence of free air in the abdomen.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
There are multiple small retroperitoneal mesenteric lymph nodes, which are stable when compared to the prior study.
These do not meet CT criteria for pathology.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL OR IV CONTRAST: There is no free fluid or free air in the pelvis.
There are severe degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.
There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Findings consistent with acute cholecystitis.
No evidence of free air.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) 5 IU/L 0 - 40   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB Asparate Aminotransferase (AST) 9 IU/L 0 - 40   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD) 222 IU/L 94 - 250   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB Alkaline Phosphatase 68 IU/L 39 - 117   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB Amylase 41 IU/L 0 - 100   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB Bilirubin, Total 0.3 mg/dL 0 - 1.5   PERFORMED AT WEST STAT LAB   Brief Hospital Course: 83 year-old female with MMP p/w nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea.
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for pancreatitis, metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure, which improved with electrolyte repletion and hydration.
Nausea/Vomiting/Abdominal Pain On admission, patient presented with laboratory values consistent with pancreatitis, though no evidence of such on CT Abdomen.
Chronic cholelithiasis, thickened gallbladder wall, and dilated CBD were seen on ultrasound dated [**10-16**], but no overt cholesytitis on exam dated unchanged from prior studies.
On day 7 of hospital admission, patient spiked a temperature while on Imipenem/Flagyl (for Klebsiella UTI and presumed cholecystitis).
Her abdominal exam continued to reveal diffuse abdominal tenderness, especially pronounced in the RUQ.
Work-up included repeat RUQ ultrasound, which showed evidence of pericholecystic fluid and acute cholecystitis.
CT Abdomen was without evidence of free air.
Patient was evalued by ERCP and surgery, and it was felt that patietn was poor surgical candidate, and decision to place percutaneous cholecystostomy tube by Interventional Radiology was finally reached.
As patient is poor surgical candidate at this time, tube will be left in place for at least 4-6 weeks; she has follow-up with general surgery scheduled, at which point further management options will be assessed.
Patient received Anzement q8h PRN for nausea, and symptoms began to resolve once drain was placed.
UTI Urine culture from rehab grew out Klebsiella resistant to most antibiotics except Imipenem.
Diarrhea Patient with a history of chronic C. Diff colitis, for which she has been treated with Flagyl several times.
Nutrition Due to pancreatitis and then cholecystitis, patient had been kept NPO for several days.
Renal Failure Patient's Cr on admission was 3.0, with baseline Creatinien around 1.9-2.0.
Etiology was thought to be pre-renal picture from diarrhea leading to ATN, with component of Klebisella UTI playing a role.
CHF: CXR on admission demonstrated mild CHF, with increased JVP on exam.
Patient likely has diastolic dysfunction as EF normal on last ECHO in [**7-28**].
With fluid hydration for pancreatitis, patient demonstrated signs of fluid overload.
Repeat CXR on hospital day 8 showed fluid overload with possible underlying PNA (patient already on Imipenem).
HTN: Blood Pressure medications were held initially in the ICU and on the floor, as mesenteric ischemia was on the differential for patient's complaints -- within limits, HTN was allowed for better gut perfusion; once diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made, Metoprolol and Norvasc were restored, and Hydralazine was added to the regimen.
Anemia Patient with baseline renal insufficiency, required 1 unit PRBCs for HCT < 28.
There was a question of possible transfusion reaction after event vs. fluid overload, as patient presented with shortness of breath necessitating NRB mask after xfusion, which improved with IV Lasix administration.
Patient also had low-grade fever, but patient had spiked a temperature the evening before and was being treated for her cholecystitis.
Hypothyroidism During period of inadequate PO intake, patient was placed on IV levothyroxine.
Psych: As patient's abdominal symptoms improved, Celexa was re-started for depression.
Lasix  Oral/IV: PRN   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, hypertension, CHF, anemia, hypothyroidism, COPD, chronic renal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: abdominal pain resolved, mild residual nausea, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as prescribed.
Please check electrolytes routinely to watch for re-feeding syndrome.
If you develop shortness of breath, abdominal pain, chest pain, please contact your provider or report to the Emergency Room immediately.
Please call hospital in 2 days to determine sensitivities for Enterococcus from Bile Fluid Cx.
