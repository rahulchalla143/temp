No obvious trauma.
One report stated that patient had drug paraphenalia present with patient as well (details of this are unclear).
Patient with continued obtundation with repeated dropping sats into 80's.
Initially had esophageal intubation but then had successful ETI.
She was then noted to have neck swelling with ?lip swelling and hypersecretions, ?drug reaction or tracheal/esophageal trauma/perforation.
Scattered healing abrasions over face.
Neck: anterior neck appears grossly increased in size, minimal erythema, no crepitus.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, appears non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, umbilical hernia present and fully reducible.
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: sedated, spontaneously awakens some and agitated with attempts to pull tube, moves all extremities spontaneously but not to command.
The lungs appear clear bilaterally without evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
No acute fracture or alignment abnormality.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine with posterior osteophyte formation.
Sclerotic appearance of C5 and C6 vertebral bodies, with slight anterior wedging of C5, likely degenerative in nature.
Apparent focal consolidation in the left upper lobe, posteriorly, only partially-imaged.
Inter- and intralobular septal thickening and centrilobular ground- glass opacities may represent pulmonary edema versus infectious etiology.
Tubular focus of air in the upper right chest wall is only partially imaged (3:63-69,72-74), but may relate to previous attempt at right subclavian central venous line placement; clinical correlation is recommended.
CT Head [**2155-9-28**]: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or abnormality of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter differentiation.
There is no fracture.
Minimal mucosal thickening in the anterior ethmoidal air cells and maxillary antra is noted.
The patient is intubated and mucosal secretions in the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx are noted.
Bibasilar consolidative and atelectatic changes may be partially secondary to aspiration.
Probable short segment colonic wall thickening at the hepatic flexure may represent mild colitis.
Nonspecific haziness of the intra-abdominal fat and loss of intra-abdominal fat planes and mild subcutaneous edema.
Differential diagnosis includes infectious etiology and acute component is not excluded.
No definite evidence of esophageal injury.
Focal air collections at the level of the pharynx are likely intraluminal; however, this could be further evaluated with fluoroscopy at a later point.
Persistent concern for acute compression fractures of T1 through T3.
CT Chest [**2155-9-29**]: 1)Small pockets of subcutaneous air in the anterior thoracic wall bilaterally of indeterminate origin with no obvious esophageal or tracheal perforation and a patulous esophagus which contains fluid.
It is Possible that the upper trachea was injured during intubation above the level of the endotracheal tube which accounts for the absence of air in the mediastinum.
2)New bilateral lower lobe consolidation and atelectasis most likely due to aspiration.
4)New left rib fracture.
5)T1 sclerosis with deformity of the superior endplate is of undetermined chronicity, reference to the CT spine [**9-28**] recommended.
Esophagram [**2155-9-29**]: There is no evidence of leak or stricture in the evaluated part of the esophagus (from the thoracic inlet to the GE junction).
no ST T wave changes.
Obtundation:  Patient with elevated alcohol level in the emergency room.
No other ingestions were known but she was questionably found with drug paraphenalia.
Intubation was difficult and there was concern for esophageal perforation.
She was intubated for 48 hours and was subsequently extubated without difficulty.
At the time of discharge she was alert, conversant but mildly agitated and there was concern for mild intoxication.
She had a short period of desaturation periintubation which resolved.
She was extubated without difficulty.
Initial imaging was concerning for potential aspiration pneumonia and she was initially started on a course of vancomycin and leovfloxacin for pneumonia dn ultimately will complete a five day course of levofloxcain.
Periintubation she was noted to become agitated and have neck and lip swelling with increased secretions.
There was concern for a drug reaction versus tracheal/esophageal injury secondary to intubation.
Imaging of the neck and chest was negative for tracheal or esophageal injury.
Her neck and lip swelling resolved.
She was extubated without difficulty and had no further airway complications.
She was not tachycardic and conitnued to have good urine output but transiently required low dose phenylephrine.
Alcohol Abuse/Obtundation: On presentation she was obtunded with a very elevated alcohol level.
You were also diagnosed with pneumonia.
It was recommended that you stay for treatment of your alcohol withdrawal and pneumonia but you decided to leave against medical advice.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience any fevers  > 101 degrees, chest pain, difficulty breathing, vomiting blood, diarrhea, inability to walk or any other concerning symptoms.
