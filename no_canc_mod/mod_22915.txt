**FINAL REPORT [**2121-12-31**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2121-12-31**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
PRESUMPTIVE STREPTOCOCCUS BOVIS.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A moderate-sized right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, slightly more organized and mildly larger than the prior study two hours ago.
Right-sided subdural hematoma tracking along the hemispheric convexity and tentorium.
A 4 mm leftward midline shift.
Left frontoparietal subgaleal hematoma.
Questionable trace intraventricular hemorrhagic extension.
FINDINGS: Redemonstrated centered within the right temporal lobe, there is an area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage that is now slightly decreased in size measuring 3.9 x 1.9 cm, where on similar measurements on the most recent prior examination it measured 4.6 x 2.2 cm.
Surrounding adjacent edema is similar as compared to the prior examination.
There is a subdural component of hemorrhage seen immediately adjacent to the right cerebral convexity and along the right tentorium, that overall, appears similar in extent since the prior examination.
There is a tiny amount of likely subarachnoid hemorrhage (series 2A: image 21 and series 2A:19) that is also similar in extent since the prior examination.
Layering intraventricular hemorrhage seen within the occipital horns appears to be slightly improved since the prior examination.
There is some degree of edema in the right cerebral hemispshere as before with decreased conspicuity of the CSF spaces.
There has been no interval development of transtentorial or uncal herniation.
There are no new areas of hemorrhage.
The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are stable demonstrating mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells and the sphenoid sinuses with the remainder being well aerated.
Mild increase in ventricular system size since prior examination.
Slight interval decrease in known multicompartmental hemorrhage with the largest focus, an area of right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Some degree of edema of the right cerebral hemisphere.
Slight interval decrease in known intraventricular hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: 82 year-old female with HTN, asthma, bronchiectasia, hyperthyroidism who was admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**12-24**] with a subdural hematoma after feeling dizzy then falling while climbing the stairs (witnessed by her sister).
She was taken to OSH where CT showed R SDH and R temporal hemorrhagic contusion.
Her exam also slightly worsened, as she no longer followed commands or moved her LE with commands.
Overnight she was noted on telemetry to be in atrial fib with a rate in the 120s which spontaneously resolved.
Per nursing, her mental status has not changed during this time.
She denies chest pain, shortness of breath or dizziness.
As per her sister she had no prior history of [**Name (NI) 17584**] or heart problems that she knows of.
Of note, the patient had a CT chest which was read as 'Multifocal calcified and noncalcified nodules with associated fibrosis,  bronchiectasis, and patchy opacification most consistent with chronic  mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection.
As per her sister, she had lung problems with increase in secreation for the last 3-4 years.
Her sister also states that she has a chronic infection of her lungs.
Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: She has now converted back to sinus with HR in 70s on Metoprolol 25mg TID.
She does not have prior hx of A-fib and this is likely new onset.
She had episode of Afib with RVR with rates 120s-160s leading to hypotension that responded to fluids.
She also had ST depressions that normalized with rate control.
Patient has multiple reasons to have afib; she is predisposed with longstanding hypertension, she is acutely ill and has a head injury, she also had a high WBC count and positive U/A and she had electrolyte abnormalities.
As well she is known to have hyperthyroidism and is on PTU.
ECHO done on [**12-24**] showed no structural heart disease and no focal WMA but did show diastolic dysfunction.
# Parenchymal and subdural hematoma: Pt appears to be stable.
Repeat head CT on [**12-27**] showed mild increase in ventricular size, but sl.
As per neurosurg, she had repeat head CT that showed overall stable appearance of multicompartmental hemorrhage without increase in ventricular caliber.
Decrease in short term memory.
Neuro-surgery will continue to follow and she has appointment on [**2121-2-3**] with neuro surge and for repeat CT. - Cont dilantin 100mg TID with weekly levels - Will need to have continue  PT, OT and re-eval of her swallowing - F/u w/ neurosurgery in [**Month (only) **] - No anticoagulation for now (including ASA) until re-evaluated by neurosurg in [**Name (NI) **] - Pt has staples on left side of skull from laceration and should be removed on Sunday [**1-4**] .
Replace foley and follow-up with MD - If febrile or has any signs of infection repeat UA .
# CT Lung findings: Ms. [**Known lastname 88353**] has history of MAC with bronchiectasis.
She was diagnosed in [**2117**] and at the time she had wt loss and hemoptsis.
Her current symptom is increase in mucous secreation and has recurrent sinusitis and she was recommended to have NS rinses and to use flonase.
She also had recent PFTs that showed severe restrictive disease.
# L Clavicular fx: This is due to fall.
Pt was found to have a distal clavicular fracture, with the distal fragment slightly superiorly displaced w/ intact AC joint.
She also has a 1st rib fx seen on CT. Pt has area of ecchymosis on L shoulder and has no limitation of movement.
- Place sling while she is out of bed for comfort - Started on oxycodone 2.5mg for severe pain - tylenol to Q 6hours PRN (LFTs sl.
elevated, so would cont to monitor and limit tylenol to <4Gm per 24hours) - Cont to monitor LUE for perfusion .
# HYPOTENSION: Now normotensive.
She has hx of hypertension and was on propanolol and HCTZ as outpatient.
She had one episode on [**12-27**] w/ SBP in 60s on the setting of A-fib with RVR and receiving HCTZ and possibly due hypovolemia given that she quickly responded to fluids.
She also had recent ECHO w/ dCHF and may be more preloaded depended.
#Dysphagia: As per sister, pt had difficulty swallowing prior to the accident and had to have small bites and take solids with liquids to help with swallowing.
Speech and swallow eval x 2 and failed.
she had no gag reflex and is at high risk for aspiration.
# Anemia: pt has hx of anemia likely due to chronic disease.

You were admitted to the hospital after you had a fall at home and hit your head.
You were found to have a head bleed and you were closely observed.
You were also found to have an urinary tract infection for which you are being treated for.
You have also developed an abnormal heart rythm called atrial fibrilation and you will need to take medication for this.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - Started on metoprolol 25mg via NG tube or orally once tolerating three times per day - STOP ASPIRIN until this is further discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] neurologist - Stop propanolol, hydrochlorothiazide - Started on Dilantin 100mg three times per day - Started on Cipro 500mg twice daily (last day today [**2122-1-3**])  This are the neurosurgery recs: # Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
# You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
He will need to help manage your new diagnose of atrial fibrilation.
