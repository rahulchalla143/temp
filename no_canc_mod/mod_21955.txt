History of Present Illness: 62 year-old male with no known coronary artery disease who had sharp pain between his shoulder blades and anterior chest pain that radiated down his left arm while doing yardwork.
He also was diaphoretic, nauseated, and had a tingling sensation in both hands.
He called EMS and was transfered to [**Hospital1 34**] where he was found to have ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVf.
At catherization, he was found to have RCA thrombis with no disease in the LMCA, LAD, or LCx.
During the procedure, he went into atrial fibrillation and had transient hypotension that required neosynepherine drip and an IV fluid bolus.
Post-procedure, he did not have chest pain or shortness of breath.
Past Medical History: 1. h/o chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis 6 years ago x 2 episodes.
There is a question of atrial fibrillation on that admission.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Asthma requiring Albuteral inhaler daily, advair, and flovent.
Depression 5. s/p removal of benign middle/inner ear tumor 2 years ago leaving him with  about 50% hearing in left ear.
6. h/o colitis.
Family History: Family history is significant for his father who had an MI at age 51.
Physical Exam: Well appearing gentleman in no acute distress.
His cardiac exam is irregular and tachycardic with a normal S1 and S1, no murmors, rubs, or gallops.
Femoral pulses are present with bruit, no evidence of hematoma at the catherization site.
His abdomen is soft, nontender, mildly distended, with bowel sounds present.
His extremeties are warm without cyanosis or edema, distal pulses are 2+ bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: At [**Hospital1 34**]: Na: 140 K: 4.2 Cl: 103 Co2: 23 BUN: 21 Cr: 0.9 Glu: 104 WBC: 9 Hct: 45 Pl: 184 CK: 427 CKMB: 4.9 Trop-T: < 0.01 EKG: Sinus rhythm, ST elevation II, III, aVf, ST depressions V2-3, I, aVl.

CAD: At cardiac catherization, he was found to have thrombis in the RCA.
During the procedure, he went into atrial fibrillation and had transient hypotension that required neosynepherine and IV fluid bolus.
His hypotension was thought to reflect some RV involvement, but an ECHO showed normal RV function.
The ECHO also showed an EF of 50% and regional left ventricular basalar hypokinesis.
Atrial Fibrillation: He went into atrial fibrillation during catherization.
Because his atrial fibrillation was induced in the catherization lab, his anticoagulation was discontinued.
Pump: He has no evidence of heart failure.
His ECHO showed an EF of 50%, which is likely secondary to the acute MI.
Asthma: He has a history of asthma; however, on admission, he had no evidence of an acute issue.
His albuteral inhaler was not given because of his tachycardia.
PPX: He was kept on colace and senna as a bowel regimen, pantoprazole for GI ulcers.
He was ambulating for DVT prophylaxis.
Disp:*30 tablets* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Inferior ST-elevation MI Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Return to the ED or call your PCP if you have recurrent chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or palpitations.
