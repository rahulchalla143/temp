Radiology HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT  [**2156-12-30**] Mild-to-moderate degenerative change involves the right hip joint.
The bilateral sacroiliac joints and the pubic symphysis is unremarkable.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 74yo F with HTN, DM, CVA, recent ORIF of hip fx found unresponsive with desat to 64%, found to have RUL PNA, UTI and ?anaphylactic reaction.
# Anaphylaxis: Given the patient's allergy to penicillin and tongue swelling after the administration of ceftriaxone, there was concern that she was having an anaphylactic reaction.
The patient was then transferred to the medicine service where she was monitored for respiratory compromise.
At the time of discharge she had decreased swelling of her tongue.
#PNA: On CXR the patient was found to have a RUL infiltrate.
However given her adverse reaction to the ceftriaxone, this was discontinued and the patient was started on Vancomycin.
Given the patient's residence at [**Location (un) **], she was treated as if she had a community acquired pneumonia.
The patient also has a h/o pseudomonal UTI.
If the she had decompensated, the plan was to start an abx such as meropenem for wider coverage.
If her condition deteriorated we would have considered CHF secondary to a hypertensive heart.
The differential would have also included a PE given the patient's recent ORIF.
Her hydralazine was increased to 50 TID because of elevated pressures.
CVA prevention: Tight glycemic and BP control was maintained.
Acute on CRI: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency.
With low urine outputs she received boluses and diuresed appropriately.
