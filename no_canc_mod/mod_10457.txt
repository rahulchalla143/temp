Admission Date:  [**2136-1-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-1-30**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 44755**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of hypertension, cellulitis and gastrointestinal bleed who presents from [**Location (un) **] Home via EMS with shortness of breath.
In the Emergency Department she was found to be in atrial fibrillation and on chest x-ray had bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 44755**] was in good health living independently with her sister until six to eight weeks prior to admission when she developed cough and decreased appetite.
She was discharged to rehabilitation, but then readmitted for worsening cellulitis to [**Hospital1 336**] on [**1-11**], for which she was treated with Unasyn.
On [**1-17**] she spiked a fever and a chest x-ray demonstrated pneumonia.
She was also given one dose of Linezolid for sputum growing VRE, although this was subsequently felt to be a contamination and Linezolid was discontinued.
Again on the 23rd she developed shortness of breath and was found to be in respiratory distress and found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions right greater then left and a left lower lobe consolidation.
On Seven Felberg the patient was maintained on Levofloxacin for her pneumonia as well as Oxacillin for her bilateral lower extremity cellulitis.
She had a right upper extremity ultrasound at the outside hospital that demonstrated superficial thrombophlebitis.
This was repeated while on the floor here and was negative for deep venous thrombosis or superficial thrombophlebitis.
On [**1-28**] te patient demonstrated worsening respiratory distress and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Heart is tachycardic and regular with systolic ejection murmur at the apex.
Lungs are without crackles, but with decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Electrocardiogram demonstrates atrial fibrillation with a rate of 165.
No ST or T wave changes and chest x-ray with bilateral effusions right greater then left.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted above on the 25th the patient began to suffer from worsening respiratory distress.
She had been evaluated and prepared for thoracentesis of her bilateral pleural effusions, which are felt most likely secondary to her congestive heart failure, although also possibilities include a peripneumonia effusion.
Over the course of the day she went from oxygen saturations of the 90s on 4 liters to requirement of 100% nonrebreather with saturations dropping into the mid 80s.
A chest x-ray on the floor demonstrated continued bilateral pleural effusions, stable congestive heart failure and worsening left lower lobe infiltrate.
Cardiac:  The patient initially noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response treated initially with 30 mg q.i.d.
Echocardiogram demonstrated an EF of greater then 55% with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5660**] dilated.
On the increased dose of Diltiazem the patient had a period of bradycardia into the 30s and Diltiazem was subsequently tapered to off.
The patient remained with heart rates in the 50s to 60s with occasional drops to the 30s off of all cardiac medications.
She is continuing to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but remains in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of the time.
No further diuresis was initiated and it is unclear how much diuresis the patient received on the floor (secondary to computers being down during that time).
Pulmonary:  A:  Pneumonia, this is a hospital acquired versus aspiration pneumonia.
A video oropharyngeal swallow study was initiated on [**1-30**] and at that point she again failed clear fluids, but she can have thickened solids and nectar consistency liquids.
We will also continue day number three of Flagyl for possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
B:  Also concern of pulmonary embolism given bilateral lower extremity cellulitis and a history of superficial thrombophlebitis in the past.
This will help with decision on whether or not to anticoagulate this woman who may have a large fall risk.
Pleural effusion likely secondary to congestive heart failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation (which was in the setting of a pneumonia), right decubitus film initially without significant layers, but will repeat today.
Cellulitis:  Patient with bilateral lower extremity cellulitis and a grade two ulcer on her left lower extremity.
Will continue dressing changes, have started zinc and vitamin C and is having good coverage of potential cellulitis pathogens with her current regimen of Vancomycin and Ceftazidime.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Again the patient failed clear liquids, but will continue nectar substance liquids as well as pureed thickened solids.
COMMUNICATION:  With the son who is seeming overwhelm with the decision on what to do with his mother who has been functionally independent all of her life.
