Admission Date:  [**2158-1-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-1-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-5-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: A.C.E Inhibitors / Insulins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, LE edema  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization- no intervention  History of Present Illness: 61 year old primarily Italian speaking male with known coronary artery disease (s/p 3 vessel CABG in [**5-25**], and multiple PCI's on both native and grafts), status-post re-PCI of SVG=>D2 in-stent restenosis via Cypher DES on 12/[**2156**].
Recently admitted [**11/2157**]/6/[**2157**] for acute decompensated heart failure in the setting of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Patient had post-procedure echocardiogram on [**2157-12-27**], which demonstrated no new MR with LV ejection fraction 35% (depressed from [**5-29**] EF 45%).
Since discharge on [**2157-12-30**], he has had intermittent dyspnea at home, unclear if this was exertional or rest, which has been increasing over the past 2 days.
Associated with this SOB is chest heaviness, no other symptoms (including no fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, ligtheadedness, syncope, worsening LE edema).
He was started on heparin drip for elevated cardiac enzymes (though decreaed since last admission at [**Hospital1 18**]), and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for invasive management.
Here, heparin drip was discontinued (as cardiac enzymes were decreased from prior) and he was given another 80 mg IV lasix and placed on nitroglycerin drip transiently for pulmonary edema.
Chest x-ray here was consistent with heart failure.
He was chest pain free on admission.

CXR [**2157-1-3**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions with prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
Scattered bibasilar atelectasis is noted .
Cardiac Catheterization: PROCEDURE DATE: [**2158-1-5**] INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Native three vessel coronary artery disease with occluded SVG-OM and SVG-D. 2.
Severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Preserved cardiac output / index.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated native three vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant circulation.
The LAD had moderate diffuse disease in the proximal and mid vessel without flow limitation.
The RCA was a dominant vessel with a proximal total occlusion.
Right and left heart catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP=15mmHG, mean PCWP=35mmHg, LVEDP=35mmHg).
Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension was present.
No transaortic gradient seen from catheter pullback from LV to ascending aorta.
Left ventriculography was not performed to reduce contrast volume   Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, CABG, CHF, CRI, PAF p/w CHF exacerbation .
He came in with dyspnea and LE edema.
Had cardiac catheterization showing elevated right and left sided pressures with PCWP of 35.
His cardiomyopathy is ischemic judging by wall motion abnormalities and his EF is 35% by echo this admission.
CRI: He has elevated Cr in the past.
It is thought to be due to CHF on CRI, but there could be some component of dye induced nephropathy.
During his stay he had no fever or productive cough to support pneumonia.
He did have a mild leukocytosis but it was down trending.
Suspected to be atelectasis vs delayed radiographic resolution of pna.
Hyperkalemia: In setting of renal insufficiency.
He recieved RISS for breakthrough coverage and was given a diabetic diet.
CAD: He was chest pain free throughout his admission.
He does carry a diagnosis of PUD and colonic polys, but it is unclear if these are the reasons he is not anticoagulated.
