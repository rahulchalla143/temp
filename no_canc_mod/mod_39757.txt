EXTREMITIES: WWP, no edema b/l.
CXR [**2184-8-8**]: Volume of moderate left pleural effusion and severity of left lower lobe consolidation have increased slightly since [**8-10**], but the difference could be due to transient findings such as retained secretions and a sympathetic pleural exudate.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 year old male who initially presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]with 3 days of dizziness, malaise, and fever/chills, found to have legionella pneumonia and atrial flutter with RVR.
Legionella Pneumonia:  He was admitted with hypoxia and required non-rebreather initially.
He had a dramatic LLL consolidation with A-A gradient on admission >400.
On the floor, his pulmonary symptoms improved and he did not have an oxygen requirement at discharge.
Fever: Patient admitted with persistent fevers >105.
In the OSH, he had marked leukocytosis with bandemia.
He was treated for infection as above and his fevers were presumably due to legionella.
He continued to have persistent fevers for ~3 days after he demonstrated significant clinical improvement.
His fevers were presumed to be secondary to Legionella, however, he was also started on doxycycline for 10 days for possible concomitant anaplasma infection.
[**Last Name (un) **] was likely prerenal secondary to fluid losses in setting of acute illness.
His Cr stabilized to 1.7 prior to discharge and his kidney disease was thought to be secondary to underlying untreated hypertension.
Atrial flutter: He presented with atrial flutter with variable block and tachycardia to 160s in setting of fever.
UTI:  The patient was admitted with a UA that could be consistent with UTI but UCx at OSH was negative.
He was treated with levaquin as above for pneumonia.
Mild transaminitis:  Patient admitted with mildly elevated LFTS, likely due to legionella.
Hematuria: During the hospitalization, the patient developed gross hematuria that was likely secondary to foley trauma in the setting of anticoagulation.
Anemia: In the setting of bleeding from his lower GU tract, the patient was noted to have a normocytic anemia.
================== Transitional Issues: [ ] The patient does not have a PCP and therefore has not had regular, routine care.
Has not had age-appropriate cancer screening (colonoscopy).
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Legionella pneumonia Atrial flutter HTN Chronic Kidney Disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have legionella pneumonia and improved with antibiotics.
While you were in the hospital, your rapid heart rate converted back to a normal heart rhythm without any intervention.
However, because we are uncertain of how long you were in this rapid heart rhythm, we started a regimen to anticoagulate you to prevent you from developing blood clots that could cause a stroke.
Also, your kidney function was noted to be elevated and we attributed that to the underlying infection along with likely long-standing untreated high blood pressure.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] follow up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5621**], a medical social worker, on Friday [**2184-8-20**] to discuss your financial issues and application for Mass Health or Free Care.
