She was admitted with hypotension and ARF, treated for a night in the MICU and transferred to the floor for management of hepatorenal syndrome with or without AIN.
There, she developed another desquamative rash.
Her hypotension likely likely related to dehdryation vs. hepatorenal syndrome.
A dopper U/S of the abdomen showed sluggish flow in the portal system.
While in the MICU the patient continued to have low urine output.
No episodes of hypotension while on the floor.
# ARF- Likely pre-renal vs. hepatorenal syndrome.
Renal ultrasound was normal and urine eos were negative but had persistent peripheral eosinophilia.
# GI bleed.
EGD showed non-bleeding esophageal varices.
A colonoscopy showed bleeding hemorroids, but they were unable to intervene upon them.
Given the degree of bleeding, the patient was intubated for airway protection in setting of large volume resucscitation.
It took several days for her sedative medications (fentanyl and versed) to clear likely due to impaired hepatic metabolism, but she was ultimately extubated on [**2125-9-3**].
Pt had no issues w/ bleeding while on the floor after transfer from MICU.
# Drug rash.
Patient developed a drug rash and low grade fever in setting of being started on Ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis while in the MICU.
Drug rash, fever, and eosinophilia resolved with removal of ceftriaxone.
# Coag Negative Staphyllococcemia - During the time that she re-desquamated on the floor, she was febrile.
Cultures were ordered and [**2-9**] were positive for coag neg staph.
Pt remained afebrile, w/ no signs of infection while on the floor.
There was about 8 liters of ascites and extensive varices throughout the peritoneal cavity.
There did not appear to be any lesions identified by palpation of the pylorus and prepyloric area.
There were no areas of external puckering or pathologicabnormality on the stomach to suggest ulcerated lesions, mass lesions or abnormality.
Based upon the patient's extensive portal hypertension and varices, performing a gastrotomy to try to visualize or to palpate a lesion that we could not palpate externally was not warranted and so that portion of the procedure was terminated and the liver transplant procedure moved forward.
The biliary anastomosis has a size mismatch.
She has some abdominal pain when the tube feeds were cut to 14 hour cycle and the time was lengthened and volume decreased to evaluate her tolerance, however by time of discharge she returned to continuous tube feeds and was changed to a renal formula due to hyperkalemia The drain behind the liver continued with very high ascitic fluid output, 2-3 Liters daily.
She remained afebrile throughout the post transplant period.
Her liver function tests improved daily, and her weight stabilized, although she still had a small amount of peripheral edema and some ascites.
