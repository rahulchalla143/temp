With treatment for encephalopathy at OSH, NH3 243 -> 11, however, worsening hyperbilirubinemia (8.1 -->16.3), xferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of possible transplant.
Patient transfered to MICU after development of hypotension and respiratory failure.
Past Medical History: PmHx: HCV genotype IA refractory to IFN x 2 ascites grade I esophageal varices (EGD [**11-1**]) h/o esophageal candidiasis s/p ccx DM II HTN asthma hypothyroid depression amenorrhea migraines  Echo [**4-2**]: EF >65%, no WMA, trivial TR.
ETT [**5-3**]: no ischemic EKG changes, no perfusion defects at good target HR, EF ~60%, no WMA.
Social History: h/o ETOH abuse h/o IVDU quit tobacco 1 yr ago on disability  Physical Exam: 97.9   120/50   102   22   94% 2L  Gen: lying in bed, jaundiced, obese HEENT: no JVD Pulm: decreased breath sounds on right side, otherwise CTA Cardiac: RRR, S1, S2 Abd: obese, distended, diffusely tender, no rebound Ext: anasarca Neuro: AO x self, hospital, thinks year is "[**2103**]", otherwise non-focal  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 49F ESLD [**3-2**] HCV, s/p TIPS for refractory ascites, admitted for rising TBili who subsequently developed respiratory failure and was transfered to the MICU.
However on HD 17 the patient became hypotensive with elevated wbc, and lactic acidosis to 15.
Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to a pleural effusion which was tapped.
Pleural fluid analysis was consistent w/ a transudate likely from ascites/liver failure.
However, the patient was reintubated on HD 17 after she developed sepsis from which she died on HD 18.
ESLD: Acute on chronic liver failure.
Lactulose was continued for hepatic encephalopathy.
4) Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia - secondary to ESLD.
5) ARF: Hepatorenal syndrome versus ATN (granular casts in urine).
