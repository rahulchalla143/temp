Admission Date:  [**2197-12-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-1-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2144-12-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**] Chief Complaint: Fever, respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation, lumbar puncture, insertion of CVL  History of Present Illness: 52 yo female, h/o hyperlipidemia, DM, HTN, presenting after returning from [**Country 11150**] with fever of unknown origin.
As per their notes, she had been feeling unwell since the 2nd leg of her flight, with symptoms of fever, chills, diffuse muscular pain, HA, weakness, and rigors.
She had denied diarrha, photophobia, nuchal rigidity, nausea; she had been complaining of pain in the left ear x 1 day.
She had a mild transaminitis.
EKG showed LBBB (thought to be old), and thick/thin smear was negative for parasites.
Further workup included hepatitis serologies (pending), TTE which showed severely depressed EF=25%.
She had mild drop in hematocrit/plts.
She did not improve and was intubated on [**12-16**] [**2-22**] hypoxic respiratory failure (?flash pulmonary edema vs. ARDS).
CT of the head was performed and was negative for any acute process.
Upon transfer, she had a brief episode of hypotension upon transfer that responded to fluid bolus.
HTN 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
CHF: EF reportedly 35% in past (?was this in setting of urosepsis), followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32963**] at [**Hospital1 112**]   Social History: no t/e/d, recently returned from [**Country 11150**] as above; was there for 12 days, rural area   Family History: Father with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer  Physical Exam: PE: BS: 101.0   86 (SR)  94/56   23   100% AC, FiO2=100%, TV=500, R=14, breathing at 23, PEEP=5 Gen: intubated, sedated, unresponsive HEENT: PERRL, OP clear, MMM Neck: no JVD Lungs: rhonchorous diffusely to anterior exam, no w/r CV: 2/6 SEM at LUSB Abd: soft, nt/nd, nabs Extr: no c/c/e, DP 2+ bilat Left ear: with stitches, mild erythema Lines: Right femoral, 2 x PIV; no erythematous Neuro: toes downgoing bilaterally, sedated   Pertinent Results: Relevant Labs/Studies:  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Fever:  She initially presented to the OSH with fevers (as high as 105.0).
LP was performed upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and was negative for signs of infection.
Dengue fever and leptospirosis were also sent.
She respiked with evidence of an infiltrate s/p failed extubation and was started on vanco/zosyn for VAP.
She remained afebrile after this one temp spike and completed a 10-day course of vanc/zosyn.
Procedure was complicated by 3 degree av block and was transfer to MICU.
In the MICU, after having two femoral lines and a temporal wire pacer patient spiked [**2198-1-5**].
She remained having low grade fever and spiked to 101 while on the floor again.
Multiple blood culrues and urine cultures were drawn and all came back negative.
Given persistent negative results for fever source, and rash drug fever was contemplated.
Patient fevers decreased and remained afebrile since [**2197-12-12**].
All antibiotics were discontinued with resolution of rash and serum eosinophilia.Patients Temp.
Patient remained to have low grade temps(100.0 max) but all blood, urine, sputum, andtips cultures remained without growth.
Liver was consulted and believed that the rise in ALT/AST was less consistent with Dengue fever and more consistent with shock liver [**2-22**] episode of hypotension peri-intubation at OSH (induced by sedating medications, lasix).
Urine was examined and had many muddy brown casts.
This was most likely consistent with ATN, given episode of hypotension described above.
Due to anuria, metabolic acidosis and rising creatinine up to 10, renal made the decision to dialyze.
A temporary dialysis catheter was placed, and HD was started during anuric period to manage acid/base status and volume issues.
She maintained excellent urine output,only requiring HD to manage a question of uremic rub.
Respiratory failure:  This was likely hypercarbic, secondary to capillary leak/respiratory distress.
After eight days of intubation, she was extubated but failed requiring re-intubation likely secondary to volume overload, tachypnea [**2-22**] underlying metabolic acidosis.
There may have been vocal cord edema (no cuff leak), so she was given 48 hours of Decadron.
Hypotension: She was hypotensive peri-intubation period, likely from sedating medications and lasix she received.
... EF was likely depressed in the setting of inflammation/sepsis and will likely recover.
Lopressor was restarted, and hydralazine/nitrate were added for afterload reduction.
-- Rhythm: She was taken to the OR for placement of a R IJ Permacath.
Her heart rate climbed to the 150s, thought to be atrial tachycardia with 3:1 heart block.
Pt was then noted to have a junctional rhythm with RBBB rather than LBBB, and appeared to have complete AV dissociation.
Temp PM was removed [**2197-12-25**] without complications, and remained in NSR.
Coagulopathy:  INR was initially mildly elevated, and platelets dropped.
DM: She was put on Insulin drip while in the ICU for aggressive blood sugar control.
Lipitor was held initially given elevated transaminases.
Patient had a depresed mood and was extremely frustrated because she could not go home.
After being admitted for the second time to the MICU, patient again became extremely withdrawn.
Unclear dx Uremia vs. Catatonic Depression vs. ICU psychosis.
