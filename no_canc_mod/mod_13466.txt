# GI Bleed/Anemia:  Blood loss anemia from GI bleeding.
Of note, patient had a prior major bleed from AVM at hepatic flexure requiring transfusion of 15U PRBC and IR embolization.
Tagged red blood cell scan revealed brisk bleeding in the distal ascending colon/hepatic flexure.
Pt had persistent BRBPR so underwent colonoscopy on [**4-8**] which revealed a visible vessel at post-polypectomy site which was injected.
Upon discharge, he was scheduled with close cardiac follow-up.
# Shortness of breath: Patient had an episode of SOB on [**4-9**] early morning.
This was thought to be secondary to fluid overload (in setting of holding diuretics and getting blood) so was given IV ethacrynic acid.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and troponin was mildly elevated to 0.13, CK peak 120, MB peak 15, thought to be secondary to demand ischemia.
Upon transfer out of the ICU, he continued to autodiurese several additional liters of excess fluids.
