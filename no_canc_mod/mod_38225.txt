Admission Date:  [**2121-1-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-1-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-10-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catherterization with drug eluting stents x2 to right coronary artery.
After finishing this he began experiencing [**7-27**], substernal to right sided, pressure like chest pain that he described as someone stepping on his chest.
The pain did not radiate to his neck, jaw or arm.
At [**Hospital3 **] his EKG revealed ST elevations of II, III and aVF, and ST depressions of I, aVL and V2-V6.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was taken to the cath lab where he was found to have thrombotic total mid vessel occlusion of the RCA.
After re-perfussion he became bradycardic (HR 60) and hypotensive (BP 95/62).
In CCU, patient was feeling well with <[**1-27**] CP (was never CP free but this was an improvement) and [**2-27**] HA.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: CTA bilaterally but with diffuse wheezes.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Sinus rhythm with borderline resting sinus tachycardia and prolonged P-R interval.
Inferior Q wave ST segment elevation myocardial infarction which may be acute or evolving.
Reciprocal ST segment depressions in leads I and aVL.
ST-T wave changes in leads V1-V2 raise consideration of posterior involvement.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Lateral ST-T wave changes consistent with myocardial ischemia or left ventricular hypertrophy, etc.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
The LCx had a 20% stenosis in OM1.
The RCA had a thrombotic mid-vessel occlusion.
Successful Export Thrombectomy and PTCA/Stenting of mid RCA thrombotic occlusion with overlapping 3.0 X 30 mm ENDEAVOUR DES (mid) deployed at 14 atms and 3.0 X 15 mm ENDEAVOUR DES (distal) deployed at 16 atms.
Final angiogram showed TIMI3 flow, no dissection and 0%  residual stenosis in the stent.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
No LV mass/thrombus.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 58 yo M with no significant PMH who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with an inferior STEMI now s/p DES x2 to RCA.
# STEMI: Patient with no significant PMH who presented with inferior STEMI, s/p DES x2 to RCA and no other significant disease on cath.
Had hypotension and bradycardia post-reperfusion requiring atropine x1 and brief dopamine gtt for which he was admitted to the CCU.
His follow up echo was significant for mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior hypokinesis, and should be reevaluated in [**1-19**] months as an outpatient.
Furthermore, given the strong family history of early MI (pt and his father), his children may benefit from family history counseling.
# Wheezes: Pt noted to be wheezy on exam upon admission to the CCU.
likely asthma related.
No desats or subjective SOB.
# RHYTHM: Patient was having multiple PVCs on telmetry as well as short runs of NSVT.
He remained asymptomatic throughout.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 4. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB, wheeze.

Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for a cardiac catheterization.
You also had some wheezes and we started you on a steroid inhaler twice daily to treat this.
