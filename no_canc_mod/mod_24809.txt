EEG: IMPRESSION: This is a moderately abnormal EEG in the apparently awake state due to the presence of a poorly organized background with bursts of generalized slowing.
This pattern may correlate with a moderate to severe encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology, or it may be an indicator of significant subcortical midline or deeper structural lesions such as may be seen with extensive vascular disease.
No evidence of ongoing or potential epileptogenesis was seen at the time of this recording.

Fever: The patient presented with high fevers and low grade leukocytosis.
With new seizures and altered mental status there was concern for a CNS infection.
Neurology felt a CNS infection was very unlikely.
CT head without acute pathology.
EEG was without epileptigenic focus.
Most likely this represented seizure from the area of prior CVA in the setting of acute illness.
Altered mental status: Likely [**3-9**] infection with underlying dementia and seizure activity and maybe medication effect.
Her mental status improved somewhat with treatment of the underlying infection though not back to baseline with some persistent episodes of somnolence and limited responsiveness.
Afib: Appears to be a new onset, likely occuring in the setting of uncontrolled HTN and infection.
She was started on labetalol, continued on oral amlodipine and given PRN PO hydralazine for uncontrolled hypertension.
Initially her home HCTZ and ACEi were held due to renal insufficiency however these were restarted after return of renal function.
Goals of care: The patient has an extremely limited prognosis.
It is the patient's and her family's wishes for her to have no further aggressive or uncomfortable measures and to be cared for at her long-term care facility.
