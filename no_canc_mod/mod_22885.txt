Full left-sided Maze procedure with a combination of the     AtriCure bipolar Synergy system and a CryoCath with     resection of left atrial appendage.
Pericardial resection.
History of Present Illness: 84 year old female with history of mitral regurgitation and a chronic pericardial effusion who was admitted for shortness of breath this past [**Month (only) 359**].
Her pericardial effusion was again noted however the decision was made not to drain it as the effusion was stable without evidence of tamponade.
Her last echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation with mild to moderate tricuspid regurgition.
As well she suffers from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Given her espisode of heart failure and her severe mitral regurgitation, she has been referred for surgical management.

No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Conclusions Prebypass  No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Tricuspid regurgitation is [**12-27**] +.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
Post bypass  Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine and epinephrine.
The tricuspid regurgitation is mild.
There are persistent low lung volumes.
Bilateral atelectasis larger on the left side have improved.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
No other signs were noted as facial twitching or foot movements.
Head Ct scan was done which showed no acute intracranial pathology, especially no hemorrhage or large mass detected.
EEG was consistent with clinical seizure.
Etiology of seizures possibly from ischemic stroke.
MRI on [**12-16**] showed:Scattered foci of restricted diffusion identified in both cerebral hemispheres involving the frontal lobes and parietal regions, likely  consistent with a thromboembolic ischemic event.
She continued to progress favorably in clinical terms;and currently the only appreciable finding is weakness in the left arm.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of her strength and mobility.
