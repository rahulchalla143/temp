CT head was negative for hemorrhage/shift.RUQ ultrasound has no ascites.
KUB show ileus  MICU: started on lactulose-> mental status started to improve, started on levo/flagyl, then bld cx grew gm + cocci   Past Medical History: 1.Cirrhosis [**2-15**] EtOH 2.Depression 3.HTN 4.s/p falls, last in [**1-17**] secondary to mechanical fall 5.Cholelithiasis s/p cholecystecomy 6.h/o stroke with resultant dysarthria 7.h/o thrombocytopenia 8.h/o GI bleed 9.Osteoporosis 10.R ext weakness 11.Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 12.Diffuse sm vessel disease of brain.
Family History: Mother died at 74 with cirrhosis, DM and HTN Father died in late 70s of CVA  Physical Exam: Gen- cachetic elderly woman HEENT- anicteric, oral mucosa dry, neck supple, oropharyn not visualized as patient refuse to open mouth CV- rrr, no r/m/g resp- CTAB, no accessory muscle use abdomen- soft, NT/ND, no hepatosplenomegaly extremities- no pedal edema neurological- coherent and obeys command, appropriate   Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2175-10-31**] TTE - The left atrium is normal in size.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetations seen.
The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.
[**2175-10-29**] Abdominal X-Ray - Probable mild ileus [**2175-10-28**] CT Abdomen -  Cirrhotic liver with portal hypertension.
Nonspecific thickening of right colon.
This is a recognized feature of chronic liver disease with portal hypertension.
Multiple small low-attenuation lesions in the liver.
[**2175-10-26**] Abdomen X-Ray - Air-filled loops of small and large bowel, consistent with an ileus pattern.
[**2175-10-26**] CXR - No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2175-10-26**] CT Head - No intracranial hemorrhage identified [**2175-10-26**] Liver U/S - Nodular liver, with no interval change in appearance in comparison to prior study.
No new mass lesions are identified within the liver.
A tiny amount of perihepatic fluid is noted.
<br> Cultures: [**2175-11-1**] Blood - pending [**2175-10-31**] Blood - pending [**2175-10-30**] Blood - pending [**2175-10-29**] Blood - pending [**2175-10-28**] Blood - pending [**2175-10-26**] Blood - coag negative staph [**2175-10-26**] Urine - STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
Altered mental status - at the time of admission the thought was that the patient had hepatic encephalopathy because of poor complaince with lactulose.
Her ammonia level was elevated on admission consistent with previous admission for hepatic encephalopathy.
She has had daily blood cultures since [**10-26**] none of which have been positive.
The patient has been encouraged to increase her PO intake to prevent dehydration and hypotension.
Alcoholic cirrhosis - The patient was continued on lactulose and it was titrated up to [**4-18**] bowel movements per day.
She was continued on aldactone which was held on several occassions secondary to dehydration and hypotension.
Diabetes - The patient was continued on an ISS while hospitalized.
Hypertension - blood pressure was not elevated during this admission.
Elevated INR (at baseline) - secondary to end stage liver disease.
The patient had 3 doses of Vitamin K during the admission secondary to elevated INR.
Thrombocytopenia likely from chronic liver disease, at baseline.
7 Ileus - the patient was nausea and vomiting on admission and found to have an ileus by KUB.
Her symptoms gradually improved and she was tolerating a regular PO diet by the time of discharge.
--Return to the ED for any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, or increased confusion.
--Please increase your water/fluid intake every day to prevent dehydration or hypotension.
