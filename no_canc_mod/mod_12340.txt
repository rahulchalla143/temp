Admission Date:  [**2183-2-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-2-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-11-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Allergies/ADRs on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: s/p cardiac cath with BMS to prox RCA, hypertensive urgency   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 55 yo W with Hx of CAD s/p PCI with BMS to RCA in [**4-13**], also PVD s/p R SFA stenting, dCHF, IDDM, HTN, HLD and active tobacco use who presented to OSH on [**2183-2-7**] with acute dyspnea and chest discomfort, had pulmonary edema on CXR and elevated troponins (peak at 0.67).
Treated with IV Lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] with resolution of symptoms, and began on heparin gtt (which was d/c in setting of g+ stools).
At OSH Pt had one episode of agitation and disorientation the morning of transfer.
She was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] where she underwent cardiac catheterization and had BMS placed to a 60% proximal RCA lesion with positive resting gradient by pressure wire.
She is being transferred to the CCU for management of her hypertension and CHF.
She denies any chest pain, dyspnea, fever or chills.
No abdominal pain or pain at cath site.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: prior Non-Q wave MI in [**4-13**] - CABG: None - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: Cardiac cath in [**4-13**] with BMS placed to RCA (severe mid 90% lesion and diffuse 70% mid disease) - PACING/ICD: None 3.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
+SEM loudest @ LUSB, + carotid bruits LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e, + right femoral bruit SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas Pulses: faint DP & PT pulses b/l   Pertinent Results: Right and Left Heart Catheterization: 1.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
There was mild paquing of the LAD with a 60% ostial stenosis leading to a small D2.
The LCx had diffuse insignificant plaquing.
The RCA had a 40% ostial lesion and a 60% proximal stenosis.
The gradient across the lesion by pressure wire was hemodynamically significant at rest (32mmHg).
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart filling pressures.
There was moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
There was severe systemic arterial hypertension despite aggressive IV vasodilator therapy (SBP=184mmHg).
On careful pullback from the LV there was no pressure gradient across the aortic valve.
NSTEMI with one vessel coronary artery disease.
Severe systemic arterial hypertension 3.
Moderate diastolic dysfunction 4.
No renal artery stenosis 5.
There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo W with PMHx of CAD s/p POBA to LAD in 99, BMS to RCA in [**4-13**], PVD (s/p L iliac angio & R SFA stenting), HTN, HLD, IDDM presenting to OSH with elevated troponins and acute on chronic diastolic CHF, transferred for cath where she received BMS to prox RCA, and had significantly elevated blood pressures necessitating nitroglycerin and nipride gtts .
# Hypertensive Urgency: Patient had been receiving her home antihypertensive medication regimen at the OSH.
Per report, the day prior to transfer her pressures were elevated and supplemental labetalol was given.
Based on the patient's description of the procedure, a component of her elevated BPs was likely secondary to anxiety.
Given her baseline poor renal function we discontinued the Nipride gtt and re-started the Nitroglycerin gtt, as well as re-started her outpatient antihypertensive regimen (except for Lisinopril during [**Last Name (un) **]).
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Patient presented to OSH with acute dyspnea, and had CXR findings of pulmonary edema and elevated troponin (peak 0.6, CKMB flat).
An echocardiogram obtained at the OSH revealed preserved EF of 55%, mild MR, mild TR, mod elevated PAP, and mild LVH.
Unclear trigger as the patient denied medication non-compliance, dietary indiscretion, or symptoms to suggest infection.
Clinical exam revealed bibasilar rales.
She was continued on Metoprolol, but Lisinopril was held given her acute on chronic kidney injury.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: Likely secondary to contrast nephropathy given her baseline poor renal function and history of diabetes, despite pre and post-cath hydration.
# CAD/PVD: The patient has a long history of diffuse vascular disease.
She presented to OSH with elevated troponins (peak 0.62) in setting of CHF and chest discomfort.
Post-cath check was notable for a bruit at entry site not documented on admission physical.
Ultrasound was obtained and negative for pseudoaneurysm.
She was also given a prescription for SL Nitro to take for chest pain in the future.
# Agitated Delirium: The patient had one episode of agitation and disorientation during her stay at the OSH.
We performed a delirium work up (B12, folate, TSH, RPR), as well as obtained a urinalysis, which were negative for gross abnormalities.
According to her family members, this was new behavior; however, they had been noticing mild increased confusion for some time now.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended delirium work-up, frequent reorientation, transfer out of ICU, and Haldol if needed for agitation.
Remained in sinus rhythm, occasionally asymptomatic sinus bradycardia with rate in the 50s.
Has many microvascular and macrovascular complications including retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, CAD and PVD.
# Chronic Normocytic Anemia: History of guaiac + stools, but prior evaluation of GI tract has been negative.
# Peripheral Neuropathy: Initially continued Lyrica 100 TID, then discontinued it in the setting of her acute kidney injury.
Her pain was controlled with tramadol and low dose oxycodone.
Upon discharge she was given a two day prescription for Percocet for pain relief, then told to re-start her Lyrica.
Famotidine was discontinued in the setting of acute kidney injury.
# Risk Factor Modification: The patient was encouraged to stop smoking tobacco.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Home Health Care  Discharge Diagnosis: acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure hypertensive urgency  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for management of heart failure.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 69**], a cardiac catheterization revealed coronary artery disease.
You were admitted to cardiac intensive care unit for management of elevated blood pressures after your procedure.
You were given diuretics to help relieve some of the excess fluid that had collected while in heart failure.
While admitted, you developed acute kidney injury likely from the contrast dye that was injected into your arteries during the catheterization, a not uncommon side effect.
This medication was held due to your acute kidney injury.
Please START sublingual nitroglycerin for management of chest pain.
It will be important to have your blood drawn on Tuesday for monitoring of your kidney function and have these results faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you are unable to see her before Tuesday.
