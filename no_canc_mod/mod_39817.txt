Admission Date:  [**2176-2-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-3-1**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: S/P fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 83 y/o female with PMH significant for HTN, syncope, and significant weight loss over the past year admitted through the ED s/p fall.
However, this morning she attempted to go from bed to the bathroom without assistance.
In further ROS, no recent fevers or chills.
No CP or palpitations.
Pt denies any CP but has a nonproductive cough in association with a "cold" that she is recovering from.
No dysuria or hematuria.
Pt's daughters report that she is very unstable on her feet but deny any past falls.
A neuro consult was obtained but they did not feel that there was a neurologic cause for the fall.
The pt was found to have a pelvic fracture but no surgical intervention needed.
A cardiology consult has been requested for elevated troponin.
HTN- Off all meds since weight loss and occasional hypotension.
Weight loss- Pt has had a 50 to 60 pound weight loss over the past year.
Hyponatremia 8.
Mixed moderate to severe obstructive and mild restrictive ventilation defect 10.
Anicteric sclera.
Mildly dry mucous membranes.
Trace LE edema bilaterally.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**5-/2476**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
WBC SCAN: IMPRESSION: 1) Uptake in lingula and right mid lung, most consistent with pneumonia.
2) Decreased uptake in the distal lumbar spine.
Findings could be due to scoliosis, compression deformities, or degenerative changes, but if there is back pain, spinal osteomyelitis/discitis cannot be excluded.
CXR [**3-1**]: Large region of consolidation or focal edema developed in the left lung between [**2-28**] and 13, and it has progressed.
Right lung is severely fibrotic and shows mild pulmonary edema compared to the appearance on [**2-13**] before or early in this admission.
Tip of the right PIC catheter projects over the superior cavoatrial junction, but it could be in a small branch such as the right internal mammary vein.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 83 y/o female with PMH significant for HTN, syncope, and significant weight loss over the past year admitted through the ED s/p fall.
1. pubic fracture.
Cardiac- She was initially ruled out for MI, although her presentation was not highly suggestive of a cardiac cause, no stress required.
The patient was thought to be mildly overloaded on exam, and was given Lasix multiple times for diuresis.
However, it was later thought that her lung findings were likely more chronic and suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis rather than pulmonary edema.
Anemia- given one unit [**2176-2-18**]; Pt with significant anemia and a HCT of 27.5 w/ drift down to HCT 22.
No evidence of bleeding into fracture site at pelvis but may have had some degree on presentation.
Had recent c scope per patient's daughter at [**Hospital6 **], which was benign, per daughter.
She then developed bacteremia, with multiple blood cultures positive for CNS, last positive culture on [**2176-2-23**], with surveillance cultures after that negative.
The patient was initially treated with Vanc and Gent, then changed to Vanc, cefepime, and Flagyl when she developed a new consolidation on CXR, thought to be suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
The patient did relatively well on the medicine floor, then required a second admission to the ICU for increased hypoxia and tachypnea.
She was found to have a new infiltrate on CXR, and antibiotics were adjusted as above, per the ID service recommendations.
