The patient was admitted to the general medicine floor from the Medical Intensive Care Unit with multiple medical problems notable for long term treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with amiodarone.
Admitted [**2140-11-14**], with one week of presumed upper respiratory infection, congestive heart failure, pneumonia then developing into acute transaminitis observed when liver function tests were checked.
CT's of the abdomen and high resolution CT of the lungs revealed findings consistent with amiodarone toxicity, unclear etiology.
The patient's course also complicated by acute on chronic renal failure as well as systolic congestive heart failure.
As hemodialysis continued daily the patient's oxygenation improved.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient completed a ten day course of Levaquin and Flagyl for pneumonia throughout his hospitalization.
He had a cholestatic picture with CT findings consistent with amiodarone toxicity.
Of note, patient had two guaiac positive stools brown in color throughout his admission.
Gastroenterology consult at that time determined that patient should have an outpatient endoscopy and colonoscopy but that there was no need to discontinue anticoagulation.
Hematology:  As stated, the patient had a baseline anemia prior to admission at 32-34% hematocrit.
All stools were guaiac, two were positive in the remaining days before discharge and he was converted from heparin to Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation management.
The patient's hematocrit was stable and increased appropriately without transfusion in the remaining days of his hospitalization.
His differential revealed no shift.
The white blood cell count elevation was thought to be non-infectious and would be monitored upon discharge.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had a history of coronary artery disease with many risk factors for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and age.
The patient had a Persantine MIBI study that revealed no evidence of ischemia as the cause of his global hypokinesis found on echocardiogram.
The patient's statin and ACE inhibitor were held due to his hepatitis and acute on chronic renal failure.
The patient had no other coronary artery issues.
For his rhythm, the patient had a history of tachy-brady syndrome and had a DDD pacemaker in place and history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
EKGs revealed a left bundle branch block and AV paced rhythm.
For his pump, his ejection fraction was greater than 55% on admission with likely a component of diastolic dysfunction that dropped to 20-25% on admission with global hypokinesis.
This was most consistent with a high volume state complicated by 2+ mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Renal:  The patient had a history of chronic renal insufficiency with proteinuria at baseline with a baseline creatinine of 2.3 likely thought to be due to hypertension and diabetes.
The patient presented with acute renal failure likely due to a prerenal state that led to acute tubular necrosis due to congestive heart failure.
Integument:  The patient had no decubitus ulcers or rashes noted throughout his admission.
He had multiple video swallow studies throughout his admission.
Musculoskeletal:  The patient had very poor tone and strength.
Throughout his admission prophylaxis was maintained in place plus anticoagulation to prevent deep venous thromboses with proton pump inhibitors to prevent gastrointestinal ulceration.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to rehabilitation, [**Last Name (un) 7333**], on [**2140-12-7**], to continue his physical rehab as well as continuing management of his hypoxia and congestive heart failure and chronic renal insufficiency.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to call his doctor or return to the Emergency Room if he had increased difficulty breathing, fevers, chills or blood in his urine or stool.
He was instructed to see his primary care physician within two weeks of discharge who would then follow him up with appointments to see the gastroenterologist for an endoscopy procedure and a colonoscopy procedure to follow up on his history of occult blood positive stool.
He was also instructed to see the pulmonologist if his hypoxia persisted to be set up by his primary care physician as well as to see his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], to follow up on his congestive heart failure management.
