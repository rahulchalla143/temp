[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/dif    SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: ABDOMINAL MESH, APPENDIX, SMALL BOWEL FISTULA, SMALL BOWEL SEGMENT, SIGMOID COLON, GALLBLADDER.
Skin with ulceration, hypertrophic scar, and acute and chronic inflammation.
Soft tissue with fat necrosis, fibrosis, and foreign body giant cell reaction consistent with prior procedure site.
Appendix, appendectomy (C-D):  Appendix:  No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Small bowel fistula, resection (E-H):  Extensive serosal and muscularis propria chronic inflammation, foreign body giant cell reaction, fibrosis, and adhesions, with kinking of the bowel wall and focal mucosal/mural ulceration.
No ischemic infarction identified.
Small bowel; resection (I-J):  Small bowel segment:  Unremarkable except for extensive serosal adhesions.
V. Sigmoid colon, section (K-L):  Colonic segment with focal ulceration and granulation tissue at one resection margin.
There are also scattered crypt abscesses within the specimen, and areas of ischemic damage of the muscularis propria.
S/P MVA with multiple traumas.
Within this skin are embedded pieces of synthetic material which appear confluent with a recently healed skin wound.
The serosa appears smooth and a small fragment of meso-appendix is included with the specimen.
It is opened to reveal yellow liquid material that is serous in nature and an unremarkable pink mucosa.
The specimen is represented as follows: C = proximal appendix cross sectional and longitudinal sections, D = appendiceal tip.
Part 3 is additionally labeled "small bowel fistula" and consists of a segment of small bowel measuring 31 cm in length with a stapled end measuring 3.0 cm.
There is an area in which the bowel kinks upon itself measuring 5.0 x 3.4 cm.
There is a markedly erythematous area with a fibrous rim adjacent to this kink.
The specimen is represented as follows: E = specimen ends, F = representative sections of unremarkable small bowel, G-H = sections through area of fibrous tissue with erythematous mucosal surface.
Part 4 is additionally labeled "small bowel" and consists of a segment of small bowel measuring 7 cm in length and an average of 3.3 cm diameter with two stapled ends.
The serosa has multiple attached adhesions and is otherwise smooth without exudate or hemorrhage.
The specimen is represented as follows: I = ends of small bowel segment, J = representative small bowel sections.
The specimen is opened to reveal largely unremarkable mucosa with normal folds and no intraluminal masses or abnormalities.
The specimen is represented as follows: K = specimen ends, L = representative sections of large bowel.

INDICATION: 24-year-old male with multiple abdominal surgeries with abdominal pain and vomiting.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Bibasilar atelectasis.
There are multiple distended loops of small bowel with air fluid levels with likely transition point seen within the mid abdomen on series 2, image 55.
Findings are consistent with small bowel obstruction.
Small amount of free fluid is seen tracking into the pelvis.
Again noted within the abdominal aorta is a thin soft tissue density sliver, unchanged compared to prior study.
The previously seen left external iliac and left common femoral deep venous thrombosis is not visualized well secondary to bolus timing.
No definite fistulous tract is identified.
Small amount of fluid is seen within the pelvis.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
Dilated loops of small bowel with transition point seen within the mid abdomen with collapsed loops of small bowel distally.
Findings consistent with small bowel obstruction.
No definite fistulous tract.

LIMITED RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in echotexture without focal mass or intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
The gallbladder contains echogenic layering material in its dependent portion consistent with sludge.
There is no gallbladder wall edema or adjacent pericholecystic fluid to suggest acute cholecystitis.
There is no perihepatic ascites.
Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis.
Tumefactive sludge within the gallbladder without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No evidence of ascites or focal hepatic mass.
