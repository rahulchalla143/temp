He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] after a positive stress test followed by a cardiac cathetrization which revealed left main and three vessel coronary artery disease.
Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with Left inframammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein grafts to diagonal obtuse marginal and posterior left ventricular branch.
Aortic valve replacement with size #23-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna tissue valve.
He tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit in stable condition on epinepherine and levophed for invasive monitoring.
His chest radiograph showed volume overload and initial attempts to wean the ventilator failed.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol without complication.
He had several brief episodes of post-operative atrial fibrillation that were treated with beta blockers and amiodarone, following which he converted to sinus rhythm.
He was found to have increased swelling in his left upper extremity so an ultrasound was performed of this extremity and found to be without deep vein thromboses.
By the time of discharge on post-operative day fourteen the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
