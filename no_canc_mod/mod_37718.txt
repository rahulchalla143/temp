Admission Date:  [**2136-7-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-7-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-10-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**] Chief Complaint: Syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: 58 y/o F with history of NIDDM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, SDH s/p fall in [**11-1**] presented to an OSH after syncopal episode.
Patient awoke en route oriented and alert, c/o severe abdominal pain, no chest pain.
Initial ECG negative for ischemia.
A repeat ECG showed inferior ST elevation.
CT scan of head negative, CTA negative for PE/aortic dissection, CT abdomen negative for AAA.
Repeat EKG after scan with resolution of ST changes.
En route to [**Hospital1 18**], patient began to have increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Patient had normalized ECG with no ST chagnes, Dopa drip and heparin drip subseuqently dc'ed, decided to not cath the patient.
Patient continued to have copious amounts of diarrhea, remains afebrile.
On arrival to the floor, patient was complaining of improving abdominal pain with continuing diarhhea.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She also denies any recent hospitalizations or antibiotic use.
Of note, patient had a recent decrease in glipizide from 5 to 2.5 mg 4 weeks ago due to nighttime hypoglycemia.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema.
Past Medical History: DM, hypertension, hypothyroidism, s/p syncope and SDH in [**11-1**]  Social History: + Tobacco 1 PPD x 10 years, quit [**2097**]  Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Diffusely tender to palpation, more in RUQ, no guarding or rebound, no [**Doctor Last Name **] sign Ext: No c/c/e.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Cardiac Cath [**2136-7-27**]: Full report pending at time of discharge; showed 3 vessel disease, bare metal stent placed in the RCA, thought to be the cuprit lesion .
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %) with distal LV/apical akinesis and inferior/infero-lateral severe hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2135-11-24**], the inferior/infero-lateral severe hypokinesis and RV hypokinesis are new.
DISCHARGE LABS:   Brief Hospital Course: 58 y/o F with DM, HTN, presented from OSH with syncope, profuse diarrhea, hypotension requiring pressor support, and transient ST elevations in the inferior leads.
# Hypotension/Syncopal event: On the cardiology floor, she proceeded to have copious amounts of diarrhea with BP in the high 80s, which was initially fluid responsive.
BP susbsequently dropped to 60s/30s, which came up to low 70s with fluid boluses.
However, TTE showed depressed EF with a new inferolateral wall motion defect.
Given her stable hemodynamics and lack of pain, she was transfered to the floor, with likely viral gastroeneteritis complicated by possible ischemic colitis in the setting of an acute coronary event.
#ACS: Patient had transient ST elevations in the inferior leads which diaspppeared by the time the patient arrived in the cath.
Decision was made not to cath as she was not having STEMI and still had copious amounts of vomiting and diarrhea and labile blood pressures.
TTE showed a new inferolateral akinesis, and once patient was stabilized back on the floor, decision was made to cath.
Post cath, patient's pressures were stable, and groin site was intact with no hematoma.
She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in his clinic in 2 weeks for an outpatient stress echo to look for a reversible wall defect in her anterior territories.
# Diabetes: Glyburide and Metformin were held in house and patient's sugars were controlled on Insulin SS; will resume outpatient meds upon discharge.
# Hypertension: Patient's Lisinopril was held due to hypotnesion while in house.
# Hypelipidemia: Continue Simvastatin.
3-vessel Coronary Artery Disease 3.
Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea was likely due to a viral gastroenteritis, which caused you to become very dehydrated.
In the setting of your heart disease and dehydration, your heart muscle did not get enough blood, causing a transient heart attack.
You were admitted to the ICU because of low blood pressure, which improved with fluids and medications to increase your blood pressure called pressors.
A cardiac catheterization showed blockages in all 3 of your major vessels supplying blood to the heart muscle.
