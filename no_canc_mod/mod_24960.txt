Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 65427**] Admission Date: [**2154-11-30**] Discharge Date: [**2154-12-19**] Date of Birth:  [**2154-11-30**] Sex:  F Service:  Neonatology   HISTORY:  This patient is a 2.7 kg product of a 38 week gestation, born by Cesarean section for an abnormal biophysical profile on the day of delivery.
At delivery, the infant emerged pale, had decreased respiratory effort and a heart rate in the 60 to 80 range.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  There is a unilateral cleft lip on the left with a bilateral cleft palate.
Extremely pale on admission with normal skin color following a transfusion and an isovolemic exchange.
Neck was supple without any sinus tract.
Skin had no lesions.
Lungs had mild grunting initially with good air entry.
The abdomen was soft and benign.
Respiratory:  On admission to the NICU, the infant was on     blow-by oxygen with moderate respiratory distress evident by     grunting .
The infant received a total of 7 meq/kg of sodium bicarbonate     in the first 24 hours of life for metabolic acidosis.
Cardiovascular:  The infant presented with mild     hypotension on the first day of life and required a     Dopamine infusion with a maximum of 5 mcg/kg per minute     but quickly weaned off Dopamine by day of life 1.
A soft     murmur presented on day of life 1 which is [**2154-12-1**].
The     infant required an isometric exchange transfusion and the     electrolytes over the next 48 hours remained     significantly abnormal with significant hypokalemia with     the lowest potassium [**Location (un) 1131**] being a 2.4.
Hypocalcemia     with the lowest calcium being 5.4.
The infant also had a     mild hyponatremia and hypochloremia.
These were corrected     with electrolyte infusions in the intravenous fluid over a     period of 2 days at which time the electrolytes began to     normalize.
They feel that most of the electrolyte     instability was related to the severe illness at birth     and the isometric exchange transfusion that the infant     received.
The infant was born severely pale and anemic     with an initial hematocrit of 12 at birth and a     reticulocyte count of 3.3.
The infant received 10 mg/kg     of packed red blood cells over 20 minutes on admission to     the NICU, followed by half volume exchange transfusion of     packed red blood cells.
The infant also developed a thrombocytopenia with     a platelet count that slowly dropped to 50 on day of life     2, [**2154-12-2**].
A Kleihauer-Betke study was done on the mother, looking for     maternal fetal hemorrhage as the cause for the etiology of     the infant's severe anemia at birth and it was found to be     positive with 41.6 ml of fetal red blood cells in the     mother's blood stream.
This is the cause of the infant's     severe anemia at birth.
The infant has had no further issues with sepsis since     that time.
A MRI was done on [**2154-12-2**] which showed     diffuse abnormal cavum septum pellucidum and a question     of a low-lying interhemispheric fissure.
An EEG was also done on [**2154-12-2**], which showed:no     epileptiform discharges but did show persistent of the sleep     state and failure of sleep cycling..      Neurology has been involved with this family and the     infant will be followed after discharge (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 48342**].
The infant remains on     phenobarbital and most  recent phenobarbital level was drawn     on [**2154-12-19**] = 18.5.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Profound anemia due to a fetomaternal hemorrhage.
Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.
