There is an inconsistent mild swallow delay.
Penetration was observed with thin liquids but no aspiration was identified.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2128-8-30**] 2:29 AM  ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  Reason: Please r/o acute process.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old man with distended abdomen and no bowel sounds.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please r/o acute process.
INDICATION: Distended abdomen with no bowel sounds.
Rule out acute process.
FINDINGS: There has been no marked interval change.
A single dilated small bowel loops is present in the right upper quadrant measuring 3.5 cm, nonspecific.
No free air is present under the diaphragms on upright.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2128-8-29**] 10:42 AM  ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  Reason: abd pain  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old man with abdominal pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: abd pain  STUDY: SUPINE ABDOMEN [**2128-8-29**].
HISTORY: 76-year-old man with abdominal pain.
There is air and stool seen throughout the colon and rectum.
There are few air-filled loops of small bowel within the mid abdomen which is nonspecific.
There is no definitive evidence for free air on this limited supine radiograph.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2128-8-29**] 10:42 AM  ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  Reason: abd pain  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old man with abdominal pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: abd pain  STUDY: SUPINE ABDOMEN [**2128-8-29**].
HISTORY: 76-year-old man with abdominal pain.
There is air and stool seen throughout the colon and rectum.
There are few air-filled loops of small bowel within the mid abdomen which is nonspecific.
There is no definitive evidence for free air on this limited supine radiograph.
Allowing for the change in technique and penetration, there likely has been little significant change in the appearance of patchy airspace disease in the right lung and left lower lobe.
Findings would be consistent with focal pneumonia possibly secondary to aspiration.
IMPRESSION:  Evidence of airspace disease in the right lung and to a lesser extent the left lower lobe with frank consolidation in the right lower lung field.
Findings would be consistent with multifocal pneumonia or aspiration which is not significantly changed since the prior examination.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old man with mildly distended abd w/o ttp on exam.
HISTORY: Mildly distended abdomen with tender to palpation on exam, question free air.
Abdomen, two views including portable supine and left lateral decubitus portable.
A wet [**Location (un) 1131**] was provided by the resident, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63915**] at 2:47 p.m. on the day of the exam as follows, "I don't see evidence of free air."
The decubitus view is suboptimal due to positioning.
Allowing for marked limitations, no free air is identified.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2128-8-21**] 10:54 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: Evidence of ischemic bowel, inflammation, obstruction, diver Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old man with fevers, abdominal distention, n/v, abdominal pain, lactate of 4.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: elevated cr  INDICATION: Fever, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
Evaluate for ischemic bowel, inflammation, obstruction or diverticulitis.
There are no prior cross-sectional abdominal studies for comparison.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of oral and 130 cc of Optiray contrast.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There are patchy bibasilar opacities within the lungs.
There are numerous gallstones within the gallbladder, which is otherwise unremarkable in appearance.
There is a nasogastric tube in place.
The distal esophagus is distended with oral contrast, and the stomach is quite distended with contrast, with a long air-fluid level within the stomach.
The duodenum takes a slightly unusual course, with the third/fourth portion of the duodenum coming to the abdominal midline (anterior to the aorta), and then coursing immediately back into the right upper quadrant.
There are multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air- fluid levels consistent with obstruction.
Dilated small bowel loops are located in the right and left upper quadrants.
There is a possible transition point identified within the left anterior mid abdomen (series 2A, image 50) and in the coronal plane (series 424B, image 13).
Small bowel loops within the lower abdomen and within the pelvis are completely decompressed.
There is a small amount of stool material and air within the colon.
It is also noted that the transverse colon courses posterior to several of the dilated small bowel loops.
There are small triangles of fluid surrounding the dilated small bowel loops, raising the possibility of ischemia of these loops.
There is no free air in the abdomen.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a small amount of air within the rectum.
There are traces of free fluid within the pelvis.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
There are degenerative changes of the spine.
Evidence of small bowel obstruction, with dilated loops of small bowel and air-fluid levels present.
Small triangles of fluid adjacent to the dilated small bowel loops raise the possibility of ischemia of these loops.
There is a possible transition point within the anterior left mid abdomen.
Given that the transition point appears to be located at the anterior abdominal wall, internal herniation of significance is thought to be less likely.
The findings of small bowel obstruction and concern for ischemia were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3037**] at approximately 11:50 p.m. on [**2128-8-21**].
Brief Hospital Course: He is an elderly, debilitated gentleman with dementia, who presented with peritonitis.
# Abdominal Pain/Nausea - [**Month (only) 116**] be related to upper GI etiology.
However, elevated lactate also concerning for ischemia, but guaiac negative.
Diarrhea does not appear to be acute so unlikely acute infectious etiology.
LFT's not elevated (amylase elevation d/t vomiting).
- A CT on [**2128-8-21**] showed evidence of small bowel obstruction, with dilated loops of small bowel and air-fluid levels present.
Yet, he had minimal PO intake and will need to continue on the tubefeedings.
# GIB - He had coffee ground emesis that was guaiac positive.
No evidence of obstruction on KUB.
Hct was 40 on admission, but likely hemoconcentrated as not eating or drinking for multiple days.
#ID - He had a spike in temperature to 101.7 on the morning of POD 9.
#Radiology - [**9-1**] Abd CT: no obstruction.
[**8-29**] Abd-XR: no free air.
[**8-28**] CXR: pulmonary edema [**8-27**] CXR - LLL atelectasis is improving.
[**8-25**] CXR increased moderate-sized right pleural effusion, and atelectasis at the left lung base has worsened.
No pneumothorax.
[**8-24**] CTA- no PE, RUL interstitial infiltrates (edema vs aspiration vs pneumonia), [**8-23**] CXR: R lung and LLL opacities c/w multifoc PNA vs asp; [**8-22**] CXR Rt patchy opacity/retrocardiac; [**8-21**] CXR: L retrocardiac consolidation, [**8-21**] CT AP: Proximal SBO.
# Sepsis - Qualifies as severe sepsis with leukocytosis, fever, suspected infection, elevated lactate.
# Elevated Cr - Cr 1.3 on admission, down to 1.2.
# HTN - He was normotensive to hypotensive on admission -  His lisinopril and atenolol were held until GIB stable and the was managed on IV Lopressor as needed, until he was able to receive his pills thru the G-tube.
# DM - On metformin as outpatient - Hold metformin in setting of mildly elevated Cr and contrast from CT - ISS .
# GERD - - [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI .
# Seizures - On POD 6, he was noted to have some seizure activity in the AM lasting several minutes.
# Resp - The was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 for ?Tb precaution.
# Psych - Dementia based on outpt meds - Restart Aricept once taking PO - Ativan HS .
# PPX - - Hep SQ - Bowel regimen - PPI .
