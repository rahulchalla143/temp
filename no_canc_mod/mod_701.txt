This is a 31-year-old gentleman with longstanding history of Crohn's disease since age 12 years, status post ileo resection and ileocolic anastomosis.
The patient was recently admitted in [**2179-12-16**] for a Crohn's flare and has been on the steroid taper since his discharge.
One week prior to admission, his prednisone was decreased from 20 mg to 10 mg, and on the day prior to admission, the patient developed mild discomfort in his abdomen then extreme pain with nausea and vomiting today.
The patient denied any diarrhea or bright red blood per rectum.
The pain is located in the periumbilical area radiating diffusely.
Of note, the patient was given morphine in the ED for pain control and developed urinary retention.
Ileal resection with ileocolic anastomosis and small bowel stricture.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Prior cryptococcal infection involving spleen.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Generally, the patient was uncomfortable appearing, but in no acute distress.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Normal bowel sounds, soft, mild pain on palpation in the periumbilical region.
No significant distention.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin exam shows 2-3 mm papules over neck, back, and chest.
Mildly pruritic and nontender.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed prominence of small bowel with mild thickening and a very few short segments.
No evidence of obstruction.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 31-year-old male with abdominal pain initially thought to be a Crohn's flare.
However, over the next 24 hours after admission, the patient developed hypoxia and respiratory distress as well as worsening abdominal pain.
That night the patient did develop the transaminitis with ALT to 674 and AST 754 with an LDH of 861, and total bilirubin 1.6, pt 13.1, PTT 29.2, and INR of 1.1.
At this time, the transaminitis in the setting of the rash was concerning for a viral etiology.
Hep serologies were checked in addition to CMV, EBV, and an acute HIV infection.
Again that night, the patient was started on vancomycin for possible skin infection and doxycycline for question of tick borne diseases.
on Cipro and Flagyl for a possible Crohn's flare, on acyclovir for possible seminated zoster, and on amphotericin for a possible histo.
TSA was performed showing evidence of varicella zoster virus.
Of note, medical team was informed that the patient had never had chickenpox, and this is a primary disseminated varicella infection.
The hematology consult obtained on the night of [**2180-4-17**], was on the setting of thrombocytopenia, there was some concern for symptoms of process such as a cord, splenomegaly, or destruction by an immune mediated system such as a viral infection.
A smear was reviewed and showed no evidence of cystocytes and hypertension was elevated.
There was again some concern for DIC and the patient's platelets, coagulations, LDH, and fibrinogen were followed closely.
Again that night, the patient significantly decompensated and had evidence of respiratory distress.
However, he again have evidence of hyper and hypothermia.
On [**2180-4-18**], which is hospital day 3, but MICU day 1, the patient was noted to have significant abnormality in his labs.
There is evidence of mild renal failure.
However, DFA for VZV became positive and IgG for VZV was negative consistent with primary varicella infection.
In addition, secondary to respiratory distress, the patient was intubated for worsening hypoxia.
After intubation, the patient became hypotensive and received aggressive fluid resuscitation with 12 liters fluid, initially normal saline, and subsequently lactate ringers.
The patient was started on Levophed for hypotension and despite full it does not remained around 55.
The patient subsequently became difficult to oxygenate, and ventilator settings were adjusted to maintain pao2 in 70s to 80s.
However, the patient became hypoxic again and was reproned.
Regarding the patient's liver failure, LFTS continued to rise, chlorides continued to rise, and renal failure worsened.
The patient did have some evidence of DIC and was transfused cryo for fibrinogen less than 100.
Regarding his renal failure and multiple issues, the patient's acidosis was thought to be to secondary to shock versus tissue necrosis versus renal failure versus electrolyte abnormalities.
Regarding his acute renal failure, the patient's bun and creatinine continued to rise despite fluids.
There was some thought about initiating CVVH, and ultimately a catheter was placed by the renal team.
On the hospital day next, the patient was significantly hypoxic with pao2 in 37 with increasing difficulty to oxygenate.
The patient secondary to ventilator protective strategies under the Argonaut protocol,  the patient had been receiving higher doses of PEEP to improve oxygenation.
However, on this day the patient developed evidence of pneumomediastinum.
Further imaging was performed in order to understand etiology of liver failure.
There is some concern that there is evidence of hypercoagulable state.
Again at this time, the patient remains intubated on four pressors with increasing difficulty oxygenating.
The patient's transaminases continued to rise as well as coagulopathy worsening and renal failure worsening.
Regarding his problem, his hypoxia and respiratory failure was thought to be due to varicella pneumonitis.
The patient is on the ventilator with Argonaut protocol in the setting of pneumomediastinum, and there was concern for pneumothorax.
However, the patient's clinical status declined secondary to multisystem organ failure before this could be initiated.
The running of hypotension and shock; this was thought to be septic shock.
The patient is currently on three pressors, and blood pressure was responsive to volume resuscitation as well as bicarbonate, but there is lot significant concern for volume overload and pulmonary edema.
The patient has evidence of venous obstruction and was started on anticoagulation.
Regarding his renal issues, acidosis continued to worsen, electrolyte abnormalities persisted despite aggressive correction and acute renal failure worsened.
Catheter was placed with CVVH the day before, and the patient was initiated on CVVH to assist with volume overload.
The patient had increasing evidence of ectopy.
Family at that time did not want further shocks or defibrillations and at 6 p.m. on [**2180-4-20**], the patient expired.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Disseminated primary varicella infection causing hepatic failure, pneumonitis, and the renal failure.
Acute renal failure.
Hepatic failure.
Pneumonitis progressing to ARDS.
Septic shock.
Hypotension requiring multiple pressor support.
DIC with evidence of venous obstruction.
History of Crohn's disease.
