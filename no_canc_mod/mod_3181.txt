1) COPD Exacerbation- He was doing well on PO steroids and completed a course of azithromycin but after missing a night of nebulizer treatment, he underwent respiratory decompensation requiring mask ventilation.
He continued to have mild wheezes on exam, but subjectively was breathing more comfortably upon discharge.
2) Rising BUN/Cr: Cr initially 1.3 up from 1.0 at baseline.
This was thought to be due to pre-renal etiology and his creatinine subsequently improved to 1.0 with fluid repletion.
4) CAD: Cardiac enzymes x 3 were negative with no EKG changes.
He remains chest pain free.
Held Lisinopril due to elevated creatinine.
7) Chronic low back pain: Continued on Vicodin prn as per outpatient regimen  8) Hyperglycemia: High blood sugars in the setting of steroids (BG's=200's).
