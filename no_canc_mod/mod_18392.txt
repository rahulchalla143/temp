Admission Date:  [**2139-11-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-8-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Emergent vascular surgery with ligation of inferior epigastric artery and evacuation of right groin/pelvic hematoma  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 76-year-old female transferred from the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3549**] Hospital ER on the evening of [**2139-11-4**] with chest pain radiating to her right posterior shoulder area.
Initial EKG had some non-specific ST changes concerning for NSTEMI and EF per ECHO (TTE) done at OSH noted to be 15%.
Per outside hospital records the patient had reported that her pain was relieved after SL nitroglycerin tablets x 3 and Lopressor 5mg IV x 3.
She was also given a loading dose of Plavix 600mg in the ER and 75mg the following morning and she was started on both Integrillin and Heparin and was transferred directly to the cardiac catheterization lab at [**Hospital1 18**] and found to not have any obstructive coronary disease, LV-gram showing EF closer to 30% but prominent apical ballooning consistent with Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy presentation.
She began to have severe hypotension during her cardiac catheterization and was started on Dopamine then switched to Neosynephrine.
She was noted to have an expanding right groin.
Of note, given reported difficulty obtaining access initially thought was that she was having a iatrogenic bleed.
In the operating room the patient was continued on Neosynephrine, and had a right internal jugular central venous line placed and failed attempt at a radial arterial line.
Just prior to going to the operating room with the vascular surgery team the patient was also given IVFs and 2 Units of blood in cardiac catheterization lab.
Per vascular team, the inferior epigastric artery on the right was ligated and a hematoma was evacuated, removing roughly 500cc of blood.
Patient arrived to the CCU intubated and sedated and a few continued bouts of intermittent low blood pressures.

Initial EKG had some non-specific ST changes concerning for NSTEMI with possible cardiogenic shock given EF per ECHO report at OSH noted to be 15%.
Repeat ECHO and cardiac catheterization of [**Hospital1 18**] showed findings consistent with Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy and very scant evidence of coronary artery disease.
Unfortunately the patient's cardiac catheterization was complicated by a large right groin hematoma and acute onset of hypotension.
CARDIAC PUMP FUNCTION /TAKOTSUBO CARDIOMYOPATHY: The patient's heart had classic apical ballooning on ECHO and typical presentation of Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy.
Per patient's spouse she had been under stress lately regarding the death of a sibling and her upcoming glaucoma surgery.
Upon CCU arrival the patient's blood pressure had been challenged in the setting of a recent post-catheterization arterial bleed as noted below.
She had minimal crackles on lung exam.
She was successfully extubated with no complications and by hospital day 3 she had progressed to 95-99%on 2L NC and then she was weaned to room air with no residual  shortness of breath complaints.
The team ultimately decided not to maintain the patient on anticoagulation for her apical enlargement/thrombus risk given the recent setting of her acute hematoma and hemorrhage.
Iron Saturation level was 63%, however in setting of acute event iron studies were felt to be unreliable.
Given that Mrs. [**Known lastname 75808**] has no past medical history of diabetes (HgAIC 5.5)and limited PMH in general hemochromatosis is unlikely but she was encouraged to discuss repeat iron studies at a later date with her PCP as an outpatient.
She was also found to have a borderline high TSH which is also unreliable in acute setting and she will plan to follow-up with her PCP on this issue.
CORONARIES: The patient had very minimal CAD on cardiac catheterization with 20% LAD and mild 25% RCA plaques.
ST changes were very non-specific on EKGs and did not reveal classic ACS presentation for STEMI or NSTEMI.
The patient was monitored telemetry in the CCU and she had no additional bout of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or lightheadedness during her hospital stay.
Aspirin therapy was initially held in the setting of her recovery from an acute bleed but she was advised to begin taking 81mg of Aspirin daily at time of discharge.
Lipid profile was likely inaccurate in acute illness setting but showed no hyperlipidemia.
She had slight QT prolongation which resolved and her nonspecific ST changes also improved during her hospital course.
RIGHT GROIN HEMATOMA /ARTERIAL BLEED: As a complication of her cardiac catheterization the patient suffered a groin hematoma after an accidental arterial bleed.
The inferior epigastric artery was emergently ligated and a hematoma (approximately 500cc)was evacuated by the vascular surgery team.
At time of discharge her Hct was 29.6 and she had no residual right groin pain and minimal discomfort with walking.
PT cleared the patient to return home and she was cautioned to avoid lifting heavy objects 9>10lbs) until her incision site had healed completely in [**4-26**] weeks.
She will plan to follow up in 2 weeks at the vascular clinic to have her staples removed.
THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Post-operatively the patient had some lasting thombocytopenia with platelets in the 70-80s range at the nadir.
This was most likely consumption related given her large bleed with abundant clotting.
She had no additional bruising, petechiae, hypotension or further complications.
LEUKOCYTOSIS: The patient had a spike to a white blood cell count of 17.9 with neutrophilia but no left shift.
She had no febrile patterns, UA and urine cultures were negative and her CXR had no consolidations.
The brief leukocytosis was likely related to stress response of bleeding.
She will plan to follow-up as an outpatient with her opthalmologist regarding the need to post-[**Last Name (un) 9495**] her scheduled surgery a few weeks until she recovers from a recent acute bleed and until she recuperates from her current cardiomyopathy.
PROPHYLAXIS / CODE STATUS : Anticoagulation was held in the setting of a new acute bleed.
She was given Protonix for GI  prophylaxis in the setting of her intubation and she was given a bowel regimen of Senna and Colace to maintain regularity.
She was asked to please return to the emergency room or call her new cardiologist or PCP as soon as possible if she had any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness,lightheadedness or signs of bleeding, discharge or erythema at her incision site in her right groin.
Medications on Admission: Heparin drip and Integrilin started [**11-4**] but discontinued in setting of acute bleed on [**11-5**] (off both at CCU transfer time) -plavix 600mg [**11-4**], 75mg [**11-5**] -lopressor 25mg po .
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Takotsubo Syndrome / Cardiomyopathy Right groin bleed requiring surgical repair Thrombocytopenia Glaucoma   Discharge Condition: Stable Hct=29.6 Creat=0.7 K=4.1 BUN: 19   Discharge Instructions: You had a cardiac catheterization and that showed a weakness in your heart that is consistant with Takotsubo syndrome.
This syndrome is similar to a heart attack but your coronary arteries do not show any major blockages.
After your catheterization, you had a large blood collection in your right groin that required surgical repair.
Please weigh yourself every day and tell Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you develop a weight gain more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
Please also call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you see that you have sweeling in your legs and feet or if you have difficulty breathing.
Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 172**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you notice increased swelling, pain or redness in your right groin.
