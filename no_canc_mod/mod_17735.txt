Brain death secondary to anoxic brain injury.
Corneal, gag and cough reflexes were all absent.
His examination was otherwise only remarkable for some superficial lacerations without significant bleeding.
In terms of his imaging, review of imaging from the referring hospital demonstrated a subdural hematoma which was not causing significant mass effect or shift but there was significant blurring of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter interface.
His chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse alveolar opacities with edema, consistent with his prior neurologic injury.
The neurosurgical service concurred that the patient's major injury was likely anoxic brain injury from his submersion.
They felt that the subdural hematoma was likely not contributing to his absence of brain stem reflexes.
This showed no evidence of perfusion to the cerebral cortex consistent with brain death.
