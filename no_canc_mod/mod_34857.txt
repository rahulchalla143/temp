The patient states that at around 8PM after dinner on the day prior to admission he developed nausea and emesis x3.
This was followed by 7 out of 10 nonradiating substernal chest pain.
The patient presented to an OSH where he was found to have likely STEMI with ST elevations in I, aVL, V1-3 with Q's in V1-[**Street Address(2) 23394**] depressions in II, III, aVF, V5-[**Street Address(2) 77527**] depressions in aVR.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] cath lab where he was found to have 90% hazy LAD lesion successfully stented with bare metal stent.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Asthma Seasonal allergies Hiatal hernia Degenerative disk disease of the spine Sleep Apnea   Social History: Denies tobacco, EtOH or drug use.
Family History: No family history of premature CAD.
Right femoral cath site with 1+ pulse, no bruit.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The proximal LAD had a 90% hazy thrombotic lesion.
Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0 x 18 mm VISION BMS.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
LCX had no significant disease.
Excellent result with normal flow down vessel and no residual stenosis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, anteroseptal, apical, and distal inferior severe hypokinesis/akinesis (LAD distribution).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
[**2175-3-4**] Femoral Ultrasound: No evidence of right groin hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula.
[**2175-3-6**] Abdominal/Pelvis CT:  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 77528**] was found to have a STEMI with 90% occlusion of the LAD; a bare metal stent was placed.
Femoral US on [**2175-3-4**] showed no bleed, pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula, and Hct remained stable.
On the morning of [**2175-3-6**], he developed chest pain with acute ST segment changes on EKG.
He was taken to the cath lab and was found to have stent thrombosis of the proximal LAD.
Plavix was increased to 150 mg PO daily and no further complications were encountered.
Below is a problem based summary:  # Non-ST elevation MI: As above, Patient underwent successful PTCA with BMS to LAD, complicated by right femoral hematoma and subacute in stent thrombosis.
Acute Systolic heart failure: After MI, TTE revealed LVEF = 30% and moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, anteroseptal, apical, and distal inferior severe hypokinesis/akinesis (LAD distribution).
Anticoagulation was started to prevent ventricular wall thrombus formation.
# Right groin hematoma.
No acute exacerbation during hospitalization, patient maintained on home regimen of Albuterol PRN.
Acute systolic heart failure Secondary 1.
Asthma 2.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having a heart attack.
After this procedure, you experienced a blood clot within the stent and this obstruction was opened as well.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, pain or bleeding from your procedure site or any other concerning symptoms, you should call your doctor or come to the emergency room.
