No abnormal flow voids are visualized.
Given the lobar location of the hemorrhage, an underlying lesion is strongly suspected but not demonstrated on the current study and therefore a followup study is recommended.
Abnormalities in the right basal ganglia and left cerebral peduncle are suggestive of developmental venous anomaly and presence of this abnormalities as well as the tiny areas of low signal on susceptibility-images in the left cerebellar hemisphere raise the possibility of cavernoma as the reason for hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe.
CTA: 2.4 x 1.7 cm left temporal intraparenchymal bleed with associated edema and effacement of surrounding sulci.
No evidence of AVM, or mycotic aneurysm.
Otherwise no evidence of acute intrathoracic process  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 39 yo man with history of DM, HTN, unknown other PMHx, who presents from work with acute onset HA and aphasia, found on head CT OSH to have left temporal lobar hemorrhage (about 2cm x 2cm x 1.5cm, but cannot fully measure given quality of OSH films), transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.
On exam, he is awake with fluent aphasia, consistent with a predominantly transcortical sensory aphasia at this time, no other obvious findings on neuro exam.
There was a discussion regarding to the possible benefits from Proplex/clotting factor infusion, which was considered to be likely be low-benefit to patient, as coags have just returned normal; platelets are low, but with unknown source of bleed would not empirically give platelets.
As an etiology, although hypertensive hemorrhage was the likely one, we have also worked up for the possibility of hypercoagulability, vascular lesion (ie, AVM) or possibly underlying neoplasm.
#1 Left temporal lobe hemorrhage Repeat head CT [**11-30**] was unchanged.
MRI with contrast with hemorrhage revealed similar to the CT findings and additionally, showed faint enhancement in right basal ganglia, left cerebral penduncle consistent with developmental venous anomalies.
Also with tiny areas of susceptability artifact in left cerebellar hemisphere; raises question of possible underlying cavernoma.
Patient was initially loaded with Dilantin, but switched to Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
#2 Hypertension To achieve good BP control, we needed to increase Enalapril to 20mg daily and Metoprolol to 75mg TID.
Lipid panel showed high TG 183 (LDL47, TC 120).
#3 Diabetes Initially placed on Insulin drip then SSC.
[**Last Name (un) **] team was consulted for DM control.
DiphenhydrAMINE HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.
Discharge Instructions: Please return to the ER or call your physician if you experience increasing HA, slurred speach, weakness, sensory disturbances, or any symptoms that concern you.
Please follow up with  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7208**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 978**] on Wed [**1-22**], 12pm at [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center, [**Location (un) **].
