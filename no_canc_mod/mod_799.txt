He was treated at [**Hospital3 3765**] and did not have a cardiac catheterization at that time due to the fact that the patient's creatinine level rose from a baseline of 1.4-1.6 up to 2.5mg/dl.
Since that time, he has been followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from nephrology at [**Hospital1 18**] and his creatinine has remained elevated but is stable at 1.9-2.0mg/dl.
