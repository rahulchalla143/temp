The differential diagnosis includes recurrence of an ovarian cyst vs. a urinoma or lymphocele in patient who is status post renal transplant.
2) Hydroureteral nephrosis of the right native kidney with obstruction of the right native ureter at the level of the pelvic cyst mass.
Bilateral atrophic kidneys consistent with endstage renal disease.
However, mild enlargement of the right kidney with respect to the left,with noted mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter up to the level of a thin band of soft tissue adjacent to the sidewall of the noted mid-pelvic cyst seen on ultrasound examination.
This could represent the native ovary with a large ovarian cyst although a focal lesion at this level is not excluded.
The possibility of a urinoma can't be excluded.
Other possibilities include a lymphocele or a peritoneal inclusion cyst.2.
Multiple small gallstones in otherwise normal gallbladder.
This may represent a peritoneal inclusion cyst.
Although it has been only a short interval from the prior exam, this cystic structure may represent a new physiologic cyst.
ECHO [**2171-10-21**]  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
-CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2171-10-20**] 11:38 AM Allowing for differences in technique, there is no significant change in extent or appearance of the alveolar opacities at both bases, or the bilateral pleural effusions.
There is mild vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema.
There are more focal alveolar opacities at both bases consistent with bibasilar pneumonias.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Compared to [**2171-10-18**], the left effusion appears slightly increased in size.
-CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2171-10-18**] 3:13 PM Progressive right middle and right lower lobe pneumonia.
New opacity in left lower lobe which may represent additional site of pneumonia or aspiration event.
New bilateral septal lines, which may be due to interstitial edema from fluid overload or may reflect an interstitial component of the infection.
-CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2171-10-17**] 9:25 AM Focal faint opacities in the right costophrenic angle, most likely representing pleural effusion and atelectasis noted on the recent abdominal CT scan.
However, early pneumonia is also a consideration.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 year old lady status post living, related donor renal transplant, IDDM, hypertension, recent total vaginal hysterectomy and left oopherectomy who presented with pyelonephritis, an enlarging pelvic cyst, right hydroureter/hydronephrosis of her native kidney, rising creatinine, and subsequently developed right middle and lower lobe pneumonia with worsening hypoxia during her hospital course.
FEVER, LEUKOCYTOSIS, BANDEMIA: Initially, her symptoms improved but the fevers, leukocytosis, bandemia, and creatinine elevation persisted so she was changed to ceftriaxone x 2 days for treatment of pyelonephritis.
Her nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain resolved within one day of starting the broad spectrum antibiotics and she tolerated a regular diabetic and cardiac prudent diet throughout her hospital stay.
Given results of urinalysis and the clinical picture, UTI/pyelonephritis was the likely cause of the patient's presenting abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, fever, and bandemia.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for hepatobiliary abnormalities.
Abdominal CT with contrast and MRI showed right-sided hydroureter of the native kidney and a large central pelvic cyst (larger than on preoperative ultrasound).
Because of persistent fever, she was started on IV vancomycin (one dose, [**10-16**]) and oral flagyl (3 doses, [**Date range (1) 25351**]).
On [**10-16**] overnight, the patient had a bout of dry coughing accompanied by acute onset dyspnea with desaturation to 88%, possibly the result of aspiration.
Chest x ray revealed developed right middle and lower lobe infiltrates.
Microbiological data was negative for multiple blood cultures, including fungal cultures.
Vaginal swab was negative for bacterial vaginosis.
In [**2171-7-14**], CMV virus was not detected, and screens for active EBV and toxoplasmosis were negative.
No flu virus has been isolated from nasopharyngeal swab.
PYELONEPHRITIS was possibly secondary to obstruction created by enlarging pelvic cyst and sharing of the ureter among the right native and transplanted kidney.
It is also possible that the enlarging pelvic cyst has a communication with the ureter, although this has not been demonstrated on CT or MRI.
PELVIC CYST: The differential diagnosis on MRI included ovarian cyst vs. a urinoma or lymphocele in patient who is status post renal transplant.
Drainage of this cyst will likely need to be performed as an outpatient to relieve the renal obstruction and to aid further diagnosis.
PNEUMONIA: While it is not fully clear, it is likely that the patient developed pneumonia secondary to aspiration with coughing in the middle of the night [**10-16**].
After [**10-16**], she developed worsening right middle and lower lobe infiltrates and hypoxia.
On [**10-18**], she was tranferred to the ICU for worsened hypoxia and concern for atypical infection versus progression to ARDS.
Her respiratory status improved rapidly, suggesting she may have had flash pulmonary edema or rapid decompensation.
INCREASED CREATININE: Creatinine increased over the past 2 months from 2.2 to a peak of 3.3, with an unclear role of the enlarging pelvic fluid mass and pyelonephritis.
Repeat urinalysis included sterile pyuria (>1000 WBC).
Prerenal cause for dysfunction was suspected with pyuria secondary to candiduria (unlikely communication with pelvic cyst).
Acute on chronic renal failure was possibly secondary to the obstruction; however, it is not clear if the native kidney plays any role in the analysis of creatinine clearance.
There were no clear signs of transplant rejection although it is likely a chronic, low level process that may have been exacerbated by use of lasix.
CHRONIC ANEMIA: Baseline HCT usually ranges from 25-30 as a result of chronic disease.
