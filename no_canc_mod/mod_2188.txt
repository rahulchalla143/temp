Sinus versus ectopic atrial rhythm.
Consider left anterior fascicular block of right bundle-branch block type.
ST-T wave abnormalities are improved.
There is a vascular stent traversing the left brachiocephalic vein.
Low lung volumes limit the evaluation.
Cardiomegaly is again noted with scattered bilateral reticular lung opacities, which appear grossly stable compared with multiple prior exams.
Possibility of mild congestion cannot be entirely excluded, though there is no overt CHF.
A small left-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded as well.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Bony structures are unchanged with degenerative changes of the left shoulder and right humeral head prosthesis.
Degenerative changes are also noted in the spine.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, possible mild fluid overload.
No evidence for mesenteric ischemia.
Colonic diverticulosis, without evidence for diverticulitis.
Stable focal dissections in distal abdominal aorta and left common iliac extending in to the proximal left external iliac artery.
Thickened bladder wall.
Correlate clinically with evidence of urinary tract infection.
Heterogeneous renal enhancement, compatible with multiple small renal cysts in the setting of hemodialysis, unchanged from prior study.
Stable pneumobilia suggesting prior biliary intervention.
Colonoscopy [**2127-6-13**]: severe diverticulosis   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12946**] is an 83 year old male with past medical history of ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, HD line infections, and prior GI bleeds who presented with bright red blood per rectum.
#) Bright red blood per rectum: Concerning for lower GI bleed (though cannot exclude upper source), given history of similar episodes in past.
Last colonoscopy was [**2123**], at which time diverticulosis was seen along with an abnormal patch of mucosa in the rectum and a rectal polyp.
Spine consult was called prior to EGD, with recommendation for keeping head in neutral position throughout procedure.
Colonoscopy was performed which revealed severe diverticulosis which was deemed causative factor for bleed and EGD therefore not indicated.
There was initial concern for fluid overloaded state given all 4L IVF given on the floor and 2 units of PRBC's that he received.
#) History of recurrent UTI's: Urine analysis on arrival was concerning for infection.
He received vanco/cipro/flagyl in ED, and was continued on cipro/daptomycin in MICU while awaiting culture data; culture grew sensitive Klebsiella oxytoca.
He had no fever, hypothermia, or leukocytosis to suggest SIRS/sepsis (initial hypotension was attributed to bleeding episodes).
#) Atrial fibrillation: Not on anticoagulation for history of bleeding.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: [**12-21**]  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath.
Disp:*4 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: - Gastrointestinal bleed - Hypotension - Urinary tract infection  SECONDARY: - End-stage renal disease on dialysis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] after several episodes of rectal bleeding.
You were seen by the gastroenterology service, and underwent a colonoscopy which showed extensive diverticulosis.
A urine test showed evidence of infection, so you were started on antibiotics.
