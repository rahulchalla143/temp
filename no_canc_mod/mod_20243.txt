Admission Date:  [**2178-4-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2178-4-29**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an unfortunate 80-year-old female with a prior medical history of hypertension, osteoporosis, prior left carotid stenosis, and had subsequent left carotid endarterectomy as well as history of polymyalgia rheumatica, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident as an unrestrained driver with possible loss of consciousness.
She was doing well, hemodynamically stable, however, she was complaining of left-sided chest pain.
She was diagnosed with multiple left sided rib fractures and evidence of crepitus.
Presentation to the Trauma Bay showed her to have extensive work of breathing requiring subsequent intubation.
Initial trauma survey revealed crepitus in the left chest and decreased breath sounds necessitating insertion of a left chest tube.
Chest x-ray had confirmed that she had a large left-sided effusion and multiple rib fractures with no obvious pneumothorax.
Her CT of the chest revealed a large left hemothorax with no evidence of pneumothorax.
A large left pulmonary contusion.
Additionally, the scan of the chest revealed a right distal clavicular fracture and left scapular fracture.
CT of abdomen with intravenous contrast on initial survey additionally showed no evidence of parenchymal or abdominal visceral injury.
She had coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
She was tachycardic, but had no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Her left chest had some mild crepitus, but there was no evidence of instability or flail segment.
Her abdomen was soft and nontender.
There was no ecchymosis or abrasion.
The rectal examination had loose tone, guaiac negative, no masses.
Her flanks and back were otherwise normal without obvious deformity or injury.
Her extremities showed no obvious deformity.
There was some minor cuts and scrapes over the knees and right elbow.
The patient was profoundly acidotic and dropped her hematocrit to 26.
Her abdomen became progressively more distended and had hemodynamic instability requiring high dose of dopamine and Levophed.
Upright chest x-ray had been repeated showing no evidence of intraabdominal free air.
She had a transthoracic echocardiogram by the oncall Cardiology fellow that night of injury revealing a hyperdynamic left ventricular function with an EF greater than 75%, a normal RV systolic function, no mitral regurgitation, no evidence of pericardial effusion.
There was spontaneous collapse of the inferior vena cava and the mechanically ventilated patient, which suggested profound hypovolemia, and her tachycardia precluded adequate evaluation of any wall motion abnormalities.
Due to the fact that the patient had initial survey on abdominal CT showing no evidence of visceral injury and the rapidly progressing abdominal distention with acidosis and somewhat collapsed IVC, it was thought that the patient may in fact be suffering from an abdominal compartment syndrome.
There was no obvious injury to the viscera.
However, after opening the abdomen, the patient profoundly improved confirming the likely diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome.
Over the ensuing days, the patient progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome as defined by her PAO2:FIO2 ratio being less than 200 with bilateral infiltrates particularly worse on the left side, where she had a confirmed contusion and left hemothorax.
There was no obvious persistent pneumothorax, however, as her daily chest x-ray evaluation confirmed this with a left chest tube being repositioned.
She was given maximal lung protective ventilation strategy including paralysis, low tidal ventilation, and permissive hypercapnia and permission hypoxia.
She had a pulmonary artery catheter that had been placed during her postoperative course for guidance of her fluid and electrolyte therapy.
She did receive a left-sided rib block several times during her ICU course to enhance her pain control and to give her an opportunity to participate in her pulmonary rehab and vent wean.
However, there was a significant component of pain and overall deconditioning that made her ventilatory wean prolonged.
Therefore the patient had a speech and swallow evaluation, and at the time of this discharge summary, the final report of the speech and swallow evaluation was indeterminate.
However, if she failed her speech and swallow evaluation, she will likely need a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube for feeding access and then a repeat speech and swallow evaluation as an outpatient can be performed in a couple of weeks when her aspiration risk was reduced, and that her mental status has improved.
Able to make weak grasp with bilateral upper extremities.
She appeared to have somewhat blunted affect despite being on a ventilator, the assessment was whether she may or may not have been suffering from a mild degree of depression as well as some intermittent waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] consciousness confirming the likely low grade delirium.
However, this was florid and did not necessitate antipsychotic regimen or one-to-one sitter or any restraining mechanism.
She had mild cephalization and evidence of mild overload, and she had bilateral effusions left greater than right, but nothing that seemed to be tapable at this time.
She had multiple left sided rib fractures, left scapular fracture, and right distal clavicular fracture, and her analgesic regimen will be key to control so that she can participate in her ventilatory wean and have adequate strength and analgesia to pull an adequate tidal volume to allow appropriate weaning as needed.
She did not have any specific parameters, however, it would be nice to keep her systolic pressures at least under 160 with a heart rate in the 70-80 range.
FEN and GI:  Patient had speech and swallow evaluation pending at the time of this dismissal.
Heme/ID:  She had no infectious issues.
She had some yeast that had grown out from a sputum sample at the end of [**Month (only) 958**], however, she did not have any florid infiltrate on chest x-ray.
She should be placed on a NPH regimen and tighten her sliding scales for normoglycemia with goal blood sugars of 120-140 can be achieved.
The patient almost certainly has some component of insulin resistance or perhaps undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.
She had no significant urinary cultures.
If her swallowing is poor, then she will receive a PEG tube for enteral access and feeding, and this can be reassessed as an outpatient in the ventilatory rehab setting to see if she can ultimately be started on an oral regimen.
She can be full weightbearing on her lower extremities as tolerated despite the pelvic fracture as previously noted.
Additionally, she should continue aggressive Physical Therapy, be out of bed, get a chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry, and trach care as standard fashion.
Status post motor vehicle crash with multiple injuries including multiple left-sided rib fractures, left hemothorax, left sided pulmonary contusion, right distal clavicular fracture, left scapular fracture, left superior and inferior pubic rami fracture.
Abdominal compartment syndrome resolved.
Status post acute respiratory distress syndrome now resolved.
Respiratory failure with failure to wean from ventilator.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Polymyalgia rheumatica.
