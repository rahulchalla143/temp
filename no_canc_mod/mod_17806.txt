HEENT: bilat periorbital ecchymoses, no hemotympanum bilat Neck: C-spine collar Lungs: CTA bilaterally, no flail chest/crepitus to palpation.
REFLEXES: DTRs 2 + and symmetric, plantars mute bilat  Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There are numerous small areas of parenchymal contusion and subarachnoid hemorrhage involving both frontal lobes and left temporal lobe.
Hyperdensity along the left tentorial leaf is consistent with subdural hematoma.
There is no shift of normally midline structures, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Included in the field of view are acute nondisplaced fractures of the lateral and medial walls of the right orbit, right temporal bone, left sphenoid, and left zygoma, which extends into the lateral wall of the left orbit.
There is a small amount of fluid in the left frontal sinus air cell and the nasopharynx and several ethmoid air cells are opacified possibly due to blood.
There is mild underlying maxillary sinus mucosal thickening which is probably chronic.
There are a few small locules of gas within the right orbit, but no evidence of retroorbital hematoma.
Multifocal areas of parenchymal contusion and subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the frontal lobes and left temporal lobe.
Small subdural hematoma layering along the left tentorial leaf.
Multiple nondisplaced fractures are better seen on the companion CT sinus facial bone study and reference to this report is suggested.
