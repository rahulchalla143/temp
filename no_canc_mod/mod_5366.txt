Admission Date:  [**2141-3-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2141-3-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-7-22**]     Sex:  F  Service:  TRANSPLANT SURGERY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 77-year-old female with a past medical history significant for a cadaveric renal transplantation performed on [**2140-11-30**] secondary to glomerulonephritis whose postoperative course was complicated by delayed graft functioning requiring three weeks of hemodialysis.
The patient was recently treated at the [**Hospital6 256**] last month for a sputum culture which grew atypical mycobacteria.
The patient states that she had a one day history of increasing dyspnea and orthopnea along with one episode of bilious emesis before presenting to an outside hospital the day prior to admission.
She denied any change in urinary output, frequency, or color but does state that she has been developing persistently increasing ankle swelling.
At the time of presentation, the patient denied fevers, chills, abdominal pain, cough, chest pain, or palpitations.
End-stage renal disease secondary to glomerulonephritis.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Atypical mycobacterium pneumonia.
Congestive heart failure.
There were no masses or bruits.
Lungs:  Inspiratory crackles bilaterally at the bases with decreased breath sounds.
Extremities:  There was 2+ pedal edema but were warm.
An AP and lateral view of the chest demonstrated moderately acute heart failure with no effusions.
An EKG demonstrated peak T waves with Q waves in the inferior leads.
The elevated creatinine was concerning for a problem with the transplanted kidney and a transplanted ultrasound was, therefore, obtained.
At approximately one day into her hospitalization, these results returned as significant for mild acute cellular rejection.
Given her worsening pulmonary function at the time of presentation and her history of pneumonia, she was seen by the Pulmonary consult service.
A CT of the head was obtained to rule out invasive fungal disease.
This test was consistent with Scedosporium pneumonia.
She was also maintained on Clarithromycin, ethambutol and Rifabutin for a total of six months to treat her atypical Mycobacterium pneumonia.
On hospital day number six, the patient became acutely short of breath with oxygen saturations in the 70% range and was immediately transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for a CHF exacerbation.
A chest x-ray obtained at this time demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions.
There were no EKG changes and her cardiac enzymes were negative.
The patient remained asymptomatic throughout her stay and was discharged to home with supplemental oxygen on hospital day number nine.
End-stage renal disease.
Congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Atrial fibrillation.
Status post inguinal hernia repair.
History of mild acute cellular rejection on [**2141-3-19**].
Atypical Mycobacterium pneumonia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She was instructed to follow-up sooner if she developed shortness of breath, chest pain, severe leg swelling, abdominal pain, fevers, or if she had any other questions or concerns.
