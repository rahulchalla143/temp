THere is hematoma in the region of the obturator notch with some hyperdensity within the hematoma which accumulates on delayed images, concerning for element of active extravasation.
note however that contrast bolus timing is suboptimal limiting eval on early.
No evidence of bladder injury.
Minimally displaced right lateral rib fractures.
no ptx or effusion.
No pulmonary contusion.
Likely right adrenal hematoma vs nodule.

spondylosis worst at c5-6 and c6-7 without critical canal narrowing.
[**6-30**] CT Head - no intracranial hemorrhage or other acute process.
[**6-30**] CXR - Displaced right-sided rib fractures as detailed above.
No definite pneumothorax seen.

The patient demonstrated possible extravasation of contrast in to a pelvic hematoma and IR was consulted, and elected not to take the patient to angiography at that time.
On [**7-1**] the patient was taken to the OR with the orthopedics service for ORIF left radius, [**Last Name (un) 101**] left proximal tibia which he tolerated without difficulty.
On [**7-4**] LENIs and CTA chest were performed secondary to ongoing tachycardia, both of which were negative for any DVT or PE.
