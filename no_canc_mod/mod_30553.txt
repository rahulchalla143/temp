Per report, she was cold, shivering, but AAOx3, denying any CP or SOB.
Also noted to have necrotic appearing sacral ulcer.
CT head and C-spine were negative, and CXR not suggestive of pulmonary edema or consolidation.
ECG did not show peaked T waves or changes concerning for ischemia.
Denied any CP or SOB.
During interview, SBP dropped to 60s, and patient was noted to have pulsatile abdominal mass on exam.
Also started levophed for persistent hypotension.
During that admission she was treated for [**Last Name (un) **] presumed secondary to rhabdomyolysis, and during a work-up for anemia was found to be guiac positive and underwent an EGD demonstrating erosive gastritis, duodenal ulcers, duodenitis.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a very mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
US [**10-4**] There are moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta but no evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm formation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions.
Left kidney cyst, no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Extensive diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
No evidence of aortic aneurysm.
Xray Right Shoulder/elbow [**10-6**] RIGHT ELBOW: There is no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or soft tissue abnormality.
There is deformity of the humeral head with large medial spurs and narrowing of the glenohumeral joint.
There are cystic changes within the humeral head suggesting old trauma with superimposed degenerative change.
No acute fracture is demonstrated.
RUE US [**10-9**]: Superficial thrombus in the right cephalic vein.
No right upper extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 89yo female with PMH of HTN, HL, prior upper GI bleed, and diverticulosis presents now s/p unwitnessed fall at home brought in by ambulance after a call by a family member concern about her safety and found to have hypothermia, bandemia, [**Last Name (un) **], elevated CK, and hypoglycemia.
Hypotension:  The patient presented in the ED with profound hypovolemia after being found down for an unclear period of time, but was normotensive.
The patient was hypothermic and exhibited a left shift (2% band and 92% polys) in the ED.
The patient was volume resuscitated with 6L of NS in the ED.
On arrive to the ICU, the patient became hypotensive to the 60/30's.
The patient had multiple sources of infection including a UTI vs. translocation of skin flora from 2 large unstagable ulcers located on her sacrum and on her L scapula, however, we had no positive cultures.
She remained afebrile, with a normal WBC count, and non signs or symptoms of infection.
An Echo was also obtained on [**10-4**] which reveal a hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function with an EF at 75%, making cardiogenic shock very unlikely.
Etiology likely [**1-30**] prerenal ischemia especially given significant improvement with IVF.
Despite initial CK elevation to the 1200's, no evidence of rhabdomyolysis based on sedmient which would have contributed to renal dysfunction.
Based on her initial BUN of 95, the patient has likely being hypovolemia and in renal failure for multiple days prior to her presentation.
# GIB- There was initial concern for GIB given a pos guiaic in the ED and in the mICU and HCT drop from 38 to 31 over 8 hours.
This HCT drop was in the setting of 6L of fluid resuscitation.
The patient had no episodes of bleeding while on the floor.
Iron studies were consistent with an inflammatory anemia, negative for hemolysis, and an appropriate reticulocyte count.
She had fecal material on her clothing.
She developed pain in her right arm, but did not recall if she fell on to it.
X-rays were negative for fractures.
# Superficial RUE clot: The patient had unilateral right upper extremity swelling.
An UE US showed a superficial cephalic clot.
# Fungal groin infection: The patient has probable dermatophytic infection of intertriginous groin area.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**]- [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Mechanical Fall at home Acute Kidney Injury secondary to dehydration Lower GI bleed of unknown source   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
While it is unclear what caused your fall, we do not think that you had a seizure or heart attack, or irregular heart rhythm.
You were brought to the hospital and initially treated in the ICU for a low blood pressure and minor GI bleed.
There are no medication changes to note.
