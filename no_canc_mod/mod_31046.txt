Pt was admitted [**2129-3-16**] at OSH due to a abd pain that started as substernal CP [**7-22**] 9 hours after dinner on [**3-15**].
Later in OSH started having more lower abd pain that was different that presentation pain.
CT showed a 7mm in lower CBD stone with 11mm CBD.
Pt became febrile after admission with rigors and temp to 104.2 rectally.
Pt became hypotensive to 80s and was bolused with IVF with improvement to 100s.
Earlier he also had some temporarty MS changes with a neg head CT.
Pt does report 2-3 weeks of a productive cough.
No tobacco, no drugs.
Drinks 2 glasses of wine and a cocktail daily, no hx of withdrawal.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vitals:97.9 137/79 60 17 96%RA GEN: Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, dry MM, clear OP NECK: no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: some expiratory wheezes ABD: Soft, mild distention, and tender in RUQ, +BS EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
[**3-17**] CXR: There is a single-lead pacer seen projecting over the left chest.
No frank pulmonary edema.
A filling defect is noted in the distal common bile duct with minimal upstream dilatation of the main common bile duct and consistent with a 7-mm stone.
Sphincterotomy was not performed due to elevated INR as per ERCP note.
Sphincterotomy was not performed in the setting of elevated INR.
[**3-19**] CXR: Lateral view shows mild peribronchial infiltration, in both lower lobes, new since [**3-17**].
Small right pleural effusion is new.
Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, and there is no interstitial edema or particular vascular engorgement.
Extensive gallbladder wall edema and pericholecystic stranding, consistent with cholecystitis.
No definite obstructive stone seen within the cystic duct or common bile duct, though CT is not exquisitely sensitive for detection of biliary calculi.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe consolidation which may represent pneumonia.
Incidentally noted moderate sliding hiatal hernia, large fat-containing right spigelian hernia, and diverticulosis.
No immediate post-procedure complications were identified.
#  Choledocholithiasis, acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis - Patient had a obstructing stone causing fever, RUQ pain, and hypotension at OSH.
ERCP was performed and it revealed a distal CBD measured approximately 10mm.
A single 7 mm round stone that was causing partial obstruction was seen at the distal CBD.
A sphincterotomy was not performed due to elevated INR.
He was able to tolerate Pos without difficulty.
He continued to have low-grade temperatures on this regimen, so the antibiotics were broadened to zosyn and vancomycin.
The patient had minimal RUQ pain, but no other symptoms.
This demonstrated findings consistent with acute cholecystitis.
Upon discussion with surgery (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and ERCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 99779**], a percutaneous chole tube placement for GB decompression was felt to be the best option rather than CCY, given the extent of inflammation and the [**Hospital 228**] medical co-morbidities (though no active medical issues).
Once his WBC and fevers improved, he was switched to cipro/flagyl to complete a 2-week course total.
#  Atrial fibrillation - the patient was continued on metoprolol for rate control.
His primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20948**], was notified of the current admission and agreed that bridging with heparin wasnot required as patient had not had a prior embolic event.
# Acute on chronic sCHF - patient has an EF of 35% per discussion with his primary cardiologist [**3-16**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, and is maintained on metoprolol, lasx, and ACE-I.
He developed acute on chronic sCHF [**3-16**] IVF resuscitation in the ICU; this was treated with IV lasix with good response.
# Productive cough: CXR with posssible retrocardiac abnl causing sx, or could be acute bronchitis.
A repeat CXR with PA and L was done to eval further the possible infiltrate and it showed signs of aspiration pneumonia.
He was continued on unasyn and cipro for it (on it anyway for acute cholangitis).
A swallow eval was done and it showed no evidence of aspiration pneumonia.
He was also treated with atrovent/albuterol for treatment of possible COPD component.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted here for a condition called cholangitis - infection of the bile duct due to an obstructing gall stone.
You developed acute cholecystits , requiring placement of a percutaneous tube.
