Intraventricular conduction defect.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2181-6-29**] intraventricular conduction defect is more marked and heart rate has increased.
CXR [**2181-8-28**] IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumonia.
CT Abd Pelvis woth contrast [**2181-8-28**] Small-to-moderate amount of simple ascites and anasarca may be from fluid overload.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and major visceral branches.
Hepatic steatosis.
Fibroid uterus.
CXR [**2181-8-29**] There is no significant change since prior exam.
There is no new lung consolidation.
Pulmonary edema is severe.
CXR [**2181-9-3**]: No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT Head [**2181-8-30**]: No acute intracranial process .
CXR [**2181-9-3**]: No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 60yo female with pmhx of CAD, CHF, ESRD on HD, T2DM, and history of chronic pruritic excoriations presented with lethargy, found to have MSSA sepsis secondary to infected [**Month/Day/Year 2286**] line vs. infected skin sores.
course also c/b delirium [**1-25**] toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.
# MSSA Bacteremia: Presented with SIRS criteria for leukocytosis and transient hypotension (although may have been near [**Month/Day/Year 5348**]).
The patient remained afebrile and WBC trended down.
She was transferred back to the MICU on [**9-1**] for worsening mental status and hypotension.
Dapto and cefepime started on [**9-3**], and per ID, to be continued for 7 days, followed by 6 weeks of cefazolin for presumptive MSSA endocarditis (TTE showed no vegetations; TEE not pursued as not within patient's goals of care).
# AMS: Likely multifactorial including sepsis, hypoglycemia, polypharmacy, and underlying psychiatric condition.
The patient's mental status fluctuated from lethargy at presentation to evening lucidity and profound AM somnolence, as well as hyperactive delirium with paranoia and hallucinations.
ABG was not conerning for hypercarbia, and was not hypoglycemic during admission and without signs active infection.
# Hypoglycemia: Most likely due to infection.
Low dose lanutus restarted at 10U qday, and will need to be uptitrated.
#Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Euvolemic on admission with O2 requirement but it is minimal.
Was volume overloaded after [**Hospital **] transfer to floor, however, after several UF HD sessions became euvolemic.
Thought that ESRD contributed to acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
# CAD: no CP or anginal symptoms at this time.
# DM II, uncontrolled with complications: multiple complications although control has improved with most recent HgA1c at goal.
# Depresion: Seen by psychiatry after reporting SI and depressed mood.
Options of obtaining TEE to look for endocarditis and for consideration of pacemaker removal given her bacteremia were discussed.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a bacterial infection in your [**Hospital1 **], and your [**Hospital1 **] sugar was low.
We believe the infection was due to your hemodialysis catheter, so it was pulled during your time in the intensive care unit.
This should adequately treat any infection of your heart or AICD, if there is one there.
We were concerned this may due to the infection in your [**Hospital1 **], and you were treated in the intensive care unit with medication to increase your pressure.
We believe this is due to your underlying renal failure in addition to your [**Hospital1 **] stream infection.
It also may have been due to your hydroxyzine.
Psychiatry visited you while you were here because of your depressed mood.
