Admission Date: [**2165-6-22**]        Discharge Date: [**2165-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-8-21**]        Sex:  F  Service:  Cardiology Medicine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45-year-old woman with a history of complete AV node block as a complication of mitral valve replacement, controlled by pacemaker, who developed CHF with dyspnea on exertion and fatigue in [**2165-4-6**].
She was begun on beta-blocker for the CHF, but was unable to tolerate the drug secondary to bradycardia and increased dyspnea.
Mitral valve prolapse.
Rheumatoid heart disease complicated by endocarditis.
General: Awake, alert, in no acute distress.
Tongue with serpiginous fissures.
No S3-S4 murmurs or rubs.
Lungs: Slight crackles of the bases bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft and nontender.
LABORATORY DATA:  Echocardiogram on [**2165-6-25**]: Global right ventricular hypokinesis with elevated pressure gradient across mitral valve, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures.
Transesophageal echocardiography on [**2165-6-25**]: Global right ventricular hypokinesis with large thrombus on mitral valve.
AV conduction block: The patient has a history of complete    AV conduction block as a complication of mitral valve    replacement in [**2155**].
The pacer revision was successful with no complications.
The patient was asymptomatic during this time.
CHF: The patient had developed CHF in the two months prior    to admission with echocardiogram from [**2165-4-6**] showing    global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection    fraction of 30%-40%.
On admission, she was without    symptoms of dyspnea or orthopnea.
Mitral valve thrombus: During pacemaker interrogation on    the morning of [**2165-6-25**], the patient became acutely    dyspneic and was noted to be tachycardiac.
Echocardiogram    was performed showing elevated pressure gradients across    her mitral valve and global right ventricular hypokinesis.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and felt that the patient was at high operative risk and would be better served by anticoagulation and thrombolysis.
The patient's symptoms resolved, and she was hemodynamically stable and was thus called out from the CCU to the medicine floor.
At discharge, the patient has no dyspnea or signs of pulmonary edema.
Mitral valve thrombus.
Congestive heart failure.
