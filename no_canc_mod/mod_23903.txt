She had a CT of the brain at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] which showed a right sided brain lesion.
III-XII: unable to assess  Motor: moves all extremities spontaneously, does not follow commands  Sensation: UTA  Toes upgoing bilaterally  Coordination: UTA  PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE: non-focal incision- dissolving sutures, well healing  Pertinent Results: CT:Right sided brain lesion  [**2104-6-27**] 02:30AM   GLUCOSE-112* UREA N-9 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-150* POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-111* TOTAL CO2-27 ANION GAP-16 [**2104-6-27**] 02:30AM   CK(CPK)-144 [**2104-6-27**] 02:30AM   CK-MB-3 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2104-6-27**] 02:30AM   CALCIUM-8.9 PHOSPHATE-2.5* MAGNESIUM-1.9 [**2104-6-27**] 02:30AM   WBC-6.5 RBC-4.13* HGB-11.3* HCT-33.2* MCV-80* MCH-27.4 MCHC-34.1 RDW-18.3* [**2104-6-27**] 02:30AM   NEUTS-73.6* LYMPHS-20.0 MONOS-5.6 EOS-0.4 BASOS-0.4 [**2104-6-27**] 02:30AM   PLT COUNT-324 [**2104-6-27**] 02:30AM   PT-13.9* PTT-21.1* INR(PT)-1.2*  MRI Brain [**2104-6-27**]: Solitary hemorrhagic lesion within the right temporal lobe.
The differential diagnosis includes a hemorrhagic mass (such as a solitary hemorrhagic metastasis), cavernoma, or sequela of amyloid angiopathy or coagulopathy.
A followup MRI following resolution of the hemorrhage is necessary to further characterize the underlying lesion.
Two small lesions in the liver most consistent with cysts.
A 7.1-cm lesion in the superior portion of the uterus may correspond to the fibroid but further evaluation is recommended by pelvic ultrasound.
1.2-cm hypodense lesion in the posterior portion of the left thyroid lobe.
Pap smear [**2104-6-30**]: AT LEAST HIGH GRADE SQUAMOUS INTRAEPITHELIAL LESION  Thyroid U/S [**2104-6-30**]:  Spongy nodule seen in the left lobe of the thyroid.
The gallbladder is entirely filled with small shadowing gallstones.
Ill-defined infiltrative appearing cervical mass, which is concerning for malignancy.
A GYN consult is suggested and this mass could be further assessed with pelvic MRI in conjunction with pap smear / biopsy.
Uterine mass with ultrasound appearance compatible with a fibroid.
Trace of fluid in the endometrial stripe with borderline endometrial thickness of 5 mm.
No adnexal mass identified.
3.2 cm mass involving the left side of the cervix, consistent with cervical malignancy.
1.8 cm left ovarian cyst which appears simple by MR but requires follow up if patient is postmenopausal.
Brain MRI demonstrated an enhancing R parietal lesion.
Susequently a C/A/P Ct with and without contrast was obtained which demonstrated multiple lesions in liver, uterus, gallbladder, and thyroid.
On [**6-30**] an a/p and thyroid ultrasound demonstrated a large cervical mass and benign liver/thiroid and cholelithiasis.
The patient developed left hemiparesis in the early AM which was thought was due to seizure activity.
On [**7-3**] an MRI fo the pelvis was performed and GYN recommended biopsy due to the pap smear result of high grade dysplasia.
On [**7-4**], she underwent R craniotomy and mass resection.
Surgery was without complication and she tolerated it well.
They consented her for a biopsy and she was discharged home to follow up as an outpatient for the procedure.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
