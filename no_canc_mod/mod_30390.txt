No acute fracture or malalignment identified.
Multiple degenerative changes.
Head CT([**9-19**]): Post-op There is a new approximately 3 x 3 cm left parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Expected post-surgical changes from left craniotomy with evacuation of subdural hematoma.
The degree of midline shift and mass effect is markedly reduced.
gall bladder us: IMPRESSION: Prominent hepatic venous vasculature suggestive of passive hepatic congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 82 y/o M with history of atrial fibrillation and [**Month/Year (2) 1291**] on coumadin, amiodarone, s/p Pacemaker, diastolic CHF, admitted s/p fall with SDH.
He was originally admitted to the neurosurgery service and had an evacuation of Subdural hemorrhage with a left sided craniotomy for bleed with hernation.
His post operative course was complicated by diastolic CHG exacerbation and strep pneumonia VAP.
He remained unresponsive after the second intubation and was made CMO.
ReIntubated [**9-24**] after 1 day on bipap for increased work of breathing and airway protection in setting of pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
He was treated with ceftriaxone for the strep pneumonia and despite better volume status and treatment of PNA, he remained unresponsive on no sedation.
He failed several pressure support trials secondary to hyperventilation and low tidal volumes, he likely had neurogenic respiratory failure.
Subdural hemorrhage: s/p Craniotomy and evacuation [**9-19**], done emergently.
had unequal pupils [**2-24**] and had stat Head CT showing no interval change.
The dose was decreased given low albumin and corrected level higher than measured.
Despite Improving Dilantin level and correcting hyponatremia, patient continued to have poor mental status.
Patient also has underlying myeloid metaplasia.
Possible etiologies of persistent coagulopathy were vitamin K deficiency vs liver damage vs most likely supratherapeutic phenytoin.
Shock liver unlikely, has not been hypotensive.
