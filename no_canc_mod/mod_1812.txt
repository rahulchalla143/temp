No aortic dissection or aneurysm.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Extensive atherosclerosis in the aorta, coronary arteries, and multiple aortic branches as described.
Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Incompletely characterized dense 4-cm lesion in the left kidney, which may represent a solid mass such as a renal cell carcinoma or a hyperdense cyst.
Multiple hypodensities in the liver and both kidneys, some of which represent cysts, and others are too small to characterize but probably also represent cysts.
[**10-4**] head CT perfusion: CONCLUSION: Old right middle cerebral artery distribution infarction.
No evidence of acute infarction on the noncontrast study.
The small portion of the inferior left temporal lobe suggests reduced blood volume and blood flow, with no evidence of elevation of the mean transit time.
CT angiography demonstrates patency of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries and their major intracranial branches.
[**10-4**] PCXR: Moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and mild pulmonary edema are new.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is increased voltage present across the entire precordium.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 113 218 90 364/431.14 70 13 107  [**10-5**] head MRI/MRA: Diffusion images demonstrate an acute infarct in the left posterior frontal lobe involving the motor cortex.
A small rounded area of high signal on FLAIR and diffusion images posteriorly within the sulcus could be due to a thrombus within a peripheral artery or due to a small infarct in the parietal cortex.
Chronic infarct and encephalomalacia are seen in the right frontal region from previous MCA infarct.
There is no mass effect or hydrocephalus.
There is moderate brain atrophy seen.
There are mild changes of small vessel disease are identified.
Soft tissue changes with inspissated secretions are seen in the right maxillary sinus with soft tissue changes in bilateral anterior ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Acute left posterior frontal infarct.
Chronic right MCA infarct.
No evidence of major vascular occlusion seen in the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of occlusion or high-grade stenosis.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+)  mitral regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2137-10-3**], LV function has decreased, and mitral regurgitation is worse.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo man w/ PMH sig for prior strokes, HTN, DM who p/w acute onset language deficits.
Neurological exam significant for aphemia.
His story was most consistent with a lesion in the inferior left frontal gyrus or to association cortex from Broca's area to motor strip resulting in mutism.
Given that no obvious vessel occlusion was seen on CTA of the head and the patient was past the three hour window, the decision was made not to pursue thrombolysis.
He had a chest CT as well given some history obtained of chest pain; this showed no dissection but did show mild pulmonary edema.
Neuro:  MRI showed a new stroke.
CV: Antihypertensives were initially held in the acute stroke setting.
Patient subsequently expressed to the primary team multiple times by written instructions that he did not wish to have a PEG placed.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: 0.5 Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for agitation.
