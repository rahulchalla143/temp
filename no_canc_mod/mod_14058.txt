Admission Date:  [**2119-9-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-9-17**]   Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old gentleman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who had the sudden onset of shortness of breath at approximately 4 p.m. today that was refractory to his usual inhalers.
Per Emergency Medical Service notes, no chest pain or recent illnesses.
Electrocardiogram there showed sinus tachycardia.
No ST changes.
Orogastric tube and Foley catheter were placed and showed poor urine output.
A chest x-ray was consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
His chest x-ray showed no acute infiltrates.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Diastolic heart failure.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
An extensive history of smoking.
Neck examination revealed no lymphadenopathy.
First heart sounds and second heart sounds were very distant.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
There was trace bilateral edema.
Skin examination revealed no lesions or rashes.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed endotracheal tube was in place, biapical bolus, diaphragmatic flattening, bibasilar atelectasis, small bilateral pleural effusions.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per minute.
Inferolateral T wave flattening.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is an 83-year-old gentleman with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation complicated by diastolic heart failure, hypertension, and a pneumonia.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was intubated for respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia for retained secretions most likely due to a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
The patient had very labile hypertension where his systolic blood pressures would go from the 120s to 130s and all the way up to the 200s.
On [**9-16**], the patient became profoundly hypotensive, so at this time the cardiac medications were being held.
PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient grew out Staphylococcus aureus (coagulase-positive) from two sputum cultures which at this time is being treated with a course of oxacillin for 14 days.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE/BRONCHITIS ISSUES: the patient was continued on Solu-Medrol, Atrovent, and albuterol for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchitis flare.
MILD CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had an echocardiogram which showed the left ventricular cavity size was normal and regional left ventricular wall motion was normal.
Trivial mitral regurgitation.
Therefore, the patient was felt to be in diastolic heart failure and optimizing of his blood pressure and heart rate were attempted to be obtained before extubation so that he would try to prevent flash pulmonary edema which we thought might be leading to him having wheezes rather than just his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  On [**9-16**], the patient became profoundly hypotensive.
It was felt to be unclear whether he was volume depleted or had been septic.
