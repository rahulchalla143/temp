Admission Date:  [**2189-7-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-8-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-2-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tetracyclines / Zinc  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation with mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: 65 yo F with h/o multiple admissions for aspiration pna now admitted with SOB.
Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 17594**] with aspiration pna and R elbow osteomyelitis and was treated with vancomycin and Imipenem which then changed to Bactrim x 2 weeks.
She was intubated and had copious prurulent sputum.
Pt started to receive a dose of vanco and developed a blotchy rash on L arm and vanco was stopped and benadryl was given.
While the vanco was infusing she began to become hypotensive and HR was in the 50's.
Therefore Vanco was d/ced (after approx 1/2 dose given), pt was started on meropenem, and given IVF for BP control.
Was given a total of 2L NS and sBP improved to low 100's, but she remained with decreased mental status without any sedatives.
Head CT showed no acute bleed.
During head CT, pt became hypertensive and more agitated.
Head CT showed no acute bleed, and patient was brought to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Other possiblities included aspiration pneumonitis vs [**2-4**] [**Month/Day (2) **] (although per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] has remained stable, therefore less likely diagnosis) vs pulmonary edema (based on rpt CXR later on day of admission - although unlikely primary cause b/c was not apparent in initial CXR, and no known underlying cause - cardiac enzymes negative x 3, EF [**5-7**] = 55%).
She was agressively diuresed and completed a 10 day course of vancomycin and meropenem to cover aspiration PNA and given her history of MRSA in her rt arm osteomyelitis.
After extubation she maintained good O2 sats and did not show evidence of respiratory distress.
2) Sepsis: Pt presented w/ fever to 101 in ED, then to ?hypothermia on presentation to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (initial temp 94.5, increased to 97.8 w/ rectal temp using different thermometer - also on bearhugger), WBC to 23.7 with bandemia, hypotension, ARF w/ decreased UOP.
Source likely asp pna, as mentioned above vs other source of infection including recurrent osteomylitis of R olecrenon (unlikely as pt has completed abx therapy) vs other source.
HTN has improved slightly since adding Captopril.
Previously bradycardic so we were cautious with increasing Metoprolol.
5) Anemia: Patient has had anemia in the past with Hct trending in the high 20's in recent months.
No evidence of active bleed.
Initially had non AG metabolic acidosis at admission (ABG 7.23/31/78, AG=10) likely [**2-4**] fluid rescusitation.
Now somewhat alkalemic, with elevated pCO2, likely from contraction alkalosis [**2-4**] diuresis.
8) Right olecranon osteomyelitis s/p treatment with vancomycin + imipenem for 10 day course-> bactrim.
Dry gauze dressing changes QD as pt has completed a course of anibiotics but with need to follow-up with infectious disease as previously arranged.
Chest CT does have tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance.
Considered rx if pt r/o for all other signs of infection and believed [**Male First Name (un) **] to be likely source of sepsis - thought unlikely due to chronice/stable nature.
12) Esophageal Dysmotility: stable.
Known problem by patient and is cause of her recurrent aspiration pna.
Issue of feeding tube addressed w/ pt in past and patient has refused enteral feeding which she has reiterated after this extubation.
She understands the risks of reaspiration and reintubation and is willing to assume those risks in order to eat orally.
Per caregiver, pt not eating well in recent weeks.
Patient was again counseled during her ICU stay as to the risks for future aspirations and the future need for intubation.
Zolpidem Tartrate 5 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for trouble sleeping.
Humibid LA 600mg PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration Pneumonia CHF   Discharge Condition: Stable on room air  Discharge Instructions: If you experience any increasing cough, fever, chills, shortness of breath, you should call your doctor but if no doctor is available you should go back to the emergency room.
Followup Instructions: You should follow-up with a primary care doctor within the next 1-2 weeks for post hospitalization follow-up.
