His hospital course was complicated by bleeding and hypotension along with atrial fibrillation.
Reason for MICU admission: The patient was initially transferred to the MICU for hypotension that was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia.
The patient had pulled his foley catheter and had profuse bleeding from the catheter site.
Cystoscopy showed improved hemostatsis and bladder irrigation was stopped.
CT of abdomen/pelvis did not show retroperitoneal bleeding.
Hypotension: The patient had persistent hypotension despite cessation of bleeding from foley site as well as no signs of hematoma in the OR.
Respiratory distress The patient had period of a apnea after returning from the OR and required reintubation.
He did not have signs of respiratory compromise and maintained his saturations.
Thrombocytopenia The patient was noted to have a dramatic platelet drop, concern for possible HIT, heparin was initially held and appropriate studies were ordered.
Right Hip fracture The patient was evaluated by orthopedics upon admission and taken to the OR on [**8-31**].
The operation was without complications but post-op had to be reintubated.
Per ortho, there was no hematoma at the surgical site while in the OR.
Pre-op  betablocker was started for risk reduction but was limited by hypotension as above.
HTN Initially pt's outpt lisinopril and catapres were held and a perioperative BB was given, but discontinued with hypotension.
Given his new onset atrial fibrillation, he was started on verapamil which was uptitrated to HR.
Atrial fibrillation On [**2137-9-5**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a HR to the 130s.
EKG revealed evidence of atrial fibrillation without any acute ST changes.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn which did not indicate an ischemic etiology for his atrial fibrillation.
The patient had a TTE which revealed mild left atrial enlargement and an EF greater than 60%.
The patient also had a V/Q scan to r/o PE given his recent hip fx and surgery which was negative.
