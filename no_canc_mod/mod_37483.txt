EXTREMITIES - WWP, chronic contractures of bilateral legs and R>L arms.

MODERATE GROWTH.
No acute intracranial process.
Interval slight decrease in thickness of a small right subdural collection, likely a resolving hematoma.
Chronic severe sinus disease.
Low lung volumes are noted, without definite focal consolidation.
There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema.
Minimal atelectasis in the lung bases is noted, but no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Remote proximal right humeral fracture is again demonstrated, and degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints are present.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta are again demonstrated, and a central venous catheter entering via an inferior approach and terminating in the right atrium is again unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, mild bibasilar atelectasis.
Left lung base consolidation increased from prior, which may represent aspiration or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
There is an adjacent small left pleural effusion of intermediate density.
Numerous bilateral hypodense renal lesions, compatible with acquired cystic disease.
Extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease without associated aneurysmal changes.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
[**5-14**] INITIAL EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] generalized periodic epileptic discharges representing electrographic seizures seen at the beginning of recording lasting about one hour.
The patient occasionally showed tonic posturing of the left arm with a few superimposed myoclonic jerks.
Within these limitations, there is no evidence of intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
The small right subdural collection seen on [**2117-5-11**] is not detected on today's exam.
Encephalomalacic changes are again seen in the left occipital/parietal and right parietal lobed as well as the right cerebellar hemisphere which are likely secondary to prior infarcts and appear unchanged from the most recent prior study.
A right thalamic lacunar infarct is also stable.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter interface is otherwise preserved without evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct.
Diffuse periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are consistent with the sequela of chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
Air-fluid levels are noted in the bilateral maxillary sinuses with partial opacification at the ethmoid air cells bilaterally.
Mucous retention cysts are seen in the bilateral sphenoid sinuses.
The middle ear cavities and left mastoid air cells remain clear.
No acute intracranial process.
The small right subdural collection seen on [**2117-5-11**] is not detected on today's exam.
Stable encephalomalacia without evidence of acute infarction.
There is a thin subdural collection layering over the right frontovertex convexity, measuring no more than 5 mm in maximal thickness, difficult to identify on the recent examinations.
There is no focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic event and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids are preserved.
Again demonstrated is global atrophy with significantly disproportionate ventriculomegaly; although not significantly changed, this raises the possibility of underlying communicating hydrocephalus, as before.
Also again demonstrated is evidence of moderately severe sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, as well as focal encephalomalacia in the left parieto-occipital and right parietal lobes, as well as the right cerebellar hemisphere, likely related to remote infarction.
There is acute-on-chronic inflammatory disease in the maxillary sinuses and anterior ethmoidal and frontal air cells, as on the previous MR study; extensive fluid-opacification of the right mastoid air cells is significantly worse.
No finding to suggest acute infarction or hemorrhage.
Global atrophy with disproportionate ventriculomegaly; underlying communicating hydrocephalus remains a concern, and should be correlated clinically.
Equivocal thin subdural collection layering over the right frontovertex convexity, measuring no more than 5 mm in maximal thickness, with no significant mass effect.
Acute-on-chronic sinus inflammatory disease and fluid opacification of the right mastoid air cells, which also should be correlated clinically.
COMMENT: A preliminary interpretation of "No diffusion abnormality to suggest new infarct.
No new hemorrhage.
No change in tiny right subdural collection."
There is moderate left lower lobe volume loss, unchanged compared to the study from the prior day.
Old right humeral displaced fracture is again visualized.
There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis.
There is moderate left lower lobe volume loss, unchanged compared to the study from the prior day.
Old right humeral displaced fracture is again visualized.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Hypodense areas as described above in the left occipital lobe and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, partly seen on the prior study.
Moderate dilation of the lateral and the third ventricles, ?
volume loss/NPH/narrowing at the superior portion of aqueduct.
No significant change in the bifrontal diameter at the level of foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**], compared to the recent study.
Within the limits of this non-contrast examination, there is no evidence of bowel wall thickening to suggest ischemia.
No acute intra-abdominal process.
Stable left lung base consolidation and small left pleural effusion.
[**5-24**] EEG: PENDING  Brief Hospital Course: 83F with complicated medical history of subdural hematoma and intracranial hemorrhage in [**2114**] now bedbound, ESRD, multiple serious infections including endocarditis and osteomyeltis, now admitted with fever, found to have LLL infiltrate and to be in status epilepticus.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM  # Cardiac Arrest - On the morning of [**5-25**], the patient had a bradycardia arrest that progress to PEA arrest that subsequently devolved to a V fib / VT arrest.
It was unclear what was the cause of her arrest - based on the available clinical data, she appeared to have suffered a primary cardiac arrest without an obvious underlying precipitant.
In addition, post-arrest, the patient had no evidence of any meaninful neurologic function, with minimal brainstem reflexes (no cough, gag, corneal reflexes or pupillary reflexes, although she did still over-breath the ventilator.)
In conjunction with the family's wishes (specifically, the patient's sister and HCP [**Doctor First Name 5464**], was decided that CPR would not be indicated in this patient given her steady drop in BP while on max dose pressors.
# Status epilepticus  At baseline, HCP reports she is very minimally verbal (few words at a time), posture rigid and contracted, bedbound - all since stroke in [**2114**].
No stereotypic movements.
By the morning of HD 6, EEG no longer showed status or seizures but continued to demonstrate epileptiform spikes.
ICU team and neuro teams both felt intubation would likely be irreversible in this pt w/poor underlying mental status and multiple severe comorbidities.
After intubation, her EEG improved, no longer showing epileptiform activity and her AEDs were able to be weaned with discontinuation of fosphenytoin and benzodiazepines and then valproic acid.
# HCAP On admission, pt c/o fever & cough x 3 weeks.
Found to have LLL infiltrate vs atelectasis on chest xray, also seen on lung cuts of CT A/P.
Cefepime added back when pt started spiking fevers in the ICU and wet productive-sounding cough evolved.
If there is decompensation, tigecycline could be added.
Given the patient's mental status, it was felt she would not be extubated readily so a trachestomy was peformed by Interventional Pulmonology.
She had some post-op bleeding that was controlled with silver nitrate.
Repeat CT abd/pelvis on [**5-23**] in setting of worsening leukocytosis despite therapeutic-dosing gentamycin showed stable (not improved) L lung base consolidation).
# TUBEFEEDS - HIGH RESIDUALS The patient was noted to have high residuals from her tube feeds as well as occasional vomiting.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS Pt noted to have acutely-worsening leukocytosis on [**5-23**].
These showed only stable L lung base consolidation - known Klebsiella pneumonia already being treated w/gentamycin.
Pt did continue to have liquid bilious stools despite several days PO vanco, so dose was increased to 500 q6H.
#GAP ACIDOSIS Pt acutely developed a gap acidosis (AG 26) on [**5-23**].
Serum acetone pending.
CHRONIC, INACTIVE ISSUES  # ESRD Continued [**Month/Day (4) 2286**] per T, Th, Sa regimen.
HD proceeded without complication thereafter.
# HTN Pt was persistently hypertensive, w/SBPs ranging 150s-170s.
# GERD Continued omeprazole.
