Admission Date:  [**2170-5-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2144-1-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-6-10**]       Sex:  M  Service:  VASCULAR SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old male who has a history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease, as well as alcohol.
He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with bilateral claudication and underwent a right SFA angioplasty and a left femoral popliteal.
He returned to the hospital on [**5-19**] with a left groin wound dehiscence and bleed after days of an unsteady gait.
The wound was explored at [**Hospital1 1474**] and a Prolene stitch was placed and the wound was closed over the graft.
The patient had a myocardial infarction at the outside hospital and was ruling in for a myocardial infarction and at this point was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Cardiology Service for further care of his coronary artery disease.

History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1.
Left femoral popliteal, probably an above the knee popliteal, on [**2170-3-28**]  EXAM: VITAL SIGNS:  He was afebrile with stable vital signs when vascular surgery was consulted.
GENERAL:  He is an elderly man, short of breath in supine position.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  Left groin - there was a 4 inch x 1.5 inch open wound with serous drainage without the graft obviously exposed.
Myocardial infarction management per cardiology and antibiotics to continue from the outside hospital which included Tequin and vancomycin given his history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient did relatively well overnight and was given diuresis by the cardiology service as well as afterload reduction with an ACE inhibitor.
On the night of [**5-28**], approximately 11:30 a.m., vascular surgery was called emergently for diffuse arterial bleeding from the patient's open left groin wound.
He had slightly decreased T-waves in the lateral leads and his left foot was warm.
At this time, in the Operating Room, the patient underwent a removal of the femoral portion of the femoral popliteal graft, debridement of the femoral artery and vein patch angioplasty, rotational sartorius myoplasty and retroperitoneal exposure of the iliac artery for proximal control.
The patient tolerated this relatively well and the following day, the patient's foot appeared relatively ischemic and the patient was taken back to the Operating Room.
At this time, he underwent a left profunda femoris artery to anterior tibial artery bypass using non reverse right saphenous vein as well as the profunda femoris endarterectomy and profundoplasty, a left lower leg fasciotomy, ligation of the popliteal artery, intraoperative angiogram performance, [**Doctor Last Name **] catheter, thromboembolectomy and vein patch angioplasty repair of the proximal graft.
He was hemodynamically stable on no pressors with a blood pressure of 109/47.
He received 4 units of blood during the operation, 5 liters of intravenous fluids with an estimated blood loss of 1500.
At this time, he had a palpable graft pulse, but no dopplerable distal pedal pulses and his foot was mottled.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
He continued to rule out for myocardial infarction and was started on intravenous beta blockade, as well as aspirin.
On postoperative day 2, he was started on some dopamine for low blood pressures.
He continued to rule out for a myocardial infarction whose chest x-ray showed left lower lobe collapse, for which he underwent a bronchoscopy which greatly improved his saturations and his respiratory rate.
His wound graft grew Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive Staphylococcus.
His left foot continued to be cool and mild to above the ankle with a palpable graft pulse.
His foot continued to be ischemic and we followed this very closely.
At this point, his foot started to become necrotic to above the ankle with skin sloughing medially.
At this time, sputum and wound grew out yeast and he was started on fluconazole in addition to his vancomycin.
His leg continued to deteriorate slightly, so at this time, on [**5-6**] he was taken to the Operating Room for a wound debridement of his groin and mid wound and partial closure and packing, as well as a left guillotine amputation by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient tolerated the procedure without any complications and returned to the Intensive Care Unit.
By postoperative day 9 and 2, he had some increasing temperatures, spiked a fever to 102.9??????.
Again, all of his wounds grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and yeast.
Additional coverage was added by the infectious disease service, as well as line changes were done.
Because of his increasing white count and fevers and complaints of some abdominal pain, general surgery was consulted to rule out cholecystitis.
The patient improved and it was felt that the patient did not have a calculous cholecystitis.
By postoperative day 12, he had some right arm swelling and an ultrasound was done which showed no deep venous thrombosis.
His abdominal pain resolved.
He had an abdominal CT that just showed sludge in the gallbladder, bilateral effusions and atelectasis with a small rectus sheath hematoma.
At this time, he spiked a fever postoperatively which was felt to be due to atelectasis and removal of necrotic tissue during the operation.
Again, he ruled out for a myocardial infarction and by postoperative day 17, a set if mechanics were checked.
Then, on postoperative day 18 the patient was extubated, as he met all criteria and did well for 9 to 10 hours and became hypertensive and tachycardic with poor saturation and increased respiratory rate requiring reintubation.
Again, he ruled out for myocardial infarction.
The patient tolerated this well and has continued to improve and have no further problems.
He is on trach mask 40% with oxygenation and PO2 in the range of 190, getting gentle diuresis each day, tolerating 70 of Impact with fiber tube feeds through his PEG.
He needs normal saline wet to dry dressings on his left groin and mid thigh wound [**Hospital1 **] with dry dressing on his left stump without any stump shrinking apparatus, just a dry dressing with an Ace wrap to the stump.
