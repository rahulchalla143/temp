New right upper lobe well-defined homogenous opacity is most likely an abscess, although a necrotic soft tissue tumor is also in the differential.
Recommend 3-4 weeks of antibiotic treatment and follow up with chest x-ray to assess any change in size of this nodule and possible biopsy or PET scan at that stage if the mass remains unchanged.
Right lower and middle lobe collapse with persistent minor atelectasis with a smaller right pleural effusion.
Slight increase in the central lymph nodes as described athough these are not pathological by CT size criteria.

Your pneumonia worsened and we had to give you stronger antibiotics.
It will need to be restarted at 81 mg after her small bowel study.
You will need a repeat chest xray as there is a possible nodule on your chest xray - in 1 week, and probably a chest CT .
