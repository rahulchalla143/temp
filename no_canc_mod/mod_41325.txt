This pain worsened yesterday and today.
Pt reports that the pain is worse with greasy foods.
Pt also reports black stools.
He was seen at the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 392**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern for sepsis and hypotension to 87/?.
Per report, pt had ultrasound at outside hospital that showed "intrahepatic stones, cholangitis and need for ERCP".
Past Medical History: h/o gallstones/cholangitis requiring removal with ERCP in [**Country 651**]  Social History: Lives in [**Country 651**] with his wife.

no significant tenderness to palp.
Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
Multiple strictured, dilated and ectatic areas were noted in the intrahepatic ducts.
Multiple filling defects consistent with stones were seen in the intrahepatic ducts.
Findings suggestive of oriental cholangiohepatitis One to two small filling defects were seen in the common bile duct.
Irregular regions of extensive biliary ductal dilatation/ectasia and stricturing involving the intrahepatic biliary system associated with multiple stones within the dilated intrahepatic biliary tree together with dilated common bile duct is most suggestive of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis.
Confluent region of abnormal hepatic parenchymal enhancement involving segment VIII of the liver without evidence of liquefaction suggestive of phlegmonous changes, likely from adjacent biliary infectious process given enhancement of regional biliary wall.
No obvious abscess at this time, though the adjacent regional dilated bile ducts may not have been decompressed by the biliary stent.
Brief Hospital Course: 52yo Chinese male with hx of gallstones/cholangitis presents with biliary sepsis.
# Biliary obstruction with sepsis, with underlying diagnosis of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis.
Met SIRS criteria and was admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic resiscutation.
Underwent ERCP with findings indicating recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (aka Oriental cholangiohepatitis).
MRCP the following day confirmed diagnosis of Oriental cholangiohepatitis with hepatobiliary infection, without clear abscess.
Hepatobiliary surgery team was involved, and felt pt was not a surgical candidate given bilateral liver lobe involvement.
# Hep panel: History of Hep B and A. Hep A IgM was negative so no recent infection.
Patient is Hep C negative (antibody and viral load both negative).
Pt had no clinical evidence of bleeding.
Low iron, low TIBC and high ferritin suggest anemia of chronic disease.
[ ] repeat ERCP in 4 wks and repeat hepatobiliary imaging [ ] recommend cancer surveillance (CA19-9, CEA, AFP) given secondary sclerosing cholangitis [ ] repeat INR to ensure normalizing [ ] pending micro data includes blood cultures and Hep B viral load  Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Medications: 1.
