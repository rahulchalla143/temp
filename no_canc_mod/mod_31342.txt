Grand-daughter states that four days prior to admission, Ms. [**Known lastname **] became confused and slow to answer.
She may have had a right facial droop this morning, but she was slouched to her right side in bed and the grand daughter was not sure.
A CXR showed left base opacity c/f atelectasis (cannot rule out infiltrate).
CT head showed small hyperdensity in left thalamus c/w hemorrhage/cavernoma/cancer.
Neurosurgical c/s revealed no surgical interventions.
OSH record review shows CXR [**2105-1-15**] showing no acute pathology, EKG with SR 79 w/ nonspecific st/t changes.

Discharge Labs : expired  Brief Hospital Course:  84F h/o COPD, DM-2, HTN, CVA (details unknown), hyperlipidemia, CAD, depression, CHF, PVD presents with altered mental status and fever from [**Hospital3 537**] nursing home.
# toxic metabolic encephalopathy:  The patient's altered mental status was attributed to toxic-metabolic encephaolpathy in the setting of sepsis, although additional concerns included new stroke, bacterial or viral meningitis, or hypercarbia.
A CT head was done showing a hyperattenuating focus involving the left thalamus, that could represent parenchymal hemorrahage vs. neoplam.
There was also evidence of small vessel ischemic diease and multiple remote infarctions.
# Dyspnea/respiratory status: The patient has a history of COPD with 100 pack year history; possible that this is related to COPD exacerbation; other differentials include pneumonia versus CHF exacerbation.
CXR with evidence of possible L basilar infiltrate versus atelectasis.
# Fevers: The etiology of the patient's fevers has broad differential, including pneumonia, UTI, or meningitis.
# Hyperattenuating lesion in L thalamus: Possibly hemorrhagic stroke versus neoplasm.
Possible that this lesion could have explained the patient's acute change in altered mental status, as well.
# COPD:  The patient had oxygen requirement during this hospitalization, which could have represented COPD excacerbation versus underlying pneumonia.
Chronic Issues: # HTN/hyperlipidemia:  The patient was initially continued on her home anti-hypertensives and hyperlipidemia medications.
