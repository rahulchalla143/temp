is a 75 year-old female with a history of COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus and colonic adenocarcinoma who presented from [**Hospital **] Rehab with shortness of breath and chest pain.
developed chest pain which radiated to her left arm and desaturated to the low 80's early the morning of admission while being changed.
An EKG was performed at the time which was significant for 3mm up-sloping ST elevations in V1-V3.
She also had a cough productive of yellowish sputum.
Apparently she had a chest Xray at the time which was suggestive of pneumonia and she was started on levofloxacin.
reported that the chest pain had resolved without intervention.
An EKG was performed which showed atrial fibrillation, ST elevations in V1-V3, TWI in V5 and V6 and LBBB.
Her chest Xray was remarkable for pulmonary edema.
She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress.
complained only of some difficulty breathing.
She stated that the reason she came to the hospital was for a "panic attack."
Past Medical History: -atrial fibrillation -type 2 diabetes mellitus -colon cancer, h/o colonic perforation, s/p hemicolectomy [**9-15**] -COPD, baseline SaO2 is 92-95% on 2-3L O2 via NC -pulmonary fibrosis -HTN -mitral regurgitation - CHF  Social History: Pt.
Physical Exam: T: 97.8F P: 109 R: 30 BP: 137/88 SaO2: 95% on 2L NC and 95% face tent General: awake, alert, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, no lesions in OP Neck: supple, no JVD appreciated Pulmonary: fine bibasilar rales about 1/2 up lung fields Cardiac: tachycardic, irregularly irregular rhythm, II/VI SEM at LSB to apex Abdomen: well-healed surgical scar, soft, NT/ND, active bowel sounds, no masses Extremities: no c/c/e bilaterally, warm to touch, 2+DP and PT pulses bilaterally Neurologic: alert and oriented x 3, but was confused at times and unable to clearly articulate her history.
Skin: no rashes or lesions.
The cause was felt to be multifactorial and secondary to underlying pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, CHF and pneumonia.
Initially, she was thought to be in heart failure and was diuresed with some improvement in her hypoxia on the first hospital day.
A TTE was performed which revealed preserved global biventricular systolic function, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension., moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and mild aortic regurgitation.
was aspirating, metronidazole was added for anaerobic coverage.
She deteriorated clinically over the course of the first three hospital days, however, with increasing oxygen demands.
On the fourth hospital day, IV steroids were begun in attempt to treat her underlying pulmonary fibrosis.
This led to a marked improvement in her clinical status as her respiratory distress was ameliorated.
was noted to have a low hematocrit on admission.
Workup revealed studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
had well-contolled glucose levels on a sliding scale of regular insulin until IV steroids were begun at which time she required an insulin drip to maintain adequate serum glucose levels.
had a speech and swallow evaluation on the second hospital day which showed evidence of aspiration.
Atrial fibrillation: On presentation the pt.
was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Zolpidem Tartrate 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
