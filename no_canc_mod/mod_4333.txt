Admission Date:  [**2140-11-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2140-11-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-7-25**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Joint pain; malaise; nausea and vomiting.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient, [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 22484**], is a 50-year-old man, with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, status post renal transplant times two.
He presented with three days of malaise, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever, diarrhea, as well as the complaint of hand pain over the MCP joint.
By report of the patient's sister, the patient was in his usual state of health two days' prior to admission, living at an [**Hospital3 12272**] facility, managing his own medications and insulin dosing, when he developed malaise, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fevers, diarrhea, as well as increasing bilateral hand pain over the MCP joint.
The patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.
In the emergency department, he was found to be somnolent with slurred speech and disoriented.
Labs were notable for a glucose of 646, positive serum ketones and a creatinine of 2.2.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for 30 years, complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, and end-stage renal disease.
History of right index finger osteomyelitis.
Chronic lower back pain.
Orthostatic hypotension.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN.
The patient had 2+ carotids with no bruit.
There was evidence of lymphadenopathy.
LUNGS:  On examination the patient gave a poor effort, but faint crackles were heard at the right base with no wheezes appreciated.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no extra heart sounds audible.
EXTREMITIES:  Examination revealed 3+ pitting edema bilaterally.
The patient has an A-V fistula in the right arm.
The patient had erythema and tenderness, as well as swelling and warmth over his MCP joints bilaterally.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Examination revealed no focal signs.
Urinalysis revealed the glucose of 500, no red cells, and no white cells.
The patient's blood was positive for acetone.
Chest x-ray:  Portable chest x-ray was done and revealed poor inspiration, but no active cardiopulmonary process.
The EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per minute, axis -30, normal intervals, small Qs in V1 and V2 consistent with an old anteroseptal infarct, no significant change from a previous [**2139-11-27**] EKG.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, status post renal transplant times two, who present with hyperglycemia volume depletion, metabolic acidosis, with positive serum ketones secondary to likely diabetic ketoacidosis.
The patient was also febrile with elevated white blood cell count and tender MCP joints suggesting the diagnosis of cellulitis versus gout.
The patient's blood sugars remained elevated in the 300s, likely secondary to the fact that he was receiving steroids.
RENAL:  The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease, status post renal transplant times two, with an elevated creatinine likely secondary to volume depletion from diabetic ketoacidosis.
The differential included gout exacerbation versus septic arthritis.
for treatment of suspected septic arthritis.
The patient's joints were tapped by the Department of Rheumatology and did not reveal positive cultures.
The patient was also started on Prednisone for management of his gouty exacerbation.
Symptoms improved rapidly and he noted decreased pain and increased mobility of his hands.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient initially presented with elevated troponin in the setting of negative creatinine kinases, suggesting possible demand ischemia related to the patient's diabetic ketoacidosis and volume depletion.
Also, the troponin may have been elevated secondary to acute renal failure.
He eventually ruled out for myocardial infarction.
However, the fact that the patient did have some evidence of myocardial leak, suggested that he may need an outpatient stress perfusion test in the future to evaluate for ischemia.
GI:  The patient developed loose, watery stools, while in the Intensive Care Unit, and then upon arrival to the floor.
C. difficile toxins were sent, as well as stool for culture and fecal leukocytes.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Acute renal failure.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
End-stage renal disease, status post renal transplant times two.
