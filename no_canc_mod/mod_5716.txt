Admission Date:  [**2183-8-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2183-8-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-6-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old male resident of the [**Hospital3 6560**] Home who was transferred to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 1760**] for evaluation of possible aspiration pneumonia.
Triage note from the emergency room mentions a possible apneic episode.
Laboratory studies drawn in the emergency room showed a blood glucose level in the 700s, serum sodium 167, and a highly concentrated urine with specific gravity of 1.036.
Multiple urinary tract infections, including infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus.
He has a chronic suprapubic catheter.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
GENERAL:  The patient was nonverbal, thin, and in no acute distress.
NECK:  His neck was stiff with no lymphadenopathy.
HEART:  Rate was slightly tachycardic and the rhythm was regular; no murmur, rub, or gallop appreciated.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with decreased bowel sounds.
He had a large sacral decubitus ulcer extending down to the coccyx.
EXTREMITIES:  He did not move any of his four extremities.
There was no peripheral edema.
WBC 14.6 with 89 neutrophils and no bands.
His urinalysis revealed slightly hazy urine with a specific gravity of 1.036.
The urine was nitrite negative, ketone negative, with 14 red blood cells and six white blood cells, and moderate bacteria.
Chest x-ray showed patchy air space disease in the left lower lung zone, consistent with a possible aspiration pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for management of his hypernatremia and hyperglycemia.
His fever and elevated white blood cell count were thought to be secondary to either a urinary tract infection or an aspiration pneumonia.
He was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for coverage of his possible pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
His oxygenation improved with supplemental oxygen and he had copious white sputum production.
Because of this, it was assumed that his infection was due to an aspiration pneumonia.
Urine cultures grew Pseudomonas and Enterococcus.
His hypotension and acute renal insufficiency were thought to be secondary to massive intravascular volume depletion, which in turn was thought secondary to decreased p.o.
The hypotension and acute renal insufficiency resolved with intravenous fluid administration.
Hyperglycemia of unknown etiology.
Acute renal failure secondary to intravascular volume depletion.
Hypotension secondary to intravascular volume depletion.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
