Several intubations for respiratory failure 2.
[**2116-6-5**] laparoscopic reduction of hiatal hernia, repair of diaphragmatic defect with pledgeted sutures, pexy of stomach to diaphragm, and laparoscopic liver biopsy   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 85535**] is a 52 year old female with a history of mental retardation and migraine headaches who is transfered from [**Hospital 792**]Hospital for further management of hepatitis.
She originally presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2116-4-28**] with an increase in the frequency of falls and confusion.
Her sister and [**Name2 (NI) 802**] noted subtle changes in her behavior as far back as [**2115-10-13**] that became increasingly pronounced over the following months, viral hepatitis work-up was reportedly negative.
At [**Hospital **] Hospital, the patient had a prolonged and complicated course with extensive evaluation of her elevated LFTs.
She was noted to have hyperammonemia and was treated with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy with some improvement in mental status.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin was elevated at 385.
She underwent a liver biopsy on [**2116-4-5**] that showed "ongoing severe liver injury with extensive hepatocyte damage and resulting collapse.
She underwent endoscopy that demonstrated a 10 cm hiatal hernia and gastric volvulus with edema and erythema of the stomach and an erosion at the GE junction.
Colonoscopy showed grade IV internal hemorrhoids and 2 colonic ulcerations that were ischemic in nature and a 2 mm polyp that was resected.
She was transferred, at the request of her family, to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-5-21**] for further evaluation as they were still seeking a diagnosis for her illness.
While on the medicine service, her hospital course was complicated by ongoing aspiration events felt to be a result of her large hiatal hernia and esophageal dysmotility.
On [**2116-5-28**], she was intubated and transferred to the MICU for increasing dyspnea and acute respiratory failure.
On [**2116-6-5**], the patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery service and underwent laparascopic hiatal hernia reduction with percutaneous liver biospy.
Past Medical History: - mental retardation of unknown etiology (some work-up at [**Hospital **] Hosp of [**Location (un) 86**] that was of unclear consequence) - history of migraine headaches that are associated with nausea and vomiting and can be debilitating.
- history of self-mutilization characterized by picking at skin.
- s/p right inner ear surgery x 2 with implant, [**2112**] and [**2107**] - ATN, AIN at [**Hospital **] hospital [**4-/2116**]  Recent medical history during this hospitalization: - Recurrent aspiration pneumonia ([**5-28**] - 18 intubated for ARDS) - hiatal hernia s/p repair - gastric volvulus s/p repair - Right upper extremity phlebitis/cellulitis associated with PICC - NASH with Grade III-IV fibrosis - ARDS and intubation post operatively [**Date range (1) 85536**]/10 - ATN, CVVH with oliguric renal failure (Cr peaked at 3.5) - Coagulase negative staphylococcal bacteremia ([**6-16**]) - Persistent Leukocytosis of unclear etiology - Elevated alpha 1 antitrypsin  Social History: She lives with her sister [**Name (NI) 17**], her [**Name (NI) 802**], and a Burmese mountain dog.
She used to work at a daycare program where she did manual labor but then was switched to a group that manages dementia patients as it was thought she might be developing dementia.
She has had diminished ability to perform her ADLs over the past few months.
She has never smoked, no alcohol, and no drug use.
Family History: - mother: breast CA at 76 - father: colorectal CA in his 60s, MI - 4 siblings: diabetes, hypertension, migraine headaches, vertigo/Meniere's disease  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 99.1, BP 149/89, HR 80, RR 20, O2 sat 96% RA General: Morbidly obese, middle-aged, Caucasian female in NAD, voice is difficult to understand HEENT: dysmorphic facies, atraumatic, sclera anicteric, disconjugate gaze, unable to completely assess EOM d/t non-cooperation with exam, OP clear, MMM Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly Heart: RRR, normal s1 and s2, no murmurs Lungs: CTA anteriorly, laterally, and superiorly in the back.
Abdomen: +BS, soft, obese, mild RUQ tenderness without rebound or guarding Extremities: 3+ edema in feet and ankles bilaterally.
Severe esophageal dysmotility and reflux.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
Advanced fibrosis (stage 3-4) with extensive bridging, multifocal incomplete nodule formation (with a rare focus suggestive of complete nodule formation) and a prominent sinusoidal component.
Moderate lobular neutrophilic inflammation and mild portal mixed inflammation (score 2).
Foci of hepatocyte ballooning degeneration with associated intracytoplasmic hyalin (score 2).
Minimal steatosis (involving <5% of the core biopsy; score 0)  2D ECHO ([**2116-6-1**]): Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
No evidence of biliary obstruction.
Small amount of perihepatic ascites.
Significant dependent body wall edema indicative of "third-spacing".
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Slightly coarsened and echogenic liver compatible with the history of autoimmune hepatitis.
No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Improved aeration of lung parenchyma, with persistent predominantly basal consolidations and perihilar ground-glass opacities.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Diffuse body wall edema with mild abdominal and pelvic ascites without focal fluid collection.
Persistent geographic area of hypoattenuation involving the medial aspect of segment II and III of the liver of uncertain etiology.
Edema or infarcts could be considered.
Left PICC ends in the left brachiocephalic vein.
Thickening of the distal colon, involving the sigmoid and through the upper rectum, even allowing for underdistension.
Differential considerations include colitis in the appropriate setting or sequelae of portal congestion.
Since the upstream colon is mildly prominent, the fact that the distal is mild to moderately narrowed may be causing slight obstruction, although contrast passes entirely through the area.
No focal liver lesion and no biliary dilatation seen.
Minimal ascites.
No evidence of abscess.
Moderate amount of ascites, which has increased since the previous study.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, which have decreased in size since the previous study.
Adjacent bibasilar atelectasis in addition to diffuse ground-glass and patchy opacities at the bases have improved.
Small areas of hypoenhancement within segment II and III of the liver with slight decrease in size of these segments likely reflects evolving infarct and subsequent scarring corresponding with the area of hypodensity noted on the previous noncontrast CT studies.
Possible bowel wall thickening of the cecum, new since the previous study.
Previously described thickening of the distal colon is not seen on today's study and may have been due to underdistension on the previous study.
MR HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST ([**2116-6-28**]): Non-specific, nonenhancing focus of high signal on FLAIR and T2 weighted images in the left parietal lobe.
The differential considerations are demyleination, vasculitis or sequlae of small vessel disease.
MICROBIOLOGY: [**5-27**] HD catheter - Coag neg staph [**6-26**] HD catheter - Coag neg staph [**6-28**] Blood cultures - VRE Multiple sputum and urine cultures showing undifferentiated yeast.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPICE CARE: Ms. [**Known lastname 85535**] was initially admitted to the hospital from [**State 792**]after being diagnosed with hepatitis that was found to be end stage liver disease (cirrhosis) from NASH.
Briefly, her hospitalization course was complicated by intubation for aspiration pneumonia with subsequent respiratory arrest.
She also underwent a hiatal hernia repair to help decrease the risk of aspiration, she was in the ICU for transient shock liver and renal dysfunction.
She also developed VRE sepsis and was finally extubated several prior to her transition to the floor.
Unfortunately her course continued to deteriorate, she was noted to again be in respiratory distress likely a combination of aspiration from secretions and a hypervolemic state.
- please continue with 5-10mg PO Morpine every 4 hours as needed for comfort, this may need to be increased pending her discomfort - please continue with 1mg Ativan PO every 4 hours for anxiety - please continue with 3 Scopolamine patches to the neck to decrease secretions - please continue with Bisacodyl 10mg PR as needed if the pt does not have a bowel movement for several days and seems uncomfortable from constipation - please continue with Acetaminophen PR as needed for any fevers  PRIOR TO TRANSFER TO THORACIC SURGERY SERVICE/MICU:  # Elevated liver enzymes: liver biopsy pathology slides were obtained from [**Hospital **] Hospital and reviewed by [**Hospital1 18**] pathology.
Pathology was consistent with stage 3-4 fibrosis thought to be secondary to NASH.
# Dysphagia, hoarse voice: barium study evaluation revealed a large hiatal hernia, and OSH upper endoscopy showed possible gastric volvulus.
# Respiratory distress, aspiration pneumonia: a respiratory code was called when patient became increasingly dyspneic and hypoxic to 85% on the non-rebreather on [**5-28**].
# Coag negative staph bacteremia: On [**5-29**] bottle grew GPCs which turned out to be coag negative staph.
# Nutrition: After above mentioned aspiration event, patient was made NPO.
Initial speech and swallow found esophageal dismotility on barium swallow, without coughing and patient was placed on diet of thin liquids and pureed solids.
# Cellulitis: she presented to the hospital from [**Hospital **] Hospital with a right arm cellulitis at the site of her previous PICC.
There were no further issues.
FROM TRANSFER TO THORACIC SURGERY SERVICE/SICU ([**2116-6-5**]):  KEY EVENTS: [**6-6**]: Hepatology rec likely volume down, supportive care.
Renal US no source.
[**6-7**]: Placement of R subclavian CVL, started levo for sbp support, adequate UO, one dose of lasix 20 mg IV in am, improved liver function, rising creatinine [**6-9**]: continues with minimal UOP.
Sputum gram stain no organisms.
[**6-14**]: Paracentesis done, 1.5 L of transudative fluid removed.
Increasing stools overnight, c. diff sent.
Patient did well for ~45 minutes, then became tachypnic with desaturation.
NO extubation.
[**6-16**]: HD was cancelled [**1-14**] fever, HD planned for [**6-17**], may not need renal recs albumin and lasix in interim; we gave lasix 40 mg once with adequate response, hepatology - f/u LFTs, no acute events, afebrile > 24 hours, d/c'ed RIJ HD line.
[**6-17**]: Vancomycin started for coag neg staph on RIGHT IJ HD catheter.
Received lasix with good output, however, afternoon lytes with hypernatremia (147).
[**6-22**]: repeat swallow study was performed demonstrating poor interest in intake, no aspiration or mechanical issue with deglutition.
FROM TRANSFER TO MICU ON [**6-26**]:  # Respiratory failure: Pt was transferred to the MICU on [**6-26**] for hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.
Multiple sputum cultures and a mini-BAL were negative except for undifferentiated yeast.
Her respiratory failure was multifactorial, with contributions from her deconditioning after a long hospital stay, increased intraabdominal pressure from ileus and ascites, a component of ARDS during her immediate post-op period, and significant fluid overload from aggressive rehydration.
# Fevers and persistent leukocytosis: Patient had multiple infectious workups including repeat negative blood/sputum/urine/catheter tip cultures, negative CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, negative CT neck, cardiac echo negative for vegetations.
# Renal failure: Patient's creatinine was 1.2 upon admission to the MICU and improved without intervention.
# Constipation/ileus/abdominal distension: Patient had difficulty with high residuals and persistent fevers seemingly associated with tube feeds.
She had intermittent increased abdominal distension which was evaluated on multiple abdominal KUBs, ultrasounds, CT scans which did not show acute abdominal processes.
Diagnostic paracenteses x2 did not demonstrate SBP and ascites did not increase drastically during her MICU stay.
Thought likely due to ileus and the distension improved with tpn (tube feeds held,) and erythromycin.
# AMS: Presumably hepatic encephalopathy was the cause of altered MS that led to pt's initial presentation to OSH in mid [**Month (only) 116**], when pt was found to have elevated LFTs for the first time.
[**Name2 (NI) **] had repeat negative head CTs and an MRI negative for acute abnormalities.
Fe studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Had one episode of blood in ETT but no overt signs of significant hemorrhage.
# Liver fibrosis/NASH: Transaminitis relatively stable during MICU course, [**Name (NI) 3539**] actually improved while in the MICU.
She was continued on ursodiol and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.
She was initially receiving lactulose, but this was discontinued due to high residuals in her tube feeds and concern for worsening abdominal distension.
Patient most likely had Vit K deficiency from chronic antibiotics, NPO status, and malabsorption/ileus.
