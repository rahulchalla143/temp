[**Hospital 37544**] medical condition notable for chronic hypertension treated with labetalol.
This pregnancy was complicated by superimposed severe pregnancy-induced hypertension with blood pressures of 215/130 mm Hg.
The hypertension persisted, and the mother was taken to elective cesarean section under general anesthesia.
General:  Very pre-term male, active, no obvious dysmorphisms.
Chest:  Positive sternal and intercostal retractions, coarse tight breath sounds.
Abdomen: Soft, three vessel cord, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Musculoskeletal:  No hip click, no sacral dimple.
Neurological:  Active, with reflexes and tone consistent with gestational age.
On day of life number ten, he had a deterioration of his respiratory status and was changed to the high-frequency oscillatory ventilator.
His most recent settings are a mean airway pressure of 13, a delta P of 22, Hertz of 15, oxygen requirement 60-80%.
[**Known lastname **] has also been treated with Combivent metered dose inhalers, and he has also been started on Diuril to treat his chronic lung disease.
Cardiovascular:  [**Known lastname **] had profound hypotension in the first two weeks of life.
On day of life number two, he received three empiric doses of hydrocortisone to rule out adrenal insufficiency.
The hydrocortisone was repeated again on day of life number seven due to his refractory hypotension and need for dopamine of 25 mcg/kg/minute.
The first, on [**2107-2-24**], showed no patent ductus arteriosus.
A repeat on [**2107-2-28**] also showed no patent ductus arteriosus.
On [**2107-3-10**], with deterioration in his respiratory status, another echocardiogram was obtained, and this showed a significant patent ductus arteriosus.
He was treated with three doses of Indocin, and a follow-up echocardiogram on [**2107-3-15**] showed a small patent ductus arteriosus.
Again with deterioration in his respiratory status, he received an echocardiogram on [**2107-3-21**], which showed a moderate patent ductus arteriosus with continuous left-to-right shunt and a 20 mm Hg gradient.
Also noted that septal position of the right ventricular pressure was felt to be less than half systemic.
Also noted was a mildly dilated left ventricle with good systolic function.
His fluids at the time of transfer are total parenteral nutrition solution 9% glucose, 2.5% protein, with electrolytes, 3 mEq of sodium per 100 cc and 2 mEq of potassium per 100 cc, minimal acetate, maximum chloride.
Infectious Disease:  [**Known lastname **] was evaluated for sepsis at the time of birth, and treated empirically.
His blood culture remained no growth at 24 hours, and his antibiotics were discontinued.
Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname **] required treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
He receives fentanyl as needed for sedation.
Sensory:  [**Known lastname **] has not had his hearing screen.
He has also not had any ophthalmologic examinations thus far.
State newborn screens have been sent several times since birth, with no notification of abnormal results to date.
Respiratory distress syndrome 3.
Suspicion for sepsis ruled out 5.
Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia 6.
