Admission Date:  [**2130-3-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-3-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-7-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: slurred speech, vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy, PEG placement  History of Present Illness: 80 yo M with PMH of htpertension and dyslipidemia who was last seen well by his wife at 6:30 this morning when he left with the dog for a walk and to buy the newspaper.
About one hour later she heard the knob moving several times without success to open the door from outside.
She called 911 and he was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where he was found to have slurred speech, left facial droop and left hemiparesis.
Head CT showed old R frontal infarct and suspicion for R MCA stroke.
He was also found to have pneumonia and was started on ceftriaxone and azythromycin.
Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: T-97.5 BP-148/79 HR-96 RR-18  91%O2Sat on 3L Gen: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit Back: No point tenderness or erythema CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake, eyes closed.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Left facial weakness UMN pattern.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
Subtle loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the right frontal lobe and right insula consistent with right MCA occlusion.
Above findings are corroborated by CTA findings of complete occlusion of the right ICA and M1 segment of right MCA.
Secretions within the trachea and left mainstem bronchus with associated ground glass opacity within the dependent portions of the visualized upper and superior segment of the lower lobes bilaterally which raises the possibility of aspiration.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Multiple sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules for which no followup is needed if there is no history of malignancy.
Significant increase in the size of the previously noted right MCA territory infarct, which now involves the entire right middle cerebral artery territory including the basal ganglia and internal capsule with mild-to- moderate mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
No acute hemorrhage within.
Two punctate foci of increased DWI signal in the occipital lobes, in the cortex, are of uncertain significance, and too small to be accurately characterized.
Paranasal sinus disease as described above.
Increase in the right MCA territory area of infarction, with mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
No acute hemorrhage.
Unchanged appearance of the dense right middle cerebral artery consistent with thrombus within.
4.Paranasal sinus disease as above  NCHCT [**2130-3-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Evolving right MCA infarct with increased edema and mass effect with new shift of the normally midline structures leftward.
No hemorrhagic transformation or herniation.
New right PCA infarct.
NCHCT [**2130-3-4**]: IMPRESSION: Continued evolution of right MCA and right PCA territory infarction with continued slight increased edema and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with slight increase in leftward shift of normally midline structures.
No new hemorrhagic transformation seen.
There is likely early right subfalcine herniation.
NCHCT [**2130-3-6**]: IMPRESSION: Continued evolution of right MCA and PCA territory infarction with slightly worsened mass effect including increase in leftward shift.
High-resistance flow in the right internal carotid artery without diastolic flow consistent with the distal right internal carotid artery occlusion seen on the CT of [**2130-3-1**].
The degree of stenosis in the proximal right internal carotid artery is mild with non elevated peak systolic velocities although the exact degree of proximal stenosis is difficult to quantitate due to the presence of the distal occlusion  2.
Less than 40% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery.
TTE [**2130-3-1**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of the basal anterior and basal inferolateral walls (LVEF = 25 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with severe global hypokinesis.
Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Mild aortic regurgtitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated aortic root.
Brief Hospital Course: This 80 M was evaluated at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for dysarthria and vomiting and found to have a large R-MCA stroke.
His CTA showed complete occlusion of the R-ICA and proximal segment of M1 branch of the R-MCA.
Over the course of 3 days he developed significant edema and swelling.
He sustained a new small R-PCA stroke on [**3-3**].
He was found to have atrial fibrillation.
At times he also has atrial flutter.
He had a surface echo which showed no thrombus or atheroma, but was notable for an EF of 25%.
He was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on [**3-8**], at which time, his exam was notable for ongoing flaccid left hemiparesis and eyelid apraxia.
While on the Stroke floor he has been clinically stable with no significant events.
He became therapeutic on coumadin and his heparin drip was stopped.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Left MCA/PCA infarct   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of a large stroke affecting the left side of your brain.
