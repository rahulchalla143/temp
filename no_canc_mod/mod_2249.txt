No CP or nausea.
Found to be in severe respiratory distress by EMS with RR 40 and intubated in the field.

2) Allowing for differences in technique, no interval change in pulmonary edema.
CXR, 2-view ([**11-17**]):Compared with [**2173-11-15**], post-extubation with partial interval clearing of the CHF and effusions.
A small residual effusion is noted on the left.
No consolidating pulmonary infiltrates appreciated.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
was a large vessel with 70% stenosis at its origin.
The LCX had mild luminal irregularities.
The RCA was a small vessel with 70-80% mid vssel stenosis.
The right sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 12mmHg and RVEDP was 14mmHg).
The pulmonary artery pressures were mildly elevated (mean PA pressure was 25mmHg).
The left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean PCW pressure was 12mmHg).
The systemic arterial pressure was mildly elevated measuring 142/76mmHg.
Selective renal aniography demonstrated no renal artery stenosis.
2 vessel coronary artery disease.
Mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
Mildly elvated pulmonary artery pressure and systemic arterial pressure.
No anigrographically apparent renal artery stenosis.
Allowing for these limitations, no obvious intracranial hemorrhage or large major vascular territorial infarction, though if suspicion remains high for the latter, MRI would be more sensitive to assess.
Multiple, scattered foci diffusion-weighted imaging abnormality within the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally, consistent with small areas of infarction.
The distribution is most compatible with an embolic etiology, with a low flow/watershed distribution being a secondary diagnostic consideration.
A high-grade stenosis of the proximal right vertebral artery is identified.
Evolving small areas of infarction within the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally, most compatible with an thromboembolic disease.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease with stenosis of the cavernous portions of the carotid arteries bilaterally.
Test terminated secondary to hypertensive BP response to low level exercise.
No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nonspecific ST-T wave changes noted late in recovery.
Brief Hospital Course: 65M h/o poorly controlled HTN, DM2, hyperlipidemia, obesity presents with acute respiratory distress [**2-4**] CHF exacerbation s/p intubation.
Extubated and SOB resolved s/p diuresis.
Transferred to floor but developed hypotension [**2-4**] meds (received labetalol and captopril together) with SBP 70's and given IVFs, glucagon, levophed and transferred back to CCU.
Acute CVA likely related to hypotensive episode.
hypertensive urgency at presentation with SBP 292, started on nitro gtt with good response, weaned off prior to coming to CCU but then restarted while titrating up po meds.
hypotensive episode [**11-17**] on labetalol, captopril, norvasc.
likely diastolic dysfunction given longstanding HTN however concern for ischemic component with depressed EF.
pro-BNP 4000 and volume overloaded at presentation; diuresed initially and euvolemic at discharge without lasix requirement.
cath revealed CAD but no intervention performed.
# CAD: 80% RCA and 70% D1, no intervention given no angina and deemed not culprit.
multiple risk factors and inferior akinesis on echo.
prior excercise test stopped due to hypertension.
ST changes on surface ECG likely repolarization abnormalities [**2-4**] LVH.
consider outpatient stress test when medically optimized if symptomatic.
# Rhythm: sinus.
monitored on telemetry with no events.
# Neuro: somnolent with right arm/face weakness 2 days following hypotensive event.
MRI/MRA brain suggests acute CVA, likely watershed from hypotensive episode per neurology consult however radiology suggests more consistent with embolic.
CTA head/neck with small bilat acute evolving CVA and cavernous carotid disease.
Started on aggrenox and no carotid ultrasound at this time per neuro.
# DM2: hyperglycemic at presentation, received 10 units regular insulin in ED with good response.
no evidence for contrast nephropathy.
# Abdominal discomfort: diffuse pattern that improved with defecation.
?gastroenteritis vs. reflux vs. constipation.
# Bicuspid aortic valve: noted incidentally on echo.
# PNA: productive cough of yellow sputum and spiked temp.
# RUE swelling: unclear cause, possible related to prior IV infiltration vs. phlebitis.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Fifteen (15) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
