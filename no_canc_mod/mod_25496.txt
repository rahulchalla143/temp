Large amount of peripancreatic stranding and fluid consistent acute pancreatitis.
No evidence of organized pseudocyst, pancreatic necrosis, venous thrombosis or arterial pseudoaneurysm formation.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage within the abdomen or pelvis.
New air-space consolidation within the right middle lobe and lingula concerning for aspiration or developing pneumonia.
Interval increase in small to moderate left pleural effusion.
Extensive peripancreatic inflammatory changes and intra-abdominal fluid slightly worsened in the interval compared to eight days prior.
Extensive third spacing.
Pancreatitis with decreased pancreatic enhancement suggestive of necrosis; copious peripancreatic, retroperitoneal and mesenteric fluid without evidence of hemorrhage or pseudocyst formation.
Right middle lobe pneumonia and left-sided pleural effusion.
Extensive third spacing.
Mild hydrocephalus with left transfrontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt in situ, and no transependymal migration of CSF.
Post-operative changes, likely related to right-sided aneurysm clipping, with no hemorrhage seen.
Mucosal sinus disease.
Urine culture (from foley) one day prior to d/c notable for 50+ reds, 20-50 whites, trace leukesterase and negative nitrites   Brief Hospital Course: 42F with acute on chronic alcoholic pancreaitis developed hypotension and ARDS requiring intubation.
These fevers were attributed to pancreatic inflammation.
Necrotizing pancreatitis:  Pt presented with acute on chronic pancreatitis, likely [**1-21**] to binge alcohol consumption.
She became hypotensive requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
Initially her CT showed large amount of peripancreatic stranding and fluid consistent acute pancreatitis and progressed to severe pancreatitis with concern for widespread necrosis involving the body and tail, extending into the neck within 48 hours.
Complications included hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia.
She was empirically treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for 14 days (meropenem + ciprofloxacin) given necrotic pancreatitis.
The most recent CT prior to discharge was notable for decreased enhancement of 75% of the pancreas suggesting 75% necrosis.
There was extensive peri-pancreatic fluid but no pseudocyst or abcess.
Given persistent abdominal distension and worsening leukocytosis, a repeat CT was obtained which showed a possible abscess forming to the right of the uterus potentially communicating with peripancreatic fluid.
General surgery was reconsulted however they did not feel a need to intervene.
Over the next day, she became afebrile and her WBC count trended down from 35 to 25.
We were not worried about the question of abscess due to resolving fevers and return of leukocytosis from 35 to 25, however we have suggested daily abdominal examinations with repeat evaluation with imaging should she become acutely febrile or have any elevation in WBC or other inflammatory markers.
Her pain was well managed on dilaudid PO.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome & ventilator associated PNA:  Pt had hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely [**1-21**] to ARDS from pancreatitis.
She required brief paralysis an esophageal balloon to maximize PEEP given initial difficulties with oxygenation.
Given her diffuse bilateral intersitial infiltrates, leukoctyosis in the mid-20 range, and persistent fevers, she was emprically treated for VAP with vancomycin, cefepime, cipro for two weeks.
On the floor, she continued to saturate well with humidified trach mask.
Persistent fevers: These were most likely secondary to alcoholic pancreatitis, we did not belive that there was an infectious process in the abdomen.
She completed a course 2 week course of vancomycin, cefepime, and cipro for ventilator assocaiated PNA (which also would have covered pancreatic infection) given her diffuse bilateral opacities, WBC~25, and fever although this was all most likely driven by ARDS secondary to pancreatitis.
Lumbar puncture was performed to rule out infection of her VP shunt: 1wbc, 1rbc, glucose of 90, and protein of 15.
She was afebrile for 36-48 hours prior to discharge.
A repeat abdominal CT showed development of small area of wall thickening near uterus communicative with peripancreatic fluid as above however our suspicion for intervention was low given that her WBC trended back down and remained afebrile.
At time of discharge WBCs were near 25 which we suspect is due to continued resolution of pancreatitis.
PO vancomycin was continued as above given her loose stools.
Fluid overload: In the setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation for pancreatitis and diffuse third spacing.
On the floor, she continued to be somewhat volume overloaded however we felt that this was secondary to inflammatory changes due to underlying pancreatitis.
We suggested that further diuresis with diuretics is not indicating since she is self-diuresing, and given her significant metabolic alkalosis, she is likely quite volume depleted intravascularly.
At time of discharge she was -3 L net over 24 hours, was saturating well on humidified trach mask, with evidence of continued fluid overload in abdominal compartment.
Acute renal failure: Developed after initial pancreatic inflammation had subsided and after aggresive fluid resuscitation.
Urine lytes were c/w intra-renal etiology.
Electrolytes have also been difficult to manage with refractory hypokalemia.
Concomittant metabolic alkalosis also makes repletion of K somewhat refractory.
Would recommend continued assessment of nutritional intake in rehab facility and would consider nutritional consultation for further input given that she still has continued caloric demands secondary to resolving pancreatitis.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 5503**] Rehab Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic alcoholic pancreatitis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Ventilator Associated PNA   Discharge Condition: Medically stable for discharge to rehabilitation   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 84691**],  You were admitted to the hospital with acute on chronic pancreatitis.
We also noted that you had loose stools while you were hospitalized.
The other possible cause of your loose stools is that when your pancreas gets damaged, it can become difficult for you to digest food.
You still have significant amounts of edema (swelling) as a consequence of the fluid you received for the pancreatitis.
You should continue to take this medicine as long as you continue to have loose stools.
(7) Started a nicotine patch, which will help you to quit smoking.
(10) Started a fentanyl patch, which helps keep you comfortable since you were recently intubated.
