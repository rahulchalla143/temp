He was initially transferred to an outside hospital and, by report, had facial fractures with a severe nasal bleed.
Upon arrival Mr. [**Known lastname **] was hypertensive with a blood pressure systolic of 190-200/palp and a heart rate in the 80's.
He was noticeably bleeding from both nares, right greater than left.
Coronary artery disease.
Cerebrovascular accident.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, in no acute distress sitting up in bed speaking in complete sentences.
No tracheal deviation.
Bilateral orbital ecchymosis.
No malocclusion.
No hemotympanum.
Edema and ecchymoses over the entire mid face.
Chest notable for a sternotomy scar.
Abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended.
Extremities: No deformities, no step-offs.
Urinalysis negative.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray:  No fracture, no pneumothorax.
Pelvis:  No fractures.
CT of the face shows bilateral anterior and medial maxillary sinus fractures, bilateral medial pterygoid fracture.
There are air-fluid levels present within the sphenoid and frontal sinuses and left maxillary sinus.
There is suspicion for a right orbital wall fracture but not definitely seen.
The ORL/ENT consult service was asked to see Mr. [**Known lastname **] for his multiple nasal fractures and for management assistance with his nasal packing.
The Ophthalmology consult service was also asked to evaluate Mr. [**Known lastname **] given his findings on examination as well as his multiple fractures including possible orbit fracture.
The Plastic Surgery service was also asked to evaluate Mr. [**Known lastname **] given his multiple facial fractures.
The Plastic Surgery service recommended an MRI of his spine which showed multiple severe spondylitic changes of the cervical spine with central canal and neural foraminal stenosis.
On the [**8-2**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the regular floor where he has been progressing steadily with a decrease in his ecchymosis and edema.
The Neurosurgery service signed off on Mr. [**Known lastname **] on [**1-3**] with a final [**Location (un) 1131**] on the MRI as being unremarkable and without any significant ligamentous injury or spinal cord compression.
Also upon transfer to the floor the physical therapist and occupational therapy team began working with Mr. [**Known lastname **] to make sure that he was able to get out of bed and move towards rehabilitation given his multiple fractures and the confirmation of a LeFort type I fracture on a repeat CT scan, he was maintained on a pureed soft diet.
He tolerated this well and there was no evidence of aspiration or other problems.
On the [**2111-1-8**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the Operating Room for an open reduction internal fixation of his LeFort type I fracture with four plates inserted.
There was also an excisional biopsy of a left alar lesion performed.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was intubated for this procedure and there were no complications associated with the procedure and he tolerated it very well.
He was subsequently transferred back to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and then the regular floor without any problems postoperatively.
