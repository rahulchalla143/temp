Admission Date:  [**2162-11-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2162-11-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-11-29**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year-old white male with a history of Parkinson's disease, idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15%, who presented to an outside hospital on [**11-15**] with a chief complaint of shortness of breath.
He was found to have mild congestive heart failure and treated with diuresis and Accupril.
The patient was also found to have decrease hematocrit and guaiac in stools.
He had an upper endoscopy significant for peptic ulcer disease.
The patient notes subacute decline with increase dyspnea on exertion in [**2162-7-29**].
The patient was admitted in early [**Month (only) 359**] with congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram revealing an ejection fraction 50%, moderate AS and 4+ MR.
The patient had an extensive workup to investigate the cause of this cardiac myopathy, which was suspected to be nonischemic.
Positive systolic ejection murmur at right upper sternal border radiating to carotids.
No femoral hematoma or bruits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**11-19**] to the medical service for complaints of shortness of breath.
The patient had a catheterization at which time it was shown that the patient had 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery, 80% stenosis of proximal DI, 80% of mid D3 not amenable to PCI.
Ejection fraction at that time was 20%, which was attributed to both coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.
The patient's Coumadin dose was noted to be held secondary to his history of recent GI bleed.
On the [**8-21**] cardiac surgery was consulted at which time a plan was formulated to proceed with an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve and coronary artery bypass graft was also planned.
Preoperatively there was no evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleed and the subQ heparin was discontinued.
On [**2162-11-24**] the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm Bovine pericardial valve, and a coronary artery bypass graft times three vessels (left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to ramus, saphenous vein graft to RPL).
The patient was extubated without complications in the Intensive Care Unit.
On postoperative day three the patient was transferred to the floor and reverted to atrial fibrillation rhythm at which time he was started on Amiodarone 150 mg intravenous times one and 400 mg po t.i.d.
In addition, the patient was also found to have a primary AV block with a PR interval of .281.
The patient did not progress in terms of the AV block and pacing was unnecessary.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease and aortic valve stenosis.
