In ED, patient noted to be OB negative and probability of post-surgical bleeding from hip was raised.
She [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] a CT pelvis which showed right adductor muscle hematoma.
On hospital day #2, the patient had a large OB + stool but non-melanotic.
Patient without abdominal complaints.
On [**5-14**] patient had another large melanotic bowel movement with hematocrit drop 30 to 24 therefore patient transferred to unit for urgent EGD.
EGD showed a large duodenal bulb ulcer which was injected with epinephrine.
Of note, hospital course also c/b afib/flutter with RVR, difficulty swallowing pills, CT chest with RUL lesion suspicious for cancer  Past Medical History: 1.

Osteopenia 9. h/o hematuria 10. s/p repair at NEBH [**2172-5-5**] as part of a scheduled, staged bilateral hip repair.
Mild Pulm HTN.

Her hospital course was complicated by  supraventricular tachycardia requiring initiation of diltiazem and a chest CT scan with suspicious Righ apical lung lesion, and leukocytosis.
1) Hematocrit drop:  This was felt to be multifactorial from both adductor muscle hematoma and bleeding duodenal bulb ulcer.
GI was consulted during the hospital stay and found the duodenal bulb ulcer as above.
Her coumadin was held given the bleeding and she will be started on lovenox SC 40 daily until procedure.
She was monitored on telemetry which showed only premature atrial beats.
3) Lung mass:  CT scan revealed worsening RUL scarring with spiculations suspicious for malignancy.
Given her extensive smoking history and recent weight loss, there was significant concern for malignancy.
5) s/p THR: Given the need for further lung biopsies for diagnsotic purposes of right apical lesion, the patient was not discharged on lovenox SC or coumadin.
