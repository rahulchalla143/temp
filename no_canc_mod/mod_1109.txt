WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2153-12-9**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..       CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.
MODERATE GROWTH.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Extensive peripancreatic fluid and extraluminal gas possibly extending to the right mid abdomen is new since prior exam and likely represents complications of pancreatitis, i.e.
Given lack of oral and IV contrast, evaluation is extremely limited and repeat CT with gastrografin through the G-tube can be performed to further assess as clinically indicated.
Stable large bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent lower lobe collapse.
Pathology [**2153-12-4**]: Pancreas, debridement:: Blood, inflammatory cells and fat necrosis with changes consistent with saponification.
Upper and lower extremity U/S [**2153-12-7**]: No DVT  CT abd/ Pelvis [**2153-12-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
New hematoma in the surgical bed surrounding the drain.
No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or active extravasation.
Several othere collections are stable to smaller (pelvic collection) in size.
Large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.

Neuro: The patient received fentanyl and dilaudid with good effect and adequate pain control.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Fluconizole was added for yeast found in his urine and sputum.
His pancreas abscess cultures grew VRE and citrobacter.
His invasive lines were changed periodically, chest x-ray and blood and urine cultures checked periodically to monitor for signs of infection.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; he was transfused packed red blood cells periodically for a low hematocrit.
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a hematoma surrounding his drain.
