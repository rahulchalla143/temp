Myocardial infarction.
Myocardial infarction in [**2158**].
Transient ischemic attack in [**2156**].
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING: Cardiac catheterization showed left vein and 3-vessel disease with an ejection fraction of 45%.
His preoperative chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
On [**7-7**], he had ultrasounds done which showed a right internal carotid stenosis of 60% to 69%, a left internal carotid stenosis of less than 40%.
His abdominal examination was benign with good bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
His extremities were warm and well perfused with no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, or varicosities.
He had Q waves in his inferior leads.
Coming off bypass, the patient experienced right ventricular failure and went back on bypass with drug manipulations.
Additional echocardiography showed an ejection fraction still approximately 35% to 40% with moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic insufficiency, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation and aortic regurgitation.
The patient went back on bypass a third time for increased right ventricular failure and increasingly unstable vital signs.
He was unresponsive on examination and was successfully sedated.
He remained fully on Swan-Ganz catheter and monitored with maximum pressors and inotropic support.
They recommended continuous venovenous hemofiltration for fluid removal and oxygenation to help improve it, but the patient was clearly hypoxic and had cardiogenic shock.
He also had lactic acidosis and congestive heart failure.
The hypernatremia was likely secondary to multiple ampules of bicarbonate given during the operation.
The left femoral venous dialysis was placed under sterile conditions in the Intensive Care Unit on [**7-8**] in preparation for continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
The patient was seen again the next morning by the Renal Service with the right ventricular assist device still in place and massive volume overload after DOR noted on maximal ventilatory support with acute renal failure secondary to the prolong hypertension.
The patient was unresponsive with no movement.
The patient continued to have low-flows and low blood pressures on his right ventricular assist device with coarse breath sounds.
His extremities appeared to have anasarca emboli and were warm.
He remained on amiodarone drip at 0.5, lidocaine drip at 1, dobutamine drip at 2.5, epinephrine drip at 0.3, Levophed drip at 0.27, and Milrinone drip at 0.25, vasopressin drip at 0.08, Neo-Synephrine drip at 1.4, propofol drip at 20, insulin drip at 1, as well as perioperative antibiotics.
He was continued on his right ventricular assist device and his intra-aortic balloon pump with acute tubular necrosis and was requiring vasopressors and on inotropic support.
He had a poor potassium clearance, by Renal Service, suggesting extreme/extensive recirculation of fluid.
He was seen by clinical Nutrition Service for a discussion of starting some parenteral nutrition, but the patient continued to decline and stopped responding to his drugs with any full measure.
There was no cardiac activity or spontaneous respirations.
