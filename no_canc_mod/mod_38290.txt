Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
The right ventricular free wall demonstrates mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
After initial deployment, significant aortic regurgitation was seen on the mitral valvular aspect of the valvular apparatrus.
Another small jet was seen on the opposite side but this was only trace in severity..
There was no pericardial effusion.
ECHO ([**5-25**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a normal transvalvular gradient and trivial aortic regurgitation.
The severity of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension are reduced.
ECHO ([**5-31**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 89F with hx of critical AS, CAD, HTN with shortness of breath admitted for Corevalve procedure.
ACTIVE ISSUES: #Aortic Stenosis Pt with SOB secondary to AS admitted for Corevale.
Corevalve on [**5-24**] without complications.
Post-procedure echo showed no gradient across aortic valve and only trace AR.
During admission, she was also followed by geriatics given advanced age and PT for deconditioning associated with preop severe aortic stenosis.
Her beta blocker was intially held due to bradycardia but it was resumed once tolerated by heart rate.
Home dose of metoprolol was initially held secondary to bradycardia in the 50-60s so she was started on amlodipine 2.5 mg po qd.
# HYPOTHYROID: stable.
# ANEMIA: Hct nl.
