Admission Date:  [**2113-1-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-1-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2027-5-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 85 yo male with a history of severe AS, 3VD CAD, CHF, s/p recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2113-1-11**] to [**2113-1-21**]) for acute on chronic systolic CHF, with multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 1516**] for severe AS and acute on chronic systolic CHF.
Prior to this, the patient has had multiple hospitalisations at [**Hospital1 **] in [**Month (only) **]-[**2112-12-29**].
He was admitted in [**Month (only) **] s/p LOC w/ left orbital fracture thoguht to be secondary to AVNRT s/p ablation, was found to have aortic stenosis and 3 vessel CAD on Cath.
He was d/ced with eval for surgery, but developed GI bleeding from a gastric ulcer.
Upon discharge he developed aCHF exacerbation, and readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] where his course was complicated by C. diff colitis.
Patient had been at [**Location (un) 1121**] [**Hospital3 **] where he was noted to have low blood pressures(SBP 80s, baseline 90s), was agitated and had loose stools for 3 days.
Patient also reported some difficulty breathing for the past well.
He was thought to be septic with leukocytosis and left shift, with question of pneumonia on CXR, anasarca and pleural effusions.
Urinalysis negative.
Today, he also had an episode of vomiting brown fluid.
Minutes prior to scheduled transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient developed chest pain and was given sublingual nitroglycerin.
However, he became hypotensive and transfer was temporarily suspended.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: - DMII - HTN - CVA (2 yrs ago, started on warfarin afterwards) - CAD - atrial fibrillation - hx DVT [**2102**] - severe aortic stenosis - systolic CHF (EF 40-45% with global hypokinesis) - syncope w/ left orbital fracture, thought to be [**3-2**] AVNRT, now s/p ablation  Past Surgical History: - s/p hip surgery - s/p knee surgery - s/p carpal tunnel syndrome   Social History: Pt lives in rehab following recent d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2113-1-21**]).
Family History: Pt denies family history of CAD, cancers or DMII.
Sleepy but rousable, speech slurred, left facial droop.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Slow reacting pupils, pupils not constricting fully to bright light.
No thrills, lifts.
ABDOMEN: Distended, fluid thrill+ve, shfting dullnes +ve, tender to deep palpation, but no rebound, no guarding, no flank bruising.
No masses or organomegaly.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PERTINENT STUDIES ECHO [**2113-1-29**] Conclusions There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =25-30 %).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe global hypokinesis.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
There is hazy opacity diffusely through both lungs -- I suspect the presence of bilateral layering effusions.
There is probably underlying collapse and/or consolidation, with suggestion of air bronchograms in the right infrahilar region.
If clinically indicated, an upright, lateral and/or decubitus films could help to further assess the underlying lung.
KUB [**2113-1-29**]   Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo male with history of critical AS, 3VD CAD, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin readmitted from rehab to OSH with sepsis, colitis, acute on chronic renal failure, exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and possible NSTEMI.
ACTIVE ISSUES # Hypotension/Shock: Pt presented with shock, likely combined septic and cardiogenic shock, with multisystem failure and lactic acidosis.
The septic component is likely secondary to GI source given the recent C.diff infection.
Pt's abdominal exam worsened rapidly with distension and rebound tenderness.
The cardiogenic component of his shock is based on elevation of troponin to 3 at OSH.
Given his known critical AS and three vessel coronary artery disease (including left main), he has little reserve for cardiac output.
It is also possible that the GI symptoms were secondary to ischemic bowel in the setting of NSTEMI.
His blood pressure was maintained at 80s/40s with reasonable mental status.
At 2AM on [**2113-1-30**], pt became unresponsive with asystole on telemetry.
There were no evidence of radial/carotid pulses, pupilary reflex, or heart/lung sounds on exam.
