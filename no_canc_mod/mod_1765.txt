Patient has a prolonged history of VT starting in [**2161**] with monomorphic VT and s/p ICD placement then.
Since placement he has been shocked multiple times, once for atrial tachycardia and most recently in [**3-/2170**] for sustain monomorphic VT in the setting of grocery shopping and it was nonresponsive to antitachycardia pacing at 188.
He has since developed post-traumatic stress disorder due to the multiple shocks.
He has been previously treated for his afib with amiodarone however developed transaminitis and therefore was switched to dofetilide.
Today the patient underwent VT ablation with ablation around the inferior scar where he had 2 inducible pathways.

He transiently had an Impella device placed during the VT ablation of his inferior wall scar.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS # Ventricular tachycardia (VT) s/p ICD: His VT has been monomorphic and he had inducible VT in 2 places around his inferior wall scar.
He underwent ICD implantation in [**2161**] and he has been shocked multiple times over the years with post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result.
Improved to 130 later in the day and was 133 morning after procedure without intervention.
Appeared euvolemic so likely related to heart failure.
CHRONIC PROBLEMS # CAD:  Patient with history of AMI and IMI with resultant heart failure and ICD placement.
He denied chest pain and EKG was without evidence of ischemia.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: Due to CAD as above, last LVEF 30% in [**2167**], and he is s/p ICD placement in [**2161**].
He had no evidence of decompensation.
# HTN: Well controlled during stay, continued home antihypertensive regimen.
# Diabetes: on metformin at home, A1c consistently in the 7s.
