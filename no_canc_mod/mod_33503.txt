She was started on levophed and was started on Ceftriaxone for SBP treatment.
She was found to have acute renal failure which was thought to be due to hypotension and ATN.

There is no pneumothorax.
Appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged, with findings most consistent with mild CHF and small bilateral pleural effusions, and pulmonary vascular congestion.
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition.
Non-specific precordial lead/anterior T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2188-5-6**] precordial lead T wave changes appear slightly more prominent.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2188-5-19**] Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent increased airspace opacity involving both lungs.
There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
Right internal jugular central venous catheter is again seen with its tip in the SVC.
No pneumothorax.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2188-5-21**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum and anterior wall.. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-5-5**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher.
[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)  [**2188-5-20**] FINDINGS: Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate no lower extremity DVT bilaterally.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Granularity and erythema of the mucosa were noted in the stomach body.
These findings are compatible with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Protruding Lesions A few small gastric nodules were seen in the fundus.
Other findings: No evidence of varices.
Impression: Granularity and erythema in the stomach body compatible with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy Nodules in the fundus No evidence of varices.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo female with h/o HCV cirrhosis, DM2, CAD s/p recent [**Year (4 digits) **] admitted to MICU for hypotension which was thought to be due to SBP/fluid depletion.
Hypotension resolved w/empiric SBP treatment and IVFs/albumin.
She was then transferred to the floor in stable condition but with persistent oxygen requirement after having had episode of flash pulmonary edema 2 days prior.
The hypotension was likely due to hypovolemia and/or sepsis.
She was treated with IVFs/albumin for concern of hypovolemia d/t diuresis and diarrhea and ceftriaxone empirically for SBP with concern of sepsis.
There was concern for cardiogenic shock as the pt has h/o CAD with recent [**Year (4 digits) **]; however, troponins were overall trending down.
Pt completed 5 day course of ceftriaxone for possible SBP, and then returned to SBP ppx with ciprofloxacin.
She was restarted on low dose metoprol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] instead of her nadolol as she had no esophageal varices seen on EGD.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Pt with baseline EF of 55% with recent [**Hospital1 **] and anteroseptal hypokinesis.
Pt had increased O2 requirement after IVF resuscitation, and CXR was c/w pulmonary edema.
# HCV Cirrhosis:  Pt was recently diagnosed with SBP and treated with 5 day course of ceftriaxone and discharged on ciprofloxacin for SBP ppx.
Nadolol was held on admission given her hypotension and was not restarted as EGD on [**5-22**] showed no varices but portal hypertensive gastropathy.
# ARF:  Cr on admission was 2.9, increased from 1.6 on [**5-15**].
Recent baseline has been 1.5-1.6.
# CAD:  Pt had a small [**Month/Day (2) **] on prior admission.
She does have a history of guaiac positive stool.
EGD on [**5-20**] showed no varices but did show portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Given stable HCT, colonoscopy was deferred for outpatient.
# PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots .

Secondary: Acute on chronic diastolic dysfunction Hepatitis C virus cirrhosis Coronary artery disease Acute on chronic renal failure   Discharge Condition: Stable, SBP in 90s (baseline)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low [**Hospital **] pressure.
You were treated with intravenous fluids and albumin as well as antibiotics for possible infection in your abdomen.
There was no active bleeding.
If you develop nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, [**Hospital **] in the stool, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, lightheadedness/dizziness, or any other concerning symptoms, please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2422**].
