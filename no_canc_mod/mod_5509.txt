Head CT neg for bleed at [**Location (un) 620**].
Cath showed LMCA with no angiographic apparent CAD, LAD with mid and distal long tubular 50% stenosis, LCX with no angiographic apparent stenosis, RCA with mid 95% long stenosis that was stented.
She was more confused at [**Location (un) 620**] and there was concern for ischemic stroke and was sent to MRI/MRA to rule out stroke after cath.
Past Medical History: Facial droop Hypercholesterolemia ?CAD Jaw cancer s/p resection and hip bone graft (leading to weakness in L hip) [**2156**]  Social History: Lives in [**Hospital3 **] facility, 3 children.
Family History: Father with MI at young age.
FTN with slight dysmetria, Pupils 5-6mm and not reactive, EOMI, OP clear, L facial droop (chronic).
Head CT - no bleed from OSH Head MRI/MRA - chronic ischemic changes.
no acute bleed.
There was 2+ mitral regurgitation.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated filling pressures with mRAP of 14 mmHg and mPCWP of 32 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with mPAP of 35 mmHg.
Successful PCI of the anterior takeoff mid-RCA with a 3.0 x 28 mm Cypher DES, post-dilated with a 3.5 mm balloon.
Elevated filling pressures.
Moderate diastolic dysfunction.
PORTABLE AP CHEST AT 8:05: No prior studies are available for comparison.
There is no pulmonary edema/CHF or pleural effusion.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is very mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Very mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo female admitted with presyncope found to be bradycardic, with ST depressions on EKG, s/p cath with stent to RCA.
ST elevation MI: Patient was transferred from outside hospital for cardiac catheterization.
A 95% RCA lesion was revealed and a cypher stent was placed without complications.
Her echo showed very mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, mild aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation.
Her EKG revealed NSR with a rate of 75 and non-specific T wave changes at discharge.
She was bradycardic on transfer but was in NSR.
Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive to 200's on arrival with unclear precipitant.
CXR did not reveal any pulmonary edema.
Conjunctivitis: Patient had some conjuntival injection and eye discharge and was given Erythromycin 5 mg/g Ointment Sig: One (1)  Ophthalmic  QID with near resolution by discharge.
Her mental status cleared by the second hospital day and she had no neurological deficits.
She follow up as an outpatient for a colonoscopy.
Bradycardia 3.
Hypertension 4.
Conjunctivitis   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable, asymptomatic   Discharge Instructions: If you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or nausea call you doctor or go to the emergency room.
You should also have him follow your blood glucose levels as they were mildly elevated during your admission.
It is also recommmended that you have an outpatient colonscopy as you were anemic during your admission.
