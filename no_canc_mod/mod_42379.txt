[**2151-10-11**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-FINAL-No Growth [**2151-10-11**] URINE URINE CULTURE-FINAL-No growth  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2151-10-11**] for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.
An abdominal/pelvic CT revealed a large pneumoperitoneum.
The patient was brought to the Operating Room emergently, where she underwent right hemicolectomy with ileocolostomy primary anastomosis for a finding of peritonitis and ischemic right hemicolon and right colonic perforation.
The patient was extubated without problem, and placed on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.
While in the SICU, the patient experienced (L) index finger swellin, pain , mild erythema.
An x-ray was perfomed of both hands, which showed degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis, and possible changes consistent with psoriatic arthritis in the right index  finger, although this finding was uncertain.
Given the patient's bowel surgery, it was determined NSAIDS should be avoided, and the pain be treated with opioid pain medications.
On POD#2, the patient was transferred to the floor NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and a Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Early on POD#6, however, the patient began experiencing intermittent fevers, and a small incisional opening, which was being packed.
House staff notified at approximately 9:00 p.m. that the patient was now tachycardiac but no frank peritonitis.
These findings nevertheless were consistent with perforation and the patient was consented and brought back to the OR for urgent exploratory laparotomy and probable ileostomy, colostomy and resection.
Early on [**2151-10-18**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, resection of ileocolic anastomosis, [**Doctor Last Name **] ileostomy, transverse end-colostomy, and debridement of fascial edges for identified perforation ileocolic anastomosis, which went well (see Operative Note).
New subclavian placed.
The patient arrived on the floor on a diabetic regular diet, home medications, oral pain medications, and on a comprehensive antibiotics regimen, which consisted of IV Daptomycin and cefepime and oral Flagyl and Ciprofloxacin.
She had a VAC dressing with black foam at 125mmHg applied to her mid-abdominal incisional wound, an ileostomy and colostomy.
She was followed by Orthopedics regarding for the left ankle; she remained non-weight bearing on the left with an ankle splint in place.
An x-ray of the left ankle demonstrated that the hardware is unchanged, and that there were no signs for complications.
The patient tolerated her diabetic regular diet with fair intake, but no nausea.
Midline abdominal incisional wound improved with continued use of the VAC dressing system.
Mobility was restricted due to non-weight bearing status on the left foot.
She experienced episodic left index finger swelling and pain; she was ultimately started on a short course of Indocin with symptomatic improvement.
At the time of discharge on [**2151-10-30**], the patient is doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient is tolerating a regular diet, ileostomy and colostomy are functioning properly, and pain is well controlled.
