She remained stable on nasal cannula O2 13-50 cc of oxygen until [**2151-7-22**] with a marked increase in her O2 needs from 50 cc to 1 liter of O2 due to increased desaturations requiring blow-by O2.
Over the day of [**8-1**], she had difficulty of oxygenation requiring increased O2 support as well as vent support.
She had a murmur which presented on [**2151-7-13**] and continues to date.
