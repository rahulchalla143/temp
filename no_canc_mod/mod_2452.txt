# Coronary Artery Disease - She originally presented to [**Hospital1 **] with 4 days of substernal chest pain and found to have ST elevations in the inferior leads.
She was found to have a subtotal occlusion of the RCA, and received 2 bare-metal stents to the mid-distal RCA.
# Rhythm ??????

# Pump ??????
Patient appeared euvolemic without signs of heart failure.

She had a TTE in the hospital which showed preserved ejection fraction and systolic function, as well as very mild mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
# Hypertension - Patient was normotensive throughout her hospitalization.
There is no hard indication for starting an ACE-I, as she has preserved ejection fraction, no evidence of heart failure, and she did not have an anterior MI.
# GERD - Patient was switched to ranitidine from omeprazole due to concern for an interaction with Plavix.
# Osteoarthritis - Pt with severe osteoarthritis affecting her knees, hips, low back and cervical spine.
