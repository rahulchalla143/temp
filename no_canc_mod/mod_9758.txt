PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her previous medical history was  PRENATAL HISTORY:  Her prenatal history is remarkable for a subchorionic placental hemorrhage at 15 weeks and some transient fetal premature atrial contractions.
Her prenatal screens were blood type B positive, antibody negative, Rubella immune, rapid plasma reagin nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and group beta strep status unknown.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Admission physical examination was remarkable for nondysmorphic extremely preterm infant.
Moderate intercostal retractions with spontaneous breaths.
He was treated with caffeine for apnea of prematurity from day of life 2 until day of life 64.
His last spontaneous episode of bradycardia occurred on [**2131-8-12**].
This spell was associated with a feeding.
He was treated with Diuril for chronic lung disease from day of life 25 to the present time.
He completed a course of antibiotics on [**2131-5-22**] for Escherichia coli pneumonia.
He was treated with indomethacin on day of life five for clinical presentation of a patent ductus arteriosis with resolution of his symptoms.
Reemergence of the murmur on day of life 11 prompted surgical ligation of the patent ductus arteriosis at [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**2131-5-18**].
On [**5-22**], he had a follow-up cardiac echocardiogram which showed a patent foramen [**Last Name (LF) 43369**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] aneurysm of the septum primum, and good biventricular function.
He continues to have an intermittent grade [**12-10**] to 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
A persistent elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine prompted a renal ultrasound on [**2131-5-18**] which demonstrated bilateral decreased perfusion.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  [**Known lastname 43368**] was treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia from day of life 1 until day of life 22.
The Steri-strips to his right groin are intact without redness or drainage.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The infant was started on ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors.
He did complete seven days of gentamicin and ceftazidime for Escherichia coli pneumonia.
On day of life 19, he again had a clinical decompensation and was started on vancomycin and gentamicin.
He remained off antibiotics until day of life 45, when a clinical presentation of sepsis and was started on vancomycin and gentamicin.
At that time, his tracheal culture was positive for Escherichia coli, and he completed seven days of antibiotic treatment for that.
On day of life 90, he had an acute increase in his abdominal girth and a tense abdomen; likely related to atropine drops he was receiving for his retinopathy or prematurity.
An ultrasound on [**6-5**] showed mild ventriculomegaly.
A follow-up ultrasound on [**6-27**] showed a left choroid plexus cyst and ventricular size in the upper limits of normal.
An ultrasound on [**7-11**] was read as normal, and a final ultrasound on [**8-31**] again showed a left choroid plexus cyst.
No periventricular leukomalacia and a normal ventricular size.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  [**Known lastname 43368**] was stable; tolerating ad lib demand feeds; on room air without respiratory distress or decompensation; stable temperature; in open crib.
(2) Born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for day care during respiratory syncytial virus season, with a smoker in the household, or with preschool siblings; and, (3) With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the Fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other care givers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Status post prematurity at 24-3/7 weeks gestation.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome.
Status post physiologic hyperbilirubinemia.
Status post metabolic acidosis.
Right inguinal hernia; status post repair on [**8-29**].
Status post apnea of prematurity.
Retinopathy of prematurity; status post laser therapy.
Status post Escherichia coli pneumonia (times two episodes).
Chronic lung disease.
Anemia of prematurity.
