Admission Date:  [**2154-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-6-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: FEVER  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement PEG tube placement Ultrasound guided prostate fluid collection aspiration.
History of Present Illness: 89 year old male with chief complaint of fevers of 104 degrees, agitation, pulling at foley w/ hematuria.
PMH BPH, afib, HTN, recent episode of hemorrhagic prostatitis, primary progressive aphasia.
pt was admitted in [**State 108**] 1 mo back for hematuria and was found to have hemorrhagic prostatitis.
Past Medical History: BPH Afib HTN Recent episode of hemorrhagic prostatitis Primary progressive aphasia  Social History: SH: no etoh, tobacco, illicits   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: 97  131/86  76  18  94ra GEN: friendly male, occasionally singing and humming.
[**6-4**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
[**6-4**] EKG: Baseline artifact Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Right bundle branch block Rightward axis - is nonspecific but cannot exclude in part right ventricular overload or chronic pulmonary disease ST-T wave changes - are in part primary and are nonspecific Clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing available for comparison .
[**6-5**] Prostate Ultrasound:CONCLUSION: Marked prostatic enlargement with an estimated volume in excess of 150 cc.
No evidence of prostate abscess on this limited study.
Massive prostate enlargement.
ECHOCARDIOGRAMS: [**6-6**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with overall normal systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
No vegetation identified.
Unsuccessful esophageal intubation.
CONCLUSION The [**Last Name (Titles) **] probe could not be passed into the esophagus due to patient's inability to cooperate.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared to the prior study of [**2154-6-6**], there is no definite change.
Compared to prior study from [**6-5**], there is an ill-defined increased opacity in the left lower lobe, could be atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax or sizeable pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of overt CHF.
KUB: [**6-10**] INDICATION: 89-year-old man with abdominal tenderness, leukocytosis, question free intraperitoneal air.
COMPARISON: Abdominal radiograph dated [**2154-6-9**] and CT abdomen and pelvis dated [**2154-6-8**]  FINDINGS: There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
Degenerative changes are noted in the lower lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Limited study, no evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
A qualified nurse was present to administer intravenous fentanyl for pain control, with continuous appropriate monitoring.
Images were limited by scattered coarse prostatic calcifications with associated dense shadowing.
However, there was an area of relative decreased echogenicity in the right gland, corresponding to the CT abnormality.
This area was more ill defined and not compatible with a discrete fluid collection, but more suggestive of a phlegmon.
IMPRESSION: Patient status post ultrasound-guided aspiration of a hypoechoic phlegmon in the right prostate gland.
-------------------  Brief Hospital Course: 89 male with benign prostatic hypertrophyu, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, recent episode of hemorrhagic prostatitis, primary progressive aphasia presenting with sepsis, floridly positive urinalysis.
1) Bacteremia / Fungemia: Patient was admitted hypotensive and tachycardic.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] culture and urine culture grew coag + staph and enterococcus.
Once final sensitivities revealed a coag + staph and enterococcus which were both sensitive to Vancomycin, the patient was started on Vancomycin and Daptomycin was discontinued.
CT scan was performed to eval for abscess, prostate necrosis / abscess.
Prostate fluid collection was seen.
This was performed, but no abscess was found; small amount of material was extracted and sent for culture.
Pacemaker pocket was studied via ultrasound and no sign of infection seen.
Two TTEs were perfomed, which showed no vegetations on limited study.
Source was felt to be most likely prostatic given coag + staph and bacteroides grew out of the fluid drained from the prostate.
Optho evaluation was negative for retinitis.
--- Patient to follow-up with ID for further management [**2154-7-10**] [**Hospital **] Medical Building [**Hospital1 18**] 10:30 AM --- Patient to have repeat prostatic ultrasound as outpatient for further evaluation of prosatic abscess.
2) Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate:  Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and off his betablocker in the setting of infection developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Patient remains off coumadin since first episode of hemorrhagic prostatitis in [**State 108**], [**Hospital 9836**] Medical Center.
3) Nutrition Poor PO intake since admission.
4) Acute renal failure Creatinine elevated at presentation, thought to be [**2-23**] pre-renal.
Elevated again after dye load from CT scan on [**6-8**].
7) Dementia Unknown etiology.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Sepsis 2) Prostate fluid collection 3) Atrial fibrillation .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a severe infection.
You were also found to have a fungal infection of the [**Hospital6 **].
You will require re-imaging of your prostate with a CT scan to ensure that the infection has resolved.
