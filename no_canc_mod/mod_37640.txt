During that admission the patient had a clotted AV graft that required thrombectomy.
On ultrasound and had a nonpatent bilateral IJ veins.
The patient was discharged to rehab and had been in her usual state of health denying an fevers or chills, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, headaches, change in bowel movements.
She does have right chronic arm pain and bilateral heel ulcers.
At [**Hospital **] Rehab she had persistent low blood pressures with systolic in the 60s, 70s and heart rate in the 80s.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] and has had persistently low blood pressures in the Emergency Department with systolics less then 90s and heart rate 70s and 80s.
However, she remained asymptomatic during this time.
Chest x-ray showed signs of early congestive heart failure.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
End stage renal disease on HD.
Failed cadaver kidney transplant.
Past history of hypertension.
Chronic pain.
Bilateral nonpatent internal jugulars.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of hydrocephalus at age 76.
The patient is a well appearing middle aged white female in no acute distress.
No crackles or wheezes.
Cardiac examination S1 and S2, 1 out of [**1-26**] early systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
No rebound or guarding.
Chest x-ray mild upper vascular redistribution, questionable retrocardiac air bronchogram.
The patient persisted to have low blood pressures while in the MICU, however, remained asymptomatic.
The patient had a random Cortisol tested, which was slightly low at 20.8.
Etiology of the hypotension was felt to be primarily due to autonomic dysfunction, however, the possibility of adrenal insufficiency was brought up.
Later on in the hospital course a possible friction rub was noted and the patient had an echocardiogram performed, which showed mild to moderate pericardial effusion new from echocardiogram done a month ago.
The patient had repeat electrocardiograms done, which showed no significant change and the echocardiogram showed no signs of tamponade.
The patient's blood cultures remained negative and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial cardiac enzymes.
Gastroparesis:  The patient had significant abdominal distention and pain after being transferred to the floor.
The patient had a KUB, which showed no signs of obstruction.
Diabetes:  The patient had elevated blood sugars on admission with a slight anion gap.
The patient was noted to have an elevated TSH, however, in light of her recent illness and the fact that her TSH was low on prior tests it was felt that it might be due to a recent infection and will be rechecked in several weeks.
In light of the fact that the patient had a questionable infection three weeks ago and no bacterial organism was identified it is possible that the patient had a viral infection and the pericardial effusion was related to a viral infection.
The patient will have a repeat echocardiogram done on Friday to assess for interval change.
Heel ulcers:  The patient was seen by podiatry who felt that the heel ulcers were not infected and there was no need for antibiotics.
Autonomic dysfunction.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
