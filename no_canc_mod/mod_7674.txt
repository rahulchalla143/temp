Per pt and his wife, he was in his usual state of health until last Tuesday (one wks ago), when he tripped on a tree root while clearing brush in the garden, and had an unwitnessed fall without apparent loss of consciousness.
Pt and his wife doubt he hit his head, and pt denies any period of confusion, tongue-biting, or lightheadedness before or after his fall.
He was able to drive afterward without difficulty.
Per pt, he had similar symptoms when he was last on gabapentin.
Pt denied fevers or chills.
He denied seizure-like activity, changes in vision, headache, language difficulties, or asymmetric weakness.
That night, pt began vomiting profuse amounts of food-like material, non-bloody, that started while he was sleeping on his back.
Per wife, pt appeared very weak after this episode and had trouble standing up, so she called 911.
Pt denies any associated symptoms of cough, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or dysuria.
He was subsequently intubated without difficulty.
Initial CXR showed b/l opacities, and CT torso confirmed these findings without additional processes.
CT head was ordered for the history of unwitnessed fall and was negative.
In the MICU, pt appeared volume overloaded on exam and CXR, with BNP [**Numeric Identifier 28490**], so he was kept on lasix.
Pt was noted to have myoclonic jerks in his upper extremities while sleeping and awake the first night in MICU.

Aspiration pneumonitis:  Patient had a history of emesis, likely associated with acute food poisoning/viral gastritis that has since self-resolved, with evidence of lung consolidation on CT chest.
Given pt's rapid improvement and low clinical suspicion for aspiration pneumonia (active lifestyle, afebrile, and no history of dysphagia), his presentation was more consistent with aspiration pneumonitis.
Serial chest x-rays showed interval improvements in parenchymal consolidations.
He was extubated on [**2188-8-25**], and started taking PO without difficulty.
Urine Legionella Ag was negative, endotracheal sputum gram stain and cultures from admission showed >25 polys and <10 epithelial cells per field with 1+ yeast, and grew rare commensal respiratory flora.
After extubation, pt remained afebrile and asymptomatic for the remainder of hospital course, and was feeling back to baseline on discharge.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF:  On admission pt also appeared to be volume overloaded.
CXR and chest CT showed mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
BNP was elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 28490**], and he had signs of pitting edema (per MICU notes, pt was 25 lbs over dry weight).
Pt improved clinically, with decreased edema on discharge.
Renal also recommended pt to be discharged on home lasix regimen (20 mg PO BID), with instructions to double his morning lasix dose (to 40 mg) as needed for pedal edema.
# Anemia: Pt's hematocrit dropped from 34 on admission (baseline 31-35) to 25-27 on [**2188-8-25**] and was stable ever since (29 on discharge).
There were no apparent sources of bleeding throughout hospital course, and pt endorsed only dry clots of blood in his sputum (no blood in stool or urine).
Pt remained asymptomatic, and it is possible his Hct changes were from hemodilution due to profound fluid shifts.
Reticulocyte index was <2% suggesting an additional chronic hypoproliferative component.
Given his concurrent renal failure, there was some concern for vasculitis like Wegener?????
# Thrombocytopenia: Pt's platelet count on admission was 163 (baseline 150s-200s), and dropped to 119 on [**2188-8-25**] (107 on discharge), in parallel with Hct changes above.
This is likely due to hemodilution as above, but we recommend continued monitoring.
This was likely due to poor perfusion from heart failure exacerbation, and Cre improved to baseline of 1.9-2.0 with gentle Lasix diuresis.
# Generalized weakness/myoclonus: Pt noted to have myoclonic jerks in the MICU that appeared to have resolved on transfer to medicine.
His history suggests this may be related to recent medication changes, such as skipped tacrolimus doses on admission, or recently restarted gabapentin doses (per pt, both these medication changes have been associated with myoclonic episodes in the past).
Gabapentin was held throughout hospital course, and he no longer had any evidence of myoclonus after transfer to Medicine.
He was clinically asymptomatic throughout hospital course, without evidence of EKG changes.
We recommend continued follow-up of potassium, especially in light of ongoing renal issues.
Afib:  Patient has history of chronic afib on Coumadin, which was initially held because of concern for dropping Hct.
Of note, his HR was stable in 50s-70s without evidence of Afib on telemetry x 24 hrs prior to discharge.
Coronary Artery Disease:  Patient with history of NSTEMI in the past, s/p atherectomy of the LAD [**2176**], DES to mid-LAD, ISRS [**2180**] s/p DES to mid-LAD, ISRS s/p POBA [**2185**], s/p CABG.
Simvastatin was initially held but re-started when initial mild transaminitis normalized.
Hyperlipidemia:  Held home statins initially given elevated LFTs but was restarted on Simvastatin when LFTs improved.
Chronic back and left hip pain:  History of sciatica and spinal stenosis.
Please follow-up pt's Hct and platelets, and workup causes of anemia and thrombocytopenia if indicated.
***Please recheck blood pressure and consider re-starting valsartan for pt's heart failure.
