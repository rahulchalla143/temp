CT Abd CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Focal consolidation at the left lung base is unchanged, and likely represents atelectasis.
There is no pleural effusion.
There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
The abdominal aorta demonstrates mild atherosclerotic calcification.
Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
No contrast-filled enterocutaneous fistula is identified.
A small focus of air within the deep subcutaneous/muscular layers adjacent to the ileostomy site is noted, decreased since the prior study.
There is no associated fluid collection to suggest abscess.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy by size criteria.
There is no fracture or worrisome bony lesion.
No evidence of enterocutaneous fistula at this time.
No associated fluid collection to suggest abscess.

# Ostomy wound and skin breakdown - patient was evaluated in the ED with a CT scan showing flow through the ostomy without any entero-cutaneous fistulas.
Surgery evaluated her in the ED and does not think there is a fistula as the wound adjacent to the ostomy was probed and could not be passed.
She continued to have pain around her wound throughout her admission and was treated with dilaudid PO which controlled the pain to an acceptable level.
The wound did not appear infected.
# Nausea and vomitting - the two days prior to discharge, the patient developed some nausea and vomitting.
She had the same level of abdominal pain that she had upon admission, and was tolerating POs and having appropriate output through her colostomy.
Surgery was following along and did serial exams that were not concerning for an acute abdomen.
She can continue to be treated wtih antiemetics as needed as long as she has appropriate stool output and vomit remains non bilious and non bloody.
# UTI - had positive UA but culture grew yeast and was likely a contaminant.
# DM - patient takes metformin at home, sugars have been well controlled, was d/c'ed on lantus previously.
# Neuropathy - patient with severe peripheral bilateral neuropathy today.
At home takes celebrex and dilaudid for pain medicines.
Held celebrex for CKD and added gabapentin for neuropathy.
Per patient, gabapentin helped pain improve.
# CKD - seems to be at baseline, but creatinine has been variable past few months.
# COPD - stable, did fine on room air .
# OSA - stable, do not know CPAP settings .
# Depression - was tearful and obviously depressed throughout hospitalization, she was on venlafaxine per old disharge summaries, but she does think she's taking it anymore.
MICU Course ([**Date range (1) **]) Transferred to ICU after failure to extubate.
Thought to be [**2-11**] hypoventilation in the setting of narcotics for post-op pain and baseline disease (COPD, obesity hypoventilation).
An NGT was placed secondary to N/V and decreased ostomy output.
Here G-tube was than removed, however it was noted that there was output from the g-tube site and a CT scan was done.
Staples were removed from her incision and packed with w-d dressing [**Hospital1 **].
