Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old woman with multiple medical problems including severe AS (valve area 0.8-1.0 cm2 in [**12-19**]), AF on coumadin, COPD, and diastolic CHF who was admitted from cardiology clinic today with progressive shortness of breath.
She has remained  afebrile, lung exam non-focal, with only a slight clinical productive cough.
Vancomycin and Cefepime was renally dosed and in the absence of signs of significant infection and with a downtrending WBC count, she was changed to oral cefpodoxime and levofloxacin on [**2148-8-7**] to complete an 8 day course of antibiotics.
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation- Patient has known history of diastolic CHF with EF of 60% on echo in [**Month (only) **] [**2147**].
On admission, patient's exam was significant for several clinical indices of cardiac failure with blateral crackles on auscultation, elevated JVP and LE edema.
She was initialy diuresed with IV furosemide and then a furosemide infusion and her volume status improved.
Echo showed hyperdynamic systolic function w/ EF 75% and severe AS (valve area 0.8 cm2).
She underwent cardiac catheterization which showed moderately severe diastolic dysfunction, clean coronaries and severe AS (valve area 0.61 cm2).
She became hypotensive and oliguric and required transfer to the CCU (see below).
She then showed signs of volume overload with worsening dyspnea and required gentle diuresis with lasix.
Hypotension- Patient became hypotensive and oliguric with lasix diuresis and was transferred to the CCU.
CXR was concerning for pneumonia.
She also received stress dose steroids as there was some thought that she might have adrenal insufficiency with her chronic steroids.
Aortic stenosis- Patient has a known history of severe AS on echo in [**2147-12-12**] with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2 and was admitted from clinic with concern that this has worsened in the 6 months given her decline in functional status and severe shortness of breath.
Echo showed stable to slight worsening of AS w/ valve area of 0.8 cm2, but increased gradient (61 mmHg, previously 44 in [**Month (only) **]).
The procedure was without complications.
Atrial fibrillation- Patient has a known history of AF, and remained in AF with rate in the 70s to 80s on telemetry for most of her hospitalization.
During hospitalization, coumadin was held and she was kept on heparin in anticipation of her cardiac catheterization.
COPD- Patient has a history of COPD and has been on 3L home oxygen and standing advair and spiriva since [**Month (only) 956**].
She has a chronic cough productive of white phlegm and is dyspnic with any exertion.
Patient is not wheezing but had generally poor air entry on examination.
Chest tightness- Patient reports has history of chest tightness at home, at rest, usually while sleeping, lasting a couple of minutes and usually relieved with deep breathing.
Had a brief episode on [**8-5**], with no new ECG changes and negative cardiac enzymes and was felt to be non-cardiac and potentially anxiety-related.
Left calf pain- Patient complained of new posterior left calf pain on palpation on [**7-30**].
She remained  afebrile, with a non-focal lung exam, with only a slight clinical productive cough.
CXR was concerning for a possible RLL pneumonia or atelectasis, she was commenced on IV cefepime and vancomycin on [**8-3**] as per the HAP policy.
She remained afebrile and antibiotics were changed to oral levofloxacin and cefpodoxime on [**8-7**] to complete an 8 day course.
Vancomycin was dropped as MRSA pneumonia was believed unlikely in the setting of her clinical presentation.
UA, UCx and legionalla UAg were negative and blood cultures showed no growth.
RA/SLE- chronic issue.
Continued on her home prednisone 10 mg daily with 2 days of stress dose IV methylprednisolone and was changed back to her home regimen on resolution of her hypotension.
Osteoporosis- No active issues.
Neuropathic pain- No active issues.
Shoulder pain- Patient complained of some left shoulder pain while in the CCU.
There was no point tenderness on examination and motion was intact.
Shoulder films should no fractures or dislocations.
Patient had some relief of symptoms with daily lidocaine patches.
