Admission Date:  [**2199-5-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2199-5-15**]   Service:  MICU  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL COURSE PRIOR TO MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT TRANSFER ON [**2199-5-3**]:  Mr. [**Known lastname 39162**] is an 84-year-old male with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, status post DDD pacer, hypertension, hypolipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, who was admitted initially on [**2199-4-4**] after an MVC complicated by hypovolemic shock secondary to hemoperitoneum.
The patient had a subsequent laparotomy with repair by mesenteric lead and cecal serosal tear.
The patient had a difficult weaning from the ventilator secondary to volume overload, and thick secretions.
The patient's C spine was unable to be cleared clinically by plain radiograph and CT scan of the cervical spine secondary to this mental status.
A Neurology Consult was obtained on [**4-30**] for delirium which was thought to be secondary to hypoxia and hypercarbia from obstructive sleep apnea which was complicated by possible palatal weakness from an old posterior circulation CVA.
There is felt to be a possible contribution from a possible shear injury status post CMCD.
The patient's antibiotics were changed from levofloxacin to Flagyl to Zosyn on [**4-30**] for aspiration pneumonitis.
A plain tracheostomy was intended for [**2199-4-2**], however, while on the medical floor, the patient experienced a hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring emergent intubation.
Respiratory failure:  The patient's original intubation on [**5-3**] was likely related to upper airway obstruction from obstruction sleep apnea, possibly secondary to palatal weakness from central lesion concomitant with copious thick secretions that he was unable to clear out.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient finished a course of Zosyn for a presumed aspiration pneumonia.
He continued with >........<level of care secondary to copious secretions which were noted to be thick, white, frothy secretions.
The patient's chest x-ray on [**5-3**] was consistent with mild congestive heart failure, however, subsequent to chest x-ray's on [**5-4**], [**5-6**], and [**5-8**], demonstrated no significant pulmonary vascular engorgement and clear pulmonary parenchyma.
There were small bilateral pleural effusions present in these x-ray's however.
The patient's respiratory failure was felt secondary to his obstructive sleep apnea and recommended that the patient undergo a polysomnogram in the future to be evaluated for CPAP during the evenings.
The underlying etiology was unclear, although, was felt to be secondary to a toxic metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with a possible component of injury to the brain sustained in the MVC.
The patient's mental status improved such that we were able to remove the C spine collar ([**Location (un) 2848**] J) that had been placed upon admission on [**4-4**], plain radiographs of his C spine were obtained on [**4-4**] with CT scan of his C spine on [**4-5**] were negative.
His acute renal failure was felt to be secondary to over-diuresis and prerenal azotemia.
Mr. [**Known lastname 39162**] will require repeat blood counts as an outpatient to ensure that his anemia is resolving.
Atrial fibrillation/Congestive heart failure: The patient is status post DDD pacer for atrial fibrillation and was maintained on amiodarone for rhythm control.
Electrocardiograms demonstrated other AV pacing or sinus rhythm.
The patient was in mild heart failure on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
>........<was withheld secondary to renal failure, and the patient's congestive heart failure improved significantly with positive pressure while on the ventilator.
The patient's etiology of congestive heart failure was felt to be diastolic dysfunction as >........<70%.
We recommend a repeat evaluation as his mental status continues to improve and the C spine collar has been removed.
The patient was maintained on >........<scale which required titration secondary to elevated blood glucoses in the 110 to low 200 range.
Recommend patient to have a polysomnogram to evaluate for positive pressure during sweep.
Altered mental status.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
Acute blood loss anemia.
Likely diabetes mellitus versa insulin resistance.
