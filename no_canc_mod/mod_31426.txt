Admission Date: [**2145-7-14**]        Discharge Date: [**2145-9-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-3-20**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old man with a history of right-sided congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45 percent, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension and cardiomyopathy, who presented with progressive shortness of breath, abdominal distention, increasing cough with intermittent fevers up to 100.2.
The patient states that his dyspnea has been getting worse over the past two to three weeks and he became increasingly concerned when he noticed abdominal swelling.
The patient has been complaining of shaking chills and fever times two days.
The patient had a recent [**Hospital1 69**] admission for hypotension and congestive heart failure in [**2144-12-20**].
Right-sided congestive heart failure.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Atrial fibrillation and flutter.
Mild cirrhotic changes of the liver.
Chronic hepatic congestion.
History of rectal bleeding.
Obstructive sleep apnea on continuous positive airway pressure at home.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - Jugular venous distention to ten centimeters.
Respiratory - Bibasilar crackles, right greater than left.
Cardiovascular - II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the apex.
The abdomen is soft, no costovertebral angle tenderness.
He was worked up for congestive heart failure, probable left lower lobe pneumonia, anemia, and chronic renal insufficiency.
Initial workup included echocardiogram as well as heart failure consult.
Over the next several weeks, the patient was followed closely by the medicine service as well as the heart failure service.
Ultimately the patient went for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging that showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with preserved left ventricular function and increased left ventricular size.
Echocardiogram done shortly after admission showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent with a left atrium that is mildly dilated, right ventricle that was markedly dilated with severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, two plus mitral regurgitation and four plus tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and, on [**2145-7-27**], he underwent cardiac catheterization that showed severe pulmonary arterial hypertension unresponsive to nitrate and clean coronaries following which cardiothoracic surgery was consulted.
The patient was felt to be have multiple medical problems and continued to be followed by the medical and cardiology service while optimizing his medical condition.
On postoperative day three, the patient returned to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at which time a permanent pacemaker was implanted due to the patient's bradycardic episodes during his preoperative course.
His chest x-ray showed worsening congestive heart failure.
Additionally, the patient began to complain that he felt like he had a kidney stone with lower abdominal pain.
He became increasingly acidotic and his white blood cell count went to 27.4.
Abdominal ultrasound showed dilated gallbladder and the patient was brought to the operating room for an open cholecystectomy.
A bronchoscopy done after the tracheostomy showed bright red blood within the trachea and the patient was brought to the operating room where they found bleeding from the thyroid isthmus.
The bleeding was controlled and the patient returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit following the exploration.
Over the next week, attempts were made to wean the patient from his full ventilation with limited success and screening process was begun to place the patient in a pulmonary rehabilitation center.
On postoperative day twenty-nine, the patient was noted to have some rectal bleeding.
Gastroenterology service was consulted and they felt that he had radiation proctitis.
The bleeding resolved and on the following day the patient was restarted on Heparin and Coumadin.
Neurologic - Alert, responsive, in no acute distress.
Pulmonary - Coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Atrial fibrillation.
Status post atrial septal defect repair.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
