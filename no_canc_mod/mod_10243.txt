Sinus rhythm.
Low amplitude P waves with slight P-R interval prolongation of about 220 milliseconds.
Slow R wave progression in leads V1-V2 which is non-diagnostic.
Cannot exclude underlying anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2144-12-30**] no diagnostic change.
Sloughing in the whole esophagus compatible with ischemic injury to esophagus.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: ICU course 85M with hx of CAD, CVA, PTC x2 for recurrent cholecystitis and ERCP for suspected cholangitis, now presenting with GI bleed.
# GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: Patient has had maroon/dark stools and symptoms of orthostasis in setting of acute hemtocrit drop.
NG lavage was mildly positive + [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely a upper GI source.
Pt then underwent EGD on [**2145-2-10**] which revealed hiatal hernia, antral gastritis, and ischemic damage to esophageal mucosa with sloughing.
He was then transitioned to po PPI and did fine throughout his hospital stay without any further evidence of bleeding.
# Acute renal failure: Acute rise to 1.4 from a baseline of 0.9 to 1.0.
The patient had previously considered a poor surgical candidate due to multiple comorbidities.

No evidence of an acute exacerbation on this admission.
CXR if worsening oxygenation or increased respiratory symptoms.
