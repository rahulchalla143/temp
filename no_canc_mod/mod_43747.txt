CXR: Right lung airspace opacity most consistent with pneumonia, with possible developing left perihilar airspace opacity, and mild superimposed congestive heart failure.

However, she improved rapidly with blood pressure control and mild diuresis, and gives no history of fever, cough or sputum production.
The clinical scenario makes me lean towards flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive emergency, with acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation.
An ace inhibitor was started, as she had not been on one previously, in the setting of heart failure with decreased EF.
Additionally, given the possibility of atypical pneumonia causing/contributing to her presentation, she will finish a 5 day course of ciprofloxacin.
Vancomycin and flagyl were discontinued shortly after transfer out of the ICU, and she remained afebrile with stable/normal WBC.
# HTN -- see above, blood pressure well controlled on discharge.
Was on nitro gtt on admit, weaned to home medications without difficulty.
# Restless leg syndrome: continued on Ropinirole .
# Depression: continued on mirtazipine .
