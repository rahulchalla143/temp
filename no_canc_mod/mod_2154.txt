At the outside hospital, x-ray showed the fracture and her initial CK value was 2,866 with an index of 4, troponin of 1.15.
She was initially admitted to a medicine team for fluid rehydration and treatment of her azotemia prior to going for a right hip replacement.
Shortly after being admitted to the Medicine Floor, her 02 saturation was approximately 68% on 3 liters of nasal cannula and she showed increasingly labored breathing.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi.
Extremities:  The patient had extreme pain in her right hip and was unable to move it in any direction.
She had no edema, cyanosis, clubbing, but did, however, have some chronic venostasis change in the lower extremities.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  This is an 83-year-old female with a history of restrictive lung disease.
She was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and further management of her rhabdomyolysis.
PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated due to her respiratory distress.
Following extubation, after several discussions with the family, it was determined that if the patient were to develop further respiratory distress that she would not be reintubated and that she would be made comfortable.
Unfortunately, shortly after being extubated on [**2111-11-6**], the patient appeared to develop some labored breathing and was unable to maintain good oxygenation with a BIPAP machine.
CARDIAC:  The patient had some nonsustained venous tachycardia.
She did have several episodes of hypotension for which she required Neo.
