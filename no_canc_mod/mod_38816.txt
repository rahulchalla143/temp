He was treated in the OSH ED with epinephrine, solumedrol, and benadryl with no effect, and subsequently was intubated for worsening respiratory distress.
Upon arrival to the ED here he had CT scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and c-spine which revealed extensive pneumomediastinum, right sided pneumothorax, a smaller left-sided pneumothorax, and extensive subcutaneous emphysema.
Past Medical History: Hypertension  Social History: possible alcohol abuse  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On admission: Intubated and sedated Vitals: BP: 123/80 HR 102 Intubated CMV 60% /5  : ABG pH 7.32 pCO2 42 pO2 56 HCO3 23 GEN: Sedated HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Bilateral subcutaneus emphysema.
Decreased blt respiratory sounds ABD: Soft, nondistended, nontender, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses Ext: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused  Physical examination upon discharge:  [**2154-1-9**]:  Vital signs:  t=96, bp=90/54, hr=81, resp.
left hand cool no calf tendeness, no pedal edema bil NEURO:  alert and oriented x 3, speech garbled, no tremors SKIN:  Crepitus clavicles bil., uppper ant.
No intracranial air.
No acute intracranial injury.
Multiple right-sided rib fractures with bilateral small pneumothoraces, extensive pneumomediastinum and tracking of subcutaneous air along the body wall.
Severe pulmonary emphysema with biapical scarring.
No solid organ injury in the abdomen or pelvis.
Extensive atherosclerosis with abdominal aortic aneurysm to 3.3 cm.
No acute fracture or malalignment.
[**2154-1-5**]:  chest x-ray:  FINDINGS: Again seen is severe bilateral subcutaneous emphysema which limits the assessment for small pneumothorax.
There is a right-sided chest tube.
There is mild mediastinal shift to the right.
A small left basilar pneumothorax is visualized and probable right medial pneumothorax.
[**2154-1-7**]:  chest x-ray:  Severe widespread subcutaneous emphysema throughout the chest wall and neck, and severe pneumomediastinum are unchanged over the past several days.
No definite pneumothorax, right pleural tube in place.
Bibasilar atelectasis or aspiration changes, unchanged since [**1-5**] at 12:29 a.m. Heart size is normal  [**2154-1-7**]:  chest x-ray:  There is no large right pneumothorax or appreciable pleural fluid collection following removal of the right pleural tube, although a small amount of pleural air would be difficult to detect in the setting of persistent severe subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum.
Left basal atelectasis has cleared.
There is probably a small to moderate left pneumothorax, which has remained stable since the earliest chest radiographs here on [**1-4**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 5579**] arrived to [**Hospital1 18**], s/p fall and developed sudden onset of right sided facial swelling.
He was intubated for increasing respiratory distress.
Imaging showed right rib fractures and bilateral pneumothorax.
NEURO: He received acetaminophen and oxycodone with good effect and adequate pain control.
His chest tube showed a small air leak the first day it was placed, but no residual pneumothorax was seen on CXR.
Repeat chest x-ray on [**1-8**] showed no pneumothorax but increased subcutaneous air in upper chest.
He was hyponatremic on arrival, which improved readily after several liters of NS followed by 1/2 NS.
He is afebrile and his blood pressure is borderline.
He is able to ambulate without dizziness or shortness of breath.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: All Care VNA of Greater [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Trauma:  fall  Blt Pneumo R > L / pneumomediastinum R Rib fx [**8-14**] / 10 is displaced.
You were also found to have a collapsed lung and rib fractures.
You are now preparing for discharge home with the following instructions:    Your injury caused rigth sided [**8-14**] rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs ( crepitus ).
