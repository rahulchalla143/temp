CT head ([**2136-6-26**]): No acute hemorrhage or CT evidence of an acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Moderate chronic small vessel disease in the supratentorial white matter.
CT head ([**2136-6-26**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No interval change.
In the visualized lung parenchyma, no evidence of pneumonia is seen.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
CT head ([**2136-6-27**]): No acute hemorrhage.
No evidence of a developing major vascular territorial infarction.
CT head: ([**2136-6-28**]): No significant change.
No hemorrhage or edema.
Brief Hospital Course: NEURO: L MCA stroke  [**Known firstname 4580**] [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year-old right handed man with atrial fibrillation (not on Coumadin) who was noted by his daughter to have significant word-finding deficits around 10:30 pm.
His exam was notable for a now global aphasia, with a right facial droop and minor amount of weakness in the right arm and leg.
The patient developed epistaxis post-tPA that required packing by ENT, but this did not recur and HCT was stable.
Review of head CT at 24 hours revealed left MCA corona radiata infarct, consistent with a cardioembolic source.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left atrium size, normal global systolic function, and no thrombus.
Telemetry revealed atrial fibrillation with normal rate.
After 1 day in the neuro ICU and no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage, he was transferred to the neurology floor.
There, his physical exam was notable for continued nonfluent dysarthric speech and right-sided weakness; in particular, there was a right facial droop and mild right upper and lower extremity weakness (motor strength 4-5 out of 5).
A repeat physical exam revealed that he had increased dysarthria, increased right facial droop, and noticeably worsened right-sided strength (motor strength 0-1 out of 5).
A repeat head CT did not show any significant change from before.
A head MRI showed multiple tiny foci of acute ischemia within the left MCA territory, consistent with the patient's presumed cardioembolic stroke, but no new areas of infarction.
An EEG showed general left-sided slowing without evidence of ongoing seizures.
Given the transient nature of his sudden decline in strength, the absence of other associated symptoms, and no evidence of new infarct or hemorrhage on imaging, his sudden right-sided weakness and dysarthria were attributed to a seizure.
As the patient refused anticoagulation with Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation and had evidence of renal insufficiency, he was started on low dose (75 mg) Dabigatran.
At discharge, the patient's physical exam was notable for mild dysarthria, right facial droop, mild right upper and lower extremity weakness (motor strength 4-5 out of 5).
He was started on  Dabigatran 75mg [**Hospital1 **] (which is low dose), as he refused Coumadin and had evidence of renal insufficiency.
UTI: Patient had a positive UA at admission, but the urine culture was contaminated.
He was started on ciprofloxacin but was switched to Bactrim, as there was a concern for post-stroke seizure and because ciprofloxacin may lower the seizure threshold.
Medications on Admission: Atrial Fibrillation (diagnosed years ago) - not on coumadin against the advise of his physicians MI (w/ multiple cardiac stents) - stopped Plavix for bleeding ulcer Bladder Cancer - s/p bladder surgery w/ chronic indwelling foley and stoma; frequent UTIs Colon cancer - diagnosed years ago on colonoscopy, has not wanted chemo Cholecystectomy  Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain, fever.
Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1694**] and ask for Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] if patient's GFR > 35 to ask about uptitrating dabigatran dose.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: left middle cerebral artery stroke   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Has mild right hemiparesis ([**4-24**] in UE and IP and 5-/5 hamstring)   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital after being found by your daughter fumbling with a lamp and having difficulty with language.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], your speech defecits worsened and after a conversation with your daughter, you received IV tPA for a suspected left middle cerebral artery stroke.
