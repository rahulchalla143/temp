The family and staff describe his seizures as "drop attacks", but also describe tonic stiffening and a ubiquitous ictal cry.
Note this contrast with recent notes, which describe his seizures as previously having a tonic component but are now marked by inattention and falls.
This suggests that his seizures are tonic or myotonic and not atonic/astatic, which are the seizure type more commonly described as "drop attacks".
If he is directed to sit during this phase he has no falls.
His seizure frequency for the past several years has been stable at 25-30 per month, each lasting 5-10 seconds.
He has been trialed on many anti-seizure meds in the past with poor success.
