Pt  reportedly developed pupillary assymetry with dimished reactivity and decerebrate posturing thus was intubated, administered 25g IV mannitol and PHT load, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
On arrival to ED, patient still with intermittent decerebrate posturing and pupillary assymetry.

Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage as described.
No focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage identified.
Diffuse brain swelling as evidenced by obliteration of the sulci.
The basilar artery and its branches including both posterior cerebral arteries and SCA and AICA are seen with no evidence of any aneurysms.
There was no reflux into the right vertebral artery, however, we had information from the CT angiogram that we decided not to study, the right vertebral artery.
Left common carotid artery arteriogram shows normal bifurcation.
The left internal carotid artery fills well along its cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid portion.
The anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery are seen normally with no evidence of aneurysms or arteriovenous malformation.
Right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring approximately 7 x 5 mm with what appears to be a daughter sac which seems to be at the fundus of the aneurysm.
The right internal carotid artery fills well along its cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid portion.
No stenosis seen.
The anterior communicating segment is also seen with no evidence of aneurysms at this location.
Post-coiling right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows near complete obliteration of the aneurysm with a small residual filling of the aneurysm at the neck of the aneurysm.
No significant vasospasm is identified on this study, which signifies interval resolution of the vasospasm.
There is hazy opacity at the right base suggestive of a small layering effusion and associated atelectasis.
There is minimal atelectasis at the left base.
Heart size is mildly enlarged.
No CHF is identified.
No new infiltrate is detected.
Given extent of SAH and declining neurological status, EVD placed in ED without complication.
Pt found to have right p-comm aneurysm thus taken to angiography suit  for aneurysm coiling.
Pt tolerated procedure well with no complications (please see dictated op note for full details).
On POD#2 pt developed hyponatremia to Na=129, this was likely from cerebral salt wasting and pt was treated with normal saline IVF.
On [**2-29**], she became less responsive and was allowed to have the BP rise.
She also had another angiogram done today that showed some vasospasm.
[**3-3**], angiogram was again repeated showing no new spasm.
On [**3-4**], a RLE ultrasound showed a pseudoaneurysm off the right CFA, which was treated on [**3-7**] with an ultrasound guided thrombin injection.
She also had an increase in her WBC and a urinalysis was performed and she was determined to have a UTI.
She completed a course of Diflucan for vaginal candidiasis.
I suspect whe will tolerate and pass a speech and swallow eval as well as may be able to have her trach decanulated.
