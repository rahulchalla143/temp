He was noted to have a Hct of 24 on admission and received 1 unit PRBC with minimal change in hematocrit, but was guaiac negative.
Summary of hospital course: 1) Atrial flutter: While in the MICU, the patient had hypotension in the setting of atrial flutter in the 150s, after which he converted to normal sinus rhythm following amiodarone drip.
Following transfer to the floor, he had several episodes of atrial flutter in the 140s, converting following IV metoprolol/dilitazem.
His metoprolol was titrated up gradually to 50 mg PO BID, amiodarone was continued, and, at time of discharge, the patient had been in paced rhythm (60s) without atrial flutter for >72 hours.
Thyroid function tests revealed an elevated TSH at 6.3, however but free T4 was within normal limits at 1.2; recheck as an outpatient in 6 wks.
The patient's abdominal exam was closely monitored throughout his hospital course, and he had several KUBs (last [**6-26**]) without evidence of megacolon.
Hypotension: The hypotension noted on admission was likely multifactorial due to C. diff-associated sepsis and cardiogenic shock from atrial flutter.
He has a history of GI bleed, but, while he had several trace guaiac positive stools during his admission, there was no evidence of significance GI bleeding.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 2.1 on admission, improving to ~ 1 on discharge.
His renal failure was likely due to hypovolemia with pre-renal azotemia, with possible contributor of ATN in the setting of diarrhea and hypotension.
Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelets dropped to 119 on [**2188-6-25**], likely due to a combination of dilutional effect (in the setting of fluid resuscitation) and sepsis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Street Address(1) 19427**] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Clostridium difficile colitis Secondary: Sepsis, Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rate, Acute renal failure, Anemia of chronic disease, Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Take all medications as prescribed.
Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have any chest pain, difficulty breathing, persistent rapid heart rate or palpitations, worsening diarrhea, abdominal pain, worsening abdominal distention, lack of any bowel movements, or any other concerning symptoms.
