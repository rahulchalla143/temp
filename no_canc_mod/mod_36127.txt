He is s/p cardiac cath at the OSH with 2 stents placed to his STEMI, and resolution of ST elevation and chest pain upon revascularization.
He experienced intermittent runs of VT en route to [**Hospital1 18**] and had evidence of cardiogenic shock upon arrival.
TTE revealed depressed EF and apical akinesis.
He was started on heparin gtt for the indication of apical akinesis and low EF.
TTE on [**6-20**] showed improved EF of 45% and residual apical akinesis.
The decision was made to monitor the patient without treatment as he was hemodynamically stable and VT can be expected within 48 hours of MI--AIVR vs. NSVT.
3) ARF: On admission, the patient had an elevated creatinine of 1.5, likely secondary to hypoperfusion, with possible contribution from the dye load received in cardiac catheterization.
