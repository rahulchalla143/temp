She has felt "odd" for approximately 1-2 weeks, noting mild diaphoresis during day, "it might be my sugars..."  In ER FBS 53 mg%, noted to be tranisently hypoxic with SpO2=76%.
Past Medical History: PMH: Esophageal cancer dx [**2138**] (T2N0) supraglottic, treated with surgical resection and external beam radiation therapy.
No chemotherapy was advised given risks of toxicity and comorbid conditions.
PEG tube placed [**11-28**], replaced [**12-30**] for nutritional support Morbid obesity, unable to ambulate without wheelchair Hepatitis C History of IVDA (heroin).

Endo -49 year old female with esophageal cancer s/p resection and radiation therapy admitted with hypoglycemia secondary to poor po intake.
Pt had elevated BS in setting of high dose steroids, but normalized after discontinuation of steroids and didn't require sliding scale insulin.
Epiglottitis/Supraglottitis: A few days into hospital course, pt was noted to be strigorous and short of breath, while maintaining O2 sats of mid 90s.
ABG was performed which showed acute respiratory acidosis secondary to CO2 retention (7.26/78/73).
Pt was transferred to the unit for close respiratory monitoring.
She was started on high dose steroids and IV unasyn with significant decrease in supraglottis on serial scopes.
At this visit, the patient took a sip of water and demonstrated aspiration, likely with abnormal swallowing secondary to pain and surgical procedure / radiation.
