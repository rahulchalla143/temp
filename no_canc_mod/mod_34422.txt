Admission Date:  [**2121-9-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-9-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-8-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**] Chief Complaint: dysphagia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Esophagoduodenoscopy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 83259**] is a 32 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for esophageal obstruction complicated by perforation admitted for esophageal food bolus obstruction.
The patient reports that he was eating chicken around 1 pm on [**2121-9-24**], at which point he complained of discomfort in his mid-esophagus after failed swallowing of chicken.
He states that he chewed the chicken and that there were no bones present.
Since the obstruction, he reports continuous pain in his mid-esophagus and an inability to swallow his secretions or anything else.
Since then, he endorses having intermitent episodes of food or pill obstruction at the same site lasting less than 10 seconds that resolve with repeated swallowing or with water.
On arrival to the ICU he continued to complain of some pain in his throat.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, 2 hours after the EGD, the patient complained of chest pain followed by vomitting food mixed with bright blood around 100cc.
The following morning the patient spiked a 101 fever, and developed a leukocytosis.
Thoracic surgery was then consulted to assess for esophageal perforation.
A thin barium swallow was done which showed no leak or strictures.
Since negative, a CT scan was performed which showed no evidence of extravasation of contrast material from the esophagus.
Ground glass opacities were found in lingula that were consistent with infection/aspiration which correlated with the chest x-ray showing possible left lower lobe consolidation.
The patient was then started on Unasyn to treat possible aspiration pneumonia.
Past Medical History: Esophageal obstruction from food bolus complicated by perforation Seasonal allergies   Social History: Married, lives with wife and two children.
No crepitus noted.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
STUDIES: EGD [**2121-9-25**] IMPRESSION:food impaction in his low third of esophagus, and multiple rings were found in the whole esophagus, which is compatible with eosinophilic esophagitis.
CXR [**2121-9-25**] IMPRESSION: No pneumomediastinum.
Possible developing consolidation at the left base.
Barium Swallow [**2121-9-25**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of leaks or strictures within the esophagus with contrast flowing into the stomach.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2121-9-25**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
No evidence of extravasation of contrast material from the esophagus.
Ground-glass opacities and consolidations in lingula that are consistent with infection/aspiration, appears to be similar to the chest radiograph was obtained the same day earlier on 11:49 a.m.   Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 83259**] is a 32 year old male with PMH significant for esophageal obstruction complicated by perforation admitted for food bolus obstruction.
#Esophageal Obstruction: In ICU, pt had EGD performed and food was found to be impacted in the lower third of the esophagus and multiple rings found in the whole esophagus, consistent with eosinophilic esophagitis.
Two hours after the procedure, the pt started complaining of chest pain followed by vomiting food mixed with approximately 100cc of bright blood.
The patient spiked a 101 fever and an elevated WBC.
Thoracic surgery was consulted to assess for esophageal perforation.
A thin barrium swallow was done and showed no evidence of any leaks or strictures.
Since negative, a CT scan was performed which showed no evidence of extravasation of the contrast material from the esophagus.
Once tolerated po, the patient was discharged home on protonix [**Hospital1 **] with a follow up appointment with GI for a repeat EGD for biopsy to confirm eosinophilic esophagitis.
#Aspiration pneumonia: On CT scan ground glass opacities were found in the lingula that were consistent with aspiration/infection which correlated to possible left lower lung consolidation on chest x-ray.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was afebrile with VSS and normalization of the WBC.
Disp:*14 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Esophageal food obstruction Secondary - Aspiration pneumonia  Discharge Condition: Patient was discharged in stable condition.
You were admitted for a obstruction of food in your esophagus.
