Prevertebral soft tissue stranding along the anterior margin of the lower cervical/upper thoracic spine vertebral bodies, with concern of small fluid collection at the lower cervical spine in the soft tissue anterior to the vertebral body.
Similar findings compared to recent MR from an outside hospital, concerning for extensive prevertebral phlegmon extending towards the mediastinum.
Multiple nonspecific ground-glass opacities in the lungs, and dependent atelectasis, nonspecific finding.
No extra- or intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
[**2118-8-21**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia.
No previous tracing available for comparison .
[**2118-8-21**] RLE U/S: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, athough the anterior leaflet tip is thickened, concern for vegetation.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Cannot adequately assess for endocarditis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
[**2118-8-24**] Video Oropharyngeal Swallow: Minimal aspiration on thin barium which the patient was able to clear.
In the visualized aspect of the cervical esophagus, there is no evidence of perforation or leak.
Marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling as noted on prior studies.
Small fluid attenuation collection in the superior aspect of the left posterior mediastinum at the level of T1-T2 now appears more organized.
Reduction in size of retropharyngealparaspinal abscess with new screw fixation of C6 and C7, better evaultaed with MRI.
Multiple right upper lobe ground-glass opacities which have increased in number and size and may represent multifocal pneumonia but the possible presence of cavitation in the lower lobes raises the possibility of septic emboli, and in light of persistent leukocytosis warrants further evaluation with echocardiography.
New bilateral small pleural effusions.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or mediastinal widening is present.
[**2118-9-1**] MR C/T Spine: Post-surgical changes from level C5 through T1, with prevertebral soft tissue swelling along cervical spine, and anterior dural enhancement from C5 through T1 with no definite evidence of epidural abscess.
Persistent small fluid collections in the prevertebral muscles bilaterally, however, decreased in size.
Normal signal in the cord, with no evidence of cord compression.
Interval decrease in size of mediastinal/left paraspinal collection, now measuring up to 15 x 10 mm, without a definite fluid component.
No new abscess or collection in the mediastinum.
Near complete resolution of multifocal ground-glass opacities in the lungs, without evidence of persistent or recurrent infection.
[**2118-9-2**] LUE U/S: Extensive thrombus about the PICC involving the left basilic, axillary as well as the subclavian vein (deep venous thrombosis).
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
Thrombus noted within the right cephalic vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 year-old M with no significant PMHx who presented to an outside hospital with posterior neck and shoulder pain, was found to have prevertebral and ventral epidural abscesses of the C-spine and transferred here for management .
# Prevertebral/Epidural abscesses: The patient was found to have ventral epidural, prevertebral, and bilateral longus coli abscesses.
ENT was consulted for possible aspiration of the collection, but were unable to based on location.
However, after the patient began to spike fevers and exhibit signs of sepsis, as well as left upper extremity weakness on extension, he was taken to the OR by Neurosurgery for evacuation of the abscesses.
He continued to spike fevers and remained tachycardic.
Thoracic Surgery was consulted out of concern for mediastinal involvement.
Additional imaging revealed continued/recurrent spinal prevertebral and epidural abscesses.
He underwent a second surgical procedure by Neurosurgery in which he had re-evacuation of the abscesses, removal of the prior hardware, full corpectomy of C6/C7 with adjacent diskectomy C5-C6 and C7-T1, microscopic evacuation of epidural abscess, and placement of a Globus cage and anterior plating.
The procedure went well without complications and he recovered nicely.
Additional imaging revealed no evidence of cord compression and decreased size of longus coli abscesses.
He underwent a number of antibiotic changes throughout his hospital course, but importantly, nafcillin was discontinued secondary to a drug rash.
# Left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis: The patient was found to have swelling of his distal left upper extremity and ultrasound revealed venous thromboses of the left basilic, axillary, and subclavian vein.
# Transaminitis: The patient presented with elevated transaminases, and elevated direct hyperbilirubinemia.
He never had abdominal pain or became hypotensive.
A RUQ ultrasound and CT of the abdomen did not reveal any dilation of the intra/extra hepatic biliary ducts, gallbladder pathology, or abscess collections.
# Microcytic Anemia: likely chronic, stable throughout the admission.
Very low MCV and Fe studies consistent with thalassemia.
Imaging studies also commented on appearance of chronic anemia.
Patient had no chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea.
# Dysphagia: The patient experienced dysphagia on presentation and after his surgical procedures.
He never experienced any respiratory distress.
Speech was consulted and the patient had a video swallowing study, which showed laryngeal penetration of thin and nectar thick liquids but no aspiration.
# Voice Hoarseness: Following the second surgical procedure the patient had evidence of voice hoarsenss, which slowly improved.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Methicillin-sensitive Staph Aureus Bacteremia Epidural and prevertebral cervical abscesses status-post surgical evacuation Full corpectomy of C6/C7 and diskectomy of C5-C6, C7-T1 with hardware placement for stabilization   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were recently transferred to [**Hospital1 1170**] for management of an abscess (collection of infection) near your spine.
You were also found to have bacteria in your blood.
We then started you on another blood thinner, Coumadin, which you will continue to take for 3 month to treat the blood clots.
- Flexaril (cyclobenzaprine) was STARTED, to be taken as needed for muscle pain - Oxycodone was STARTED at 5-10 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain .
