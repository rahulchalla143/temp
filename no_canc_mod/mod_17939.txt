Admission Date:  [**2119-2-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-2-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**] Chief Complaint: admission for monitoring in the setting of a new PE and recent left fronto-parietal SDH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC Filter Placement   History of Present Illness: 82M w/ MMP including a PE about one year ago and recent SDH who presents today with a HA and found to have a PE.
Head CT done here showed that the hematoma was resolving.
A CT-A was obtained and showed a R lower lobe segmental PE.
The patient had an IVC filter placed.
He was seen by neurosurg who felt that it was safe to anti-coag him w/ a conservative heparin scale.
On his last admission the patient's fall was thought to be secondary to his central demyelinating disorder.

There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
There are opacities along the anterior thoracic spine which are similar and again consistent with large osteophytes.
There is also calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for progression of SDH  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 year old man with hx of subdural now w/worsening headache and ?
new blood on outside CT head REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for progression of SDH CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 82-year-old man with history of subdural, now with worsening headache and question of new blood on outside CT.
Evaluate for progression of subdural hemorrhage.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: Again seen is a small left-sided subdural hematoma layering over the left temporoparietal convexity.
The density is now mostly isointense to [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, however, there is a more focal area of hypoattenuation that suggests more acute re-hemorrhage.
Again seen is mild mass effect on the subjacent gyri and lateral ventricle.
There is no hydrocephalus.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2119-2-10**] 7:44 PM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-  Reason: h/o PE now w/ hypoxia evaluate for PE Field of view: 38 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 year old man with Dm, s/p pacemaker, hip replacement, admitted s/p fall found to have subdural hematoma.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: h/o PE now w/ hypoxia evaluate for PE CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: CTA of the chest with and without contrast.
No prior CTA is available for comparison.
FINDINGS: There is a filling defect of a segmental pulmonary artery in the right lower lobe.
There is motion in the lower chest precluding the definitive assessment of subsegmental branches; however, there probably are several left lower lobe subsegmental filling defects.
The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable except for mild atherosclerotic calcifications.
There are several mediastinal lymph nodes which do not meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
The lungs are otherwise clear without consolidations or effusions.
Images through the upper abdomen do not demonstrate acute pathology.
BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are again seen along the thoracic spine without evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Right lower lobe segmental PE.
8-mm suspicious-appearing nodule in the left upper lobe, better assessed on HRCT of [**2119-2-6**].
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  Reason: eval for dvt  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 year old man with h/o PE now w/ hypoxia REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for dvt INDICATION: 83-year-old man with history of PE, now with hypoxia.
There is no evidence of intraluminal clot.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
HISTORY: 82-year-old male with subdural hematoma on heparin for anticoagulation for PE, referred for assessment of interval change in subdural hematoma.
FINDINGS: Again demonstrated is the small left-sided subdural hematoma which layers over the left temporoparietal convexity.
As before, the majority measures density similar to the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, however, there remains a focal area of hyperdensity not significantly changed from the prior study and consistent with more acute re-hemorrhage into the hematoma.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
Again seen is hypodensity of the periventricular white matter consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic change.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in left subdural hematoma with small focus of hyperdensity indicating probable recent re-hemorrhage again demonstrated.
Echo [**2119-2-13**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow  pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery  systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension admitted with PE in the setting of stopped anticoagulation after subdural hematoma in [**2119-1-9**].
However, the next day, heparin stopped given that risk for bleed from hematoma deemed greater than risk from PE.
Per neurosurg, left subdural hematoma is improving.
Repeat head CT on [**2119-2-12**] essentially unchanged showing unchanged left subdural hematoma with focal area of hyperdensity associated with hemorrhage which was seen on prior CT and unchanged.
Anticoagulation was not restarted as the risks of anticoagulation in this patient given his subdural hematoma was thought to be greater than the benefits, given his relatively small PE.
There is some concern for a possible hypercoagulable state in this patient given an 8 mm pulmonary nodule found on chest CT.
# Left subdural hemotoma: Patient was seen by [**Year (4 digits) **] during this admission and they found that the hematoma was improving and repeat head CT demonstrated no interval change.
Patient with a nonfocal neuro exam.
Patient used tylenol for headache pain control.
# Pulmonary Nodule 8mm suspicious nodule noted in the LUL on chest CT.
Given patient's PE and extensive smoking history, concern for a hypercoagulable state due to malignancy.
# DM II: Patient was maintained on an insulin sliding scale and then converted back to his metformin outpatient regimen.
# BPH: no active issues and maintained on tamsulosin .
# anxiety/depression: cont venlafaxine .
# GERD: cont ranitidine .
# rash: cont ketoconazole .
Subdural Hematoma .

If you have any symptoms of worsening or changing headache, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, please seek immediate medical attention.
