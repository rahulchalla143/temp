History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 74283**] is a 46 year old male with past medical history notable for dilated alcoholic cardiomyopathy who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] after a witnessed arrest at home earlier on the day of admission.
After his appointment, he went to his brother's house where he was noted to be intoxicated and c/o shortness of breath.
The patient's brother then noted that he "gurgled" for about one minute while making a grunting noise; the patient typically has pain and did not complain of any chest pain, back pain, or palpitations/dizziness at the time per the patient's brother.
He then had bradycardic PEA and received a total of 3 mg epi and 2 mg atropine.
Past Medical History: DM2 atrial fbrillation alcoholism with alcoholic cardiomyopathy hypertension hypercholesterolemia chronic low back pain  Cardiac Risk Factors: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension   Cardiac History: CABG: n/a  Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**11/2195**] anatomy as follows:  clean coronary arteries    Social History: Lives with mother who feels that he lies to her about his drinking.
Sclera anicteric with slight clear discharge from both eyes.
No oculocephalic reflex.
Neck: JVP not assessed due to body habitus.
No HSM or tenderness.
no abdominal bruits noted.
Ext: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally; DP and PT pulses dopplerable bilaterally Skin: slight evidence of stasis dermatitis   Pertinent Results: EKG from OSH demonstrated atrial fibrillation at a rate of 90.
ST segments < 0.5 mm depressed in V6.
EKG here: atrial fibrillation at rate of 80. normal axis.
no st segment changes noted.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: atrial fibrillation 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2196-11-29**] demonstrated: dilated LV (66 mm ed and 57 mm es), EF 25%, mild MR, dilated LA, LV systolic function severely impaired with diffuse LV hypokinesis and symmetric LVH, mild TR, RV systolic pressure 41 * Previous echo ([**12/2196**]) with EF 52%  TTE [**2197-5-27**]:  LV cavity severely dilated with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
moderately dilated RV cavity.
moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CXR [**5-26**]: profound cardiomegaly, likely fluid overload CXR [**6-2**]: Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
Left pleural effusion if any is small, without increase.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and mediastinal venous engorgement persist.
EEG [**5-28**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the frequent left more than right frontal spike or sharp and slow wave discharges as well as the slow and disorganized background rhythm.
These are suggestive of bilateral frontal potential foci of epileptogenesis.
The slow and disorganized background rhythm is suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy which may be seen with medication effect, toxic metabolic abnormalities, infections, or global ischemic injury.
There were no electrographic seizures noted.

Hospital course by problem is as follows:  #) Arrythmia/arrest: Most likely VT or VF arrest.
Rise in CEs were likely secondary to prolonged resuscitation and multiple shocks.
Electrolyte abnormality unlikely given stable lytes at presentation to OSH.
Most likely, arrest was precipitated by fluid overload in the setting of medication noncompliance (patient reportedly was not taking meds for a few days prior) and ETOH binge.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation upon admission and had episodes of tachycardia,(as high as 160s, and sustained in 130s) so esmolol drip was intiated for HR control (goal 90-110) but discontinued shortly thereafter due to hypotension.
Patient presented with evidence of CHF and fluid overload on exam - rales on PE and pulmonary edema on CXR.
The neurology service was consulted and a CT head/c spine was done to rule out intracranial or cervical injury.
On [**6-1**] the patient began experiencing more episodes of myoclonus with hypertension (~200/100s), tachycardia, and tachypnea associated with myoclonus.
#) Fever/ leukocytosis: The patient presented with low grade fever (100.0) and leukocytosis (11.5) which progressed throughout hospital stay to tmax of 102.4 on [**5-29**].
clinical suspicion was for sinusitis versus PNA ([**5-27**] sputum sample positive for 4+GPR, 2+GPC; ?LLL opacity on CXR) versus line infection (swan tip culture negative to date).
Vancomycin was started on HD4 and zosyn was added on HD5 for empiric treatment.
The patient did not respond to treatment and it was thought the the etiology of fevers may be central (secondary to anoxic brain injury).
#) DM: outpatient meds were held; DM was managed with an ISS.
