Admission Date:  [**2182-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-2-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2138-9-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Erythromycin Base / Levofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: REASON FOR MICU TRANSFER: pneumonia; trach-dependent chronic respiratory failure .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 43 year old man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy with chronic respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy who is ventilator dependent (for chest expansion/volume, not oxygen).
He has been having increasing SOB and rust-colored sputum from his trach, and has not been as comfortable with his normal titer volume on his vent (700).
Today, given the increasing oxygen requirement he went to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5871**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where he was noted to have a leukocytosis (WBC 19.9 with 87%PMNs) and lactate 2.6.
CXR showed right-sided pneumonia.
A repeat CXR confirmed likely right-sided pneumonia.
He was given levofloxacin 750mg IV but developed a rash around the IV, so the antibiotic was stopped.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Duchenne muscular dystrophy - Chronic respiratory failure s/p trach [**2170**], vent-dependent - Bronchiectasis - S/p cardiac arrest in [**2163**] in setting of viral pnumonia, s/p ICD - Left ventricular ejection fraction of 37% by cardiac MRI in [**2173**] at [**Hospital3 1810**] - H/o ventricular tachycardia [**8-/2180**] (thought most likely due to an atrial flutter conducting 1:1 across the AV node in the setting of his baseline abnormal QRS complex) - Long QT interval - Right bundle branch block - Scoliosis - Cholelithiasis - S/p open gastrectomy and PEG tube placement  Social History: He lives with his [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 4559**] and Pirina.

SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..  [**2182-2-23**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING EMERGENCY [**Hospital1 **]  [**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior wall and apex The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30 %).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
Left ventricular cavity dilation with regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-8-24**], the current study is of superior image quality, but remains suboptimal and suggests multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2182-2-23**] 2:23 AM IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidations, likely atelectasis and pleural effusions but cannot exclude infectious process.
Moderate-to-severe background pulmonary edema.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2182-2-24**] 1:54 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-23**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right.
On this apparent upright view, there is some movement of the bilateral pleural effusions, again more prominent on the right.
There is some shift of the mediastinum to the right, which has been present on all examinations since at least [**2180-11-2**].
Right pleural effusion with adjacent consolidation has increased.
Left lower lobe opacities are unchanged.
It could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
No other interval change.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 42970**] was admitted to the medical ICU for concerns of dyspnea and hemoptysis.
in brief, his a  43M with Duchenne muscular dystrophy with chronic respiratory failure s/p trach with multiple recent pneumonias who presents with SOB and hemoptysis, with concerns of pneumonia.
# Dyspnea: Initially there was concern for ventilator acquired pneumonia.
ID was consulted and felt his cultures showed pseudomonal colonization and not true infection.
The patient remained afebrile in the MICU.
# Chronic Respiratory failure: Most recent ABG is 7.18/47/128/18, consistent with a mixed AG metabolic acidosis + respiratory acidosis.
Delta-delta is 0.5, so there is also a non-AG metabolic acidosis.
[**Name2 (NI) **] does have mildly elevated lactate, but no evidence of ketoacidosis or renal failure and no ingestions.
# H/o cardiac arrest s/p ICD/pacemaker: Currently AV paced at 60bpm.
He had a brief episode of likely atrial tachycardia which resolved on its own [**2182-2-24**].
During his hospitalization he also had a cardiac ECHO performed, which showed left ventricular cavity dilation with regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
The patient also did receive several liters of fluid during his stay and required a dose of IV lasix for diuresis.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Centrus Home Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory distress Acute on Chronic respiratory failure Acute on chronic systolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
We talked to the infectious disease doctors and the [**Name5 (PTitle) **] levels look like colonization (meaning the bacteria are not causing active infection but are just always there).
During your hospital stay you were found to have a rash from an antibiotic called levofloxacin.
You also had an ECHO of your heart performed which showed that your heart pumping function is mildly decreased.
