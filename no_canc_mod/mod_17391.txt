OSH images / CT reveal large acute SDH on left with approx 2 cm of MLS.
No localization or w/d to upper extremities.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please perform with diffusion to evaluate extent of PCA infarct CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CLINICAL HISTORY: 45-year-old male with status post head trauma with evacuation of left subdural hematoma to assess for brain infarcts.
There are acute infarcts noted in the left basal ganglia including the thalamus, internal capsule, external capsule, left posterior parietal lobe extending superiorly and also in the left temporal lobe.
There is slow diffusion noted also in the right basal ganglia and the caudate nucleus and thalamus and the right internal capsule.
There is slow diffusion also noted in the peripheral aspect of the right parietal lobe.
There is high intensity on the noted in the cerebral peduncles on the FLAIR images, but without slow diffusion.
These changes are not typical of infarction, and may reflect edema from trauma or compression.
Multiple susceptibility artifacts noted in the region of the infarcted area most likely representing blood products.
There is no evidence of any flow-limiting stenosis, filling defect or aneurysm (greater than 3 mm).
Acute infarcts noted in the bilateral posterior cerebral artery territories and the posterior aspect of the bilateral parietal lobes, and in the right cerebellar hemisphere.
There is slow diffusion noted in the peripheral aspect of the right parietal lobe, and in the left frontal lobe which may be due to embolic infarcts.
Unchanged shift of normally midline structures to the right with unchanged evidence of uncal herniation since the CT scan study of [**2180-8-31**].

CLINICAL HISTORY: 45-year-old man with head trauma status post evacuation of left subdural hematoma, to assess for progression.
There are new infarcts noted in the left basal ganglia, in the right parietal region and the left frontal region.
The infarct in the right superior cerebellar artery distribution is more apparent.
There is partial resolution of the left frontoparietal pneumocephalus with no evidence of any new bleed.
Improvement in the shift of normally midline structures to the right and uncal herniation as described above.
Multiple areas of infarcts present with new infarcts in the left basal ganglia and the bilateral peripheral parietal cortex and in the left frontal lobe as described above.
The peripheral infarcted areas in the parietal and frontal lobes may be related to an underlying embolic event resulting in an infarct.

TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained with multiplanar reformatted images.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Scattered axillary lymph nodes are identified, none of which definitively meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
No pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are identified.
The heart and great vessels are unremarkable and there is no evidence of pericardial or pleural effusion.
The lung windows demonstrate dependent atelectasis bilaterally with a few scattered small irregular opacities in the right upper lobe posteroinferiorly (i.e.
2:19) which may also represent atelectasis, scarring or air space disease.
The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally and there is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable and there is no free air, free fluid, or pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.
No free pelvic fluid or pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are identified.
Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of traumatic injury in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
3) Small irregular right upper lobe pulmonary opacities may represent scarring, atelectasis, or air space disease.
