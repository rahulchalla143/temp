However, a week and a half later, due to increasing pain, he went to his local ED where he was diagnosed with R-sided rib fractures, given pain medications, and sent home.
His pain did not subside within a few days so he presented to his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] reassured him and gave him more pain medications and again discharged him home.
Earlier today, he presented to [**Hospital6 204**] seemingly septic with fevers, tachycardia with HR in the 140s-150s and leukocytosis of 20.
CTA performed at LGH showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates that appeared continuous with a >10cm x 9cm multiloculated fluid collection that seems to extend in the RP space posterior to the R hepatic lobe and upper pole of the R kidney.
This fluid collection also extends into the lower chest wall between the 10/11th and 11/12th ribs.

WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2163-8-17**]):    NO GROWTH.

Large, 26 x 14 x 10 cm multiloculated, partially liquefied, partially solid fluid collection involving the right paravertebral soft tissues of the mid and lower thoracic spine, the posterobasal segment and pleural space of  the lower lobe of the right lung, the right posterior pararenal space and the  right iliopsoas muscle.
Differential diagnosis includes superinfected hematoma or frank abscess, possible actinomycosis or tuberculosis given the aggressive and destructive nature of the collection.
A total of 620 cc of bloody and purulent aspirate was removed, and specimen sent for analysis  [**2163-8-18**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1.
Marked reduction in size of previously seen large multiloculated fluid collection involving the right paravertebral soft tissues of the mid and lower thoracic spine status post drain placement.
He was relatively unstable in the ER with tachycardia to 150 and was diaphoretic due to sepsis and was therefore admitted to the SICU for further resuscitation and management.
His tachycardia soon resolved and he then underwent another  CT scan to further delineate the fluid collection and eventually the retroperitoneal collection was drained.
He remained afebrile and his WBC decreased from 25K on admission to 12K 3 days post drainage.
A repeat CT scan was obtained on [**2163-8-18**] to assure the collection was fully drained and he had marked improvement although there was a hypodense area in the posterior post ion of the right lower lobe that potentially could be drained.
He went back to Interventional Radiology on [**2163-8-19**] and......  Of note he had some elevated blood sugars during this admission which was presumed to be from sepsis.
Medications on Admission: none  Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Retroperitoneal abscess Acute blood loss anemia Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital with a severe infection probably due to a collection of blood that developed when you fell, then became infected.
* If you develop any increased pain, fevers or a change in the color of the drainage please call your doctor or return to the Emergency Room.
