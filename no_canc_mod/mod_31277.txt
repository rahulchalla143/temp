Admission Date:  [**2114-10-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-10-25**]   Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Echo [**10-22**] Cardiac Cath [**10-23**] Cardiac Cath [**10-24**]  History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft [**2109**] and PCI in [**2110**] who presents with exertional angina, doe and pnd with + stress test for cardiac cath.
Pt c/o 3-4 weeks of progressive doe and increased sob.
States no sob at rest, but gets sob with minimal exertion.
She had a stres test on [**2114-9-4**] showing LV dilation with exertion.
Denies any residual weakness from the fall.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2109**];3VD status post coronary artery bypass graft [**3-/2109**] with saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal-1 and obtuse marginal-2.
Old Q waves inferiorly 2.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
There is no history of ethanol or tobacco use.
no carotid bruits Chest:  Crackles upto middle of lung fields bilaterally CVR:  nl s1, s2.
II/VI early systolic murmor heard best over left upper sternal border.
no change with valsalva.
no radiation to carotids.
- Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
- The LAD was diffusely diseased with narrowing to 50% in the proximal vessel and then serial 80-90% lesions in the mid and distal vessel.
- The LCX was diffusely diseased with serial 90% lesions in the proximal segment.
The LCX supplied a large, bifurcating OM1 that had diffuse luminal irregularities and a focal 80% lesion at the bifurcation.
- The RCA was diffusely diseased with an 80% ostial narrowing and serial 90% lesions in the proximal and mid vessel.
2) Grafts - The SVG->LAD had 90% in-stent restenosis in the proximal segment(cypher stent -> no residual stenosis) and an 80% tubular stenosis in the distal graft just prior to the touchdown (cypher stent -> negative 20% residual stenosis) - The SVG->OM was known to be totally occluded.
There was also evidence of pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 72/23/40 mmHg and a PVR of 736 dynes-sec/cm5.
Cath [**2114-10-23**]  1) Coronary arteries -The LAD had severe proximal and midvessel disease with distal competitive filling via the SVG-LAD.
- The SVG-LAD had no angiographically apparent, flow-limiting disease.
2) Resting hemodynamics revealed central hypertension with blood pressure 170/82 mmHg.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.

1) CAD - Pt with h/o MI, s/p cabg and pci with 3 weeks of doe and sob and +stress test revealing fixed inferior and lateral wall perfusion defects and lv dilation.
Pt denied any CP, orthopnea or PND after the procedures.
2) CHF - Pt volume overloaded on exam, elevated jvp and bibasilar crackles.
DOE may have been secondary to CAD vs. CHF.
Echo [**10-22**] was remarkable for global hypokinesis and a thrombus in LV cavity.
During the cath on [**10-22**], SVG -> LAD stenosis was opened with 2 cypher stents.
She had some SOB with exertion however denied CP, orthopnea and pnd.
The renal insuff on presentation may have been a combination of CRI secondary to DM as well as pt being prerenal due to severly depressed CO seen on first PCI.
Creatinine 0.9 post cath [**10-23**], in setting of post cath hydration.
5) DM - Glipizide was held in patinet and pt was covered with RISS.
6) HTN - Pt was switched over to lopressor 50 po bid (taking atenelol 50 po qd outpt) and ACEI was continued initially.
Coronary artery disease a)status post myocardial infarction in [**2109**]; 3VD status post coronary artery bypass graft [**3-/2109**] with saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal-1 and obtuse marginal-2.
