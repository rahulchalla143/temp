<br> Of note, pt had increased sputum at [**Hospital1 **] and was started on [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 64983**] [**1-26**] for presumed bronchitis vs PNA.
In addition, patient was found to have RUQ tenderness so CT abd/pelvis was obtained & showed "sludge within a distended appearing gallbladder.
There may also be pericholecystic fluid or wall edema that is concerning for acute cholecystits."
CT also revealed pericardial and bilat pleural effusions, moderate ascites, and R-inguinal hernia with nonobstucted small bowel.
<br> Upon my eval in the ED, he denies any abdom pain, F/C, N/V, or diarrhea (in fact is slightly constipated).
He has noted increased sputum production (yellow, thick) over the past few days.
Pt also c/o pain in his buttocks at the site of skin breakdown.
Pt also denies any lightheadedness, visual changes, or known confusion when his BP was low.

There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
IMPRESSION: Developing pulmonary edema with possible underlying consolidations.
No definite sizeable masses are identified in the neck.
No definite free fluid collections within the neck are identified.
<BR> IMPRESSION: Contrast material visualized within the upper airway perhaps secondary to reflux from placement of contrast material for CT of the torso obtained at the same time.
No definite evidence of pathologic fluid collection in the neck.
<BR> EKG (admit): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Multifocal PVCs, Poor R wave progression, Nonspecific ST-T wave changes, No previous tracing available for comparison Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 117 0 98 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 64986**] 157 <BR> ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent), mainly due to abnormal left ventricular electrical/mechanical activation sequence.

<BR> CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2151-3-13**] 10:17 AM: The right pleural effusion has [**Month/Day/Year 7968**] since the previous exam, however, there is suggestion of larger effusion on the left extending along the lateral chest wall.
Overall the parenchymal opacities remain stable with compressive atelectasis in the left lung base.
The degree of the pulmonary edema shows no change since the previous exam.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

HYPOTENSION: Initially BP stabilized after NS and PRBCs, but intermittently became hypotensive during the begining of his hospital stay thought to be related to sepsis.
Blood cultures remained persistently sterile.
Continued to be hypotensive during CVVH only, but later was able to maintain his BP during HD sessions as time went on.
POSSIBLE ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS: noted on CT abd/pelvis.
RUQ tenderness but no peritoneal signs.
Remained afebrile without abdominal pain after his course of antibiotics was completed.
Sputum Cx grew back MRSA and enterobacter, changed to CTX after sensitivity panel.
He later was treated for 2 full courses Vanc and Meropenem for PNA which was completed on [**3-6**].
There was evidence of aspirated contrast by CT initially, so pt's PEG was changed to PEJ to help prevent aspiration.
Approximately 6 days prior to his hospital discharge he began having copious secretions.
His CXR showed no evidence of a new pulmonary infiltrate.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE: With his worsening respiratory difficult a trach was re-placed at the site of his prior trach site and he was vented as tolerated in the setting of CHF and PNA.
Attempts were made to wean his from the trach, but were difficult in the setting of CHF, PNA, and severe deconditioning.
He was gradually weaned off the vent with removal of fluid through hemodialysis / ultrafiltration and treatment of his pneumonias.
He is able to cough some of his secretions into his mouth and has a good gag.
ProBNP markedly elevated in ED but O2 sat stable on NC even after 2U PRBC in ED.
JVD and crackles.
Digoxin was held for serum level 2.2 and evidence of dig toxicity on EKG (accelerated junctional rhythm).
His CHF is complicated by severe malnutrition and low albumin, creating for marked third spacing.
Finally, he was started on low dose beta-blocker, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] to help w/ ventricular remodeling.
He later became anuric, and underwent CVVH for fluid removal.
A tunned HD line was placed by renal, and he later tolerated full HD sessions without difficulty.
He continues to require hemodialysis and hasn't made any signs of renal recovery.
[**Name2 (NI) **] did have renal u/s demonstrating normal blood flow and no evidence of obstructive physiology.
AFIB/CAD: it was initially unclear if pt is chronically in Afib or paroxysmal, however he remained in AFIB throughout his entire hospital stay.
While here he had a GIB with an episode of hypotension in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
In the setting of his acute renal failure, he developed dig toxicity with EKG changes (accelerated junctional rhythm).
He was started on IV amiodarone (load) and was tolerating PO amio but maintained in atrial fibrillation.
Later in his hospitalization, cardiology (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**]) was reconsulted regarding the utility of continuing amiodarone in the setting of likely chronic afib w/ enlarged atria, chf, and respiratory failure (making conversion to SR unlikely).
Given his history of dig toxicity and renal failure, it was decided to d/c dig on [**3-19**].
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was initiated on metoprolol for CHF and rate control.
GIB/ANTICOAGULATION: he was restarted on Coumadin and then began to have bright red blood per rectum, and hypotension in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
He has no further bleeding during the last [**1-29**] weeks of hospitlization and no further transfusion requirements.
DECUB: he has significant sacral decub ulcers that were evaluated by the wound care team, as well as a L-heel pressure ulcer that was followed as well.
He continues to have SEVERE pain in the buttock region.
We have been increasing his fentanyl patch and using morphine IV for breakthrough pain.
His wound has been slowly improving.
He requires frequent turning and an air mattress.
In fact, pt was found heavily sedated on [**3-18**] - this was attributable to this increased narcotic dosage and subsequently has been reduced to 125 mg every 3 days (last changed [**3-18**]).
Earlier in hospital course, it was demonstrated that pt was in fact aspirating and as such, PEG was converted to PEJ to reduce risk for aspiration.
He did have repeat swallow study which continued to demonstrate high risk for aspiration.
There is mild erythema at site of PEJ that is felt to represent inflammation rather than infection.
Finally, he does have left subclavian dialysis port.
They have been advised about the severity of his many illnesses and the chance for recurrent complications or repeat hopsitilzations.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Outpatient Speech/Swallowing Therapy Pt is deemed to be aspiration risk and should be maintained NPO from mouth.
Pt has minimal IVF needs and could consider removal of PICC line as condition continues to improve.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Renal Failure now on hemodialysis GIB in setting of coumadin pneumonia with MRSA aspiration pneumonia sepsis MRSA tracheobronchitis sacral and heel decubitus ulcers secondary: CAD s/p cabg aortic stenosis s/p AVR   Discharge Condition: fair   Discharge Instructions: When the patient's clinical status improves, he needs a colonoscopy for his GIB.
If he has no lesions, anti-coagulation with coumadin could be considered.
