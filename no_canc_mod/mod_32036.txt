Brief Hospital Course: # Throat pain/swelling: Patient was initially admitted to the ICU for an unclear cause of likely allergic reaction versus angioedema.
She did not report any new medication a few days prior to the episode or new foods.
C1 esterase deficiency was also in the differenital, which could affect the gut and cause GI symptoms.
She was by ENT and there was no indication for intubation.
Her O2 saturations were stable and she did not exhibit any stridor or subjective dyspnea.
She was watched overnight and discharged on a rapid steroid taper and instructed to follow-up with an allergy specialist to determine a possible cause of her adverse reaction.
Given her history of asthma and a high incidence of concurrent atopy, it was highly recommended to her to procure an EpiPen in cases of extreme shortness of breath and to avoid taking NSAIDs or aspirin, as these are common causes of allergies.
# Diarrhea: She was complaining of diarrhea prior to admission that seemed to resolve.
# Chest pain: Her chest pain was atypical and nonexertional.
She does not have any cardiac risk factors and no EKG changes.
The H2 blockers and magic mouthwash seemed to improve her symptoms, indicating a likely GI cause of her chest pain.
Menthol-Cetylpyridinium 3 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane PRN (as needed) as needed for throat pain.
Maalox 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
You were admitted to the hospital with increased facial swelling and numbness, fevers, and a sore throat.
We were initially concerned that you were having an allergic reaction that may cause you to have difficulty breathing, so you were brought to the intensive care unit.
When it was felt your breathing was stable and your facial swelling decreased, you were transferred to a regular medical floor for further observation.
While we could not figure out the cause of your adverse reaction, we would advise you not to take aspirin or NSAIDs such as motrin or ibuprofen, as there are common causes of allergic reactions.
As we discussed, many patients with a history of asthma can also have allergies that are unknown to them.
We would like you to take 2 medications when you leave the hospital: Prednisone 30mg (3 tablets) by mouth daily for 1 day (day #1) Prednisone 20mg (3 tablets) by mouth daily for 1 day (day #2) Prednisone 10mg (3 tablets) by mouth daily for 1 day (day #3) Maalox 5ml by mouth 4 times a day as needed for indigestion Menthol-Cetylpyridinium (Cepacol) 3 mg Lozenge by mouth as needed for throat pain.
Please continue to take all other medications prescribed by your physicians as directed, except for aspirin, motrin, or ibuprofen (as listed above).
If you have a recurrence of facial swelling, experience itchiness, or feel like you are having increasing difficulty with breathing, you should report to the Emergency Room immediately.
In coordination with your primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] also recommend that you carry around an EpiPen with you, just in case you have a severe allergic reaction in the future.
