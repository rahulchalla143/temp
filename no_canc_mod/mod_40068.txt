No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve or chordae.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal valve morphology without echo evidence of discrete vegetation/abscess or pathology flow.
CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pre-existing pleural effusions has slightly decreased but parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms are still visible at both lung bases.
Moderate areas of atelectasis at both lung bases.

A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Brief Hospital Course: 41 Yo F previously healthy presented with multifocal pneumonia requiring intubation; also with staph epidermidits and staph capitis bacteremia.
# Acute Resp Failure/Multifocal Pneumonia: Patient was admitted with hypoxia and found to have multilobar pneumonia on chest xray.
Patient also had bronch to evaluate for possible other etiologies.
The rash was presumably due to cefipime.
# Bacteremia: Cultures on presentation to [**Location (un) 620**] grew staph capitis and staph epidermidis.
However, repeat TEE here not c/w endocarditis.
It is unclear whether the staph epidermidits and capitis were true infection or contaminant.
ID followed the patient and initially recommended 14 days of antibiotics but given that overall it appeared that the patient had a superimposed pneumonia on top of a viral illness, that treating for a pneumonia for 10 days was adequate and that 14 days was not necessary.
#Drug rash The patient intially had a rash developed on her left inner thigh which was treated with miconazole.
She intermitently complained of pruritis which was treated with benadryl and [**Doctor First Name 130**].
She had some hoarseness on [**11-9**] but no SOB or other respiratory issues.
# Acute Renal Failure: Pt had sudden increase in creatinine from baseline 0.6 to 2.5 prior to transfer here.
Her acute kidney injury was likely contrast nephropathy c/b NSAID overuse in setting of hypovolemia.
FeNa is 2.7% which is consistent with ATN/intrinsic process.
# Metabolic acidosis: Mixed gap and non-gap acidosis, likely secondary to renal failure and NaCl resuscitation.
# Anemia, NOS: Pt was noted to have hct decrease from 39 to 32 on admission, likely hemodilutional in setting of fluid resuscitation and possible marrow suppresion from infection.
She remained stable with no signs of active bleeding.
No signs of active bleeding.
# Liver lesions incidentally noted on CT chest: likely simple cysts given hounsfield units similar to water, however her LFTs remain midly elevated.
Pt should have  outpatient work-up for etiology of elevated LFTs and liver lesions with imaging once her renal function recovers.
Outpatient Lab Work please draw a CBC and basic metabolic panel prior in 1 week and fax to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Multifocal pneumonia Respiratory failure Acute Kidney Injury/ATN Acidosis Liver lesions of unknown significance cefipime induced drug rash   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with multifocal pneumonia causing respiratory failure and requiring intubation.
Finally, you were found to have liver lesions of unknown significance.
