is a 76 yo female with a history of ESRD on HD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and DM2 who presents with a 1 day history of 3 episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious, clear emesis and 1 episode of nonbloody diarrhea.
The patient woke up in her USOH this AM when she suddenly developed 3 episodes of emesis and 1 episode of diarrhea.
She reports that she did not eat breakfast this morning, and has had no change in her diet.
She has a sick contact: a next door neighbor in rehab had vomiting and diarrhea recently.
She had an EKG which showed NSR, [**Month/Day (2) **] in I, aVL, no ST changes.
CT abdomen/pelvis, CXR, and abdominal films were negative for acute disease.
On the floor, the patient continued to have no symptoms and reported no pain.
She remained febrile to 102.2 and tachycardic to 120.
No EKG changes.
MICU was called for evaluation for transfer.

Ext: 1+ pitting ankle edema bilaterally, 1+ DP pulses bilaterally.
L AV fistula in place.
No evidence of obstruction or acute intra-abdominal pathology.
Right-sided renal lesion concerning for carcinoma and not completely characterized on this single phase of contrast study.
9 mm partially calcified splenic artery aneurysm.
CXR ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
No infiltrate or evidence of pulmonary edema.
Abdomen Films ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION:  Subacute fractures of right superior and inferior pubic rami; no evidence of obstruction or free air.
EKG: NSR, No [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] elevation in V2, ST depression in V6 (noncontiguous) .

Findings are still concerning for neoplastic involvement and dedicated MRI examination is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo female with a history of ESRD on HD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and DM2 who presents with a 1 day history of vomiting and diarrhea.
Patient presented with a 1 day history of emesis and diarrhea, with a temperature of 100.1.
CT abd/pelvis was without evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology, CXR was without evidence of infiltrate, and abdominal film was without free air.
The patient was transferred to the MICU on the day of admission for fever up to 102.2 and hypotension; in the ICU the fever defervesced without antibiotics and she remained afebrile.
Patient was also tachycardic, which was likely a response to fever or dehydration, as patient denied any pain.
Blood cultures taken at that time were with no growth.
(UA/urine Cx not able to be done as patient makes minimal urine.)
Fecal culture negative for salmonella, shigella, and campylobacter.
Diarrhea resolved spontaneously without intervention prior to discharge.
# Hypotension:  On admission, she had fever and hypotension down to 88/40.
The patient also developed hypotension down to SBP in the 70s during 3 HD sessions when given IV lopressor and IV diltiazem for treatment of a fib with RVR into 140s-170s (see below).
Her Coumadin is being held for at least 1 month pending GI f/u s/p UGIB at the beginning of [**9-10**].
She becomes hypotensive during these episodes (usually down to 70/30) but responsive to IVF boluses.
Digoxin was started on [**2124-9-23**] (renally dosed) with post-load digoxin level of 1.6 and no EKG changes consistent with digoxin toxicity.
# Erratic pacemaker firing:  Patient has a [**Company 1543**] dual chamber ICD, and is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11679**] at [**Hospital1 112**].
On telemetry, it was noticed that she had occasional pacemaker spikes on top of T waves.
She was found to have a normal functioning ICD, and the spikes appeared to be [**1-7**] undersensing of a fib waves with inappropriate atrial pacing.
# Renal lesion: CT abdomen showed a right-sided renal lesion concerning for carcinoma.
Renal U/S showed mixed solid and cystic right interpolar renal lesion as noted on CT examination concerning for neoplastic involvement.
She developed a fib with RVR and hypotension during 3 HD sessions as above, and they had to be terminated early.
# Elevated Troponins: Patient has a baseline elevated troponins per [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] records (0.08-0.16).
EKG without any acute changes.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued Simvastatin.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Stable .
# Subacute Pelvic fracture: Found on [**Location (un) 620**] CT, seen again on Pelvic CT here.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Daily Duoderm dressing changes with saline cleansing.
# On [**9-28**] the patient was discharged in stable condition, afebrile with VSS to rehab for further care.
