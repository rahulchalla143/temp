Admission Date:  [**2108-11-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-11-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**] Chief Complaint: confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness:  [**Age over 90 **]M w/ h/o CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI, Afib on dabigatran, brought in by his son due to confusion lethargy and markedly slurred speech for approximately one week.
At baseline, he has clear speech, is oriented, and can walk independently for very short distances.
Per the patient's son, the patient has had no specific complaints, however for the last week and a half he has had slurred speech and dizziness.
[**2108-10-30**] he was seen in the ED for hypoxia and discharged on an increased dose of Lasix 120mg daily.
[**2108-11-19**] his son called his cardiologist's office with a complaint of dizziness.
He has had a couple of mild episodes of epistaxis.
He continued to have slurred speech and hypotension, so he was brought in to the ED.
Found to have guaiac positive brown stool.
CXR showed chronic R sided effusion.
He denies pain and is unable to provide further ROS.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**6-/2107**], [**7-/2107**], and [**11/2107**] treated medically - CHF EF 25% to 30% on [**6-/2107**] TTE - Aortic stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2, peak gradient 38, mean gradient 24 in [**6-/2107**] TTE) - Hypertension - Chronic kidney failure (baseline Cr 1.7-2.0)   Social History: The patient lives with his wife of 72 years and his son.
-Illicit drugs: No drugs.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death  Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented to self and month, but not place HEENT: Sclera anicteric, R pupil reactive, dry mucous membranes, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP just above the clavicle, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, diminished at right base.
CV: Regular rate, distant, faint, harsh systolic Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 1+ pulses, mild LE edema bilaterally Neuro: A&Ox1.5, CNII-XII intact except for left eye and dysarthric speech, sensation and strength grossly intact in all extremities   Pertinent Results: [**2108-11-21**] 03:30PM BLOOD WBC-5.4 RBC-3.14* Hgb-8.6* Hct-27.7* MCV-88 MCH-27.5 MCHC-31.1 RDW-15.6* Plt Ct-130*# [**2108-11-21**] 03:30PM BLOOD PT-35.7* PTT-120.3* INR(PT)-3.6* [**2108-11-21**] 03:30PM BLOOD Glucose-209* UreaN-76* Creat-2.3* Na-137 K-5.1 Cl-98 HCO3-30 AnGap-14 [**2108-11-21**] 03:30PM BLOOD ALT-25 AST-36 CK(CPK)-29* AlkPhos-60 TotBili-0.3 [**2108-11-21**] 03:30PM BLOOD cTropnT-0.03* [**2108-11-21**] 03:30PM BLOOD Calcium-9.1 Phos-4.9* Mg-2.5  ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal/anterior hypokinesis/akinesis with apical akinesis/dyskinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is aortic valve stenosis which is probably severe (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2) but the gradient is low; since left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed is possible that the aortic valve area would be larger with a higher stroke volume.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]M w/ h/o CHF, CAD, Afib on dabigatran, brought by his son due to confusion lethargy and markedly slurred speech for approximately one week.
He was found to have a pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics.
He also had an anemia, likely secondary to GI blood loss secondary to decreased clearance of dabigaran in the setting of renal impairment.
