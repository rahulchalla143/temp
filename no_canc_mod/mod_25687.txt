[**2179-6-12**] CT Head: 18 x 40 mm right parietal epidural hematoma with associated subgaleal hemorrhage.
Multilevel degenerative disease with no acute fractures noted.
If ligamentous injury is a clinical concern, then an MR is recommended for further evaluation.
Mild bilateral pulmonary edema.
[**2179-6-12**] CXR: Findings mild pulmonary edema with possible superimposed pneumonia.
Differential diagnosis would include aspiration.
No clear evidence of neoplasm is demonstrated.
Extensive vascular calcification as described in the body of the report.
Bilateral right slightly more than left pleural effusion that appears to be low in density, nonhemorrhagic.
CT-Head [**2179-6-16**]: FINDINGS: A 28 x 16 mm epidural hematoma is redemonstrated overlying the right parietal lobe near the vertex (2:23).
No new hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect is seen.
Relative hypodensity of the periventricular white matter is compatible with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
There has been interval improvement of the right-sided subgaleal hematoma with some decrease.
Stable right parietal epidural hematoma since the [**2179-6-13**] study and decreased compared to [**2179-5-13**].
No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Left axis deviation like due to left anterior fascicular block.
Right bundle-branch block.
The Q-T interval is slightly shorter.
[**2179-6-17**]: Sinus rhythm.
Right bundle-branch block.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 71 year old female with multiple medical problems who fell and hit her head and also became short of breath.
# Shortness of Breath: Patient's shortness of breath was related to CHF.
She was afebrile and without cough so was not treated with antibiotics.
She had Chest CT for evaluation of possible lung malignancy.
This was not done with contrast due to her chronic kidney disease.
Her CT did not show evidence of malignancy.
While on the floors she remained asymptomatic and her oxygen saturations were normal on room air.
# Intracranial hemorrhage: Patient with both epidural and sub-galeal bleed on head CT. Neurosurgery evaluated the patient in the ED and opted for a non-operative course.
She was started on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
We recommend that she takes this medicine at night as her blood pressure trend showed higher pressures at night.
# L Rotator Cuff Tear: OSH MRI was obtained from [**Hospital1 87076**] showing a L Rotator Cuff Tear.
# UTI: Patient had a positive UA on [**6-17**] and urine culture was no growth to date at time of discharge.
# PENDING Labs at time of discharge: Urine culture no growth to date on [**6-18**] after 2 days.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: epidural hematoma, subgaleal hematoma  Secondary: Diabetes mellitus, COPD, CHF - unknown systolic or diastolic   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with and epidural hematoma (bleeding around your brain).
