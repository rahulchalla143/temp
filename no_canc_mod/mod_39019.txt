CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2145-11-9**]):       NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.
A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may reactivate       when immunity is compromised.
Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2136**] mg/dl may cause       interference with CMV IgM results.
BLOOD/FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
BLOOD/AFB CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
HIV-1 Viral Load/Ultrasensitive (Pending):     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2145-11-12**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**11-8**], 11/25/ [**11-11**]: Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2145-11-14**]): NO GROWTH.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT Chest:  IMPRESSION: Pulmonary nodule versus atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
Splenomegaly  ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver demonstrates normal echogenicity without focal mass.
There is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary dilatation.
There is no ascites.
No focal hepatic lesion.
There is no focal hepatic lesion.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no cholelithiasis.
There is no ascites.
There is no hydronephrosis, mass or calculus in either kidney.
She was lethargic but cleared with time in Obs.
Labs showed revealed serum tox pos for BZD and utox pos for BZD and methadone (as prescribed at [**Hospital1 **]).
Psych was consulted, recommended admission for possible withdrawal sxs or DTs.
In the MICU refused LP so was prophylactically started on vanco, acyclovir, ceftriaxone and dexamethasone for concern of meningitis.
Possible UTI was diagnosed, but no other infection was found.
On the floor the patient was alert and oriented, again with unstable emotional outbursts and little insight into her disease but no confusion, hallucinations.
ECHO showed no valvular vegetation.
Smear for erlichia was also negative.
Alk phos and LDH were also acutely elevated but less so.
Her T. Bili, INR also increased on the day following her LFT rise, indicating abnormal liver function.
We ruled out Hep A, Hep B.  Hep C viral load was 700,000 so unlikely to have been cause.
We believe it is most likely that her liver disease was [**1-16**] self injection or ingestion of an illicit substance prior to admission or to one of the medications she was given at [**Hospital1 **].
She had periods of pressured speech and irritability while here but was not acutely manic.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Acute Liver Failure Altered Mental Status Polysubstance abuse Bipolar disorder   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital with altered mental status, fever.
We believe this was from something you took outside the hospital as we didn't find any evidence for infection.
You refused a lumbar puncture so we couldn't rule out meningitis.
We then found that you went into acute liver failure.
If you start using drugs again, or if you have any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, change in color of your urine or stool, confusion, slurred speech, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you please call your doctor or come to the emergency room.
