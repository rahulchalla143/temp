trachea midline.
small evidence of LIJ attempt.
no subcutaneous crepitus.
mild neck stiffness CV: regular tachy, nl s1, s2, no m/r/g PULM: coarse crackles bilaterally ABD: soft, ND, + BS, no HSM EXT: cool, dry, +2 distal pulses BL, no femoral bruits.
3+ pedal edema NEURO: intubated/sedated.
SKIN: multiple erythematous lesions on right thigh.
petechial rash to lower back.
Left suprahilar increased rounded density and left mid lung zone 1.7 cm nodule.
Moderate pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, ascites, subcutaneous edema, and mild interstitial pulmonary edema are all consistent with volume overload.
Small anterior left pneumothorax.
Consolidation in the lower lobes of the lungs bilaterally, most suggestive of aspiration, probably with a component of atelectasis as well.
Fibroid uterus.
[**2117-7-4**] CT head - Limited study without evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
Worsening of bibasilar effusions and associated airspace disease, most likely atelectasis, underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Slight decrease in pericardial effusion.
Persistent, diffuse simple ascites, with new ascending/transverse colitis without dilatation or perforation.
No definable abscess or focal collection, as clinically questioned.
Diffuse mild small bowel thickening is felt to be due to third spacing.
Fibroid uterus.
Surgical wound as described above in the mid thigh anteriorly with packing material.
No soft tissue or muscle fluid collection or abscess.
Diffuse low-attenuation throughout the muscles of the thigh, which may represent muscle edema.
Fluid tracking in both the deep and superficial fascial compartments of the anterior and posterior thigh.
No soft tissue gas is present.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion, mostly posterior (minimal anterior fluid seen).
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Moderate pericardial effusion without overt tamponade.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old woman with history of multiple sclerosis, SLE c/b nephritis presenting with altered mental status found to be in shock complicated by multi-organ failure.
# Septic shock: [**2-27**] serratia bacteremia presumably from GI source given pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis.
Shock requiring max dose 4 pressors on presentation and she was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids until blood cultures grew serratia bacteremia.
Also cardiogenic in setting of sepsis as EF was severely depressed on initial echo obtained upon presentation to the ED (since normalized s/p treatment of sepsis).
She completed a full 2 week course of the above antibiotics with resolution of her shock and discontinuation of pressor support.
Of note, she also grew serratia from right leg deep tissue biopsy (performed by surgery on presentation), but suspect leg was seeded from blood as opposed to leg as source of bacteremia.
CT right LE was negative for fluid collection/abscess/air.
At the time of discharge, her BP was stable, she was afebrile, and there was no leukocytosis.
# Livedo necrosis:  Right lower extremity biopsied on initial presentation out of concern for necrotizing fasciitis and source of sepsis.
General surgery and dermatology were consulted and deep tissue biopsy did not show e/o nec fasciitis however did also grow serratia to lesser degree than in blood.
CT right lower extremity was unrevealing for abscess and air was leg was presumably seeded from bacteremia as opposed to leg as source.
for wounds (ph# [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2723**]).
# Anemia/hct drop:  Has baseline anemia from underlying renal dz and renal failure however now with acute drop while on heparin gtt.
She did have bloody oral secretions but not enough to lose that amount of blood (23.5-->19).
She has had no gross blood per GI tract however concerning is the increase in her BUN.
No other clear source of blood loss.
Prior to discharge, she had some frank blood from her tracheostomy, and heparin gtt was stopped.
Repeat bronchoscopy did not show any areas of frank bleeding, and it was thought to be secondary to trauma from the tube.
# Respiratory failure:  Initially intubated on presentation in the setting of altered mental status.
She was extubated, however failed x1 and was reintubated due to profound respiratory muscle weakness, copious oral secretions and inability to clear them.
She was again extubated however had probable aspiration event with acute hypoxia and brdaycardia again requiring reintubation.
# Acute renal failure/Lupus nephritis: patient had rising Cr thought to be lupus nephritis prior to this admission.
She became oliguric on admisison requiring initiation of CVVH which she tolerated well and was transitioned to HD.
# Oral ulcers:  During her course, she developed severe oral ulcers involving her lips and within the oropharynx.
HSV1 was cultured from lip ulcers and she was started on valtrex for a 14-21 day course.
Topical viscous lidocaine was used for pain control.
# Pancytopenia: Leukopenia on presentation secondary to sepsis/DIC vs. due to lupus vs. in setting of cellcept.
# SLE:  With lupus nephritis as above.
Off cellcept temporarily given fungemia and on hydrocortisone.
# MS: Stable without active issues.
She had some discomfort surrounding her PEG tube and was evaluated several times by interventional pulmonology and no problems were found.
This is likely due to pain at the surgical site.
# hypertension: maintained with good blood pressure control on his current medications.
