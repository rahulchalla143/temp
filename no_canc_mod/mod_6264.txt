He was found to have profound anemia from a [**Month/Day/Year 24997**] lesion in the 3rd part of the duodenum and hospital course complicated by poorly controlled atrial fibrillation and new ARF secondary to hypovolemia induced ATN.
GIB: Patient was admitted to the ICU for concern of upper GI bleed, given h/o duodenal bleeding.
GI did EGD on day of admission with report as above, he had coffee ground blood in stomach and blood in duodenum with [**Month/Day/Year 24997**] lesion in 3rd part duodenum and 3 clips were applied.
He received 2u PRBC's after the procedure (5 total) and no further bleeding was seen, and his Hct stabilized.
Renal was consulted who saw muddy brown casts indicating ATN likely from severe hypotension with 80/40s BPs and acute anemia with nadir HCT 17 range.
There was no immediate need for renal replacement therapy though given he was improving steadily and UOP was in acceptable ranges.
There was also question of post-obstructive element given reports that he had a prior Foley in place at OSH that a nurse had removed, with poor UOP thereafter, in the setting of known BPH.
Atrial fibrillation: Initially had poor control with atrial fibrillation with RVR on admission that was attributed to his severe hypovolemia.
There was also some initial concern for QRS prolongation on EKG in the setting of hyperkalemia , however, he has a fascicular block at baseline and his QRS was at baseline.
This longer QT improved with hyperkalemia treatment.
PVD: Longstanding peripheral vascular disease.
He has a chronic right arterial ulcer: S/p surgical debridement by vascular surgery on [**8-18**] which was his last hospital admission.
RLE chronic wound appeared clean, non-infected for entirety of hospital course.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**], was notified of the admission and agreed Bactrim could be discontinued as clean wound and no fevers or leukocytosis at time of discharge.
No signs of active flares.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed ([**Company 24997**] Lesion)  Secondary Diagnosis: Acute Renal Failure, Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
In addition, your creatinine was significantly elevated when you arrived at the hospital, suggesting that you were in acute renal failure.
Finally, you had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on [**2111-8-29**], that led to a very high heart rate and low blood pressure.
This was likely the result of your acute blood loss and low red blood cell level (hematocrit).
