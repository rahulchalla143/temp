Admission Date:  [**2197-4-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2197-5-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2139-2-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  General surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58 year-old gentleman who is presenting for operative management of his familial carcinoma of the stomach.
He was seen in Dr.[**Name (NI) 6275**] office after a biopsy showing metaplasia of his stomach with a strong history of gastric cancer.
The only complication noted was a small splenic injury that was coagulated and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
On postoperative day number nine the patient ate slightly solid food that caused him to have some mid to low back pain and sort of obstructive symptoms.
He had an electrocardiogram and CK enzymes that ruled out any cardiac etiology and it was felt that this occurred secondary to obstruction from a food product.
He had a swallow study on [**5-5**] in the fluoroscopy that showed an obstructed area at the distal aspect of the S-pouch and a nasogastric tube was placed under direct visualization of the fluoroscopy.
By postoperative day 12 his pain had more or less resolved and he was continued as n.p.o.
He received physical therapy and was able to tolerate a soft solid diet by day 17 without much difficulty.
The pathology report from his lesion showed:  1) From the distal stomach chronic inactive gastritis with glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia extending to the proximal reaction margins.
4) Regional lymph nodes with reactive hyperplasia.
5) Omentum which was adipose tissue with recent hemorrhage.
Of note was one lymph node containing a fibrocalcific nodule possibly representing a remnant of an old granulomatous process.
