HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 36 year old male with a past medical history of endocarditis secondary to intravenous drug abuse resulting in tricuspid valve replacement that needed to be removed for infection.
The patient then had complete heart block requiring a pacemaker that was removed secondary to pocket infection.
On [**2140-2-6**], the patient was at home with his fiance when he had a cardiac arrest.
In the Emergency Room, the patient had an episode of ventricular tachycardia with prolonged QT that resolved with direct current cardioversion.
Past cardiac history:  In [**2132-5-28**], Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia endocarditis, in [**2132-9-27**], tricuspid valve vegetation, Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia; in [**2132-9-27**], septic emboli to the lungs, tricuspid valve resection, patent foramen ovale, tricuspid valve replacement, foramen ovale closure, third degree atrioventricular block, status post permanent pacemaker in [**2133-8-28**]; atrial lead placement, pacer reprogramming in [**2133-10-28**]; Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in [**2133-12-28**]; tricuspid valve prosthesis removed, atrial septal defect graft revision, epicardial pacemaker implanted; in [**2134-11-28**], pacemaker pocket was infected again; in [**2135-1-29**] heroin overdose, pacemaker removed; in [**2135-1-29**], cardia pacemaker wires were infected, removed through sternotomy.
No tobacco, no ethanol.
History of heroin abuse.
No scleral icterus.
There was a right ventricular heave.
Prominent neck veins secondary to lack of tricuspid valve.
Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema and good pulses.
No signs of endocarditis.
Cardiovascular:  While in the Cardiac Care Unit, the patient had a transvenous pacer placed for his complete heart block.
The patient was treated initially for Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, however, subsequent blood cultures showed that the patient was growing Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient had to have his transvenous pacer wire removed.
The patient had an echocardiogram on the [**6-21**] which showed left ventricular wall thickness was normal.
Right ventricular systolic function appeared to be depressed and there was abnormal diastolic septal motion position consistent with right ventricular volume overload; abnormal septal wall motion.
Aortic valve leaflets were normal with no masses or vegetatives.
Mitral valve was normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There was severe four plus tricuspid regurgitation because of the lack of a tricuspid valve.
Throughout the hospital course, the patient had episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia for which he was started on Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
With the history of complete heart block, the patient had a transvenous pacer in place at a heart rate to be left at a heart rate of 80.
The patient has no history of coronary artery disease.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was found to have Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia secondary to transvenous pacer wire infection.
After the pacer wire was removed, the patient had surveillance blood cultures done which were no longer positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient also had a neck ultrasound done which was negative for any sort of pus pockets.
Throughout the hospital course, the patient developed mild myelosuppression while on the Vancomycin, however, prior to discharge, the patient's white blood cell count had gone up to about 3 or 4 which was felt to be normal for him and the patient's white blood cell count was stable while on the Vancomycin.
The patient also had some issues with his creatinine being slightly elevated during the hospital course to a maximum of 1.4, however, this was felt to be prerenal and the patient was encouraged to take good p.o.
There were also some issues with the patient possibly being HIV infected given the lowering blood counts, however, the patient was found to be HIV negative and it was felt that the low blood counts were probably from the myelosuppression on the Vancomycin.
The patient also had a Panorex of the mouth to look for any sort of dental abscesses, but this was all negative and it was felt that the patient was infected from the transvenous pacer wire.
Complete heart block.
Tricuspid valve removal.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
Check white blood cell count as well as Vancomycin levels as well as BUN and creatinine while the patient is in rehabilitation to make sure the patient is not having any more myelosuppression or renal toxicity from the Vancomycin or is not getting prerenal.
If you have any further questions, please call [**Hospital1 188**].
