Admission Date:  [**2177-2-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2177-2-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-9-30**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old gentleman who has a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in the past including an inferior myocardial infarction in [**2171**] and a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2176-11-19**] who is admitted from [**Hospital6 33**] with an unstable anginal syndrome, a positive troponin, and negative creatine kinases.
The patient had been having several days of worsening exertional chest pain associated with some shortness of breath, diaphoresis; his typical anginal symptoms which led him to present to the outside hospital, at which time his studies became concerning for an acute coronary syndrome.
The patient's most recent cardiac catheterization prior to this admission revealed the following:  an ejection fraction of 38%, a normal left main, a 60% tubular middle left anterior descending artery with a totally occluded first diagonal, faint left-to-left collaterals, a distal left anterior descending artery of 90%, a small ramus with a proximal 70%, circumflex system with a 90% first obtuse marginal inferior lesion, and a 70% superior pole lesion, a diffusely diseased third obtuse marginal.
The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease with a moderate in-stent restenosis on previously placed posterior descending artery stent; unchanged from [**2175-8-20**] catheterization, and a posterior left ventricle that was totally occluded and filled by right-to-right collaterals.
The proximal to middle left anterior descending artery lesion underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting, and the distal left anterior descending artery was treated with a stent also.
The patient was directly admitted to the catheterization laboratory at [**Hospital6 33**], at which time he underwent a limited study notable for in-stent restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery stent placed in [**2175-8-20**] and a 90% distal left anterior descending artery occlusion, and a distal left anterior descending artery that was subtotally occluded immediately proximal to a prior distal left anterior descending artery stent.
The proximal left anterior descending artery 80% in-stent restenosis underwent successful brachy therapy, and a stent was placed in the distal left anterior descending artery proximal to a prior stent to treat a restenosis.
The procedure was complicated by hypotension in to the 70s with bradycardia into the 40s, in a sinus rhythm.
An echocardiogram done on the catheterization table revealed no evidence of tamponade.
It was felt that the patient was having an severe vagal reaction.
He was started on dopamine which was eventually increased to 10 mcg/kg per minute, and the Coronary Care Unit team was then asked to evaluate and observe the patient overnight while peripheral anatropes were weaned.
Coronary artery disease; status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2171**], status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2176-11-19**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history notable for coronary artery disease and diabetes in multiple family members.
Neck was supple, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities revealed soaked dressing, no femoral bruits.
No firmness or ecchymosis consistent with a hematoma, preserved distal pulses.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  CT of the abdomen, pelvis, and leg revealed a 1.5-cm X 1.5-cm hematoma with surrounding fat stranding.
No evidence of an acute hemorrhage or continued extravasation of fluid.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for management of hypotension, for which the short differential included active blood loss which was effectively ruled out by the CT study and a vagal response necessitating inotropic support.
Over the course of the first evening in the Coronary Care Unit the patient became progressively anxious and reported difficulty urinating, and eventually was given 1 mg of Ativan.
Electrocardiogram showed no evolving changes.
The patient did suffer nonsustained ventricular tachycardia while in house.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the setting of unstable angina.
