Admission Date:  [**2110-10-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-10-8**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization x 2  History of Present Illness: 88 year old female with hx of anterior STEMI s/p DES to mid-LAD in [**2100**], breast cancer s/p lumpectomy and XRT, thyroid cancer s/p thyroidectomy, sensineural deafness s/p cochlear implant, type II DM, HTN and HLD presenting with left arm pain and found to have inferior STEMI.
The patient reports the onset of left arm pain radiating from the elbow to the shoulder with associated nausea and shortness of breath while eating breakfast this morning.
She lay down to rest, but the pain didn't improve.
She denies any associated chest pain, did have some vomiting and diaphoresis.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.7, 90, 168/67, 20, 98% Labs and imaging significant for troponin of 0.28, EKG showing ST elevations in the inferior leads.
Sent to cath lab, where she was found to have obstruction of a distal branch of PDA, too tight to pass stent and balloon angioplasty of the lesion was performed.
Also found to have 90% in-stent restenosis of LAD stent.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Family History: Family history significant for premature CAD, brother MI age 50 and mother MI ?
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
No hematoma or bruit.
SKIN: venous insufficiency changes of bilateral ankles  On Discharge: Unchanged from above.
Borderline diagnostic Q waves recorded in leads II, III and aVF and continued ST segment elevation in these leads and slight ST segment elevation in leads V4-V6.
Rule out active inferolateral ischemic process.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenosis of the LMCA.
The LAD has diffuse disease and a 90% in-stent re-stenosis in its mid-portion with flow distal to the stenosis.
The LCx has mild, angiographically apparent disease with no flow limiting lesions.
The RCA has diffuse mild disease with occluded small PDA that was deemed the culprit vessel.
There was no aortic valve gradient seen on careful pullback from the left ventricle to aorta.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
EKG [**2110-10-5**]: Sinus rhythm and significant Q waves in leads II, III and aVF and continued ST segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF and V5-V6 with now biphasic T waves in leads III and aVF.
These findings are consistent with further evolution of acute inferolateral myocardial infarction.
Cardiac Cath [**2110-10-6**]: Findings ESTIMATED blood loss: <100 cc Hemodynamics (see above): Coronary angiography:  right dominant LMCA:  No angiographically apparent CAD LAD:  mid vessel in-stent restenosis and disease between prior stents 80% LCX:  Mild luminal irregularities RCA:  Not injected  Interventional details Change for 6 French XB3.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild calcific mitral stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
CXR [**10-8**]: IMPRESSION: Right basilar subsegmental atelectasis.
No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Labs on Discharge: [**2110-10-8**] 06:05AM BLOOD WBC-5.3 RBC-2.89* Hgb-8.4* Hct-25.8* MCV-89 MCH-29.1 MCHC-32.5 RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-204 [**2110-10-8**] 06:05AM BLOOD Glucose-128* UreaN-18 Creat-1.1 Na-140 K-4.2 Cl-105 HCO3-28 AnGap-11  Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo F with hx CAD s/p anterior STEMI and DES to mid-LAD, breast cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, diabetes presenting with left arm pain and found to have inferior STEMI s/p balloon angioplasty of R-PDA as well as 90% in-stent restenosis of LAD.
# STEMI/CAD: Patient presented with left arm pain and was found to have inferior STEMI.
The patient had STEMI in [**2100**] and is s/p DES to LAD and was found to have evidence of 90% in-stent restenosis.
Home lisinopril was held initially given elevated Cr and recent dye load from cath.
# PUMP:  Previous history of decreased EF following MI in [**2100**], with subsequent improvement.
No history of CHF symptoms.
Mild calcific mitral stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
On [**10-7**] the patient had elevated glucose and was restarted on glipizide and ISS increased.
Transitional: -A1C not at goal, will need outpatient management for improvement of glycemic control.

Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and needed to have a balloon angioplasty to open up the artery that was blocked.
