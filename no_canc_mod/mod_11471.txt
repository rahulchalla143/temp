PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, Mr. [**Known lastname 43093**] was a morbidly obese middle-aged man in no acute distress.
His neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly or carotid bruits.
Heart showed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, with no abdominal wall hernias or other palpable masses.
His extremities were warm and well perfused, with trace edema, and early venous stasis changes.
He had no focal neurological or motor deficits.
The patient had some complaints of nausea early on postoperative day number one, so he was maintained n.p.o.
At about noon on postoperative day number one, the patient began to complain of pain across his chest that was constant and worsened by inspiration.

Due to the aforementioned events and the patient's significant risk factors, the decision was made to transfer the patient to the surgical intensive care unit at that time.
The patient's chest pain resolved significantly after three rounds of sublingual nitroglycerin tablets.
The decision was also made at this time to study the patient by CAT scan of the chest for the possibility of pulmonary embolus.
This was found to be a negative study with the CAT scan being completely nonsuggestive of pulmonary embolus.
His chest pain resolved without further medication and was present by postoperative day number two with only a cough.
His abdomen was soft and his incision was healing nicely.
The patient continued to improve and tolerated stage I diet with no difficulty.
