CXR ([**8-22**]) n the interim, there has been placement of bibasilar pigtail catheters with markedly reduction of bilateral pleural effusions.
Small left greater than right pleural effusions remain.
There is persistent left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity, most likely due to left lower lobe collapse.
There is a discoid atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
CXR ([**8-23**])  There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged compared with [**2167-8-22**].
There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, unchanged allowing for technique.
There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, probably slightly improved.
There is patchy opacity at the right base, likely reflecting atelectasis.
There is minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles.
No pneumothorax is detected.
CXR [**2167-8-24**]  No significant change in upper zone pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion, cardiomegaly, and small bilateral pleural effusions.

ACTIVE ISSUES: #Acute on chronic CHF and bilateral pleural effusions: Pt was admitted in [**6-/2167**] and ECHO at that time showed LVEF Of 30-35%.
CXR on admission showed pleural effusions (singificantly increased in size from prior imaging in [**Month (only) 116**]) and pulmonary edema consistent with CHF exacerbation.
Physical exam also consistent with volume overload with severe lower extremity peripheral edema.
Repeat echocardiogram showed regional LV wall motion abnormality with EF of ~25%.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted and bilateral pigtail catheters were insterted and drained a total of 1.5L of pleural fluid which was culture negative (AFB culture only pending at the time of discharge).
Dischrage CXR showed resolution of pulmonary edema with small residual effusions, significantly improved since admission.
She will be discharged on torsemide 10 mg PO daily for volume control, and has been educated in low-sodium diet by nutrition consult team.
She may also benefit from spironolactone or low-dose digoxin if chronically symptomatic.
Hypotension thought to be secondaruy to worsening LV dysfunction with cardiogenic shock.
Given tachycardia and episodes of Afib dopamine was changed to vasopressin.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient with history of atrial fibrillation and was previously anticoagulated with warfarin.
However, given supratherapeutic INRs (see below) and hematoma with attempted PICC placement, she was felt to be a poor candidate for triple therapy.
During this admission, the patient was initially in sinus rhythm on telemetry but subsequently developed multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rate to 100s-110s.
Amiodarone was suggested to improve rhythm/rate control; however her daughter is concerned that this medication was responsible for a skin reaction during a prior admission and did not want her mother to receive this medication.
In the future, amiodarone may be considered if there is poor rate control with current dose of metoprolol succinate as blood pressures may not tolerate further uptitration.
# Somnolence: Upon admission pt was somnolent and reportedly confused.
Pt was pancultured to rule out sepsis as source.
She did have an episode of confusion in the evening of [**2167-8-25**] in the setting of low blood pressure to systolic of 90 (other vitals including temperature and O2 sat were stable).
Her symptoms self-resolved and were attributed to low blood pressure with possible component of sundowning.
# UTI: Pt had urine culture positive for pan-sensitive E. coli.
# Anticoagulation/hematoma: INR elevated on admission at 4.7 and her coumadin was held.
Pt developed hematoma in R. arm after attempted PICC line placement.
# CAD: Pt has hx of LAD STEMI in [**2157**] and NSTEMI [**2167-7-6**] with BMS to LAD.
EKG on admision shows STD in V3-V6 which are likely related to LV strain in the setting of LVH and tachycardia.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
# Diabetes Mellitus: -She remained on insulin SS for the majority of her hosptial course, but home metformin and glipizide were restarted prior to discharge.
She will be sent to rehab for a brief period, with plans to return home where she is overseen by her daughter, who is very involved.
- Pleural fluid (left and right side) AFB cultures were pending at the time of discharge (AFB smear negative) - Urine culture from [**2167-8-25**] pending at the time of discharge (U/A from [**2167-8-25**] showed 154 WBC, +LE, -nitrites, -bacteria, +yeast) - For her systolic heart failure, she should be started on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient as blood pressures allow.
- For her atrial fibrillation, her warfarin has been held given the risk of bleeding with concurrent aspirin and clopidogrel.
Her metoprolol succinate has been uptitrated to 200 mg PO daily but may require further titration depending on blood pressure and rates while in atrial fibrillation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] LivingCenter - Elmhurst - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive heart failure Bilateral Pleural effusions Paroxsysmal Atrial fibrillation Urinary tract infection Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You had an acute exacerbation of your congestive heart failure and required bipap ventilation and furosemide intravenously to get rid of the extra fluid.
You also had pleural effusions, a collection of fluid near the base of the lung.
Your atrial fibrillation has been intermittant and is very fast when it occurs.
We have increased the metoprolol to prevent a fast heart rate and your warfarin has been discontinued because you are already on 2 other strong blood thinners.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] feels that the risk of serious bleeding from 3 blood thinners is greater than the risk of a stroke at this time.
Please weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Start senna and metamucil to prevent constipation 5.
