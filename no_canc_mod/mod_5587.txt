Studies [**2167-4-28**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm with capture.Compared to the previous tracing of [**2167-4-21**] the atrial rate is increased andthere is now evidence of ventricular pacing.
[**2167-4-28**] RENAL TRANSPLANT ULTRASOUND: Normal-appearing left lower quadrant renal transplant without hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid.
[**2167-4-28**] CHEST PA/LAT: Interstitial markings may be mostly due to crowding due to markedly low lung volumes, however, mild volume overload cannot be entirely excluded on the basis of this examination.
Status post bilateral nephrectomy with two renal grafts in the pelvis, one atrophic on the right and the other a normal sized graft on the left.
Assessment for pyelonephritis is limited without the administration of IV contrast.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Abnormal septal motion most likely due to conduction abnormality.
[**2167-4-30**] Chest port line placement HISTORY: 49 year old female with new left PICC.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**2167-4-29**]  PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The new left PICC crosses the midline and then curves upwards.

There is mild vascular engorgement and stable mild cardiomegaly.
New left PICC, tip pointing superiorly, possibly in proximal SVC or azygos vein.
No pneumothorax.
Mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.
[**2167-5-1**] Foot AP,LAT & OBL BILAT INDICATION: Question osteomyelitis with heel ulcers.
The amputated margins are smooth and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis.
In the heel, there is mild subcutaneous lucency but a discrete ulcer is not identified.
There is a small plantar calcaneal spur.
The overlying cortex is preserved and there is no osteolysis or periosteal reaction.
Vascular calcifications are also noted.
There are chronic fractures of the second and third metatarsal distal shafts.
There is no acute fracture.
There is a small plantar ulcer superficial to the calcaneus which does not extend to bone.
Overlying cortex of the calcaneus is intact without osteolysis or periosteal reaction.
There is a small plantar calcaneal spur.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.

# Diabetes Type I with diabetic ketoacidosis (A1c 8.8): She developed DKA In the setting of medication non-adherence and sepsis.
She had intermittently refused fingersticks and insulin, citing that her FSG were "satisfactory."
# Sepsis from a urinary source with E. coli bacteremia Urinalysis indicative of urinary tract infection with risk factors including diabetes and straight catheterization in setting of probable neurogenic bladder.
She was started on vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency department and transitioned to ciprofloxacin and vancomycin due to her history of beta-lactam resistant enterobacter previously.
She was broadened to cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin when she developed worsening fevers and rigors on [**4-30**] with E. coli bacteremia.
She subsequently was afebrile with negative surveillance cultures for at least 48 hours.
No evidence of shunt on ECHO.
She refused flu swab, and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] droplet precautions were lifted secondary to low suspicion of influenza.
Patient subsequently had no further issues with oxygenation.
# Acute renal failure with history of renal transplant: She is on chronic immunosuppresion.
Her baseline creatinine is around 0.9 with elevation to 1.5 during hospitalization likely consistent with intrinsic process including urinary tract infection and ATN in setting of sepsis given many WBC and granular casts.
Likely anemia of chronic inflammation.
Consider iron supplementation given Fe/TIBC of 8 % and Ferritin 139 in setting of chronic disease.
# Impaired skin integrity on heel Patient with impaired skin integrity noted on admission likely from DM and PVD on bilateral heels.
No apparent superinfection or cellulitis.
Plain film of both feet not suggestive of osteomyelitis.
She will need careful monitoring of area as high risk for infection.
