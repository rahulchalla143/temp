PULMONARY:  The patient underwent a CT angiogram on [**2111-3-18**] to rule out chronic pulmonary emboli given the results of echocardiogram, see below.
CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary emboli, did show some improvement in left sided effusion as well as some chronic atelectasis and emphysematous changes.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient underwent cardio echocardiogram to evaluate systolic function given concern that congestive heart failure might be contributing to bilateral pleural effusions.
However, abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular volume and pressure overload was noted.
The RV was dilated compared to the prior report on [**2111-1-9**] with increased tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient was sent for CT angiogram to rule out a chronic pulmonary emboli as the source of pulmonary hypertension.
Given a negative CT angiogram, it is thought that the patient's worsening pulmonary hypertension and RV dilation might more likely reflect amiodarone toxicity with resulting pulmonary fibrosis in the intervals since the last cardiac echocardiogram.
The patient was started on captopril low dose for concern for congestive heart failure, but this was discontinued given a normal ejection fraction and the fact that the patient's blood pressure was not tolerating additional antihypertensives.
