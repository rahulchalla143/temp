Admission Date: [**2181-1-19**]        Discharge Date: [**2181-2-9**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:   SERVICE:  Gold Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old female who had been discharged the day previously from the medical service after having an episode of cholangitis.
During that hospitalization, she was also found to have a severe COPD and required significant pulmonary toilet as well as steroids and inhalers.
After getting home, the patient ate a snack and immediately developed severe right upper quadrant pain and the pain was nonradiating and sharp.
She did have a cough and reported a positive sputum which she had been treated for in the hospital with Levaquin.
She also had significant shortness of breath.
Diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
She had decreased breath sounds.
There were significant expiratory wheezes.
She had some mild right upper quadrant tenderness with no rebound and some voluntary guarding.
Ultrasound showed multiple stones with some mild gallbladder wall thickening but no ductal dilatation.
A CT scan was performed to evaluate her pancreatitis as well as the GI service was consulted for evaluation of her stent, question of whether or not this was obstructing.
Her CT scan showed extensive pancreatic necrosis and the patient was admitted to the surgical service.
She continued to require a significant amount of fluids as well as having decreased 02 saturations.
Her oxygen saturation improved and she reached a sat of 98% on a face mask but continued to have poor oxygenation on blood gases.
She was continued on vanco, Meropenem, and fluconazole for prophylaxis with the necrosis of her pancreas.
Repeat CT scan showed no improvement of her pancreatic necrosis and some mild fluid.
She continued to have severe pulmonary issues and required increasing ventilatory support.
Dermatology was consulted for a rash on her body which was felt to be drug related.
She was kept on an insulin drip for tight blood glucose control as she had elevated blood sugars from her diabetes postoperatively as well as from her extensive pancreatic necrosis.
[**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes was consulted as the patient had very little residual pancreatic function.
The patient began having high secretions from a pulmonary standpoint and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including vanco and Zosyn.
She began having high temperatures shortly thereafter.
Her lines were changed and tips were sent for culture.
Her sputum ultimately grew out E. coli as well as MRSA and her peritoneal fluid grew out gram-negative rods from the JP drains.
She was also started on fluconazole after her peritoneal fluid from her JP had mild fungus.
ID was consulted as the patient continued to have high fevers while on appropriate antibiotics.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2181-2-4**] and it was found that she had minimal secretions at that time and her airway was patent.
From an abdominal standpoint, her abdomen was well drained with the JP drains and there were no residual fluid collections and the area of fluctuance over her right flank was also drained percutaneously at the bedside with only minimal serous fluid recovered.
CT scan imaging showed that she had complete collapse of both bilateral lower lobes and significant atelectasis.
Again, the patient had a brachial A line placed in order for blood gas evaluation and hemodynamic monitoring.
This showed that the patient continued to have very poor oxygenation and began having high PC02 levels even with complete aggressive pulmonary management.
A new A-line was placed on the 25th and the patient continued to have significantly poor oxygenation and 02 sats slowly began to drop.
