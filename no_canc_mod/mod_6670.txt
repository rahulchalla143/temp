Today at rehab, the pt had T 104 rectally, SBP in the 80s, and received Vanc, diflucan, cipro and imipenem.
Reported chronic abd pain and nausea.
Past Medical History: -Status-post ascending aorta to descending aorta bypass graft with 18mm gelweave [**2110-1-29**] -Repair of right ventricular laceration and sternal wound debridement [**2-10**] -Coarctation of the distal Arch s/p Surgical Repair of Arch/Desc.
-Aorta w/ Homograft via Left Thoracotomy at age 13 -Bicuspid Aortic Valve -Congestive Heart Failure: most recent echo was TEE [**2-21**] done after RV laceration repair, but at that time EF was >55% -Hypercholesterolemia -Psoriatic Arthritis -Osteoarthritis -Asthma -Sciatica -Hemorrhoids -Meckel's Diverticulum s/p surgery -Right Lung Nodule -s/p L2-L3, L4-L5 sacral fusion -s/p L Subacromial decompression via arthroscopy -s/p Appendectomy -s/p Open Cholecystectomy -s/p R Inguinal Hernia Repair -s/p Nasal surgery for deviated septum -s/p Lens Implants -h/o HIT -recent MRSA pneumonia -h/o atrial fibrillation during hospitalization -h/o VRE bacteremia (linezolid through [**2110-4-2**]) -recent MRSE aortic graft infection -s/p open jejunostomy tube placement [**2110-2-24**] -s/p percutaneous tracheostomy [**2110-3-21**]  Social History: No tobacco, no EtOH.
Granulation tissue over sternum with no dehiscence or evidence of infection.
CV: distant heart sounds, regular rate/rhythm, no murmur appreciated.
Ext: 2+ pitting edema bilat lower extremities .
ucx [**5-7**]: no growth .
Unchanged appearance of fluid collection surrounding the distal portion of the aorto-aortic graft, again contiguous with a pleural fluid collection.
Large cardiac silhouette reflecting cardiomegaly with pericardial effusion.
Persistent bibasilar atelectasis, with small-to-moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-4**], there is no significant change.
Ucx results from rehabd: [**5-6**]: >100,000 pseudomonas, resistant to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ticarcillin-clav sensitive to cefepime, cipro, gent, impipenem, pip, tobra, amikacin, zosyn bcx 5/28,[**5-7**] no growth Sputum [**5-7**] pending Urine [**5-7**]: pending   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 62 M with a h/o aortic coarctation s/p bypass in [**3-13**] complicated by sternal wound dehiscence and RV rupture s/p repair, VRE bacteremia, fungemia, VAP, returning from rehab with fever.
He received one dose of flagyl for possible c. diff.
While UTI was thought to be the primary source of infection, other possible sources of infection included pleural effusion (?empyema), persistently infected graft, line infection, VAP, decub ulcers or potentially c.diff.
His rehab was called and it was discovered he had pseudomonas growing in a ucx from [**5-6**] (pls see results section for sensitivity data).
The cause of his resp failure was probably deconditioning and inability to generate adequate negative intrathoracic pressure with the flail chest.
Abdominal pain: Pt had RLQ pain at presentation, as well as nausea.
Abdominal CT did not show any source for the abdominal pain and his abd exam was not impressive.
Aortic bypass graft: Pt has a known chronically infected graft.
Anemia: Likely from chronic disease.
FEN: Poor nutritional status, with low albumin.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Diflucan (started [**2110-5-7**])   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Urinary Tract Infection Anemia   Discharge Condition: Pt at baseline with no fevers   Discharge Instructions: Please take your medications as prescribed.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, dizziness or other concering symptoms.
