Pt recently had cardiac cath in [**2-11**] for anginal symptoms resulting in PCI with cypher stents placed in the Left Circumflex and LAD.
Patient also had an MI approximately 10 years ago.
Bilateral total knee replacements performed at the OSH without complications and with minimal blood loss.
Post op in the PACU, patient developed CP, diaphoresis, and SOB.
Initial EKG at OSH showed afib, prominent ST elev in v2-v6, 1, and aVL, and ST depressions in inferior leads.
Catherization at [**Hospital1 18**] showed 100% proximal stent restenosis, diffuse RCA disease, and a patent Left Circumflex stent.
The catherization was complicated by the development of wide complex tachycardia and hypotension (SBP 80s).
The patient als developed persistent distal LAD spasm and treated with Nitroglycerin IC and Nipride.
Of note, Persantine MIBI [**9-12**] showed small fixed inferior defect with slight atypical redistribution suggestive of ischemia.
Echo also done [**9-12**] showed normal LVEF of 60%, concentric LVH, and moderate MR.   Past Medical History: CAD  -s/p PCI to L circ and LAD in [**2-11**]  -s/p MI [**04**] years ago  -[**9-12**]: pMIBI showed a small fixed inferior defect with slight  apical redistribution suggestive of ischemia.

Vascular calcifications are present in the aorta and splenic vessels.
There is no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

Based on [**2191**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Course by System:  A. Cardiovascular  Ischemia:  Patient had MI ten years ago and is s/p stent of Left Circumflex and LAD [**2-11**].
Immediately post-op patient had chest pain and developed dynamic EKG changes suggestive of a large anterior STEMI (confirmed by enzymes peaking at CPK of 4741 and Troponin of 14.95).
Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catherization, which showed 100% proximal lesion in his LAD stent, diffuse RCA disease, and a patent Left Circumflex stent.
However, there was large componenent of distal LAD spasm in the setting of pressors and ?embolization.
Pt had massive CK leak and was found in cardiogenic shock necessitating dopamine and IABP from cath lab.
After hypotension resolved, pt was started on Coreg and Captopril.
Meanwhile, his lipitor was increased to 80 mg.  CHF: Pt admitted w/ anterior STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock.
He was hypotensive in cath lab requiring maximum doses of dopamine and also trialed on dobutamine.
Echo during hospitalization showed EF of 20% with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Meanwhile, he be anti-coagulated w/ coumadin given large apical wall akinesis.
Lovenox will be used as bridging therapy w/ goal inr 2.0  Rhythm:  History of chronic afib.
During cath lab, initially found w/ wide complex tachycardia w/ compromised hemodynamics.
At one point during hospital course, attempted DCCV in attempt to improved hemodynamics w/ sinus rhythm.
Meanwhile, pt had frequent runs of NSVT during course.
C.  Heme Patient's Hematocrit fell below 27 several times during hospitalization, likely secondary to bleeding within knees in the setting of anti-coagulation.
Addominal CT was performed was negative for retro-peritoneal bleed.
D.  Respiratory Initially intubated in the cath lab for cardiogenic shock.
E.  Neuro Patient's pain was initially managed with PO vicodin.
As a result, patient was given IV Morphine which resulted in a change in mental status.
The patient was then given oxycodone, standing tylenol, and Ultram for pain management.
G.  Prophx Patient was given senna/colace for constipation prophx, protonix for GI prophx, Heparin for DVT prophx.
