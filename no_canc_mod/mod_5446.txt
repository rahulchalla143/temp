The shortness of breath is worse with exertion and especially going up stairs, as well as worsened by supine position, but this has been building for about one month.

She continues to have b/l LE swelling and edema with superficial redness.

Physical Exam: Cardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal), (Murmur: No(t) Systolic, No(t) Diastolic) Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Not assessed), (Left radial pulse: Not assessed), (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse: Present) Respiratory / Chest: (Breath Sounds: Clear : , No(t) Crackles : , Wheezes : ) Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, ostomy with green liquid stool output Extremities: Right: 3+, Left: 3+ Skin:  Warm, Erythemous lesions on LE Neurologic: Attentive, Follows simple commands, Responds to: Not assessed, Oriented (to): x3, Movement: Not assessed, Tone: Not assessed   Pertinent Results: Bicarb  Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mrs. [**Known lastname 7474**] is a 75 y/o female with advanced CKD and ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap academia in setting of increased ostomy output and some worsening of renal failure.
Likely related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy output .
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE V. Worsened 3.0 ??????
3.9 without appreciable drop in urine output according to the patient and husband.
- Awaiting renal's decision re: initiation of HD timing - If HD this admit will need access; likely tunneled line; has seen transplant as outpatient for access options.
INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT - consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics, elevated WBC which responded with flagyl initiation, though would be rare to have enteritis without colon.
No obvious bleeding source or hematoma.
- check hemolysis panel today (?history of this in the past per notes from several years ago) -  T&S, would not transfuse unless <21 -  Consider restart of epo - both MDS and significant CKD.
- Guaiac ostomy output.
Mostly exertional; likely related to acidemia and need for significant respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.
- Treatment of acidosis as above  &#9658; CELLULITIS.
unclear if this is a new finding of infection or related to venous stasis.
Was being managed by derm as outpatient for venous stasis.
Add on vanco level today - Continue topical antifungal powder - Bilat LE ultrasounds to r/o collections - done, negative for collections.
CAD -  ?On aspirin daily ??????
will check into  GERD  - continue protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] (on at home)  MICU Course: Patient noted to have shortness of breath in setting of low bicarb and ongoing diarrhea.
Likely secondary to worsening renal failure and increased ostomy output.
Noted to have elevated WBC so treated with vanco for cellulitis (b/l thigh cellulitis clinically improving on vanco), cipro for positive ua (UCx not sent), and flagyl for increased ostomy output (though patient is s/p colectomy for UC which has improved with flagyl).
