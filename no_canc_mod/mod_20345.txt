The patient was in her USOH until last night when she noted to have a change in mental status and was seen slumped to the LEFT in her wheel-chair.
The patient was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital where a CT scan of the brain revealed an acute RIGHT thalamic bleed (4:20 am) of about 10cc.
She had resultant RIGHT sided weakness, with short-term memory dysfunction but was eventually able to return home and take care of her own ADLs.
-Second intracranial event also of unclear etiology in [**2164**].
RIGHT sided weakness worsened.

CT head at admission: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the right thalamus with surrounding edema and mass effect.
There is small amount of intraventricular extension, although no evidence of hydrocephalus at this time.
No new hemorrhages are noted.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 61 year old woman with a history of ICH ('[**54**] and '[**64**]) with residual R-sided symptoms who presented with new left sided weakness that was worse in the arm than leg and included her face.
She was found to have a R-thalamic hemorrhage in the setting of HTN.
The has increased reflexes on the R (related to her old hemorrhages).
A repeat CT-head [**9-11**] showed no interval change.
For management of agitation she was started on seroquel.
Given her history of previous hemorrhages and hypertension, the cause of the present hemorrhage is most likely hypertensive.
Cardiovascular: The patient has hypertension that was relatively well controled with labetolol and lasix (standing dose) and metoprolol PRN.
She remained ventilator dependent and a trach was placed [**9-13**].
There is no neurological reason for her difficulties to wean.
Prior to discharge, she was tolerating hours of CPAP and it is expected that she will be weaned successfully.
No source of GI bleeding was found.
Infectious disease: The patient developed a fever [**9-15**].
Possible underlying etiology was aspiration pneumonia or UTI (enterococ in urine, sensitive to levaquin).
Lasix 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for fluid overload: based on daily weight.
