Admission Date:  [**2180-12-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-1-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-10-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Nadolol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**] Chief Complaint: HCV cirrhosis, upper GI bleed, cerebral edema  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left IJ Central line R arterial line mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: 49 y.o.
Endoscopy revealed bleeding esophageal varices which were banded x 3 but she continued to bleed and required a repeat endoscopy the following day with three more bands placed to achieve hemostasis.
She remained hypotensive and required pressor (levophed).
Initially, she remained unresponsive off sedation, presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy.
CT head revealed large areas of brain edema in the parietal and temporal lobes.
Previously worked in the banking and bond trading business for approximately 15 years, then worked part-time as a secretary and administrative assistant at a chiropractor's office.
No longer working given her worsening encephalopathy.
Significant h/o polysubstance abuse, including marijuana, hallucinogens, cocaine, heroin (all last used in early 20s), as well as prescription narcotics (last in [**2-15**]), and tobacco.
Family History: + lung cancer in M aunt + alcoholism M - DM type II, HTN, depression/anxiety, alcoholism F - doesn't know her father 2 brothers, 1 sister - all alcoholics one brother is being considered as her liver donor   Physical Exam: VS: 98.5, 89/51, 61, 23, 93% on AC/500/12(22)/5/1.0 GEN: sedated, obese female HEENT: pupils small but reactive LUNGS: decreased BS at left base HEART: RRR, nl S1S2, no m/r/g ABD: hypoactive BS, soft, nd/nt EXT: no edema NEURO: with propofol off, withdraws to noxious stimuli.
There is  consolidation of the left base either representing atelectasis or pneumonia.
There is a likely small associated left pleural effusion .
CT head [**2180-12-21**]: IMPRESSION: Bilateral temporal lobe edema with effacement of the subjacent temporal horns of the lateral ventricle temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricles.
There appears to be extension of edema into the left parietal region with mild sulcal effacement.
Images from outside hospital would be useful to assess for interval change.
ATTENDING NOTE: I think that the white matter hypodensity involves both cerebral hemispheres with predominent involvement of temporal lobes.
Conditions such herpres encephgalitis should be considered in the differential but extensive involvement of frontal and parietal lobes is somewhat unusual.
A mark was made at the left lower quadrant for paracentesis to be performed by the clinical staff.
Small right pleural effusion.
EEG [**2180-12-22**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured one electrographic seizure with onset in the left temporal region, which then spread to both hemispheres and lasted for about two minutes.
The background activity in wakefulness showed bursts of generalized slowing and occasional left posterior quadrant slowing.
Normal CT angiography and CT venography with no vascular stenosis or occlusion, and no venous thrombosis.
Unchanged diffuse hypodensity throughout white matter tracts symmetrically involving both temporal, and, to a lesser extent, frontal lobes.
The findings are suggestive of cerebral edema due to a systemic or metabolic cause, including liver failure or related metabolic abnormalities.
[**12-24**] EEG Impression: This 24 hour video EEG telemetry captured no electrographic seizures or pushbutton activations.
Automated and routine sampling demonstrated periods of generalized slowing consistent with an underlying encephalopathy.
Occasional periods of slowing were seen in the temporal parietal leads consistent with more focal regions of underlying cortical or subcortical dysfunction.
Unchanged diffuse hypodensity involving the white matter tracts predominantly involving the temporal lobe, also involving the frontal lobes.
The differential diagnosis includes cerebral edema due to the liver failure.
MRI of the head is the best modality for evaluation of the white matter disease and cerebral edema.
No other acute intracranial pathology is identified.
[**12-25**] EEG IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no ongoing seizure activity.
Routine samplings showed a background suggestive of an encephalopathy involving both superficial and deeper structures and additional slowing in the left mid-temporal region.
[**12-26**] EEG IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no clinical or electrographic seizures.
The background activity was slow with additional bursts of generalized slowing suggestive of an encephalopathy and with focal slowing and sharp and slow wave complexes in the left temporal and posterior areas.
Abnormal T2- and FLAIR-signal identified bilaterally, most intense at the insular cortex.
Abnormal signal also seen in the medial and inferior temporal lobes, bilaterally.
Findings raise the possibility of herpetic or other viral encephalitis, though there is no restricted diffusion or hemorrhage.
Signal abnormality appears to involve more than simply the white matter tracts, with involvement of the insular cortex as well as the cortex in the temporal lobes.
This more global picture again raises concern for previous hypoxic/anoxic brain injury, possibly with secondary acute demyelination.
Examination is otherwise without change except for improving aeration at the lung bases with associated slight increase in lung volumes.
There were no focal lateralized or epileptiform features noted .
There are low lung volumes.
There is no pleural effusion.
female with Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis, initially admitted to [**Hospital6 **] with variceal bleeding, stabilized endoscopically, but then developed altered mental status, presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, and intubated for airway protection.
# Neuro: Pt had acutely AMS at OSH and was found to have developed cerebral edema after her initial variceal bleed.
Initialy, her AMS was attributed to severe hepatic encephalopathy.
Nonetheless, she was continued on lactulose and rifaxamin for any contribution of hepatic encephalopathy to her AMS.
CT head upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU revealed bilateral cerebral edema, primarily of the temporal lobes, most concerning for HSV encephalitis.
Neurology was consulted and recommeded EEG and empiric coverage for HSV encephalitis with acyclovir (10mg/kg Q8H).
The MICU team also emperically covered for bacterial meningitis with CTX/Vancomycin, beginning [**2180-12-21**].
Her continuous EEG showed evidence of seizure activity at that time, and she was loaded with Keppra and maintenance dose begun.
Serial head imaging revealed stable cerebral edema but no evidence of CVA.
On [**12-26**] a head MRI revealed not only diffuse bitemporal abnormailties as previously seen, but also extension into the grey matter, concerning for prior anoxic brain injury.
She had no subsequent problems protecting her airway, but remained forgetful and altered.
A repeat EEG was ordered per neurology to re-evaluate for subclinical seizure, which was without any evidence of seizure.
Her prognosis is uncertain as to recovery from her anoxic brain injury, and she is left with significant mental deficits (oriented to person only at time of transfer).
# Respiratory:  Initially was intubated at OSH for airway protection after she became confused, felt [**1-15**] hepatic encephalopathy, later felt to be cerebral edema (see above).
However, was noted at OSH to have fever and grew MRSA in sputum, so was started on Vanco on [**2180-12-20**] for a MRSA pneumonia.
Also of significance, at baseline, the patient has hepatopulmonary syndrome with PaO2 in the 60s.
She completed a 2 week course of vancomycin and remained afebrile subsequently.
Note should be made to avoid upright positioning for extended periods of time due to hepatopulmonary syndrome and orthodeoxia.
# GI/Liver - Initial presentation to [**Hospital3 **] Hosptial showed bleeding [**1-15**] esophageal varices and she was stabilized with volume resuscitation.
Diagnostic paracentesis on admission [**2180-12-21**] was negative for SBP.
# ID - initially was broadly covered out of concern for meningitis with vanc/CTX/acyclovir.
# Heme - has thrombocytopenia Likely [**1-15**] liver disease.
# Psych - has depression, held meds given mental status .
# PPx: pneumoboots, PPI .
# CODE: FULL, confirmed .
# Access -- CVL changed upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], then d/c'ed [**1-1**] after extubation with adequate PIVs in place.
Insulin Regular insulin sliding scale   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: anoxic brain injury vericeal bleeding Possible HSV encephalitis .
Secondary: end stage liver disease due to EtOH and HCV Hepatopulmonary Syndrome - baseline sats high 80s Depression   Discharge Condition: improved   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] after suffering a gastrointestinal bleed due to your liver disease.
However, you suffered swelling around the brain which necessitated intubation.
You were transferred to us seriously ill. You were treated for a possible infection of your brain, and will be finishing a course of medicine for this at your rehab.
Unfortunately, MRI scans of your head showed evidence of anoxic (lack of blood flow) brain injury, which may have occcurred from either blood loss or swelling around the brain.
