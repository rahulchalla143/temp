Repeat CT scan of the chest showed improved left lower lobe pneumonia, but a new consolidation was found in the posterior segment of the left upper lobe consistent with aspiration.
Since she continued to spike fevers and have elevated white counts, she was considered for a mini-tracheostomy that was supposed to be done on [**2142-6-4**].
However, she did defervesce with lowered white count to 13.3 48 hours prior the scheduled mini-tracheostomy placement on [**6-4**], so the mini-tracheostomy was cancelled.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Coronary artery disease with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
The patient did have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction during the hospital course, so Cardiology was consulted.
If she has further chest pain both either at rehabilitation center or at home, Norvasc can be recontinued, and the patient can be tried on a course of Imdur.
Also, morphine can be used to control the pain and even heparin can be started for 48 hours if the chest pain is accompanied by ST elevation changes on EKG.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Fever, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
It is likely that she has a fever due to her aspiration pneumonia.
PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient did become delirious while in the hospital requiring a one on one sitter.
This delirium is likely secondary to infections.
A TSH was checked and found to be slightly elevated at 5.1, so a free T4 was ordered.
The free T4 came back normal at 1.2; therefore, the patient likely does not have any thyroid abnormalities.
Also concerning with her delirium is a possibility of retaining carbon dioxide, so an arterial blood gas was done revealing pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 37, and PO2 of 90, saturating at 95% on room air.
Therefore, there is not a concern that she has a hypercarbic respiratory failure leading to the delirium.
HEMATOLOGY:  Elevated INR secondary to malnutrition.
Again, this elevated INR is believed secondary to her malnutrition.
Chronic ileus.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Bleeding diathesis secondary to malnutrition.
