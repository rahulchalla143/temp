His only symptome was dizziness, but he did not fall or loose consciousness.
He has not been eating well, and has been having diarrhea described as loose stools without melena or blood for the last 3 months.
Also reports leg weakness over the last several months.
Records indicate he was complaining of left foot pain to the parametics.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: Male in no distress.
VITALS: T 96.3 rectal HR 66 BP 90/57 RR 18 Sat 97%RA SKIN: no lesions HEENT: Anicteric, PERRL, Mild right lateral eye deviation, mouth dry NECK: No stiffness, No masses, No LAD, Palpable carotid pulses, no bruits, no tracheal deviation, no JVP elevation CHEST: no supraclavicular or axillary LAD, Lungs Clear to Asculation, No Wheezes/Rhonchi/Crackles HEART: Normal PMI, RRR, No Murmurs/Gallops/Rubs ABDOMEN: Flat, No scars, NABS, Soft, No organomegaly, No masses, No guarding, No rebound.
QUANTITY NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ACID FAST SMEAR (MAW).
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2101-12-15**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Since the previous tracing of [**2101-12-9**] sinus bradycardia is absent.
RENAL U.S.  [**2101-12-12**] 9:30 AM RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 10 cm and left kidney measures 11 cm, with no hydronephrosis, masses or stones.
The cortices of both kidneys are mildly thinned.
No echogenic calculi are identified.
A 1.4 x 1 x 1.2 cm simple cyst with increased through transmission is seen within the lower pole of the left kidney.
No evidence of echogenic renal calculi or hydronephrosis.
Mild thinning of the renal cortices which likely represents medical renal disease .
There are low inspiratory volumes.
There is continued opacity at the right base medially, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.
No gross effusion is identified.
No pneumothorax detected.
Compared with [**2101-12-10**] and allowing for differences in technique, there has probably been some re-expansion of atelectasis in the right lung.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2101-12-11**] 2:15 PM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.
No diffusion abnormalities are identified.
Bilateral T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities are grossly stable since [**2094-4-12**] and likely represent chronic small vessel ischemia.
There are no areas of abnormal enhancement.
MRA: The intracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries and their major branches are unremarkable without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.
Incidentally noted is a small right A1, likely a congenital variant.
IMPRESSION: Grossly unchanged since [**2094-4-12**] without evidence of acute intracranial process.
SLEEP: No transitions from sleep to wakefulness were seen.
IMPRESSION: This EEG demonstrates a slow background rhythm consistent with a mild encephalopathy or similar findings may be seen in patients with extensive subcortical white matter disease located bilaterally or in deep, midline locations.
No evidence of ongoing seizures is seen.
Head CT ([**12-10**]): CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2101-12-9**] 9:56 PM NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Again seen are scattered subcortical white matter hypodensities suggesting chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
The more focal area of hypoattenuation within the right frontal lobe anteriorly is unchanged compared to one day prior.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
Again, MRI with DWI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, or mass effect.
There are scattered periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities, suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
More focal hypodensity in the right frontal white matter may reflect a small lacunar infarct.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: Mild small vessel ischemic changes.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Was initially treated for sepsis and empirically on Levaquin for posssible sepsis, however no evidence of sepsis.
Seratonin syndrome was suspected in the setting of an elevated fluoxetine dose interacting with other medications, and all serotonergic medications were discontinued, including fluoxetine, buspirone, asacol and hysocamine.
CT head showed no acute changes.
He also received an initial dose of cyproheptadine, which did not impressively change his mental status.
He had an MRI with no acute change (results as above).
Prior to discharge, patient was oriented x 3 and appeared to back to baseline mental status.
Acute renal falure - this was in setting of acyclovir.
GI Bleed - patient had an episode of coffee ground emesis while in the ICU.
No episodes of abdominal discomfort.
Hyperlipidemia - LFTs were elevated so lipitor was held.
Htn - bp decreased while patient in the ICU.
Of note, during the course during the course of this hospitalization, the patient's cousin, [**Name (NI) 565**] [**Name (NI) 10743**] who is his HCP, allegedly threatened to kill one of the physicians due to the patient's acute delirium which likely resulted from unusually high doses of SSRIs.
Mr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 565**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10743**] stated that in event of a cardiac and respiratory arrest - he did want manual chest compressions but no shocks, mechanical ventilation, intubation or other artificial means of resuscitation.
It was discussed with him at length that manual compressions alone would rarely be effective without the other aspects of CPR eg shocks, mechanical ventilation etc.
He understood this and still wanted patient to only have manual compressions on chest.
Per her, the patient has mental retardation and will need further detailed neuropsych assessment to determine if the patient has capacity to make his medical decisions.
Since there were concerns during this hospital stay about the health care proxy's descisions and that the patient stated at times that the cousin wanted to shoot him, it would be best if patient had a formal capacity evaluation and further determination of the decision maker be deferred to that time.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Risperidone 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for agitation.
Diazepam 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] health care center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Altered mental status - likely secondary to serotonin syndrome Hypothermia - resolved Secondary: Acute renal failure - in setting of Acyclovir, resolved GI bleed Depression/Anxiety Dyslipidemia Crohn's Disease BPH s/p TURP Mental Retardation   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted due to hypothermia.
You subsequently had a change in your mental status, likely from an interaction of your medications (serotonin syndrome).
You subsequently were placed on a medication, Acyclovir that resulted in worsening of your kidney function.
Your Lipitor was held because there was an elevation in your liver enzymes.
Your Metoprolol was held due to low blood pressures.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you were to develop worsening headache, change in your vision, high fever, or increased confusion.
