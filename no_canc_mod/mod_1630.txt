Admission Date:  [**2139-1-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-1-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-2-26**]       Sex:  M   CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Ascites, scrotal swelling, shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55 year old male with infarction times two, status post four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2135-3-6**], hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, who reports he has had increased swelling of his abdomen and legs with swelling of the scrotum which has progressed over two to three weeks' time.
He also has had associated and frequent shortness of breath and inability to move.
There, he was assumed to have biventricular failure as the cause of his edema.
An abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly and a renal consult thought patient was pre-renal and therefore, the patient's diuresis was withheld except for Spironolactone.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, distended with splenomegaly.
Ascites with Enterococci sensitive to Ampicillin and sensitive to Vancomycin.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 55 year old male with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, significant coronary artery disease, but good ejection fraction on a recent MUGA scan, obesity, hypertension, and lower extremity edema with shortness of breath times two to three weeks.
He had his first paracentesis in an outside hospital recently with unclear etiology of his edema.
Thickened aortic and mitral leaflets, and a right ventriculogram could be done if further quantification was to be done.
This showed a diffusely increased echogenicity in the liver consistent with fatty liver.
Portal venous flow with hepatopetal direction and a normal hepatic reflow.
There were mild ascites but no other abnormality on this ultrasound.
The patient had paracentesis of five liters of fluid in-house which was clear and yellow.
Hepatitis serologies were also sent to determine whether there was some evidence of liver dysfunction accounted by Hepatitis.
The patient was maintained on a cardiac low-salt diet of less than 2 grams per day and diuretics were initially held secondary to the question of prerenal azotemia.
The Renal Service was consulted regarding this patient and acute renal failure was thought to be secondary to ACE inhibitors plus diuretics plus/minus infection, with the intention to restart Bumex 2 twice a day once the patient's creatinine reached its baseline.
A right heart catheterization was performed while the patient was in-house to find the etiology of his symptoms as well as transfer to Liver biopsy.
The catheterization showed equalization of pressures consistent with a constrictive physiology.
The patient had increased right and left heart pressures as well as cirrhosis.
There were no further recommendations from renal at this time, and the patient was cleared for discharge.
