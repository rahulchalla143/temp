He was found to have an exposed RUE AV fistula/graft in clinic on [**2166-12-25**], and was sent to Pre-Op for a planned repair where he became febrile to 103.0, with chills.
No headache, sore throat, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, N/V, rash or abdominal pain.
Coronary artery disease s/p MI in [**12/2164**], status post 2 stents to the LAD.
Cath in [**1-/2165**] revealed re-stenosis of both stents.

Hypertension 5.
History of multiple E coli bacteremias 10.
Anemia of chronic disease 11.
Hypercholesteremia 12.
COPD 13.
Afib/Aflutterm, not on anticoagulation secondary to history of GI bleed.
Social History: The patient lives at home with his wife & daughter in a [**Location (un) 6332**] apartment with an elevator.
Family History: Mother with hypertension No history of no strokes, seizures, or heart disease  Physical Exam: Per transplant surgery admission note on [**2166-12-25**]: VITALS: T 193, HR 99, BP 130/59, RR 18 GEN: In NAD.
Abdomen soft and non-tender.
Lateral ST-T wave changes.
[**2166-12-25**] CXR: No acute disease Relevant studies in hospital: [**2166-12-30**] CT HEAD: FINDINGS: There is an area of decreased attenuation involving the white and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of the posterior left frontal lobe.
This could be consistent with an evolving infarct.
Diffuse areas of low attenuation in the periventricular white matter is consistent with chronic microvascular angiopathy.
No intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures is apparent.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemmorage.
Numerous calcifications are noted in the sulci, brain parenchyma and ventricles.
Likely evolving infarct of the left posterior frontal lobe, which would be consistent with the patient's history of new expressive aphasia.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2166-12-30**] MRI HEAD: There is a wedge-shaped area of slow diffusion in the ventral portion of the left pons, consistent with an acute infarction.
There is also slow diffusion involving the posterior aspect of the insular cortex, operculum, and anterior aspect of the left parietal lobe consistent with an acute infarction.
There are multiple areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular subcortical white matter consistent with chronic small vessel infarctions.
There is also a region of magnetic susceptibility artifact in the posterior right thalamus, consistent with sequela from a prior intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is associated Wallerian degeneration in the right cerebral peduncle.
There are multiple areas of magnetic susceptiblity artifact throughout both cerebral hemispheres, which correspond to the multiple intraparenchymal calcifications, consisent with sequela from prior cystercercosis infection.
On the postcontrast images, there is no abnormal enhancement in the brain parenchyma.
In the MRA images, there is no evidence of a vascular occlusion, stenosis, or aneurysm involving the arteries in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
There is some motion artifact which limits the study.
We do not have a good evaluation of the distal smaller branches of the intracerebral vasculature.
There is a small T1- and T2-hyperintense mass in the soft tissues of the left frontal scalp.
This may represent a small sebaceous or proteinaceous cyst.
IMPRESSION: Acute infarctions involving the left ventral pons and the posterior left insular cortex, left temporal operculum, and left anterior parietal lobe.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2165-3-4**], there is no significant change.
[**2167-1-6**] TEE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
The interatrial septum is aneurysmal with a very small superior left-to-right shunt color Doppler at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are complex (>4mm non-mobile) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened but severe aortic stenosis is not suggested and no discrete vegetations are seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened but no discrete vegetations are seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year-old male with multiple medical problems including CAD s/p CABG, PAF on no anticoagulation [**1-21**] history of GU bleed, HTN, and ESRD on HD, admitted with an exposed and infected AV graft.
Given his Staph aureus bacteremia, a TTE was performed on [**2166-12-31**] which was negative for vegetations.
A TEE was subsequently performed on [**2167-1-6**], which was also negative for vegetations, although it revealed a small ASD.
Nonetheless, per ID, given his high-grade staphylococcus aureus bacteremia on admission, removal of only the infected portions of the AV graft (?
2) CVA: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a known history of PAF, and was not on anticoagulation on admission given a prior history of GI bleed.
On [**2166-12-30**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have new expressive aphasia, with a left sided mouth droop.
CT head and MRI head were consistent with an acute infarct involving the left ventral pons and the posterior left insular cortex, left temporal operculum, and left anterior parietal lobe.
Of note, given his poor vascular access, Heparin could not be given.
The etiology of his CVA was felt most likely cardioembolic in the setting of known PAF (in atrial fibrillation in hospital) and no anticoagulation.
Septic embolus was also a concern given his MSSA bacteremia.
Hence, he underwent a TTE on [**2166-12-31**], which was negative for vegetations.
A carotid ultrasound revealed bilateral <40% stenosis of his carotids.
A TEE was also performed on [**2167-1-6**], which was also negative for vegetations, although it revealed a small ASD.
Of note, while in hospital, he was noted to have persistent hyperkalemia despite hemodialysis, which was felt secondary to dietary indiscretions and food brought by family.
Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has extremely poor vascular access.
No acute issues in hospital.
