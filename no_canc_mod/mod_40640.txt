Admission Date:  [**2129-1-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-11-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Macrobid / Betadine  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: OSH transfer for bilateral pulmonary embolism.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Venous Catheter placement Arterial Line placement IVC filter placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 51-year-old female status-post recent bilateral breast reduction surgery complicated by infection status-post recent discharge from OSH for chest pain presented to OSH in PEA arrest with PE on CT scan status-post thrombolytics.
She was alert and orientated complaining of left leg pain.
In the field EMS performed CPR for 20 minutes, she received 3 rounds of Epi and Atropine and responded with a rhythm of sinus tachycardia.
She was also started on Levophed given hypotension to 70s.
She was noted to have non-focal movement of her upper extremities.
Her labs were noted to be remarkable for a +d-dimer, elevated Creatinine 1.4, trans.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: The right ventricle is mildly dilated with free wall hypokinesis.
These findings are consistent with a pulmonary embolus.
Normal regional and global LV function without significant valvular abnormality.
Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
Cardiomegaly, with abnormal left ventricular contour.
This is worrisome for development of left ventricular aneurysm, and echocardiography is recommended for correlation.
Alternatively, this could represent a lung mass projecting over the left heart border.
If echocardiography is not revealing, further evaluation with chest CT is recommended.
If there is no wire or catheter fragment external to the patient which could project in this position, this finding is worrisome for a retained catheter or wire fragment, possibly located within the SVC, extending into a hepatic vein.
Lateral chest radiograph is recommended for correlation.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
There is a heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys, left greater than right with wedge-shaped areas of decreased density.
These could represent areas of infarct versus differential function.
Colonic distention and focal wall thickening of the transverse colon, which may be infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic (particularly given recent cardiac arrest).
[**2129-1-30**] Bleeding scan Final Report RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA: 14.4 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m RBC ([**2129-1-30**]); HISTORY:51 yo F with ongoing bloody bowel movements and falling Hct.
Blood flow images show no areas of abnormal tracer activity.Dynamic blood pool images show increased tracer activity within the first 90 minutes in the region of the pelvis, overlying the left iliac vessels and progressing more centrally and inferiorly within the pelvis, likely corresponding to the sigmoid colon or rectum.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with probable active hemorrhage in the region of the sigmoid colon or rectum.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Targeted ultrasound of the area of discomfort in the medial left acromioclavicular fossa demonstrates no subcutaneous edema.
PT: 22.5  PTT: 89.7  INR: 2.1   Brief Hospital Course: Middle Aged Female status-post recent bilateral breast reduction c/b infection s/p recent discharge for MSK chest pain p/w PEA arrest s/p multiple cycles of Atropine/Epi likely [**3-1**] PE s/p thrombolytics on pressors, intubated, heparin gtt.
OBSTRUCTIVE CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Cariogenic shock likely secondary to clot burden, as CT scan showed PE with RV dilatation.
TTE performed showed areas of hypokinesis, dilated RV with LV systolic function intact.
She was felt to be preload dependent and was aggressively treated with IV fluids.
LARGE PE STATUS-POST THROMBOLYTICS: Patient noted to have a large PE on CT scan likely [**3-1**] immobile status s/p surgery with poor wound healing followed by cervical disc herniation where she was immobile.
Due to her PEA arrest she underwent thrombolytic therapy which ended at 9:25 Am on the day of admission.
Thereafter, she was started on heparin gtt, but had bleeding complications which subsided off heparin in the ICU during which time an IVC filter was placed.
Low molecular weight heparin therapy was not given because of the uncertain absorption and therapeutic benefit in obese patients, which she is, as well as need for observation on anticoagulation considering patient's bleeding complications (GI bleed and breast surgical sites).
She will follow up in [**Hospital 3052**] for evaluation of duration of anticoagulation and timing of IVC filter retrieval.
PEA ARREST: Secondary to vascular collapse due to pulmonary embolism.
Per OSH reports pt had 3 episodes of PEA arrest with response to several rounds of epi and atropine.
Mental status at admission was difficult to obtain as pt was intubated but she was noted to have non-focal movement of her upper extremities.
She was monitored on telemetry without further incident.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Pt noted to be unresponsive initially on examination with no sedation on board.
At OSH she was reported to have non-focal movement of her upper extremities.
Ddx for AMS included anoxic brain injury from PEA arrest, cerebral hypoperfusion from her persistent hypotension.
However, patient continued to be confused and would perseverate on minor details.
She had trouble remembering why she was in the hospital, and repeated the same questions throughout the day.
However, it did appear as if her mental status was improving throughout her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course.
By the time she was transferred to medical floor, her mental status had completely recovered.
# ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA/GI BLEED:  Patient's hct continued to drop throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission.
CT of abdomen/pelvis and left thigh (patient had an ecchymosis in this area) were unrevealing for source of bleeding.
The next day she has bright red blood per rectum and heavy clots at the breast reduction surgical sites.
A retained tampon was noted and removed, though no heavy vaginal bleeding was noted.
A bleeding scan [**2129-1-29**] showed questionable upper GI bleeding.
Another scan [**2129-1-30**] showed definite sigmoid/rectal bleeding.
Heparin was held while an IVC filter was placed, her blood count stabilized, and heparin was re-initiated given high risk complications from PE.
Continued observation on heparin alone demonstrated stable HCT without further bleeding.
This was thought due to hypoperfusion with cardiac arrest.
BREAST REDUCTION COMPLICATED BY INFECTION:  Patient's breast surgery was complicated by bilateral infections.
Levofloxacin was later tapered to Keflex for prophylaxis per Plastics request, which she tolerated well (completed 10 day course).
There were no further signs of infection.
Cervical radiculopathy:  She was started on neurontin and tramadol to help control arm pain related to her cervical radiculopathy with improvement.
Rizatriptan 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO PRN (as needed) as needed for migraine.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **]:*14 syringes* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility:  [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrest Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism Lower GI Bleed, acute blood loss anemia Hypertension, benign   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to hospital (ICU) after cardiac arrest due to bilateral pulmonary embolism for which you were treated with clot busting medications at an outside hospital.
You were continued on anticoagulants, but experienced episodes of bleeding from your surgical breast wounds and from your GI tract, which required you to be in ICU on several occasions.
The bleeding in the GI tract was most likely from the rectal or sigmoid colon area as per a bleeding scan done at the time.
The bleeding stablized by itself and the anticoagulation was re-initiated, without colonoscopy.
You will need to be monitored for therapeutic effectiveness of the warfarin by an [**Hospital 2786**] clinic and/or your PCP.
