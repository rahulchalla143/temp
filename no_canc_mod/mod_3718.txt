Admission Date:  [**2101-4-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2101-4-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2039-3-10**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with a history of numerous admissions for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations as well as a recent non-Q-wave myocardial infarction who has recently completed a course of ciprofloxacin for dysuria as well as Zithromax for a recent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
He denied any problems with chest pain or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but did not that his shortness of breath had been worsening recently at home.
The patient is home bound with a baseline oxygen saturation between 89% to 90% on room air, dropping to 86% with showering.
The patient presented to the Emergency Room on [**4-1**] with severe dyspnea and anxiety.
The patient was given intravenous benzodiazepines and Solu-Medrol intravenously and was intubated and sedated with propofol for impending respiratory failure.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Reactive airway disease by pulmonary function tests.
Low back pain.
Myocardial infarction on [**2101-1-25**].
Last echocardiogram revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and mild apical hypokinesis.
Last catheterization revealed no clinical significance of stenosis, and no intervention.
Mild pulmonary hypertension as well as 2+ mitral regurgitation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient had a recent flu shot.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed mucous membranes were moist.
Cardiovascular examination revealed very distant heart sounds.
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs appreciated.
Lungs revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
No dullness to percussion.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
Urinalysis revealed trace blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.
Toxicology screen was negative for aspirin, negative for alcohol, negative for Tylenol, negative for benzodiazepines, negative for barbiturates, and negative for tricyclics.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a rate of 135 beats per minute, 0.5-mm ST segment depressions in the inferolateral leads.
A chest x-ray revealed hyperinflated lungs; consistent with the patient's severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
During his hospital course, the patient was treated with azithromycin, as well as oral steroids, as well as meter-dosed inhalers and nebulizers for his reactive airway disease.
The patient underwent computed tomography angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism given the abrupt onset of his dyspnea, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure.
The computed tomography angiogram was negative for a pulmonary embolism.
The patient had a severe episode of laryngospasm subsequent to extubation.
Physical examination revealed severe inspiratory stridor.
The patient was also ruled out for myocardial infarction given his history of coronary artery disease and tachycardia.
The patient's beta blocker was held given the acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, and statin and aspirin were continued.
The patient was extubated and did quite well for the first hour, but subsequently began to have extreme tachypnea causing air trapping and causing the patient to work harder at high lung volumes.
It was thought that there was a significant anxiety component to the patient's failure to wean.
After these two failed attempts at extubation, given the patient's severe pulmonary disease, it was thought that placing a tracheostomy would be the most appropriate decision in the hopes that the patient would be able to come off the tracheostomy in the next one to two months.
Of note, the patient also developed a minor urinary tract infection toward the end of his hospitalization and was placed on ciprofloxacin and had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed as well as tracheostomy for feeding.
