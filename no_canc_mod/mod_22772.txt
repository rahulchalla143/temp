Admission Date:  [**2102-9-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-9-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2027-6-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: Called by Emergency Department to evaluate IPH   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The pt is a 75 year-old right-handed woman with a history of HTN and depression who presents with a headache and left sided weakness, found to have a large (5x5x7cm) right temporal lobe hemorrhage.
She went to see her ophthalmologist, who found no abnormalities, but thought this may be secondary to a migraine headache (though according to her husband she has no history of migraines).
The vision changes and headache improved, and later that week she had a routine physical, which reportedly showed a 'normal' blood pressure, and no other abnormalities.
Today her husband reports that around noon she began complaining of a severe headache.
She was initially taken to an OSH, where she had a NCHCT which showed a large (5x5x7cm) right temporal lobe hemorrhage, at which time she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Past Medical History: - HTN (?)
No palpable pulse Pupils fixed an dilated, no corneal reflex  Pertinent Results: [**2102-9-4**] 03:36AM   GLUCOSE-164* UREA N-18 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-3.5 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-13 [**2102-9-4**] 03:36AM   CK-MB-4 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2102-9-4**] 03:36AM   WBC-11.8* RBC-4.04* HGB-13.1 HCT-37.2 MCV-92 MCH-32.4* MCHC-35.1* RDW-13.3 [**2102-9-4**] 03:36AM   PLT COUNT-196  NCHCT FINDINGS: Again noted is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the right parietal, frontal and temporal lobes.
It measures 6.4 x 5.0 cm , previously 6.6 x 4.7 cm and is overall unchanged in size or appearance.
There is persistent peri-hemorrhagic edema with stable effacement of sulci and ventricles.
There is a 4-mm leftward shift from normally midline structures which is minimally decreased from prior.
Stable intraventricular hemorrhage bilaterally and persistent hemorrhage into the supravermian cistern is again noted.
The subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe is unchanged from prior study.
No hydrocephalus is noted.
An unchanged large CSF hypodensity in the anterior left middle cranial fossa is compatible with large arachnoid cyst.
There is no evidence of acute fracture.
IMPRESSION: Overall, no significant change in intraparenchymal hemorrhage and associated edema.
Stable intraventricular hemorrhage bilaterally with persistent hemorrhage into supravermian cistern, unchanged from prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: Patient was admitted on [**2102-9-4**] for left-sided weakness and headache and was found to have a large R temporal hemorrhage.
She had gross neglect of the left side, to self, visual stimuli and to sensory stimuli.
Eyes did not move past midline to the left, and sensory input from left side of face was different as well as decreased hearing on left v. neglect.
L arm was extensor to pain and left lower extremity had triple flexion to pain with downgoing toes.
MRI imaging revealed no evidence of mass leading to likely etiology of amyloid angiopathy.
Repeat CT on [**9-5**] showed no new blood and no increase in midline shift.
The patient did have leukucytosis a CT chest with contrast was ordered which did not demonstrate pulmonary embolism.
A transthoracic echo was completed and non concering for endocarditis or any overt pathology.
The patient passed away from repiratory depression secondary to stroke on [**2102-10-14**] at 9:35 am.
