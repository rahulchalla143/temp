studies: CXR: Right lung opacification concerning for extensive pneumonia.
CT head: IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
CT Cspine: No fracture or malalignment of normal prevertebral soft tissues.
Degenerative changes as described above.
Extensive right lung opacification most concerning for pneumonia.
No acute intra-abdominal process or fracture.
Sideport of the orogastric tube is within in the distal esophagus, and the tube should be advance for optimal placement.
EEG: [**5-4**] This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of the presence of an extremely severe diffuse encephalopathy.
EEG: [**5-5**] This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of an extremely severe diffuse encephalopathy with a complete loss of any identifiable electrical activity in cerebral origin.
Diffuse ST segment depression which is non-specific.
CXR [**5-4**] Left subclavian vascular catheter terminates within the proximal to mid superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.
Worsening diffuse airspace opacities throughout the right lung, particularly in the right middle and right lower lobes with near-complete obscuration of right heart border and right hemidiaphragm.
Findings are consistent with a diffuse right lung pneumonia as demonstrated on recent CT of [**2194-5-3**]; however, given worsening volume loss, there is likely coexisting atelectasis involving portions of the right middle and right lower lobes.
CT head [**5-4**] Hyperdensities noted within the sulci and along the tentorium appear consistent with previous contrast bolus given on [**2194-5-3**].
Although subarachnoid hemorrhage cannot be definitively ruled out the normal size of the ventricles and normal appearance of cisterns suggest the etiology of hyperdensities as being due to sluggish circulation and stasis of contrast within vasculature, possibly in the setting of renal insufficiency.
Diffuse extensive abnormal signal involving the bilateral sulci, basal ganglia and thalami with thickening of the sulci and crowding of the posterior fossa, likely representing diffuse brain swelling and suggestive of brain death.
Abnormal signal within the subarachnoid space bilaterally may represent residual contrast from prior CAT scan in the setting of renal insufficiency.
[**5-5**] TTE: IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
The very extensive right-sided parenchymal opacity is constant in severity and distribution.
On the left, there is no change in appearance of the normally appearing lung parenchyma.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Patient is a 66 yo male with past medical history of HIV on HAART,  CD4 584, VL 93 (2 weeks ago), PML, hx PCP pneumonia, syphilis (treated), crystal meth and tobaccoabuse, and B12 deficiency and also recent stroke, who presents found on floor at home soaked in urine and found to have multifocal PNA and positive amphetamine screen.
He was admitted to MICU having been intubated for airway protection and necessary medical studies given he was extremely agitated in the ED.
He had an episode of hypotension overnight on admission and was later found to have clinical brain death.
Altered mental status - Patient was found on ground soaked in urine with altered mental status at home.
He was non-verbal, not obeying commands and had blood at the mouth.
Several etiologies for the altered mental status were considered.
Pneumonia was discovered on CXR and CT scan to involve all 3 right lobes and BC grew strep pneumoniae.
CSF infection was considered and he was covered with ampicillin in addition to the above-mentioned antibiotics.
Patient also had positive amphetamines on Utox with a history of methamphetamine abuse, and his altered mental status could be related to recent drug use, supported by the marked agitation seen in the ED.
EKG showed no ischemic changes and trop negative.
CT head and C-spine in ED were negative for acute injury.
On his first night in the hospital patient developed an episode of hypotension to SBP 48.
Following that event, he was found to have absence of cranial nerve reflexes including pupilary, blink, and doll's eyes.
EEG showed near-isoelectric tracing and MRI revealed diffuse brain swelling consistent with anoxic brain injury.
Pneumonia - Patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection and facilitation of necessary medical studies in the setting of severe agitation in the ED.
CXR and CT torso showed multifocal PNA in right lobe.
Patient has history of PCP pneumonia in [**2191**], though CD4 > 500.
CXR was not consistent with PCP so steroids and bactrim were stopped.
Concern was for aspiration CAP considering found in fetal position nonresponive on floor of apartment.
Acute Renal Failure Creatinine was elevated to 3.4 from previous baseline of 0.8-1.0 after CT torso with contrast today.
Could also be rhabdomyolysis in setting of unknown time down, though only small blood on UA and CK 139.
