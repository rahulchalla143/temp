Patient developed SSCP [**6-17**] while working on his motorcycle, assoc w/ diaphoresis and right arm numbness.
He was found to have inferior ST elevations on EKG was started on Plavix, a Heparin gtt, and Integrillin gtt.
His OM2 was stented with a DES, resulting in resolution of his chest pain.
Currently, he feels well w/ only mild lingering chest pressure.
No chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, abd pain, leg pain, or leg weakness or numbness.

No cocaine or IVDU.
Family History: - CAD: father died of MI at 61, brother had MI at 40.
Sclera anicteric.
Neck: Supple with no JVD.
CV: reg s1/s2, no s3/s4/m/r Pulm: CTA b/l, no crackles or wheezes.
Ext: warm; 2+ DP b/l, no edema, no femoral bruits.
EKG [**2164-6-4**] - demonstrated ST elevations in II, III, aVF, V5, V6 and ST depressions in aVR, AvL and V1, V2.
Sinus rhythm.
Actue inferolateral ST segment elevation myocardial infarction with reciprocal depressions in lead aVL and V1-V2.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 50 year old man with multiple cardiac risk factors admitted to CCU for monitoring after inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction, treated with a drug eluting stent to the second obtuse marginal branch off of the left circumflex artery.
Cath showed significant RCA disease and distal LCX disease.
He had several asymptomatic 10 beat runs of ventricular tachycardia after catheterization.
Disp:*30 Patch 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: STEMI Hypertension Smoking Hyperlipidemia Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable.
Chest pain free.
Again, we understand that quitting smoking is very difficult, but we also must emphasize that with your hypertension, high cholesterol and family history, smoking has the propensity of worsening your heart disease and increasing the likelyhood of another heart attack.
