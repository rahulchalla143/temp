L1 vertebral body compression fracture with an 8-mm retropulsion of indeterminate age, although no surround hematoma or soft tissue swelling.
Retropulsion causes severe spinal canal narrowing at this level, which increases risk of spinal cord injury.
If clinical concern, MRI is more sensitive in evaluation of spinal cord injury.
Multiple bilateral rib fractures as above, with underlying left chest wall/mediastinal contusion/hematoma.
No acute fracture or subluxation.
Multilevel degenerative changes including osteophytes with mild spinal canal narrowing at C3-C4, increasing risk of spinal cord injury.
If clinical concern for spinal cord or ligamentous injury, MRI is more sensitive.
Findings may be periapical and dental related, although while felt less likely, traumatic injury is not excluded  [**2107-9-21**] Right hip and knee : No evidence of acute fracture involving the right hip, right femur, or right knee.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral segments.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2106-5-5**], a focal wall motion abnormality can be seen on the current study.
Mild symmetric LVH is seen on the current study.
[**2107-9-24**] CXR : Left lower lobe opacity has minimally increased; this could be due to atelectasis, pneumonia cannot be totally excluded but less likely.
There are low lung volumes.
Atelectasis in the right base is stable.
There are no enlarging pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
The transverse colon is slightly distended measuring 8.5 cm in maximal diameter.
There are no air- fluid levels.
Haziness of the abdomen could be due to patient body habitus and/or ascites.
There are degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
[**2107-9-26**] Video swallow : There is penetration and aspiration with thin consistency.
There  is also penetration with nectar consistency, but no evidence of aspiration.
Aspiration with thin consistency.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 78277**] was evaluated in the ER by the Trauma Service and Ct scans of the C Spine, Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis were notable for multiple rib fractures and an old L1 compression fracture.
He was admitted to the Trauma floor for pain control, pulmonary toilet and a syncopal work up.
It was difficult to fully explain the mechanism of his fall despite the help of the Italian interpreter and on exam he seemed to have no vision in the left eye.
Eventually his daughter explained that his visual problems were old secondary to a detached retina.
He had carotid studies which showed a string sign on the right and 70-79% occlusion of the left internal carotid artery.
His pain was partially controlled with a PCA but language barrier limited more instruction therefore he was changed to Tylenol around the clock and prn oxycodone.
A chest Xray revealed a left lower lobe density and he was placed on IV Vancomycin and Zosyn.
He remained afebrile with  a normal WBC and was changed to oral Cipro in [**2107-9-27**] which will continue thru [**2107-10-1**].
His main complaint of left sided rib pain was controlled with Tylenol and prn Oxycodone.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Insulin Regular Human 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: 2-8 units Injection four times a day as needed for elevated blood sugars per sliding scale: Check blood sugars Pre meal and HS.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**]- [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: S/P fall with : Left anterior [**5-15**] rib fracture Right anterior 7th rib fractuer Left lateral 6th rib fracture Old L1 compression fracture with stenosis Bilateral carotid stenoses COPD CAD DM2   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: ??????
