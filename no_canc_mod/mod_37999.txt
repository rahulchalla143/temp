Admission Date:  [**2138-3-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-3-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-9-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**] Chief Complaint: Symptomatic bradycardia.
History of Present Illness:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8389**] is a 75 year-old woman with a history of CAD s/p CABG, bovine AVR, DVT on lovenox, and endometrial cancer s/p XRT who is transferred from [**Hospital 882**] hospital for management of symptomatic bradycardia, syncope.
She was in usual state of health until the morning of [**2138-3-3**] when she had syncope while walking to the cafeteria and fell to the ground.
She denied prodrome, SOB, lightheadedness or CP prior to the event.
She did not have loss of bladder or bowel function (although she has some stool incontinence at baseline).
She denied any numbness or tingling, weakness, or amnesia.
At the [**Hospital1 882**], she developed bradycardia to the 30s which was found to be sinus arrest with narrow junctional escape.
On arrival to the CVICU, she denied chest pain and dyspnea but noted a dizziness and light-headedness associated with her bradycardic episodes.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
Past Medical History: - AVR, bovine [**8-5**] - CAD s/p CABG [**8-5**] - HTN - HLD - DVT (RLE, popliteal and femoral) [**7-7**], on lovenox - Endometrial cancer s/p XRT [**1-7**] - Hysterectomy - Tonic clonic seizure thought to be [**12-31**] PRES - Bilateral hearing aids   Social History: Widowed x 5 years, lives in [**Location (un) 18293**].
-Tobacco history: quit in [**2134**] -ETOH: occasional -Illicit drugs: none   Family History: Father died of throat cancer.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
2/6 SEM LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Left anterior fascicular block.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild linear atelectases along the left heart border may be chronic.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Satisfactory placement of atrial and ventricular pacing leads.
Brief Hospital Course: Precis   Ms. [**Known lastname 8389**] is a 75 year-old woman with a history of CAD s/p CABG, bovine AVR, DVT on lovenox, and endometrial cancer s/p XRT who is transferred from [**Hospital 883**] hospital for management of symptomatic bradycardia and syncope.
Bradycardia and sinus pause were attributed to age-related conduction system degeneration.
Atropine (0.5 mg IV) was given and dopamine started with no further pauses, but a subsequent bradycardic episode to 40s BPMs.
Various causes of this were excluded including electrolyte disturbance, ischemia (enzymes flat), hypothyroidism (TSH normal), attributed to senile degeneration of the conduction system with possible contribution by atenolol.
Chest x-ray films showed good lead placement without physiologic or radiographic evidence of complication.
Lovenox was  Syncope   Attributed to bradycardia or sinus pause.
No head injury was sustained.
Hypertension   Ms. [**Known lastname 91893**] antihypertensives were held in the setting of bradycardia and hypotension.
Deep Venous Thrombosis   Course of Lovenox was to be stopped in [**Month (only) 404**] this year and was not.
There was initially some confusion about whether this was to continue indefinitely in the context of endometrial cancer, but this was resolved by discussion with her PCP.
Coronary Artery Disease   Post-CABG.
No evidence of ischemia during the admission, based on history, symptoms, EKG and enzymes.
Endometrial cancer   Treated with XRT and hysterectomy.
Non-active and no related investigations or treatment during the admission.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: sick sinus syndrome - bradycardia with 10 second pauses  Secondary diagnosis: Hypertension Deep vein thrombosis Status post endometrial cancer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have a slow heart rate with long pauses.
