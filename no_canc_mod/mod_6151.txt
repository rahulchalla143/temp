HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history significant for end-stage renal disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, status post right pontine CVA, retinopathy, left brachiocephalic DVT, and several admissions in the past for CVA, rule out myocardial infarction, and change in mental status.
The patient was recently discharged on [**9-25**] for a chief complaint of change in mental status and for repair of a left upper extremity fistula thrombus.
The patient presented during this admission with a chief complaint of temperatures of 102 on [**10-4**] and fevers and chills.
He had no EKG changes.
The patient also had a period of hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Right common femoral-dorsalis pedis bypass.
Status post right femoral fracture repair.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  On admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98.0, blood pressure 141/78, respiratory rate 21, heart rate 109, and 100% on nonrebreather mask.
His neck had bilateral hematomas secondary to central line placement attempts.
His heart had a normal S1, S2 with distant heart sounds, but no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
His abdomen was soft with mild voluntary guarding.
He had no hepatosplenomegaly.
He had an area of a hematoma over the left fistula site.
He had faint dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
His urinalysis was positive for trace blood, 50 of protein, 1,000 of glucose, no ketones, no leukocyte esterase, no white blood cells, and no bacteria.
The source of his fevers even after transfer to the floor on hospital day three was unclear.
Out of his many sets of blood cultures, only one set grew gram-negative Staphylococcus.
His chest x-rays continuously showed bibasilar atelectasis.
Since it was unclear exactly what the source of his fevers was, and because the patient was complaining of left hip pain, there was a question of whether he might have a retroperitoneal abscess.
At that point, it was decided to do a CT of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis to rule out any abscesses.
It is also unclear whether the hematoma over his left arm fistula could potentially be infected leading to his continued temperatures.
Arteriovenous fistula:  On [**10-9**], the patient underwent an ultrasound of his left arm due to the left hematoma over his A-V fistula site.
The ultrasound showed a patent deep venous system, patent left arteriovenous graft, and a large hematoma.
Transplant Surgery was consulted, who recommended a fistulogram to rule out a pseudoaneurysm.
The fistulogram showed a small pseudoaneurysm with no communication with the hematoma.
The Surgery team suggested that a repair be done for the pseudoaneurysm, but that it was not emergent, and the patient's fever should be cleared prior to surgery.
They stated that the hematoma over the fistula site was an unlikely source of his temperatures.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus:  The patient was placed on a regular insulin-sliding scale throughout his hospital stay.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis:  The patient received hemodialysis on the same schedule as prior to admission.
Orthopedics:  During his hospital stay, the patient had complaint of left hip pain, and there was continued tenderness on palpation of his left hip.
A CT of the pelvis was also done to rule out any abscess.
However, the patient was afebrile for a period greater than 24 hours prior to discharge.
Chronic renal failure.
Left arm arteriovenous fistula pseudoaneurysm.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was told to call his doctor if he experienced any further fevers, increased pain, or other worrisome symptoms.
