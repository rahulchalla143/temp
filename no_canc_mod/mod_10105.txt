ECG [**2190-9-25**] Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2190-9-25**]  12:25:18 PM   Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
ST segment elevation in leads V2-V3 with diffuse T wave inversion most pronounced in the precordial leads.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-9-19**] the ST-T wave changes and prolonged Q-T interval are new.
There is loss R wave in lead V3 but that could be due to lead placement.
Diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
Since the previous tracing of same date no significant change.
There is Q-T interval prolongation and deep T wave inversion which is global and consistent with extensive anterolateral and apical ischemia and/or myocardial infarction and likely further evolution as compared with previous tracing of [**2190-9-25**].

IMPRESSION: No gross abnormalities on the limited views acquired.
There is again seen bibasilar atelectasis and likely small pleural effusions.
There is a baseline bronchovascular prominence and there may be an element of fluid overload; however, this is a limited study.
Severe degenerative changes of bilateral glenohumeral joints are seen.
There are again seen likely small pleural effusions bilaterally with blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles.
There is a baseline prominence of bronchovascular markings.
Overall, there is no appreciable change since the previous study.
Degenerative changes of bilateral glenohumeral joints are again visualized.
Colonoscopy [**2190-9-21**] Findings:  Protruding Lesions Non-bleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula were seen in the whole colon.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the whole colon Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Potential bright red blood per rectum from internal hemorrhoids or diverticula.
No active bleeding or mass lesion identified.
Impression: Small hiatal hernia noted.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: No source of bleeding noted on upper endoscopy.
Small hiatal hernia noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 88F with dCHF, pulmonary hypertension, CKD admitted [**2190-9-19**] with GIB of unclear etiology, transfused 5 units and no focus of bleeding seen.
Flash pulmonary edema after significant fluid and blood resuscitation following lying flat for MR-scan requiring furosemide infusion with decreasing IV requirements to her dry weight.
Raised TnT with associated tachycardia suggested possible cardiac event although may have been rate related with diffuse new T-wave inversions.
Echocardiogrphy revealed stress cardiomyopathy.
Had an episode of expressive apahsia (subjective and noted by daughter) which resolved after 2 hours and may have represented a small stroke - no imaging was performed.
She had gross BRBPR on DRE.
Her Hct had elevated to 27, appropriate given the transfusion, and she was complaining of only mild abdominal cramping that had significantly improved.
Colonoscopy revealed multiple non-bleeding diverticula in the whole colon and grade 1 internal hemorrhoids; EGD was unremarkable.
Capsule endoscopy was performed per GI recommendations, and revealed an intraluminal mass with a smooth pink surface in the small bowel, without bleeding at the site.
For further work-up and follow-up on capsule study, she underwent MR enterography which was not completed due to an episode of flash pulmonary edema.
She had no further episodes of GIB and did not need additional transfusions, and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the hospital stay.
Differential dx includes lesion small bowel (AVM, malignancy) or proximal colon that was not visualized.
Ischemic colitis less likely given lack of abd pain but considerable cardiac history.
Gi were unkeen to do other investigations of her bleeding unless this recurred at which point a tagged RBC scan and/or CT-enterography could be done.
No further bleeding and Hb/HCt stable on discharge.
ANEMIA: Her Hct in the ED was 17.2 (baseline 31-33.5), likely secondary to the acute bleed superimposed on her known, chronic anemia due to CKD.
However, it then stabilized at 28-32, but after several episodes of passing clots and BRBPR, Hct dropped again to 23.7.
As there was no active bleeding and Hct was stable, we placed her back on amlodipine 5 mg daily, but continued holding the rest of the regimen.
On day 4 of her hospital stay, she had an episode of sinus tachycardia, so we also started her on metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] with good effect, HR stabilizing back to 80s-90s.
Target <140/80 if urinary pr <220g/day or for <130/80 if >220mg/day.
Decompensated dCHF: Post lying flat for MR [**First Name (Titles) 9140**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and pulmonary edema on CXR.
This was likely triggered by recent transfusions, tachycardia with diastolic dysfunction, and laying flat for MRI.
Upon trasnfer, pt started on bipap 8/5 and lasix drip with rapid improvement in symptoms and was weaned to 2L NC with RR 18-20.
Stress cardiomyopathy improved on repeat [**Last Name (Titles) 113**].
During her whole time post ICU d/c she was saturating well on room air and her shortness of breath greatly improved.
Episode of apparent expressive aphasia w hypertension and tachycardia.
No further episodes.
# ECG changes and tachycardia: Pt with TWI relatively diffusely inferolaterally, new compared with prior ECGs while on MICU, likely secondary to rate related demand and strain in setting of LVH and stress cardiomyopthy.
TnT was max 0.14 which could represent small NSTEMI but baseline is also high given CRF.
TnT fell despite worse ECG changes with deep TwI especially anteriorly but present throughout ECG and felt by cardiology to possibly represent "cerebral" T-waves.
On the prior [**Last Name (Titles) 113**] the anteroseptal and inferior apical segments were hypokinetic (although not reported as so).
Both echoes were consistent with stress cardiomyopathy, resolving to normal on the repeat study.
Pulmonary pressures were similar on both studies (under-reported on prior) and degree of mitral regurgitation was probably similar.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: Likely related to CHF and decreased renal perfusion and should improve with diuresis.
# Possible UTI: Enterococcus on culture but UA negative.
# h/o DVT: Holding anticoagulation in setting of GIB as above.
This was solely for DVT in [**2183**] and has contraindication so no indication for anticoagulation currently.
# Renal osteodystrophy and Osteoporosis: We restarted calcitriol and alendronate .
# Low mood.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] Senior Healthcare of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Gastrointestinal bleed - Blood loss anemia - Small bowel mass NOS - Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure - Regional LVSD, takasubo variant - Moderate aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.0-1.2cm2) - Aortic and mitral regurgitation - Asymptomatic bacteruria  Secondary: - Hypertension - CKD stage IV - Dementia - Postoperative DVT [**2176**] - Glaucoma - s/p hysterectomy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted to the hospital for bleeding in your GI tract.
You had no recurrence of teh fluid on your lungs.
While in the hospital, you underwent a colonoscopy and upper GI endoscopy (too look for possible bleeding points within the upper bowel and stomach) to look at your bowel.
These did not reveal a cause of your initial blood loss.
You also had a capsule endoscopy (a capsule with a camera to record as it goes through your bowel and produce pictures of the bowel wall) which showed an abnormality in your small bowel that was not clearly bleeding.
Given your recent acute illness and fragile state and the fact that your blood counts remained stable for several days without any further blood products, further work up for this abnormality was not done while you were in the hospital.
You had an episode of problems with your speech which your daughter and yourself noticed.
It is unclear whether this was a small stroke but given previous problems with scanning and the fact that blood thinning treatment (one of the main therapies in stroke) coudl not be given due to your previous significant bleeding meant taht we did not investigate further.
Your speech improved and had no problems with weakness or other features of stroke following this episode.
Given your heart failure and some EKG changes noted during your hospitalization, you were seen by a cardiologist.
