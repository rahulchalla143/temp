Admission Date:  [**2101-5-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-5-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2023-9-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea/Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Radial arterial line placement Right IJ Cordis Catheter placement Left IJ TLC placement  History of Present Illness: 77 yo male with CHF, COPD sent from OSH with dyspnea, noted to have O2 sats in 70s on RA, fever to 104.2, and productive cough, with CXR c/w LLL PNA and CHF.
Pt reports at 11 am on day of admit, he noted an increase in WOB and increased DOE.
+ cough with yellow sputum.
No hemoptysis.
Denies PND/change in orthopnea or LE edema.
No wt changes.
<150 yards at baselien causes dyspnea.
CVA HTN AF on coumadin CRI, unclear baseline PVD(s/p aorto-fem bypass) Hyperlipidemia COPD CHF(EF=40% in [**1-/2101**]) Gout AAA(2.3 cm) 2+ MR  Social History: Heavy smoker.
Healed midline incision Ext:Cool; 1+ DPs bilat.
No edema Neuro:CN intact.
Initially required a bicarb infusion given worsening acidemia and increasing lactate levels.
PA catheter numbers obtained but did not provide clear evidence for sepsis or pump related failure.
Attempted mask ventilation to prevent intubation, but pt became increasingly fatigued with commensurate worsening of his pH ABGs.
After initial improvement, he remained dependent on mechanical ventilation despite multiple weaning attempts.
Inability to wean presumed secondary to a number of factors including underlying lung disease with superimposed pneumonia and a component of failure.
Levo was changed to cefepime for pseudomonal coverage given continued need for mechanical ventilation with persistent secretions.
3.COPD:Pt was started on dexamethasone for COPD and possible adrenal insuff given on chronic steroids.
A cortisol level returned very elevated at >100 though, and the steroids were weaned down.
4.CV:Pt had h/o cardiac issues.
Believe he needed diuresis, but unable to provide given low BP and poor CO. Pt also in AF while here, and BB was good at controlling rate.
As noted above, CO was in nL range and SVR/PCWP were close to nL even off pressors so not consistent with either sepsis or cardiac failure.
Believe problem was poor perfusion of kidneys in setting of hypotension.
UOP was very poor and Cr rose for several days, but this process then reversed, and his renal function markers returned to [**Location 213**] function and had good urine output.
6.HTN/hypotension:As above, pt was hypertensive initially.
7.Neuro:Had head CT done whcih showed old lacunar infarcts.
Nothing new to explain decreased consciousness.
Pt had expressed desire to be intubated only for short time if we had reversible cause of illness, but no more.
He remained ventilator dependent and would face an course fraught with risk of setback as well as procedures such as a trache and lengthy rehab.
