He was intubated in the ED and went into afib with RVR and dropped his BP, so dilt gtt was started as well as peripheral dopamine.
He was presumed to be septic secondary to his low grade fever, hx of sepsis and high lactate.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient being on a ventilator.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Bibasilar air space opacities, could represent pneumonia.
Attention is recommended to this region on follow up studies to assess for resolution.
Left basal effusion and scattered ground-glass opacities in both lungs with more confluent focal opacities in the lower lobes are highly suggestive of areas of infection and pneumonic consolidation.
Bilateral renal lesions, some of which are likely simple cysts but others are more dense and a mass cannot be excluded.
Distended gallbladder, without evidence of wall thickening or  pericholecystic fluid or inflammatory change.
**FINAL REPORT [**2102-1-8**]**     Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2102-1-8**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2102-1-6**]):       Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
Refer to respiratory viral culture for further information   Brief Hospital Course: 85 y/o M with hx of CHF, DM, sacral decubs, afib and dementia who presented with pneumonia and septic shock including altered mental status and hypotension,  complicated by afib with RVR during presentation.
Respiratory failure and pneumonia: Initially intubated and admitted to the MICU where he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and vasopressors.
Respiratory status was complicated by a component of volume overload and received several doses of IV lasix with good results, which was continued for a daily dose of 40mg PO Lasix.
This medication is new and may need to be decreased or stopped in the future when back to dry weight.
Also with underlying COPD, which likely further reduced respiratory function.
Since arrival to the floor respiratory status has been stable on NC, intermittantly with some decreased saturations that improved with deep suctioning.
Tube feeds were also adjusted for a lower volume so that aspiration risk is minimized and Hyoscyamine was started to decrease secreations.
# Afib with RVR: In MICU with heart rates in the 190s with drop in BPs.
CHF: history of CHF, echo in MICU with mild PA htn and EF >55%.
Also episode of demand NSTEMI with elevated trops but an unchanged EKG, likely related to demand in setting of septic shock.
# Hypernatremia: likely from poor PO intake and free water deficit.
# ARF:  On admission had a rising creatinine to a peak of 3.2.
Etiology likely prerenal given it improved quickly with IVF and resolution of septic shock.
# Dementia - Mostly non-verbal at baseline.
On presentation more altered likely due to underlying infeciton.
# DM - Well controlled on basic sliding scale and home latus 18qHS.
# Anemia: Hct stable throughout hospitalization without evidence of gross bleeding or hemorhage.
Likely combination of anemia of chronic disease and dilutional effect with copious fluids given throughout hospitalization.
Wife who is at home and is the actual proxy also agrees with DNI and just wants him to be comfortable, with minimal invasive procedures and avoiding painful procedures.
The daughter is more willing to have some aggressive measures taken, including potential for rehospitalization.

Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: Five (5) mg PO q2hours as needed for mild dyspnea.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing.
