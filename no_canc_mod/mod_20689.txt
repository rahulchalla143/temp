He remained euvolemic on exam throughout his hospital admission.
A trial dose of captopril 6.25 mg was attempted because the patient described his altace allergy as consisting of a headache.
At discharge, the patient's blood pressure tolerated a dose of 12.5 mg and he did not complain of any headache, lightheadedness, or cough.
With respect to RHYTHM, the patient reverted to normal sinus rhythm with occasional bouts of ventricular tachycardia while on amiodarone.
He was subsequently discontinued from his amiodarone before the procedure and demonstrated several more episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
On [**9-4**], the patient successfully underwent ablation therapy without complication.
There was one limited episode of five beats of ventricular tachycardia the following evening.
With respect to ISCHEMIA, the patient has known CAD but did not experience any chest pain or demonstrate EKG changes during his hospital course.
Urinalysis revealed a urinary tract infection and culture grew out 10-100K Pseudomonas resistant to levofloxacin.
Piperacillin was temporarily started per ID, but due to lack of white cells on the urinalysis, it was subsequently felt this was a long term colonization issue rather than an acute infection with the risk of bacteremia.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.

Please return to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room if you feel shocks from your defibrillator, lightheadedness, palpiations, or chest pain.
