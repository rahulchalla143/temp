In the setting of his Coumadin being held, he had sustained a fall and had significant hemorrhagic contusions to his bilateral frontal and anterior temporal lobes and had been taken care of by the neurosurgical service.
Neurology became involved in his care on [**5-16**] at which time there was some concern for a change in behavior including some greater lethargy.
An MRI showed right-sided large wedge-shaped infarcts, likely cardioembolic in etiology.
His lungs sound clear; however, there is a machine-like murmur to his heart that seems to encompass both the systolic and diastolic phases of the rhythm.
On neurological exam, the patient can make some brief verbal utterances, but is largely obtunded and inattentive.
The exam findings of mild  weakness on the left and extinction to DSS fit with a medium-sized right parietal infarct.
Patient placed on heparin will montitor with CT in am of [**2161-5-19**] he was continued Keppra 500 [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis.
Lorazepam Intensol 2 mg/mL Concentrate Sig: 1-2 mg PO q2 hours as needed for anxiety.
4. olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 931**] House Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 932**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Bifrontal Contusions Traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Acute right frontal and parietal lobe infarctions UTI acute hypokalemia chronic diastolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 28221**],  You were admitted to the hospital for bruises and bleeding in your brain after a fall.
You were also found to have a stroke during your admission.
