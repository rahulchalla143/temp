Pt reports that she progressed from dyspnea on exertion to dyspnea at rest.
She has been using frequent nebs with minimal relief.
Exam was remarkable for poor air movement.
Her last admission was [**Date range (1) 18230**] for presumed COPD flare and also included a 24 hour stay in the ICU for BiPAP.
On arrival to floor, pt continues to feel short of breath on non-rebreather.
She denies singificant cough or fevers.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
There was no significant change following inhaled bronchodilator.
Flow-Volume Loop: Moderate expiratory coving with a moderately reduced volume excursion and an early termination of exhalation.
Impression: Moderate obstructive ventilatory defect with a moderate to marked gas exchange defect.
There are no prior studies available for comparison.
CXR: Limited study due to apical lordotic positioning of the patient and lack of visualization of the left costophrenic angle.
Emphysema with no definite evidence of acute superimposed process.
If clinically feasible, consider PA and lateral views in the radiology suite, if indicated.
No evidence of bronchomalacia.
Diffuse severe emphysema.
New bilateral lower lobe bronchial wall thickening suggestive  of small airways disease.
New lower lobe mucous plugging with and subsegmental atelectasis at both lung bases.
Chronic but not previously seen bilateral rib fractures .
EKG: sinus tach, no ST changes .
[**2183-12-30**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study, pulmonary pressures not obtainable because of technically-inadequate tricuspid regurgitation jet.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchomalacia and COPD complicated by vocal cord dysfunction and uses home O2 3L at night who presented to OSH with increased SOB over past 3 days and hypoxia.
Pt reports that she progressed from dyspnea on exertion to dyspnea at rest.
She has been using frequent nebs with minimal relief.
Exam was remarkable for poor air movement.
Her last admission was [**Date range (3) 18230**] for presumed COPD flare and also included a 24 hour stay in the ICU for BiPAP.
On arrival to floor, pt continues to feel short of breath on non-rebreather.
She denies significant cough or fevers.
She has chronic arthritic pains which are typical pains for her.
# COPD exacerbation:    Ms. [**Known lastname 18231**] has been hospitalized nearly monthly for COPD flares for the past 7 months.
Pt has diffuse wheezes on exam indicative of COPD flare, but may have a LLL infiltrate on CXR (difficult to tell as L costophrenic angle cut off from film).
Repeat CXR showed left lower lobe atelectasis, unilateral retrocardiac opacities which likely indicated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, but no  evidence of acute pneumonia.
Inintially on presentation, pt reported having trouble tolerating BiPAP, but said in the past she has gotten relief from Ativan and morphine.
By MICU day 2,  Vancomycin and Cefepime were discontinued given low suspicion for HCAP, but Levofloxacin was changed from IV to PO (for a 5-day course- day 1 = [**2183-12-25**]) as most likely cause for patient's presentation was a severe COPD exacerbation.
She was discharged on acetylcysteine nebs, tesselon pearls, a prednisone taper and PRN morphine for cough and shortness of breath.
# Seizure d/o: Continued home lamotrigine .
# Depression:  patient carries a history of depressive symptoms per report.
Code: DNR, would consider intubation if believed to be due to a reversible process, confirmed with patient.
Needs to be readdressed, as patient would most likely not be able to be pulled from vent given her compromised respiratory status at baseline.
