Female w/ COPD on baseline 3L O2, HL, DM II, HTN, Schizoaffective d.o., TD, depression p/w hyperglycemia, acute exacerbation of chronic cough, hyponatremia.
Admitted to ICU for subjective dyspnea relieved with BiPAP.
COPD Exacerbation: Pt presented to the ED with sensation of air hunger and dyspnea, in the [**Name (NI) **] pt appeared to be using accessory muscles despite Methylprednisolone 125mg, several rounds of nebulizers.
On review of CXR 2 view there was no evidence of PNA.
It is possible given the increase in chronic cough, hyperglycemia that perhaps a viral syndrome could have preceeded her symptoms vs d/c of spiriva.
She underwent an echo which showed moderate pulmonary edema.
She should consider outpatient pulmonary rehabilation for her COPD.
Hyperglycemia: Pt noted to have elevated CBGs to 500 at home.
This may have been due to infection given pt's report of diet and medication adherence.
She was continued on her home Glargine in the ICU and Metformin was held in the ICU for potential contrast.
Patient was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes consult service.
Unclear etiology, she has never had hyponatremia in the past.
Her hyponatremia was believed to be [**1-12**] mild hypovolemia from increased osmotic diuresis with glucosuria in addition to her HCTZ.
