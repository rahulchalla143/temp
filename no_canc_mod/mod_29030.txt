Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe 3 vessel disease.
The proximal LAD had a 90% stenosis after D1, followed by 80% mid stenosis.
The RCA was 100% occluded proximally with distal filling via left to right collaterals.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 30 mmHg.
There was severe pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 72 mmHg.
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was severely elevated (a/v/m=44/50/40 mmHg).
There was  systemic arterial systolic hypotension with aortic systolic pressure of 96 mmHg.
Given his end stage renal disease, CVVHD was initiated for fluid management with gradual transition to hemodialysis.
He has an isolated episode of SVT which was successfully treated with Adenosine with conversion back to a normal sinus rhythm.
He initially remained critically ill and was kept intubated and sedated for several days.
He required placement of a left chest tube for hemothorax on postoperative day four.
Chest x-ray was suscipious for pneumonia.
He intermittenly required Haldol and Ativan for behavioral control.
