HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 76 year old very pleasant gentleman with a past medical history significant for invasive adenocarcinoma of the stomach status post near total gastrectomy in [**2197-10-11**], with Roux-en-Y anastomosis and partial jejunal pouch, cirrhosis, coronary artery disease and orthostatic hypotension who was admitted to [**Hospital6 2910**] on [**2198-2-15**] with complaints of nausea and dysphagia.
At the [**Hospital6 2910**] Mr. [**Known lastname 14859**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed esophageal varices and stricture.
He has had three esophageal dilatations in the past for stricture at anastomotic site.
In addition, at [**Hospital6 2910**], Mr. [**Known lastname 14859**] had a transthoracic echocardiogram for evaluation of orthostatic hypotension which was unremarkable.
He was noted to have significant orthostatic changes which was felt secondary to autonomic dysfunction after his Florinef was discontinued.
Other work-up at [**Hospital6 2910**] included paracentesis with albumin which showed SAAG greater than 1.1.
Cytology was negative for malignancy and there was no evidence of SVP.
He was unable to tolerate more than liquids while at the hospital secondary to coughing which was felt secondary to aspiration.
However, on hospital day number two, he was noted to have desaturations and tachypnea and was complaining of a feeling of an obstruction in his throat.
Invasive gastric adenocarcinoma status post near total gastrectomy in [**2197-10-11**].
He had an esophageal to jejunal anastomosis within a Roux-en-Y procedure.
He is status post three esophageal dilatations by esophagogastroduodenoscopy secondary to strictures at the anastomotic sites.
History of cirrhosis which was diagnosed in the 70s thought secondary to alcohol use.
Anastomotic site ulcer.
Coronary artery disease status post angioplasty and stent.
Autonomic dysfunction / orthostatic hypotension.
Transverse colectomy secondary to invasive gastric adenocarcinoma in [**2197-10-11**].
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
The patient is very active in Alcoholics Anonymous and has not had any alcohol since diagnosis of cirrhosis.
He has no close relatives.
He had poor dentition.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.
He had bilateral basilar crackles, right greater than left.
On abdominal examination, he had hypoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended; a very large horizontal abdominal scar was present and he was dull to percussion throughout with a positive fluid wave.
On extremities:  No lower extremity edema.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 76 year old gentleman with a history of gastric cancer status post near total gastrectomy with an esophageal duodenal Roux-en-Y procedure who has had three esophageal dilatations secondary to stricture at the anastomotic site, who was transferred from outside hospital for complaints of dysphagia and nausea.
He was transferred for evaluation of TIPS procedure and repeat EGD for evaluation of swallowing complaints which was thought secondary to aspiration.
GASTROENTEROLOGY:  As stated above, Mr. [**Known lastname 53330**] main complaint included dysphagia which was thought secondary to mechanical obstruction at his anastomotic site from a history of gastric cancer treated in 10/[**2197**].
After intubation on hospital day number five, Mr. [**Known lastname 14859**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed no stricture and a wide open anastomosis with visible aspiration of secretions.
General Surgery was consulted as well as Gastroenterology for possible interventions as it was felt that the reason he was intubated was secondary to recurrent aspiration.
The conclusions from both consultations obtained was that there was no surgical or endoscopic intervention.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:  He was intubated on hospital day number five for respiratory distress secondary to persistent aspiration through his esophageal duodenal anastomosis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 14859**] was not able to be weaned from the ventilator given the development of metabolic acidosis which will be described below.
ENTEROCOCCUS BACTEREMIA:  On [**2198-3-1**], Mr. [**Known lastname 14859**] had a one out of four blood culture bottles growing enterococcus which was sensitive to Vancomycin.
He had a subclavian line at that time which was discontinued and the catheter tip sent for culture which did not have any growth.
LEUKOCYTOSIS:  On hospital day number six and seven, the patient had significant and acute increase in his white blood cell count from 11 to 41.
There was no clear source of infection, however, given the rapid and very high increase in his white count, Clostridium difficile colitis was suspected.
In addition, other diagnoses which were entertained were sepsis and mesenteric ischemia.
A CT scan of the abdomen was performed which showed no evidence of abscess with some colonic thickening which was nonspecific.
Also of note, he had significant ascites which was tapped and showed 85 white cells and a SAAG of less than 1; therefore it was not felt that the patient had peritonitis as an explanation for his leukocytosis.
It was felt that this was mostly toxic metabolic in nature given his significant leukocytosis and likely hepatic encephalopathy.
He had a number of reasons for his hypotension including acute issues such as sepsis, leukocytosis, sedating medications, nutritional deficiency as well as chronic issues which included baseline autonomic dysfunction.
Mr. [**Known lastname 14859**] has no relatives in the area.
Invasive gastric carcinoma status post total gastrectomy in [**2197-10-11**] with a transverse colectomy.
Respiratory failure secondary to recurrent aspiration.
Leukocytosis which was likely secondary to Clostridium difficile colitis, possible mesenteric ischemia.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use.
