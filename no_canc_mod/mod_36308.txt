Pain began in the setting of practical exam for surgical technician training.
The pain was [**10-15**], radiated to the left arm and jaw, and was associated with diaphoresis.
There was no nausea or vomiting.
At end of procedure, pt showed cyanosis on R thigh and foot, with brisk PT pulse by report, assoc with no pain.
ACE-I was held given recent contrast load and mild hypovolemia.
He had continued diaphoresis, mild chest pain, but repeat EKG no changes suggestive of ichemia.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI [**33**] yrs ago Multiple Sclerosis dx'd 18 yrs ago HTN Hyperlipidemia Depression ADD   Social History: Married with 2 sons.
Physical Exam: VS: afebrile 106/73 49 20 96% RA Gen: anxious appearing, diaphoretic HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA Neck: no JVD CV: S1, S2.
No pain with palpation.
Ischemia:  Pt p/w inferior STEMI with 90% blockage in LCx and 70% in RCA.
RLE cyanosis observed after catheterization was reduced after removal of venous sheath and did not recur during inpatient course; right sided LENIs revealed no evidence of DVT and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not show evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Pt had transient chest pain for 1 day following the procedure, but pain was not associated with ischemic EKG changes.
Chest pain was not apparent by day #2 post-catheterization.
The post-catheterization course was benign, with no evidence of cyanotic extremities.
The patient transiently complained of chest pain following the procedure; the CP was not associated with EKG changes suggestive of ischemia.
The pain subsided by 6 hours post-cath.
Pump:  Echcardiogram on [**2126-2-8**] was significant for impaired systolic function, with EF 30-35%.
There were multiple wall motion abnormalities, including: inferolateral, mid-distal anterioseptal, and distal anterior akinesis; and inferior hypokinesis.
These abnormalities were considered to be possibly related to hibernating or stunned myocardium; follow-up echocardiogram 3-4 weeks post-discharge will be helpful to determine the level of recovery of hibernating/stunned myocardium and the need for AICD placement.
Rhythm:  During the inpatient course, Mr. [**Known lastname 108450**] had persistent asymptomatic bradycardia, which was ntreated.
Cyanosis s/p cath  As mentioned above, the RLE cyanosis post-cath#1 was considered to be due to venous insufficiency.
