During work up, patient had previous CTA demonstrating severe carotid artery stenosis, thought to be ammenable to stenting.
Cath at that time revealed 90-99% stenosis of the L ICA with post-stent imaging revealing good flow through the L ICA with 30% residual stenosis.
The procedure was complicated by a brief period of bradycardia/asystole and hypotension during stent deployment which was controlled with glycopyrrolate.
The patient was reported to complain of some chest pain at the completion of the procedure while in the PACU.
An EKG demonstrated some lateral ST segment changes concerning for ischemic change consistent with her known coronary stenoses which was reported to subsequently improve over approximately 4 hours.
Given the patient's chest pain and EKG changes, she was transferred to the CCU for observation while waiting for CABG.

She denies any chest pain currently.
She reports intermittent shortness of breath which is her baseline per her report.
OP: MMM, no dentition.
Neck: Harsh carotid bruits vs. radiating AS murmur bilaterally, pulses not attempted.
No JVD Chest: Lungs CTA bilaterally anterior, laterally and posterior Cor: RRR, +III-VI/VI harsh late systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur with loss of S2.
+ Bruit heard over left femoral.
Extremities: Lower extremities cool bilaterally, without edema or cyanosis Pulses: DP and PT not palpable bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: [**2122-1-20**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity.
[**2122-1-21**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic uypertension.
There is hyperechoic thrombus surrounding the right internal jugular venous catheter.
The right subclavian vein demonstrates normal flow and no evidence of thrombus.
The left subclavian vein also demonstrates normal flow and waveform and no evidence of thrombosis.
[**2122-1-29**] CXR Small right pleural effusion has increased, small amount of left pleural effusion has improved slightly.
Significant left lower lobe atelectasisp persists.
Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.
No pneumothorax.

The procedure was complicated by chest pain and asystole which responded to glycopyrrolate.
Postprocedure she was taken to the recovery unit where she continued to have chest pain and EKG changes.
Nitroglycerin and heparin were started with some relief of her symptoms and she was transfused for postoperative anemia.
The cardiology service was consulted and her cardiac enzymes were cycled which ruled her in for a myocardial infarction.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed normal right and left ventricular ejection fractions with no significant change from her prior study.
She remained intubated for some hypoxia and thick secretions.
A right chest tube was placed on [**2122-1-24**] for a pleural effusion without complication.
Amiodarone was started for atrial fibrillation with good effect.
