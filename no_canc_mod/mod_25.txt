The patient had a past medical history significant for hypertension, glaucoma, and breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, XRT in [**2176**].
She was in her usual state of health until [**12-2**] when she began to note shortness of breath.
She saw her PCP and performed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest x-ray, which revealed a right upper lobe density.
This was followed up with a CT scan, which revealed a lobulated mass of 2.3 cm in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe and bilateral lobe interstitial fibrosis.
The patient had a mediastinoscopy, which showed no evidence of malignancy or lymph nodes.
Lung biopsy was performed, which revealed pulmonary fibrosis.
Subsequent spirometry revealed a mild restrictive defect.
Attempts made to place a temporary pacing wire but during the procedure the patient suffered respiratory arrest.
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to evaluate her hypotension and revealed an SVR of 2473 with a cardiac output of 2.2.
Urgent TTE revealed normal systolic function, no pericardial effusion.
The patient was empirically treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for hypotension, which was thought possibly due to sepsis.
By hospital day 4, she continued to have mild respiratory distress despite being extubated.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Her lungs revealed diffuse crackles bilaterally.
Lower extremity revealed no edema.
Chest x-ray on admission to MICU revealed persistent bilateral upper lobe patchy opacities, may represent interstitial edema plus aspiration.
Continued patchy atelectasis within the left lower lobe and small left pleural effusion.
Subsequently, she developed a picture consistent with ARDS and required multiple pressors.
Hyperkalemia causing cardiopulmonary arrest.
