EKG with no evidence of ischemia.
Her R renal artery had 60% stenosis with no significant stenosis.
He was transferred to the CCU for management of hypertensive emergency and CHF exacerbation.

Past Medical History: Coronary artery disease s/p CABG [**10/2105**] (LIMA->LAD; SVG to OM2; SVG to PDA) Type II diabetes mellitus Hypertension Cardiomyopathy (EF 30-35%) Post-CABG atrial fibrillation with recent Holter that showed no atrial fibrillation Hypercholesterolemia Pseudogout Peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease s/p lower extremity artherectomy Tobacco use prior TIA [**2091**] s/p R CEA [**12/2102**] s/p stenting of R brachiocephalic to subclavian   Social History: Has not smoked since CABG, although has a significant smoking history (at least 100 PYs).
He has 3 children, no history of breast cancer in them.
His son had gynecomastia with onset at age 12, which required surgical excision  Physical Exam: T 95.0, BP 196/104, HR 69, RR 11, O2sat 92% 2LNC, I/O [**Telephone/Fax (1) 109284**] General: NAD, appears comfortable, lying in bed HOB 30deg, speaking in full sentences HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, dry MM Neck: JVP ~9cm, no bruits CV: PMI nondisplaced, RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur at RUSB RESP: breath sounds decreased at both bases, rales 1/3 up b/l Abd: +BS, soft, NT, ND, no masses Ext: trace BLE edema, 2+ DPs on right, 1+ DP on left Neuro: A&Ox3, CNs III-XII intact to challenge, strength 5/5 UEs/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/l, sensation intact to LT throughout   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: GLUCOSE-176* UREA N-21* CREAT-1.1 SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-4.0 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-16 .
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated LMCA and 3 vessel native coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had severe diffuse disease with heavy calcification.
The SVG-OM1 was patent without lesions.
The SVG-RCA was patent without lesions.
The LSCA had no demonstrable gradient across the proximal stent which was difficult to engage.
Non-selective [**Female First Name (un) 899**] angiography demonstrated no critical lesions in the LSC or the origin fo the [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
Right renal artery angiography demonstrated 60% lesion that did not have significant gradient with vasodilator therapy.
The right sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 9mmHg and RVEDP was 14mmHg).
The systemic arterial  pressures were significant elevated measuring 198/86mmHg.
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pull back of the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
LMCA and native 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
Depressed cardiac index.
Non-hemodynamically significant right renal artery stenosis.
Head CT [**2105-12-24**]: FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of infarction.
Low attenuation in the periventricular white matter is consistent with chronic microvascular infarction and was seen on [**2107-1-4**].
There is a new linear calcification in the region of the right middle cerebral artery within the sylvian fissure.
No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
No evidence of infarction.
New linear area of calcification along the right middle cerebral artery in the region of the right sylvian fissure.
While this may represent atherosclerosis, an underlying aneurysm should be suspected.
[**2105-12-26**] MRI/A: FINDINGS, BRAIN MRI: There are several areas of slow diffusion identified in the brain.
These areas are small and noted in the right posterior frontal, left frontal subcortical, right occipital subcortical, and left medial occipital cortical regions indicative of small acute infarcts.
Location in both cerebral hemispheres suggests embolic event.
There is mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and small vessel disease seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter.
A chronic small right cerebellar infarct is identified.
There is no mass effect or midline shift seen.
IMPRESSION: Several small cortical and subcortical areas of slow diffusion indicative of acute infarcts.
No evidence of [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] occlusion or high-grade stenosis seen.
There is no evidence of aneurysm visualized at the site of calcifications seen on CT.
This calcification could be due to calcification in the vessel wall or a calcified plaque or a calcified embolus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] occlusion or stenosis seen on MRA of the head.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 71M with hx of CAD s/p CABG, CHF (30%) transferred to the CCU with hypertensive emergency and CHF exacerbation.
# Hypoglycemia: Had 1 episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia (confusion, headache, jaw and arm numbness) to 32 after getting his home morning doses of insulin.
Insulin dosage was moderately decreased and he had no further episodes of hypoglycemia.
# Hypertensive emergency: Unclear etiology as patient denies med noncompliance and dietary indiscretion, and renal artery stenosis does not appear to be significant enough.
He had headaches associated with high blood pressures (above 160 systolic), with nausea and vomiting that resolved with control of BP.
Head CT was negative for acute process, but showed linear opacification thought to be MCA atherosclerosis, confirmed by MRA.
# CHF: H/o both systolic and diastolic dysfunction with EF 30-35%, likely ischemic cardiomyopathy.
History c/w acute pulmonary edema, likely [**1-29**] hypertension.
He ruled out for MI with no EKG changes to suggest new ischemic event, 3 sets cardiac enzymes with flat CKs and troponin very mildly elevated.
# CAD: h/o CAD s/p 3v CABG [**09**]/[**2104**].
EKG with no evidence of acute ischemia.
CE x3 with flat CKs and very mildly elevated troponin.
# Rhythm: H/o perioperative Afib, subsequent Holter monitor with no recurrence.
Did have several small runs of NSVT and in combination with low EF he should have outpatient follow-up with repeat echo in 6 weeks for risk stratification for ICD placement.
# Type II DM: (see hypoglycemia) Had episode of low BS.
Had slight bump in bun/cr likely secondary to diruesis (to early for contrast nephropathy).
He received mucomyst before and after cath, but no hydration secondary to CHF exacerbation.
# Small Embolic strokes: Found small ?embolic subacute embolic strokes on MRI.
Not likely cause of above neuro symptoms.
