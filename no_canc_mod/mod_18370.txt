Patient repors she has been feeling short of breath with normal daily activities (making her bed, going to the kitchen) that was new.
She presented to her PCP with these complaints and she was empirically treated for a community acquired pneumonia.
Cardiac enzymes were also drawn and patient was called to present to ED after these returned elevated (per report 1.5, unclear if Tn T or I).
Patient denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, light headedness, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
She does point out however that she has never had symptoms with any of her heart attacks but rather that these present with URI symptoms.
No excessive bleeding after recent bypass however.
Denies any hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, but does report chronic bilateral ankle edema.
Denies palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: EKG: ([**2116-12-26**]) NSR at 87 with incomplete right bundle branch block, TWI at aVL, I and V2, with 1mm ST elevation in V2-V3.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: ([**2116-12-26**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall, with extensive apical akinesis and focal apical dyskinesis (no definite apical thrombus seen but cannot exclude with certainty).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-10-5**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is further depressed, secondary to extensive hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall.
ETT: ([**2116-12-23**]) Ramping cycle ergometer protocol, 3 mins INTERPRETATION: This 71 yo woman (h/o silent NSTEMI and s/p CABG on [**2116-10-12**]) was referrred to the lab for evaluation.
The patient  completed 3.75 minutes on a ramping cycle ergometer protocol and was stopped due to marked shortness of breath and fatigue.
The patient denied any neck, chest, arm or back discomfort throughout the study.
No significant ST segment changes were noted from baseline.
IMPRESSION: Marked shortness of breath noted at a low workload.
No ischemic EKG changes noted.
Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Occluded SVG-OM venous conduits 4.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Successful placement of an IABP via the left femoral artery.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the left main - proximal left  circumflex with a Xience drug eluting stent.
CHEST X-RAY: Personal review demonstrates partially rotated film with blunted left costophrenic angle and right lower lobe opacity, with minimal change from prior in [**10-17**] (with exception of left sublavian line which not present now).

# ACS/ NSTEMI: Initial cardiac catherization showed restenosis of bypass grafts (except SVG-RCA) not felt to be repeat surgical candidate and thus underwent LCX stenting and PTCA to LAD.
Medical management of CAD including heparin gtt, plavix, ASA, statin were continued.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath.
You were found to have a small heart attack (NSTEMI).
You underwent cardiac catheterization and found to have blockages in multiple arteries including the grafts that were created during your recent CABG.
Your heart function was evaluated and you were found to have slightly worse heart function.
You were given medications to remove excess fluid from your body.
Please contact your doctor or go to the emergency room if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain or pressure, worsening shortness of breath, difficulty breathing with minimal exertion, lightheadedness/dizziness or other concerning symtpoms.
