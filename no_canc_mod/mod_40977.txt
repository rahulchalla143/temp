Admission Date:  [**2141-5-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-5-10**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year-old male with a history of diastolic dysfunction, recent MRSA pneumonia, and asthma, who initially presented on [**2141-5-1**] with a 1-day history of increased SOB, productive cough and congestion.
On arrival to the ED, CXR showed moderate CHF.
In ED, he was also noted to have anterolateral EKG changes, with new TWI in I, aVL, and "pseudonormalization" of T waves in V3-6.
Hypertension 3.
Asthma 4.
History of bronchiolitis obliterans pneumonia ([**4-/2134**]) 5.
Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine high 2s-low 3s 6.
History of diverticular bleed, and upper GI bleed in 03/[**2140**].
Colonic adenoma 8.
CVA in [**2127**] 10.
MRSA pneumonia in [**2-/2141**]  Social History: He is originally from [**Country 4812**].
Bilateral expiratory wheezes.
Heart exam limited secondary to breath sounds.
Relevant imaging data: [**2141-5-2**] CXR: Moderate CHF [**2141-5-2**] CXR: NG tube, worsened CHF [**2141-5-2**] CXR: ETT, persistent pulmonary edema  ECHO [**2141-5-2**]: LV thickness normal.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal septal and apical akinesis.
Aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened and there is focal calcification of the noncoronary cusp.
[**2141-5-3**] CXR: Moderately severe pulmonary edema has changed in distribution but not in overall severity, accompanied by persistent small left and small-to-moderate right pleural effusion and borderline cardiomegaly.
[**2141-5-9**] CXR: Small bilateral plerual effusions, with RLL atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year-old male with CHF, CRI, prior GI bleed (both upper and lower), admitted with respiratory failure.
Respiratory failure: His acute decompensation was felt most consistent with flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation.
CAD: His cardiac enzymes on admission were noted to be trending up, and an EKG was concerning for "pseudonormalization" of T waves in V3-6 versus 04/[**2140**].
He was briefly started on heparin, which was discontinued in the setting of a hematocrit drop and probable demand ischemia rather than ACS.
An echo was obtained on [**2141-5-2**], which revealed new systolic dysfunction with EF 35%, with mid to distal septal and apical akinesis.
He was started on Captopril while in the ICU, subsequently discontinued in the setting of an acute rise in his creatinine.
CHF: As noted above, he was found to have new systolic dysfunction, felt likely secondary to a recent anterior MI.
In addition, he likely has a component of diastolic dysfunction.
His acute presentation was felt secondary to flash pulmonary edema, and he responded well to diuresis.
GI bleed: While in the hospital, he was noted to have guaiac positive stools, associated with a hematocrit drop to 24 on [**2141-5-2**] (albeit also in the setting of a short course of IV heparin).
CRI: Patient with known CKD with fluctuating creatinine at baseline, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3271**] as an out-patient.
While in the hospital, his creatinine rose to a peak of 4.2, at one point with concomitant hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia.
A recent renal U/S in [**2-/2141**] was remarkable for thin cortices suggestive of parenchymal disease.
The renal service was consulted on [**2141-5-9**] for further advice, with an impression of probable hypertensive nephrosclerosis possibly also with superimposed FSGS.
A repeat U/A was negative, and a repeat CXR showed only RLL atelectasis without clear infiltrate.
7) Hematuria: While in the hospital, he was noted to have microscopic hematuria.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**12-19**] Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Congestive heart failure Probable coronary artery disease Chronic kidney disease Hyponatremia Tracheobronchitis Gastrointestinal bleeding   Discharge Condition: Patient discharged home in stable condition, with stable saturation on room air.
Please return to the ED or call your PCP if you develop chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, or if you notice black or bloody stools.
