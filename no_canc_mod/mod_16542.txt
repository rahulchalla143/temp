Admission Date:  [**2169-9-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-10-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2131-5-10**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Neurosurgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 38-year-old gentleman who fell at work after having a generalized seizure.
He was transferred to [**Hospital3 17310**] where a head CT showed a left subdural hematoma and left fronto-temporal interparenchymal contusion with a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
He had a repeat head CT which showed an increase in the subdural hematoma and parenchymal blood with a temporo-parietal contusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2169-9-18**], the patient had a repeat head CT which showed evolution of the left fronto-temporal contusion, overall mass effect and not significantly changed.
The right arm was moving less than the left arm, and there was a question of a generalized seizure.
The patient was extubated on [**2169-9-19**] and tolerated it until [**2169-9-20**] when he required reintubation for an obstruction of his airway and secretions.
The patient also had a lumbar puncture done on [**2169-9-21**] for a temperature of 104 to rule out meningitis from attempted ventriculostomy drain placement.
The patient had an EEG which showed no seizure activity and continued to improve neurologically until [**2169-9-26**] when his mental status deteriorated.
Head CT showed an increase in swelling.
The patient had a repeat head CT on [**2169-9-27**] which showed increase in midline shift, left temporal edema and slight increase in ventricular size with ventricular drain placed.
On [**2169-9-29**], the patient had a repeat head CT which showed an increase in size of the left subdural hematoma.
The patient was taken to the operating room and had a bur hole drainage of the left subdural hematoma without intraoperative complications.
He was seen by the Hematology Service for an increasing platelet count.
The patient's thrombocytosis was thought to be secondary to inflammation with no immediate treatment required.
CT showed stable size of the residual subdural fluid and a small amount of blood in the track from the ventriculostomy drain.
CT scan showed mild decrease in brain edema.
He remained neurologically awake and alert, moving all extremities, confused and agitated at times with severe receptive aphasia, but slowly improving.
