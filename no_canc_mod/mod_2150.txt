[**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 71 year old female with a history of hypertension who presents with hypotension, fevers and dysuria, consistent with septic physiology likely secondary to urinary source.
Hypotension responsive to fluid resucitation  # Hypotension/fevers: Likely secondary to sepsis with leukocytosis to 24.5 with bandemia to 12, most suspicious for a urinary source, given urinary symptoms and recent E.coli on urine culture.
Pt had completed [**4-9**] doses of DS Bactrim for UTI as outpt; E.coli resistant to Bactrim.
MRSA coverage not indicated given no indwelling lines or recent hospitalizations.
No indication for pseudomonal coverage given urine culture.
Pt was transferred to the MICU where hypotension was responsive to fluid rescucitation and IV antibiotics.
# Acute renal failure: SCr 1.9, baseline SCr 0.9.
# Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 16 on presentation in ED, found to have lactate to 3.7, which came down with IVF and antibiotics.
Suspect that AG was secondary to lactic acidosis in setting of acute infection.
