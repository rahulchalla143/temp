The patient is a 64 year-old female with a history of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**12-12**] with exertional chest pain and shortness of breath as well as a productive cough.
She was found to have pneumonia clinically and was treated with Rocephin antibiotics.
She was also found to have had a non ST elevation myocardial infarction with peak troponin I of 14.2 and peak CK of 569.
Catheterization was performed on [**12-13**] and revealed mitral regurgitation, 50% ejection fraction, normal left main, diffuse disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery with a 70% mid lesion and occluded left circumflex after the obtuse marginal one and a mid to distal 70% lesion of the right coronary artery with a probable thrombus.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome surgery.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient did admit on review of systems to some visual changes secondary to retinopathy and a cough at the time residual from her treatment of pneumonia.
Her extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
She was alert and oriented times three and grossly intact neurologically and peripheral pulses were present throughout carotid, radial, dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  Recommendations were sent that the laboratory work be completed prior to preparation for cardiac surgery.
Preoperative pulmonary medicine consultation was performed on [**12-17**] who noted the persistent bronchitis and probable bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient did have periodic episodes of mild fleeting chest pressure and a urinary tract infection also for which she was on antibiotics.
The CT scan showed some evidence of emphysema with a question of bronchiectasis.
On [**12-19**] the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with a left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, vein graft to the obtuse marginal and a vein graft to the right coronary artery.
The patient was in sinus rhythm, slightly tachycardic at 99 with a cardiac index of 2.0.
The patient had rhonchi bilaterally.
The patient did have an episode of tachycardia at 140 and was given Lopressor for beta blockade by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54094**].
The patient remained on bed rest at that time pending resolution of tachycardia.
The patient went into atrial fibrillation at 2:42 on [**12-22**].
Back in sinus rhythm at 86 with periodic atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day five the patient had completed two units of packed red blood cell transfusion for a blood loss anemia and the patient continued to ambulate and was doing well.
The plan was that the patient could go home with physical therapy and antibiotics continued for coverage of the preoperative pneumonia and urinary tract infections.
On postoperative day six the patient had no complaints and no events overnight.
The patient did have 1+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
On postoperative day seven the patient had gone back into atrial fibrillation overnight, so discharge was delayed for another 24 hours, but in the morning on the 11th the patient was back in sinus rhythm at 75 with a good blood pressure and saturating well despite some faint bibasilar crackles with the plan that if there was no atrial fibrillation overnight then the patient could be discharged home in the morning.
Both lower extremities had mild peripheral edema.
