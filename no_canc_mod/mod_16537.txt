Admission Date:  [**2161-1-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-1-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-8-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: S/P Fall with transfer from outside hospital with head bleeds  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left sided subdural hematoma evacuation   History of Present Illness: 61 y/o M w/ h/o MVC resulting in coma 5 yrs ago and 2 SDH resulting after bad falls in subsequent years presents to ED with CT scan showing SDH, SAH after wife noticed pt acting more lethargic, sleepy and agitated over the past 4 days.
Patient denies loss of consciousness, but does state that he hit his head.
At baseline, the patient has an unsteady gait and dysarthric speech acording to his wife.
Past Medical History: hypertension, depression, CAD with cardiac arrest, anxiety, s/p MVC 5yrs ago resulting in a coma for 7 days and deficits in gait and speech, s/p fall backwards 4yrs ago resulting in SDH, s/p fall down stairs 2-3yrs ago resulting in left frontal lobe SDH with midline shift.
Language: Speech fluent, moderate expressive aphasia and significant dysarthria.
V, VII: Mild facial droop on left.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
He indicated "Left extra-axial hematoma representing epidural hematoma has increased in size, measuring 26 mm in greatest dimension.
Mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle is new.
Right and left-sided subdural hematoma also along the falx and layering over the tentorium.
Minimal effacement of the suprasellar cistern and compression of the brainstem is concerning for impending herniation.
No gross aneurysm.
Old nasal bone fracture.
Paranasal sinus mucosal disease.
FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital CT scan does indicate that there has been relatively prominent interval increase in size of the left-sided posterior temporal extra-axial hemorrhage.
I believe this finding still represents subdural hemorrhage, as there is also considerable subdural blood more anteriorly overlying the anterior aspect of the left temporal lobe.
The large right-sided cerebral convexity acute subdural hemorrhage is stable in size.
There is somewhat increased mass effect upon the left atrium, and perhaps a few millimeters rightward shift of the septum pellucidum.
There is probably a minimal quantity of subarachnoid blood in the left sylvian fissure and layering in the left atrium.
Compared with the prior CT angiogram performed on [**2157-7-4**], there does not appear to be any overt interval change.
There is the expected displacement of the cortical vessels away from the inner table of the skull, secondary to the large extra-axial hemorrhages.
No definite sign of an aneurysm is seen.
It was my impression at that time of the first study that there was a left-sided trigeminal artery present, which is a congenital carotid/basilar anastomosis accounting for the basilar artery discontinuity.
The CT angiogram does not appear to show definite sign of an aneurysm at this time.
Enlargement of left posterior temporal component of large subdural hemorrhage, compared with the prior study.
Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage within the left sylvian fissure.
Tiny amount of blood within the left lateral ventricle.
The majority of the left-sided extra-axial hemorrhage has been evacuated with a small component remaining.
Additionally the amount of subdural hemorrhage tracking along the falx and tentorium appears improved.
Right-sided subdural hematoma is not significantly changed extending up to 16 mm from  the skull base (2:10).
Intraventricular hemorrhage is again noted within the lateral ventricles bilaterally with a small component likely within the inferior fourth ventricle.
There has been worsening of hydrocephalus involving the left lateral ventricle with dilatation of the occipital and temporal horns which is new from prior exam.
Additionally there is slightly increased mass effect noted along the right lateral ventricle.
Regions of encephalomalacia involving the left frontal and parietal lobe are stable as is diffuse paranasal mucosal sinus disease.
Subarachnoid components bilaterally are not significantly changed.
Evacuation of left-sided extra-axial component with decreased subdural hemorrhage tracking along the falx and tentorium.
Right-sided subdural hematoma displays no short interval change from 5 a.m. examination.
Persistent intraventricular hemorrhage within the lateral ventricles and likely within the fourth ventricle.
There is new hydrocephalus involving the left ventricle predominantly within the occipital and temporal horns which are dilated.
Slightly increased mass effect noted along the right lateral ventricle.
Diffuse unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage.
[**1-26**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Preliminary Report FINDINGS:  Similar appearance of left subdural hematoma status post evacuation, although with decreased pneumocephalus.
Similar appearance of subdural hemorrhage tracking along the falx and tentorium.
Right-sided subdural hematoma is essentially unchanged measuring up to 13 mm.
Intraventricular hemorrhage is seen bilaterally, although more pronounced on the left.
Slight improvement of hydrocephalus involving the left ventricle with decreased size of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Follow up CT showed slight improvement of left sided subdural and continued with right sided subdural.
CT scan on POD 1 showed no interval change in the subdural heamtomas from the post operative CT scan.
On [**1-27**], a repeat Head Ct was performed which showed a left extraaxial fluid collection increased in size from 7mm to 9mm, increased mass effect on lateral ventricles, effacement of sulci and minimal increase in shift of midline structures.
Medications on Admission: Amoxicillin - for nasal sinus infection started [**1-23**], Lisinopril (dose uncertain at this time), Atenolol (dose uncertain at this time), Zocor (dose uncertain at this time), Klonopin 5mg qhs, Depakote 50mg [**Hospital1 **], Folic Acid (dose uncertain at this time)   Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral subdural hematomas and SAH   Discharge Condition: Expired   Completed by:[**2161-5-19**
