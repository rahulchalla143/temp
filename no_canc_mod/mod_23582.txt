Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with right olecranon osteomyelitis.
Patient has history of ventilator-associated pneumonia with resistant pseudomonas in recent cultures (sensitive only to tobramycin but treated with cefepime with good result) and reports that over the last few days he has had increasing SOB worse than baseline.
In addition he has had increasing secretions.
He thinks he may also have been having fevers (low-grade).
Reportedly received cefepime and/or levoquin in the ED  for history of pseudomonal VAP since already on Vancomycin for osteomyelitis was covered for MRSA.
On the floor,  patient complained of SOB and requested nebulizer treatments.

Images: CXR (wet read): limited study secondar to pt body habitus/scoliosis; RML consolidation - may represent aspiration vs PNA  .
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia with <1mm STE I avl slightly worse than prior and TWI III.
Brief Hospital Course: # Respiratory distress/SOB: Afebrile, no leukocytosis and no evidence of pneumonia on chest xray (although exam difficult due to patient anatomy.)
Initially started on cipro, cefepime for history of Pseudomonas pneumonia.
No microbiologic evidence of bacteria from sputum, Legionella antigen negative.
Thought likely secondary to Enterococcus bacteremia, and cipro, cefepime were discontinued.
# R Olecranon Osteomyelitis: Increased vancomycin dose initially due to low trough, then switched to daptomycin after consultation with ID as clinically no improvement.
# Enterococcal bacteremia: Initial blood cultures grew Enterococcus and coag neg Staph.
The patient will follow up with ID on an outpatient basis (as he was doing prior to admission for his osteomyelitis.)
# Chronic obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease: Continued on home dose of prednisone 15mg daily and bactrim prophylaxis with prn nebs and chest PT.
