lady with PMH of HTN presented to ER after passing out and having left side weakness after that.
80 RHF with HTN and no other known PMH was brought to the ED for evaluation of left sided weakness.
ICU admission: 80F w/ hx of HTN presented to ED after syncopal episode followed by L-sided weakness and dysarthria.
CT head showed no evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarct.
After receiving approximately half the tPA dose, she began to have gum bleeding.
Shortly thereafter the patient's L-sided weakness showed some improvement; dysarthria continued.
En route to the SICU, the patient became bradycardic to the 30s, lethargic, and showed worsening L-sided weakness and neglect compared to that demonstrated in the ED.
She was given a 1000cc bolus of LR with improvement in heart rate to the 40s/low 50s and mild improvement in her mental status.
She underwent a STAT non-contrast head CT, which showed no evidence of hemorrhage.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of PFO or ASD.
Simple atheroma in the thoracic aorta.
Radiology: [**2140-6-8**] CTA-head/neck: A tiny amount of calcific plaque is noted in the right carotid bulb.
No significant stenosis is noted in the left carotid circulation.
No areas of thrombosis or dissection are noted either.
[**2140-6-8**] CT-head perfusion: Elevated MTT in a moderately-large right MCA territory consistent with an infarct in this region.
No intra-arterial thrombosis or evidence of dissection noted.
[**2140-6-8**] NCHCT: No intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2140-6-8**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.
[**2140-6-9**]: Evolving right MCA-territory infarct with hemorrhagic conversion.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus .
[**2140-6-11**] CT-head: Evolving right MCA infarction with hemorrhagic conversion with blood products slightly more prominent.
Continued effacement of the right cerebral sulci and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
Small hiatal hernia.
Mildly elevated R hemidiaphragm of indeterminate chronicity.
Moderate fecal loading.
Calcified uterine fibroids + pessary.
Secondary diagnoses: CT-torso showed enlarged thyroid and intermediate density renal cystic lesions Bacterial vaginosis Urinary tract infection .
80 yo W with h/o HTN "passed out" per husband found to have R gaze pref, L hemiparesis and dysarthria.
CT head did not shows any hemorrhage or signs of infarct, CTA shows cut off in the right M2 segment, CT perfusion showed increased MTT in the right hemisphere with decreased flow in the area, perfusion volume mismatched with MTT.
MRI showed an acute right middle cerebral artery territorial infarct with blood products.
Echo showed EF 70%, focal calcifications in the aortic arch and mild 1+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] had TEE [**2140-6-14**] which showed no cardiac source of embolus identified with no evidence of PFO or ASD with bubble.
As no cause for her stroke, she proceeded to a CT-torso to rule out malignancy which showed minimal abnormalities on preliminary read (formal read awaited at time of writing) with heterogeneously enlarged thyroid and intermediate density renal cystic lesions which should be followed as an outpatient.
Patient had vaginal discharge and was found to have bacterial vaginosis on review by OB/Gyn although swab was indeterminate.
She also had evidence of a UTI and treated with po ciprofloxacin for 7 days.
Her left sided weakness and neglect improved and her dysarthria improved although fluctuates throughout the day with persistent hemi-sensory loss.
# R MCA infarct: Patient presented with left hemiparesis, right gaze preference and dysarthria and found to have an acute left MCA stroke on CT-perfusion and MRI imaging and as she was within the time window received IV thrombolysis.
She worked with PT/OT and speech and swallow.
Work-up for the etiology of her stroke included echo and TEE which showed no cardiac causes and fibrinogen was mildly elevated at 633.
Clinically the patient has improving left hemiparesis and neglect with still significant left facial weakness.
Dysarthria fluctuates during the day but has improved and left hemisensory loss.
As no cause for her stroke, she proceeded to a CT-torso to rule out malignancy which showed minimal abnormalities on preliminary read (formal read awaited at time of writing) with heterogeneously enlarged thyroid and intermediate density renal cystic lesions which should be followed as an outpatient.
# HTN: Hypertensive in house and initially had anti-hypertensives were held to allow auto-regulation.
# Bacterial vaginosis: Patient has a pessary in place and was noted to have foul-smelling vaginal discharge.
# UTI: Positive UA but in context of vaginal discharge.
We treated for complicated UTI with ciprofloxacin 7 days.
# Enlarged thyroid and renal cysts: CT-torso showed heterogeneously enlarged thyroid and intermediate density renal cystic lesions and should have ultrasound follow-up of both of these as an out-patient.
Secondary diagnoses: Bacterial vaginosis Urinary tract infection CT-torso showed enlarged thyoid and intermediate density renal cystic lesions   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You presented after passing out and you were found to have left sided weakness.
You were assessed by neurology in the ED and  CT scanning showed evidence of a stroke in the left side of the brain.
You received clot-busting therapy for the blood vessel that was blocked and caused your stroke and you were transferred to the ICU for monitoring.
You were assessed with an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) which was unremarkable and a further echocardiogram with the use of an endoscopy showed no evidence of clot in the heart.
You also had swallowing problems as a result of your stroke and you were placed on a modified diet after review by speech and swallow specialists.
You had a CT scan of the body which showed some slight enlargement of the thyroid gland and will have to have an ultrasound as an out-patient to assess this and cysts (which can be normal) within the kidneys which should also be assessed by ultrasound as an out-patient.
You were also fond to have vaginal discharge and were felt to have bacterial vaginosis and and UTI.
Your symptoms were very slowly improving and you were transferred to rehabilitation on [**2140-6-16**].
