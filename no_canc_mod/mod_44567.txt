Urine tox screen was positive for methadone.
Imaging was significant for bibasilar atelectasis, no evidence of any infectious process.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a hypodense lesion in the right side of the C6 vertebral body.
This may represent a hemangioma or focal fat deposition.
Cardiomegaly and prominent pulmonary artery.
Mildly fatty liver.
Steatohepatitis cannot be excluded based on imaging.
No acute process of the abdomen orpelvis.

Sludge in the gallbladder with no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] w/o contrast [**2188-3-13**]: Diffuse marrow signal abnormality involving the cervical spine, which may be seen with reactive marrow changes in patients with anemia, diffuse neoplastic marrow infiltration such as with lymphoma is also a consideration.
The focal lesion seen in C6 vertebral body likely represents an atypical hemangioma.

Small bilateral pleural effusions, right larger than left, with adjacent compressive atelectasis and bilateral lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis, worse since [**2188-3-7**].
Diffuse ground-glass opacity throughout the lungs is nonspecific but may be related to fluid overload in the appropriate clinical setting.
Circumferential esophageal wall thickening may be due to esophagitis.
Right lower extremity ultrasound [**2188-3-19**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right leg.
She was found to have acute kidney and liver injury, which presumable caused accumulation of methadone, explaining her mental status on presentation.
As the patient's mental status improved, she began to withdraw, and methadone was titrated until her withdrawal symptoms were relieved.
She underwent TEE, which was negative for valvular vegetation.
She received naloxone in the field without improvement of her mental status.
Precipitating source not completely clear, mildly elevated acetaminophen level of 7 (given at OSH) but has subsequently trended to 0.
Once the patient woke up, she denied any unusual ingestions, and her son was not aware of any toxic ingestions, though notes she has had fatigue and poor appetite for ~5 days.
There was no documented hypotension to suggest possible shock liver.
Hepatitis serologies showed evidence of prior hep B vaccination and hep A exposure or vaccination.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed patent hepatic vasculature.
The patient was treated empirically with an N-acetyl cysteine drip, although there was no clear history of acetaminophen overdose.
The patient's liver function tests gradually improved, and at the time of discharge, were notable only for mildly elevated transaminases ALT 102, AST 43, with normal Alk phos, Tbili, and INR.
There was a second mild increase in creatinine on [**4-29**] that was thought to be related to mild contrast nephropathy.
#Hypoxia: The patient had persistent hypoxemia, requiring 4L of oxygen through most of her hospital course, but requiring only 2L/min at the time of discharge.
Her lasts PFTs reported showed severe obstructive pulmonary disease, with severely reduced diffusion capacity.
#Pulmonary hypertension/RV dysfunction: Echocardiogram showed dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction, along with evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
CTA chest showed no pulmonary embolism.
The patient's pulmonary hypertension was thought to be related to her underlying lung disease, although the differential diagnosis would include pulmonary arterial hypertension related to HIV.
There were no positive blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**].
TEE was negative for valvular vegetation.
#Supraclavicular/hilar lymphadenopathy/ground glass opacity: CT of the chest on [**2188-3-7**] showed left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy measuring up to 18 x 17 mm.
CTA of the chest on [**2188-3-16**] showed prominent hilar lymph nodes, along with diffuse ground-glass opacity throughout the lungs which per radiology may be related to fluid overload.
#C6 lesion: On CT C-spine [**2188-3-7**], incidental note was made of a hypodense lesion in the right side of the C6 vertebral body.
This was further characterized by MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] [**2188-3-13**], showing the C6 lesion to likely be an atypical hemangioma.
#Increased marrow signal on MR neck: On MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] [**2188-3-13**], note was made of  Diffuse marrow signal abnormality involving the cervical spine.
Per radiology, this can be seen with reactive marrow changes in patients with anemia, but diffuse neoplastic marrow infiltration such as with lymphoma is also a consideration.
Methadone was restarted, and gradually uptitrated until the patient's withdrawal symptoms resolved at a dose of 30 mg TID.
#HIV: The patient's HIV medications were initially held in the setting of severe liver and kidney dysfunction.
#Anxiety/Depression: Clonazepam was initially held due to somnolence.
The patient denied any ingestions or suicidal ideation.
#Transitional issues: -Complete vancomycin course for Strep epidermidis bacteremia on [**2188-3-24**].
-Primary care and pulmonology follow-up for pulmonary hypertension, RV hypokinesis, chronic lung disease with persistent 2L oxygen requirement.
-Follow-up of hilar and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy noted on MRI.
-Follow-up of increased marrow signal noted on MR neck.
-Monitoring of liver and kidney function.
5. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation twice a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
13. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO once a day as needed for heartburn, reflux.

You were found to have severe liver and kidney failure.
It was thought that your methadone built up in the setting of liver and kidney failure, and was responsible for the sleepiness.
The cause of the liver failure was unclear.
No other causes of liver damage were found other than your chronic hepatitis C. Never take more than 2 grams of Tylenol (acetaminophen) in 1 day.
You had some laboratory evidence of muscle damage when you arrived.
You had a transesophageal echocardiogram, which did not show any evidence of a heart valve infection.
Your echocardiogram showed evidence of pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs).
There was no evidence of blood clots in your lungs.
You should follow up with your primary care doctor and lung doctor for further management of your pulmonary hypertension.
The echocardiogram also showed some dilatation of the right side of your heart.
Your CT scans showed some enlarged lymph nodes in your chest and under your clavicle on your right side.
This could be related to infection, but it will be important for you to have close follow-up with your primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] possible reimaging, to make sure that this is not evidence of a cancer.
You had an abscess on your right hand which was drained by plastic surgery.
You also had some herpes lesions on your lower back that were treated with acyclovir.
It was restarted at a lower dose when you woke up and started to demonstrate some symptoms of withdrawal.
When you reached a certain dose, the withdrawal symptoms stopped.
There are some changes to your medications: START vancomycin 1 gram twice daily.
START omeprazole 20 mg daily as needed for reflux or heartburn.
START docusate and senna for constipation DECREASE methadone to 90 mg daily.
