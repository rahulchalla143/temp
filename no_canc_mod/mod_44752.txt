Admission Date:  [**2149-6-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-6-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-4-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: complete heart block  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pacemaker placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 56272**] is a 51M w/ hx of AS (unknown severity), HTN, hypothyroidism, s/p Hodgkin's treatment w/ extensive radiation therapy to chest at age of 4, who presents intubated from outside hospital with bradycardia.
The patient fell yesterday approximately 10pm, felt dizzy previously, struck head and was evaluated by outside hospital with CAT scan which was reportedly negative, reported to be a concussion, and went home to rest.
He was found to be hypotensive and bradycardic at a rate in 30s-40s, thought to be a ventricular escape rhythm.
The patient was given atropine and epinephrine with no change in HR or BP.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the patient was in complete heart block with narrow escape rhythm at approx 35-40 bpm.
Placement of temporary pacing wire deferred secondary to poor access (secondary to radiation) and renal failure.
CXR demonstrated a large globular heart.
Cspine showed no acute abnormality and CT head non-con demonstrated no acute intracranial abnormality.
On review of systems (per sister [**Location (un) **], the patient had symptoms of dyspnea and dyspnea on exertion for approximately 6-9 months.
The sister knew no other symptoms.
Reportedly he had been evaluated for AVR, and was denied both open and transcutaneous minimally invasive procedures.
Dopamine transiently increased in an attempt to elevated SBP.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: HTN 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - Aortic stenosis (unknown valve area), CHF (unknown EF) 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -  hypothyroidism -  s/p thyroidectomy -  Hodgkin's lymphoma (at age 4) s/p Cobalt Radiation  Social History: - Tobacco history:  unknown - ETOH:  significant alcohol use, per sister - Illicit drugs:  negative, per sister  Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VS:  60 externally paced, 136/50, 95% on ventilator (CMV, FIO2 52%, rate of 16, minute ventilation 7.8) Gen: intubated, sedated NECK: Significant radiation scaring.
Chest: pectus excavatum deformity CV: bradycardic and regular.
II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex.
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
L femoral venous line C/D/I.
II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex.
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal anteroseptal akinesis and inferoseptal hypokinesis (overall left ventricular ejection fraction ?45-50% but views are suboptimal for assessment of sytolic function).
Cannot exclude additonal wall motion abnormalities.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 3 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No fracture or subluxation.
CT head non-con ([**2149-6-10**]): IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
CXR ([**2149-6-12**]): Transvenous right atrial lead curls anteriorly, its tip projecting over the anterior wall of the mid portion of the right atrium.
Pulmonary edema continues to clear.
There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening and small right pleural effusion is probably unrelated.
Severe cardiomegaly has also improved.
Acute thrombosis of the right basilic and cephalic (superficial) veins.
No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
Axillary vein not imaged, due to overlying bandage.
LE DOPPLER: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right or left leg  DISCHARGE LABS: [**2149-6-16**] 06:52AM BLOOD WBC-7.8 RBC-3.52* Hgb-11.1* Hct-34.4* MCV-98 MCH-31.6 MCHC-32.4 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-265 [**2149-6-16**] 06:52AM BLOOD PT-13.1* PTT-93.0* INR(PT)-1.2* [**2149-6-16**] 06:52AM BLOOD Glucose-89 UreaN-18 Creat-1.0 Na-140 K-4.4 Cl-101 HCO3-28 AnGap-15 [**2149-6-16**] 06:52AM BLOOD Calcium-8.0* Phos-3.9 Mg-2.1  Brief Hospital Course: 51M with aortic stenosis, CHF and hx of Hodgkin's lymphoma who presents with complete heart block in the setting of renal failure and hyperkalemia.
Patient also has significant aortic stenosis.
The patient had a pacemaker placed, with resolution of bradycardia and hemodynamic instability.
# Complete Heart Block: Pt was in CHB on admission with bradycardia to 30s.
Due to poor access, temp pacer could not be placed; instead, a femoral triple lumen central line was placed and he was given fluids in the ED and then transferred to the CCU.
etiology remained uncertain, but could include hyperkalemia, though there was little e/o hyperkalemic signs on EKG.
Also considered hypothyroidism - TSH was elevated at 10 but free T4 was normal so no adjustments to his levothryoxine were made.
Also considered progression of CHF secondary to AS.
Blood cultures were drawn to r/o endocarditis (pt has abnormal valves so would be at risk) but were NGTD.
After pacer placement, he experienced a few limited episodes of atrial tachycardia with normal AV node conduction, which was unusual given his previous CHB.
However, he intermittently went back into complete heart block requiring pacing, most notably after receiving large metoprolol load prior to CTA torso/coronaries in order to bring heart rate down for coronary imaging.
However, at lower doses of BB he was tachycardic to 100s (pt a-sensed on pacer with v-pacing set up to 130s).
# Aortic stenosis: pt w/ known severe/critical AS, w/out record of valve diameter.
Pt apparently has been evaluated for AVR but due to his anatomy s/p radiation treatments as a child, he is not a candidate for open repair.
He was taken for CTA torso as well to eval femoral arteries.
Final results were pending at the time of discharge, but preliminary read showed acute PE (see below).
# Acute PE: wet read of CTA done for corevalve work up showed incidental finding of "Acute emboli in right lower lobar and segmental pulmonary arteries (4:21-28)."
bilateral LE dopplers were neg for DVT and RUE doppler (side of entry for pacemaker) showed "acute thrombosis of the right basilic and cephalic (superficial) veins.
No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
Axillary vein not imaged, due to overlying bandage."
Source of PE unknown but could be in axillary vein that was unable to be imaged.
# Hypothyroidism: patient s/p thyroidectomy at age of 19.  on synthroid 150mcg qd at home.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient was hyperkalemic to 6.5 upon admission, without specific EKG changes appreciated, and was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50 and kayexalate.
# Renal failure: The patient had [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr of 2.5 upon admission to the CCU, likely from poor forward flow from cardiogenic shock secondary to profound bradycardia.
3. consider additional work up for source of PE if indicated  Medications on Admission: -metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] -lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] -synthroid 150mcg qd -kcl 20mg qd  Discharge Medications: 1. furosemide 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Disp:*60 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: complete heart block pacemaker placement severe aortic stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
The cause of your abnormal heart rate could be due to medications, abnormal electrolytes, or your severe aortic stenosis worsening.
If your symptoms recur, your pacemaker will prevent your heart rate from dropping low.
