Admission Date:  [**2145-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-3-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 38277**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain, palpitations, nausea, diaphoresis and confusion for one day.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old man with history of gastric adenocarcinoma s/p resection in [**2136**], diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension presents one day after experiencing sub-sternal chest pain.
He states that he was in [**Country 2045**] 2 weeks ago when he developed headache, abdominal pain and decreased oral inake.
He subsequently traveled to [**State 108**] and was in the care of family when he describes experiencing severe sub-sternal chest pain that began yesterday at 4PM with radiation to left arm and left jaw, which he decribes as "very uncomfortable," and was associated with palpitations, nausea and diaphoresis.
Patient was also noted by family members to be confused and have difficulty ambulating.
This afternoon at 1 PM, the patient continued to describe chest discomfort and was flown from [**State 108**] to [**Location (un) 86**] where he was immediately [**Last Name (un) 4662**] the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Head CT revealed no acute intracranial process with bilateral parietal lobe atrophy.

- C diff neg x 3 - BCx NGTD - UCx neg - O&P neg x 3 .
No acute intracranial process.
Widening of the extra-axial spaces overlying both parietal lobes, likely due to atrophy .
Pa/Lat CXR ([**2145-2-23**]): IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
LLE U/S ([**2145-2-23**]): IMPRESSION: No DVT of the left lower extremity, though the calf veins were not visualized.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior wall, lateral walls and apical segments.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with proximal LAD ischemia/infarction.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Mild to moderate mitral and aortic regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2137-3-11**], wall motion abnormalities are new.
The degrees of aortic and mitral regurgitation have increased.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
No evidence of biliary obstruction.
Specific signs of acute cholecystitis are not seen, however, if there is high clinical concern for acute cholecystitis, a Gallbladder HIDA scan can be obtained for further evaluation.
CT Abdomen and Plevis ([**2145-2-26**]): Findings consistent with acute cholecystitis.
Gallbladder wall distention with layering high-density sludge, pericholecystic fluid and stranding, all indicative of acute cholecystitis given patient's clinical picture.
No other cause for acute infectious inflammatory response identified on CT. .
No intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Small right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88 year-old man with DM, HTN and HLD presents more than 24 hours after the onset of chest pain with evidence of STEMI with EKG changes and elevated Troponin but with normal CK/CKMB with evidence of Q waves.
# CAD: Pattern of ST elevation in V2 to V4 with reciprocal changes in II,III and aVf suggests an anterior wall MI.
Treated medically for STEMI as he was likely over 24 hours out from the initial event - cath defered.
Continued on ASA and Atorvastatin but ACE-I held due to acute kidney infury.
F/U EKG the next day with evidence of Q waves which combined with normal CK/CKMBs and fact that history obtained after talking with family indicated that CP started at least 3-4 days before presentation made likely that pt had an MI but that had already completed infarcting by time of arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
TTE showed severe hypokinesis in the anterior/lateral/apical area with decreased EF (20-25%) compared to prior also consistent with recent anterior MI.
TTE could not rule-out ventricular thrombus so heparin gtt continued but then later stopped when decision was made that pt would not undergo long-term anti-coagulation with warfarin.
# Acute Cholecystitis: Initial labs showed significant elevation in transaminases as well as cholestatic labs (Tbili, Alk Phos) and synthetic function alteration (elevated INR).
Some gallbladder wall thickening with sludge but no clear signs of cholecystitis.
Hepatitis panel showed immunization to Hep B and no evidence of active Hep C infection.
Pt then developed mild abdominal pain and an abdominal CT showed evidence of cholecystitis.
Cultures ultimately grew out Streptococcus species most consistent with strep bovis.
Around same time of percutaneous drain placement pt had stopped making all urine and developed hypotension requiring pressor support.
Clinical picture was most consistent with sepsis from presumed infectious source in the gallbladder.
# Respiratory Code: During morning of [**2-28**], but was suddently noted to aspirate and stopped breathing with heart rhythm suddently switching to PEA.
Code blue was called and PEA arrest protocol initiated.
# Altered Mental Status: Initially related to his recent STEMI vs abdominal process causing liver dysfunction vs ICU/hospital delerium in the elderly.
Tried to hold sedating medications and continue to reorient him as he is at high risk for delirium - pt later required low dose olanzipine 2.5mg Qhs for delerium and agitation intermittently.
When acute cholecystitis was diagnosed, suspicion increased that this was driving process for delerium.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Most recent Cr in our system was 1.7 in [**2140**] so unclear baseline, Cr was 3.2 on admission, concerning that this could be poor forward flow in the setting of an acute ischemic event leading to heart failure.
However, during afternoon of [**2-27**] urine output started to drop off to anuric levels and was non-responsive to 3.5L of fluid bolus.
This was thought most likely [**1-27**] to septic shock as BP was lowish at the time and required pressor support.
Cr was continuing to trend up and pt was still anuric despite pressors and volume repletion on the day that he passed.
Before pt could be formally made CMO and extubated, pt became bradycardic and quickly went into asystole.
# Pump: On arrival, pt appeared to be in mild acute systolic heart failure likely [**1-27**] to recent decrease in EF due to recent MI.
Initially was able to make urine, but urine output later tailed off as renal failure worsened.
Despite this, pt never developed respiratory symptoms [**1-27**] to fluid overload.
# RHYTHM: Post STEMI with no current evidence of arrythmia at this time.
Due to recent MI, pt was monitored on tele during hospitalization and continued on metoprolol.
At this point he became quickly bradycardic and then went into asystole which lead to his passing.
# Diabetes: patient with a h/o diabetes, no recent A1C in our system.
# Peptic Ulcer Disease: status resection, not currently on any therapy but given the initiation of dual anti-platelet therapy and heparin gtt will start famotidine 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Asymmetric LE edema: chronic per history but LLE U/S showed no evidence of DVT.
