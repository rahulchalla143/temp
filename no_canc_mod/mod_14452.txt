Admission Date:  [**2146-10-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-10-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-4-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of a hemodialysis tunneled catheter   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 58968**] is a 21 y/o female with a h/o renal failure [**12-30**] FSGS Dx [**12/2144**] (not on HD, being evaluated for transplant) who presented to outpatient clinic for routine follow-up and was noted to have an elevated creatinine to 16.
Pt admitted to feeling fatigued x 2-3 months, though this improved somewhat with Procrit injections.
She noted N/V and cold symptoms for the prior 3 weeks.
She denied any hemetemesis or melena.
She denied any abdominal pain.
Over the past few days prior to presentation she also c/o fatigue and dizziness with exertion (walking from one room to another), but denied CP/SOB/palpitations.
She denied confusion or difficulty with speech.
She noted 2 pillow orthopnea but denies PND.
Bedside TTE obtained showed moderate pericardial effusion without RV collapse.
In the AM of [**2146-10-6**] in the CCU, she was slightly tachycardic (HR 100's) but otherwise hemodynamically stable.
Echo was repeated and showed a pericardial effusion with worsening pericardial pressures, thought to be consistent with early cardiac tamponade physiology.
Patient was then transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring given the acute change in the echo.
She was monitored ON in the CCU and was then transferred to medicine hemodynamically stable with no clinical evidence of pericardial tamponade.
Past Medical History: CRF - dx early [**2144**], biopsy proven FSGS, not on HD, being evaluated for transplant.
diagnosis made incidentally with elevated SBP at routine sports physical.
HTN - [**12-30**] ARF.
Family History: She has no family history of kidney disease or nephrolithiasis.
She also has no family history of diabetes or early coronary disease.
Her father died of [**Name (NI) 4278**] lymphoma and neurofibrosarcoma.
Physical Exam: VS: 99.5 178/108  73  18 100% RA; pulsus was <5 GEN: NAD HEENT: PERRLA, sclera anicteric,  OP clear, MMM, no LAD, no carotid bruits.
no murmurs, rubs.
PULM: CTA B, no r/r/w.
ABD: soft, NT, ND, + BS, no HSM.
EXT: warm, 2+ dp/radial pulses BL NEURO: alert & oriented x 3, no asterixis.
There is no evidence of elevated central venous or pulmonary arterial or left atrial pressures.
No pulmonary edema or pleural effusion is present.
[**2146-10-5**] Echo Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence for increased pericardial pressures c/w early tamponade physiology.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is no evidence of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 21 y/o female with h/o ESRD [**12-30**] to FSGS awaiting transplant who presented with nausea and worsening fatigue and was found to have ARF (cr 16) c/b a pericardial effusion.
She was then transferred to the CCU given her pericardial effusion that was found to have early signs of tamponade.
She was monitored overnight in the CCU and was transferred to the medicine floor hemodynamically stable with no clinical signs of tamponade and a normal pulsus.
Pericardial Effusion The [**Hospital **] hospital course was significant for a pericardial effusion.
The effusion most likely accumulated over the past few months prior to admission.
There was no evidence of tamponade physiology on admission.
She had a brief echo in the ED which r/o signs of tamponade.
A repeat echo on [**2146-10-5**] was concerning for early tamponade physiology.
She was hemodynamically stable with no clinical signs/symptoms of tamponade.
After session of HD, her clinical evidence of volume overload improved which likely resolved her pericardial effusion.
A repeat echo on [**2146-10-10**] revealed a smaller pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade.
Pt's admission symptoms improved after HD sessions along with her clinical picture of volume overload.
