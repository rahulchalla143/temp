Noted a little incision infection, transplant incision infection treated with Keflex x seven days.
The patient was followed on an outpatient basis and noted to have an elevated creatinine on [**2198-2-1**] - the creatinine was 3.3 and the Prograf level was 22.
The patient was admitted to the transplant unit for further evaluation of elevated creatinine.
No change in bowel habits.
Patient without explanation why.
No nausea or vomiting.
No dysuria, though the patient reported persistent hematuria.
The patient reports moderate pain from incision, with persistent of erythema.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, secondary to ANCA glomerulonephritis, scleroderma, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction x two, status post LAD stent, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30 percent, peripheral vascular disease, right upper lung mass, chronic, history of MAC.
History of gastric erosions and anemia.
History of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, history of cholecystectomy and a repair of a left femoral aneurysm, and peritoneal dialysis catheter with repositioning x 2 and a right A-V fistula.
Ultrasound of the right kidney transplant revealed mild hydronephrosis, which was new compared to [**2198-1-23**].
Resistive indices at the lower and interpolar regions of the transplant kidney approached 1, with waveforms demonstrating good systolic upstroke with virtually no diastolic flow.
Biopsy results returned significant for acute cellular rejection.
Just after this infusion, the patient was noted to be acutely short of breath.
She had bilateral diffuse crackles anteriorly and posteriorly.
There was no pedal edema.
Her chest x-ray result revealed pulmonary edema  Her EKG was normal.
She was placed on a nitroglycerin drip as well, given the elevated enzymes, and serial enzymes were drawn.
The patient was weaned from the ventilator with stable vital signs and respiratory function.
She was discharged without insulin, and she will be followed in the outpatient clinic to monitor the hyperglycemia induced by steroids.
There was mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There was severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with near akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and the anterior walls and distal inferior walls.
The apex is mildly dyskinetic.
No masses or thrombi were seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets, three of them, appeared structurally normal, with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgiation.
Mild one plus mitral regurgitation was seen.
