endoscopy   History of Present Illness: 42y/o M w/ a PMH of only HTN who was transferred here after a 1month admission at an OSH for further management of his liver disease.
He was in his USOH until approximately 1 month ago when, in the context of continued heavy drinking, he developed tremors of his hands and became unstable with walking.
He also noticed, at this time, abdominal distention and diffuse abdominal pain.
He presented to the the ED at [**Hospital3 **] where he found to be confused and jaundiced and was admitted for furhter management.
While in the OSH, he developed increasing somnolence and eventually required ICU level care for respiratory protection (although it does not appear he was ever intubated).
He was noted to have ARF and hyponatremia as well as a ?
His ARF was thought to be [**1-13**] renal hypoperfusion [**1-13**] diuretic therapy and poor PO intake but worsened despite IVF support.
He was initially treated with CTX/azithromycin for the suspected PNA but these were later d/c for unclear reasons.
Taps of his abdomen were reported to be c/w SBP but no note of antibiotic therapy is made in the d/c summary and these results show <10 PMN per tap.
He was eventually transfered her for further management of his medical conditions.
On arrival here, the patient complained only of abdominal tightness, mild abdominal pain, and decreased appetite but denied any CP, SOB, N/V, HA, rash, cough, URI symptoms, dysuria, diarrhea, or constipation.
Past Medical History: HTN  Social History: No tobacco/drug use.
Family History: No liver/kidney problems.

Physical Exam: 99.2, 121/80, 87, 22, 96%RA Gen: Jaundiced M lying in bed, slightly uncomfortable HEENT: + scleral icterus, MMM, O/P clear, no cervical LAD CV: RRR, 2/6 SEM at the USB w/out radiation Lungs: L basilar crackles Abd: Grossly distended and tense, easily appreciable fluid wave and shifting dullness, distant BS, HSM not able to be assessed, mild diffuse tenderness, + caput medusa Ext: 3+ LE pitting edema to the mid thigh, distal pulses difficult to assess Neuro: AAO x3, appropriate in conversation per interpreter, moving all his extremities spontaneously Skin: Jaundiced   Pertinent Results: Admission labs: Na 131, K 4.1, Cl 104, bicarb 16, BUN 45, Cr 2.8, glu 115 Ca 8.1, Mg 3.9, Phos 2.4 tbili 34.1, alk phos 157, Ast 138, ALT 59, INR 1.8, alb 2.9 .
[**9-30**] Renal US: 2 calculi, no obstruction [**9-16**] abd angiogram: no Portal or hepatic vein obstruction, recanulized umbilical vein suggestion varices.
[**10-6**] CXR Two PA and two lateral views of the chest show markedly elevated right hemidiaphragm and bilateral perihilar and left bibasilar atelectasis.
Pneumonia remains a possibility, but the appearance could be entirely consistent with consolidation from atelectasis .
[**10-7**] CXR:Lung volumes remain quite low, and the right hemidiaphragm is still markedly elevated, but less so compared to the prior study.
Pulmonary vasculature is congested, but there is no edema or focal consolidation and no clear evidence of substantial pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
+ esophageal candidiasis   Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 42y/o M w/ EtOH cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis complicated by renal failure and massive fluid overload/ascites who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after a 1mo OSH admission for further management.
Cirrhosis/alcoholic hepatits: Mr [**Known lastname **] presented with labs suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis superimposed upon his EtOH cirrhosis.
He was shortly started on pentoxyphylline for his alcoholic hepatitis and completed over a 3 wk course in the hospital.
Mr [**Known lastname **] did have an EGD which revealed no varices.
He was placed on lactulose and rifaxamin due to hepatic encephalopathy which gradually cleared.
He was moderately encephalopathic on admission with +asterixis and slowed speech, but was without asterixis and at his mental baseline as per family members.
Mr [**Known lastname **] also had significant pruritis presumed to be [**1-13**] bile acids (also with component of drug rash as below).
Multiple conversations took place through an interpreter with the patient and his health care proxy (cousin) regarding the seriousness of his condition and the need for alcohol abstinence.
Renal failure: Mr [**Known lastname **] Cr was 2.7 on transfer from OSH, which improved to 2.0 with 1L NS bolus.
He was massively total-body fluid-overloaded with very diminished lung volumes and pulmonary edema, although oxygenating on room air.
He was started on midodrine, octreotide, and IV albumin at maximum doses for treatment of presumed hepatorenal syndrome.
Renal was consulted on the patient and felt that he was in a likely pre-renal state with a component of ATN given his urine Na of 20 and a high urine output.
Nevertheless, his renal failure gradually improved and he tolerated several large volume paracentesis and was then started on low-dose diuretics (lasix 20, aldactone 50) with large and persistant diuresis.
CXR was very difficult to interpret due to his large ascites, poor lung volumes, and fluid overload.
Diagnostic paracentesis was persistantly negative (despite 1 contaminated specimen + for enterococcus w/o WBC that was repeated and was negative).
He was treated empirically for several days with CTX; his low-grade fevers and leukocytosis persisted.
EGD during his hospital course revealed esophageal candidiasis and he was started on fluconazole.
Within several days he began having high fevers up to 103 and was empirically started on CTX and flagyl to cover empirically for C-diff and SBP or pneumonia.
He subsuquently developed a pruruitic rash and eosinophilia; with negative cultures and no sympoms to suggest infection all antibiotics were stopped and his leukocytosis, eosinohpilia, and fevers resolved prior to discharge.
Immunizations: He was immunized with the first series of HBV; he was + for HAV Ab; he also received a pneumovax and an influenza vaccine.
psychosocial: Mr. [**Known lastname **] seemed quite depressed through much of his stay with what appeared to be a lack of motivation and a very blunted affect.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not meed criteria for major depression, but rather adjustment disorder.
He was started on Mirtazipine 15mg qhs which seemed to help quite significantly with insomnia and seemed to improve Mr. [**Known lastname **] mood.
