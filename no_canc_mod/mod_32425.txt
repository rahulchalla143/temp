Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2135-1-29**]: Emergent Left Burr Hole Evacuation for subdural hemorrhage   History of Present Illness: Neurosurgery was asked to evaluate this gentleman for possible surgical intervention.
This is a 72 year old male who has a history of diplopia since [**10/2134**] which was thought to be a blood clot behind the eye per the sons reports.
The patient drove with diplopia and as a result was in a MVC in [**Country 6171**] on [**2134-12-11**].
He was treated for a concussion and did not have any imaging.
[**2135-1-12**] he became unsteady on his feet and was seen at the hospital per family reports.
[**Name (NI) **] was found to have a large left subdural hematoma and was transferred here for further care.
Recently, the patient has had right ankle swelling without fracture per son.
[**Name (NI) **] has not had any food since 3pm today.
He denies photophobia, weakness, nausea, vomiting, seizure like activity, numbness or tingling.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Renal Caliculi  Social History: Married, resides in [**Country 6171**] with wife.
No dysarthria  Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 3 mm bilaterally.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  Toes downgoing bilaterally, no clonus  Coordination: dysmetria on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements slower on right.

Thin subdural collection overlies the right cerebral convexity, which is approximately 5 mm thick.
The left subdural collection has a mass effect on subjacent sulci, as well as produces rightward shift of septum pellucidum approximately 9 mm.
The right subdural collection does not produce significant mass effect.
There is no evidence of major vascular territorial infarction.
Mucosal thickening is seen involving left and right maxillary sinuses, the remainder of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
There is slight decrease in rightward subfalcine herniation, from 12 to 9 mm.
Again there is sulcal effacement along the left cerebral hemisphere, particularly along the frontal region.
There is cortical hypodensity of the left frontal lobe underlying the subdural collection, presumably due to contusion or infarction.
Hyperdense blood layering along the right superior convexity and the right frontal region is not larger compared to the prior study.
No new focus of hemorrhage is noted.
Soft tissue swelling and subcutaneous gas is noted along the post-surgical sites.
Vascular calcifications are noted along the cavernous carotid arteries.
Mucosal thickening is noted within the maxillary sinuses as well as some of the ethmoid air cells.
MRI Head [**2135-1-30**]: FINDINGS: Again seen is a large left frontal subdural collection that contains both air and hemorrhagic fluid.
A far smaller right subdural hematoma is also noted.
Left frontal mass effect related to the collection appears unchanged since the previous study.
Of note, the apparent hypodensity in the left frontal lobe, noted on the CT scan, does not have an MR correlate.
The diffusion images appear normal with no evidence of hemorrhage or contusion.
12-Lead EKG(pre-op) Sinus rhythm.
Poor R wave progression, likely a normal variant.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
of Left ACA infarct [**2-28**] compression under the pressure of the left frontal SDH.
His diet and activity were advanced and pain controlled.
He was started on Dilantin on arrival and has not had a seizure.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Large Isodense Left Subdural Hematoma Right Frontal acute subdural hematoma   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable   Discharge Instructions: General Instructions  ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-5**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
