Admission Date:  [**2147-12-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-8-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: R IPH, LOC  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2147-12-8**]: Right Craniectomy, embolization of AVM, and evacuation of right IPH   History of Present Illness: This is a 54 year old female who was in her usual state of health until she was found by upstairs neighbors after they heard a loud noise.
Ecchymosis to left eye Neck: Hard cervical collar in place Extrem: Warm and well-perfused.
On discharge: ****   Pertinent Results: CT Head [**2147-12-13**]: Stable size and appearance of intraparenchymal and interventricular hemorrhage, pneumocephalus, post-surgical changes and frontal hematoma.
Midline shift measures 12 mm today vs 10 mm today likely due to inter-scan variability given stable size of intracranial hemorrhage and edema.
Postoperative changes of the right frontoparietal lobe as described.
Increase in the amount of hypodensity within the surgical bed, concerning for evolving infarct with edema.
Unchanged 8-9mm leftward shift of midline structures, mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and adjacent sturctures including thalami, subthalamic regions and upper midbrain.
Slight interval enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles concerning for developing hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of focal or diffuse lesions within the cervical spinal cord.
Multilevel disc degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine as described in detail above, more significant from C4/C5 through C6/C7 levels.
No diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute ischemic changes.
MRA of Brain [**2147-12-9**]: There is no evidence of significant flow stenotic lesions, mild deviation of the vessels on the right, likely consistent with mass effect from the previously drained parenchymal hematoma.
MRA of Neck [**2147-12-9**]: Patency of the carotid arteries and vertebral arteries with mild  decreased signal at the origin of the left common carotid artery, possibly artifactual in nature.
Expected postoperative changes in the right frontoparietal lobe as described above.
No significant change in intraventricular hemorrhage as described above.
CT Head [**2147-12-8**]: 5 cm right intraparenchymal hemorrhage in right temporal and parietal lobe with extension into right lateral ventricle.
Arteriovenous malformation in the posterior right temporal lobe, supplied by branches of the distal right MCA and draining into the cortical veins and eventually into the superior sagittal sinus.
Similar size and appearance of large parenchymal hematoma and  intraventricular hemorrhage as estimated on the contrast-enhanced study, and similar degree of mass effect, midline shift and central herniation.
Following an acute decompensation and posturing in the ED, she was emergently taken to the OR on [**2147-12-8**] initially for a right craniectomy, followed by cerebral angiography and onyx embolization of rt parietal AVM.
On [**2147-12-9**], she had a NCHCT which showed expected post-operative changes, with persistent 10mm of midline shift.
On [**2147-12-11**], she was noted to have a fixed and dilated right pupil.
With this event, she underwent a Head CT which showed Slight interval enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles but was otherwise unchanged from previous studies.
She had brisk withdrawal on the Left Lower Extremity.
In the late am, she had a bronchospastic event(thought to be caused by carinal irritation), requiring Propofol for additional sedation, albuterol and racemic epinephrine.
On [**2147-12-14**] she developed a fever to 104 overnight and was subsequently pancultured.
On exam she was found to be less interactive, with eye opening to voice with light stimulation, but was not following commands otherwise, and withdrew to noxious stimuli in all 4 extremities.
On [**2147-12-16**] her sputum culture grew coag + staph aureus so she was changed to Cipro.
On [**2147-12-17**] the patient was noted to have bilateral vesicular lesions in the sacral region so antivirals were started empirically.
Eventual cultures were negative for HSV but positive serum HSV for which she was treated for 7 days with Acyclovir.
No source of bleed was found for her initial drop in hct, however at that time the patient was receiving multiple amounts of IV fluids and it was thought to be dilutional.
She has been afebrile since [**12-23**] and had a PICC line placed for IV Naficilin on [**12-25**].
She remained febrile and on [**12-21**] LENIS was done to rule a thrombus in the tibial vein, [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery was consulted regarding question of treatment and need for IVC filter.
On [**12-25**] she had a transient increase in LFTs for which her Naficllin was changed to Vancomycin and a ultrasound of her liver showed a grossly normal son[**Name (NI) 493**] assessment of the abdomen with incidental note of hepatic cyst.
On discharge she was awake, alert and orientated X3 with no cranial nerve findings.
She has some minimal left sided weakness noted.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing/SOB.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Right intraparenchymal hemorrhage Right AVM Respiratory Failure Hypertension Staph aureus pneumonia Urinary Tract Infection Bronchospasm Left lower extremity deep vein thrombus (posterior tibial vein) small pericardial effusion Left hemi neglect Left visual field cut HSV +   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: General Instructions  ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
