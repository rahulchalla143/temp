During his initial admission in [**2116-12-1**], he was treated for a pseudomonal UTI and pseudomonal bacteremia with double coverage with ceftazidime and cipro for 2 weeks.
No additional sources of fever were found during his work-up during this second admission.
The on [**2117-2-17**], he was found to have increased hematuria with blood surrounding his Foley, and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
In the ED, his vital signs were notable for a fever to 103.7 with systolic blood pressures of 110-130.

STUDIES: - [**2117-1-15**] - Echo - Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
No valvular pathology or pathologic valvular flow identified.
Small amount of bibasilar pleural effusions not amenable to thoracocentesis.
Associated right lower lobe more than left lower lobe atelectasis is seen.
4.5-cm dilatation of the ascending aorta - [**2117-2-17**] - Portable CXR - No acute cardiopulmonary process.
- [**2117-2-18**] - Renal US - No hydronephrosis.
No evidence of bladder mass, partially distended bladder with internal clots.
- [**2117-2-18**] - Portable CXR - In comparison with the study of [**2-17**], the streak of atelectasis at the right base is somewhat more prominent.

Sepsis: resolved, likely etiology was MSSA bacteremia given gpcs in [**3-5**] blood cultures, presumed source was erythematous PICC line now d/c'd.
TTE [**2-19**] showed no e/o vegetations.
Other possible sources include sacral decubitus ulcer (site appears clean, without purulence) vs recurrence epidural abscess, urine Cx NGTD, CXR clear.
Acute Renal Failure: resolved, possible etiologies include post-renal [**1-2**] obstruction from clots or pre-renal secondary to dehydration or intermittent hypotension leading to transfer.
Hematuria: pt developed acute hematuria & hct drop without clear h/o Foley trauma.
Anemia: hct drop noted in setting of persistent hematuria and IVF hydration.
Decubitus Ulcer: Stage IV decubitus ulcer that appears clean and without evidence of infection.
The patient was seen by both wound care and plastic surgery who felt the wound was clean with no evidence of infection.
His po intake should also be encouraged to have adequate caloric reserve for proper wound healing.
Chronic Pain and Muscle Spasms: pain medications were held initially given concern for altered mental status and lethargy.
MS improved in am, BP trends down when sleeping, likely due to autonomic dysregulation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 745**] Health Center  Discharge Diagnosis: bacteremia quadriplegia sacral ulcer stage IV HCV   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with hematuria and found to have bacteremia, likely from your PICC line.
You should return to the ER if you develop fevers greater than 101.5, chills, or new symptoms.
