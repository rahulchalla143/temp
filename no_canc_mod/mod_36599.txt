She has noted polyuria with urinary urgency, but no dysuria.
She thinks that she has had elevated blood sugars for quite some time, but is unsure because she has not been really checking her sugars at home.
It was then decided to start her on an insulin drip to better control her sugars despite no anion gap being present.
A UA showed moderate leukocyte esterase positivity and 15 WBCs.
CXR reportedly did not show any acute process.
An EKG reportedly showed NSR at a rate of 82 with T-wave flattening in lead III which was consistent with prior EKGs.
Of note, the patient developed a pink rash all over her body which was most notable on her palms, shins, chest, and back before she received the vancomycin and it was thought that the rash was due to hyperemia from re-perfusion after initially being mottled.
On the floor, the patient is alert and oriented, but inattentive and slow to answer questions.
She denies any localizing symptoms at this time.
Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Abdomen:  soft, NT, ND, NABS, no HSM.
There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, the result of hyperinflation.
There is no pneumothorax.
The heart size is normal, the mediastinal contours are notable for top normal pulmonary artery size, and mild prominence of the right hilus, which is unchanged since [**2173**].
There is degenerative change of the spine.

Discharge labs:  [**2177-7-4**] 07:18AM BLOOD WBC-3.3* RBC-3.77* Hgb-10.6* Hct-33.2* MCV-88 MCH-28.2 MCHC-32.0 RDW-15.5 Plt Ct-100* [**2177-7-4**] 07:18AM BLOOD Plt Ct-100* [**2177-7-4**] 07:18AM BLOOD Glucose-257* UreaN-14 Creat-0.9 Na-137 K-4.6 Cl-105 HCO3-25 AnGap-12   Brief Hospital Course: To briefly summarize: 68 yo woman with diabetes complicated by neuropathy, renal cell cancer sp nephrectomy, obesity, hypertension, transferred from ICU after admission there with possible confusion, feeling sick and hyperglycemia.
She was admitted to the ICU after initially being found to be hyperglycemic, hypotensive and hypothermic.
In the ER, she developed a considerable rash on her knees and hands.
There was a question of joint swelling.
In the ICU, her infectious workup to evaluate for the hyperglycemia revealed a possible UTI.
She was also found to have recurrence of an ulcer on the base of her right great toe.
She was restarted on long acting insulin, with moderate control, and observed overnight in the ICU.
She had an acute encephalopathy in the setting of acute illness.
Type II diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled, with complications - The patient's blood sugars were elevated as high as 672 and requried insulin drip and ICU admission.
The precipitant was unclear, but was thought viral infection and a UTI.
She seemed taking good POs without indiscretions or medication changes.
Possible Urinary tract infection- The patient's UA is mildly positive with moderate leukocyte esterase and 15 WBCs.
Likely prerenal etiology given profound volume depletion related to uncontrolled hyperglycemia plus lab interference given ketones.
Skin rash -  She had noticeable warmth and erythema over her bilateral knees, hands, and back.
She was seen by rheumatology, but they did not believe there was concern for rheumatologic illness.
Pancytopenia - She initially had WBC of 8, HCT 34, PLT 117 and after IVF and correction of her glucose went down to 3.1, 31 and 59 respectively.
Workup revealed likely multifactorial etiology, with exacerbation of chronic thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia in setting of viral syndrome.
Likely related to hyperglycemia and infection.
Treated with supportive care.
Diabetic foot ulcer.
history of renal cell cancer, now with abnormal CXR -  per pt, awaiting biopsy at [**Hospital1 2025**], in the next ten days.
Chronic issues: Restless legs syndrome, depression, peripheral neuropathy, hypertension:  Continued on home medications, with gradual reintroduction back to home doses.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Pancytopenia Hypotension Poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus, with neuropathy.
Acute confusion and delirium Diabetic foot ulcer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
