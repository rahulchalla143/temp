Brief Hospital Course: This is a 87 year-old male with a history of orthostatic hypotension and recent fall c/b trauma to face who presents with facial swelling and ?angioedema.
Facial swelling: possibly angioedema given recent initiation of ACEi but also possibly related to the fall and trauma.
SYNCOPE / AUTNOMIC DYSFUNCTION: symptoms of presyncope chronically (for 2 years) and a formal diagnosis of autnomic dysfunction has been made with tilt table testing here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2190**].
I have recommended a walker with a seat so that he can sit down immediately should he feel lightheaded, I have strongly urged he use this at all times given his high risk to fall, and have suggested if this is ineffective he may at somepoint be committed to a wheelchair given his severe autnomic dysfunction.
He had no acute fractures as a result of his fall.
I have also checked a B12 which was 400 and an RPR which was non reactive given that he had a + romberg sign suggestive of posterior column spinal cord disease.
