HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  66-year-old female with history of hypertension, nonobstructive cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction, status post catheterization.
She has had worsening dyspnea on exertion over two to three months, increased edema and was referred for catheterization.
Catheterization showed a right dominant system, non-angiographically apparent lesions in LMCA, LAD, and left circumflex, 30% RCA, hemodynamic resting with mean RA 15, C-wedge pressure of 34, diastolic pressure 25, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension with mean PAP of 46, cardiac index of 1.6.
The patient's symptoms, she has had increased dyspnea on exertion over two to three months to walking about one block, difficulty walking up a flight of stairs, has had difficulty with activities as noted, also with mild lower extremity edema.
She denies any fevers or chills.
History of atrial fibrillation, status post pacemaker in 0/[**2192**], status post ablation.
History of mitral regurgitation which was shown on [**8-/2193**] on echo with 1+ mitral regurgitation.
History of E. coli, urosepsis in [**2191-7-17**].
History of colon polyps.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No murmurs, gallops or rubs appreciated.
No rebound or guarding.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, 1+ bilateral pulses, also 1+ lower extremity edema at the ankles.
Echo showed LV mildly dilated, 1+ mitral regurgitation, ejection fraction of 35-40%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  66-year-old female with history of atrial fibrillation pacemaker in [**9-/2192**], hypertension, mitral regurgitation, also nonobstructive cardiomyopathy, presented with increased shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, status post catheterization, now notable for increased filling pressures which had improved with Nipride and milrinone.
Continue with heparin and Coumadin for anticoagulation and for evaluation of biventricular pacer, she will need outpatient myocardial oxygen ventilation rate/exercise tolerance test after discharge in two to four weeks and to continue as discussed earlier with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and then follow up results with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
On the day of discharge the patient was doing much better, no acute distress.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Discharge instructions were to call or return if she developed increased shortness of breath, chest pain, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness or dizziness or palpitations.
Atrial fibrillation, status post pacemaker placement.
This is on the [**Location (un) 436**] of [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Cardiac Services and she was instructed to take no food or caffeine one hour before the appointment and to wear loose clothes and to call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 98118**] with any concerns or questions.
Cardiac catheterization notable for elevated filling pressures and also coronaries were shown to be 30% right coronary artery lesion and other vessels without angiographically apparent lesions.
Swan placement for treatment of congestive heart failure while in service.
