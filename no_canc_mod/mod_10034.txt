States was at home, laying in bed watching TV when developed L sided CP radiating to L arm.
Also received Solumedrol 125mg, ceftriazone and azithromycin for COPD flare.
There was diffuse coronary vasospasm that improved w/ 200mg IC TNG.

Imaging: [**2191-2-10**] CXR - Hyperinflation reflects severe emphysema.
Heart is normal in size, and there is no pulmonary edema.
Tiny left pleural effusion may be present.
No pneumothorax.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant vessel revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had mild proximal disease and a 90% thrombotic lesion in distal vessel?first septal branch (twin LAD system).
The LCX was a small vessel and had an 80% distal stenosis.
The RCA was a dominant vessel with mild proximal disease.
The ramus intermedius was  a small vessel with mild diffuse disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and right sided filling pressures, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and low cardiac index of 1.6 L/min/m2.
Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Low cardiac index .
[**2191-2-10**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia with Left axis deviation and late transition.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The  mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo M w/ PMH of COPD, CAD, HTN and hypercholesterolemia, who was admitted for STEMI and was found to have coronary vasospasm and elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization.
# Ischemia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an ST elevation MI and went to the cath lab for POBA to LAD.
The most notable finding on his catheterization was that his coronaries appeared to be diffusely spastic and could be dilated with the administration of IV nitro.
He tolerated these medications well, with no side effects.
# Pump: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had markedly elevated filling pressures by R heart catheterization and received IV lasix during the procedure.
He appeared euvolemic on exam with minimal diuresis on PO lasix, so it was felt that his respiratory symptoms and dyspnea were most likely due to his underlying pulmonary disease.
Prior to discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an episode of hypotension after getting his PO lasix dose.
He was given additional PO fluids and his BP responded well, so his PO lasix was discontinued since it was felt that he was euvolemic, perhaps even hypovolemic, and his ECHO appeared to have a preserved EF (though likely has diastolic dysfunction).
# Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was monitored on telemetry and remained in NSR through the majority of his stay.
However, on admission to the CCU, he had no evidence of a COPD exacerbation (no wheezing, his O2 sats were stable on his home O2 requirement, and had no dyspnea), so he was not continued on steroids or antibiotics.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: ST elevation MI s/p balloon angioplasty to distal LAD .
Secondary diagnosis: COPD Hypercholesterolemia HTN GERD Esophageal strictures BPH   Discharge Condition: Good.
Please call your PCP or go to the nearest ER if you develop any of the following symptoms: fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, jaw or arm pain, nausea, vomiting, leg pain, leg swelling, numbness or tingling in your legs, or any other worrisome symptoms.
