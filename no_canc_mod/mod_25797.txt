Selective angiography of this right dominant system revealed single (1) vessel coronary artery disease.
Specifically the proximal RCA demonstrated a 95-100% thrombotic occlusion with severe limitiation in flow distal to the occlusion.
The left main demonstrated no angiographic evidence of any flow limiting disease.
The LAD was a very tortuous vessel with a 30% stenosis in D1 - TIMI III flow throughout the vessel.
The LCX demonstrated only mild luminal irregularities.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and mildly elevated left filling pressures (RA mean 13; RVEDP 15; PCWP 19.
Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
A small secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is present.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
4.The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace mitral regurgitation seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo female with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia and NIDDM s/p IMI with stent to proximal RCA .
ST elevation inferior MI s/p cypher stenting proximal RCA: Pt had IMI enzymes trended down but had some residual ST elevation persisting post cypher stent placement in proximal RCA.
An ACE-I was not started at admission as her creatinine had been slightly increased and it was unclear whether or not there was a contraindication from past use.
Her PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and said that this could be started as her creatinine was stable at 1.1 and she did not have problems with this in the past.
Pump: Patient had no JVP or other evidence of fluid overload on exam.
Rhythm: Patient in NSR on day of discharge and had no events on telemetry.
Platlets were 109 on day of discharge but there is no evidence of active bleeding.
Primary biliary cirrhosis: LFTs were checked b/c increasing lipitor dose.
LFTs were normal except slightly elevated alk phos.
8. h/o bleeding ulcer: Treated [**3-18**] yrs ago, no episodes since or while in house and stools were guaiac negative.
Ecotrin 325 mg Lipitor 10 mg po qday  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: ST elevation inferior MI   Discharge Condition: chest pain resolved, blood pressure stable  Discharge Instructions: If you have chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations of any other concerning symptoms call you doctor or come to the emergency room.
