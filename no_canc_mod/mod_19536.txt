HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: 50-year-old man with depressed skull fracture, assess fracture reduction.
Again noted, unchanged small left cerebral convexity subdural hematoma.
There is no significant mass effect or midline shift.
The evaluation of the comminuted depressed skull fracture along the right side of the frontal lobe is extremely limited by motion, however, there has been interval fracture reduction, and where evaluated, alignment appears improved, with surgical sutures in place.
The amount of hemorrhage into right choroid plexus has significantly decreased in the interval.
Interval reduction of right frontal depressed skull fracture.
Improved right choroid plexus hemorrhage.
Unchanged left subdural hematoma, right subdural hematoma is not well assessed due to significant motion and beam hardening artifact.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of right upper extremity venous system.
The jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, cephalic, and basilic veins are all patent without evidence of thrombus or obstruction.
There is no evidence of superficial phlebitis.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT   Brief Hospital Course: Pt admitted through ED after EMS found pt with abrasion to forehead.
Workup revealed Skull fracture that was depressed.
His family was contact[**Name (NI) **] for consent.
On [**4-27**] pt was taken to the Or for elevation of his depressed skull fracture.
Post-operatively, he was lethargic and somewhat uncooperative with his exam, but he was grossly neurologically intact.
He did demonstrate some elements of korsakoff dementia, and he was maintained on a CIWA scale/folate/thiamine/MVI while in-house.
On [**4-30**] pt developed a fever, and CXR/BCx/UCx were done, all of which were no growth (though the BCx was ot finalized at the time of d/c), and pt was afebrile for remainder of hospitalization.
On [**5-3**] dilantin was d/c'd, his staples were d/c'd prior to discharge, and his was discharged to rehab on [**5-5**] in improved neurologic condition (still disoriented to location, but no focal deficits and significantly more awake and attentive).
