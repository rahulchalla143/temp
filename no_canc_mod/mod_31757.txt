A small right pleural effusion results in minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus.
There is no pneumothorax.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CTA (chest and abdomen--[**2149-8-6**]): CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Again identified is the large right lateral chest wall hematoma, centered around the right mid to lower intercostal muscles, and extending into the right lateral flank.
No active extravasation is seen.
Moderate sized, intermediate density layering right pleural effusion, which may represent hemothorax, with right basilar atelectasis is unchanged.
Small left effusion with atelectasis is unchanged.
The previously-noted 2- mm left basilar pulmonary nodule is not identified.
There is no focal airspace consolidation.
There is no aortic dissection.
Coronary artery calcifications are again noted.
There is no pericardial effusion.
An additional 3-4 mm hypoattenuating lesion are too small to characterize.
The liver has a nodular contour, consistent with cirrhosis.
There is no portal venous gas.
The colon remains mildly disteded.
Anterior abdominal wall caput medusae in the setting of portal hypertension is unchanged.
There are no enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
There is air in the non- dependent portion of the urinary bladder, which contains a Foley catheter.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Possible right tenth posterior rib fracture is again noted on the sagittal images (301:14).
There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.
Degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine are again noted.
Lower abdominal wall and venous collaterals are again noted.
Gynecomastia is unchanged.
Unchanged large right chest wall and flank hematoma.
No active contrast extravasation is identified.
Circumferential foci of air in the ascending and proximal trasverse colon is most likely due to air admixed with stool, less likely pneumatosis.
Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, intermediate density, right greater than left, with underlying atelectasis.
Moderate ascites, unchanged.
Slightly higher density of the fluid in the dependent portion of the lower pelvis likely reflects layering blood.
Cirrhosis with stigmata of portal hypertension  GI bleeding study ([**2149-8-7**]): IMPRESSION: Positive tagged RBC scan demonstrating active bleeding site in the lower right chest.
IR embolization report findings-abridged ([**2149-8-7**]) Selective arteriograms of right intercostal arteries between T7 and T10, showing at least one small focus of active bleeding distally in the T9 intercostal artery.
No immediate complications.
U/S guided paracentesis ([**2149-8-12**]): IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis yielding 2.25 liters of clear, dark yellow fluid.
Cultures:  Urine ([**2149-8-10**]): PROVIDENCIA RETTGERI.
#right chest wall hematoma with acute blood loss anemia-On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], repeat imaging documented progression of right axillary bleed was performed.
CT also showed acute rib fracture which is the likely etiology of injured intercostal artery.
However, he developed increased back pain and a HCT drop.
Next, a repeat CT showed ongoing bleeding around [**8-19**] and subsequently he was transferred back to the ICU.
He underwent a repeated IR procedure, which showed generalized oozing, no focal bleeding, and recieved some cauterization of oozing.
Once hemodynamically stable, he was transfered back to floor once HCT stable, however had some bleeding from R groin site where IR threaded a catheter for the embolization procedure.
He had a HCT drop for the third time around [**8-26**], with CT again suggestive of ongoing bleeding, however Tagged RBC was negative for significant bleeding, thus he was managed symptomatically with transfusions, ffp, amicar to treat the underlying coagulopathy.
At this point, transplant was also consulted to consider liver transplant while here given it may be the only definitive option for his bleeding diathesis/coagulopathy.
#End stage liver disease likely secondary to ETOH cirrhosis: The patient has a history of liver disease and has been following with the liver transplant clinic at [**Hospital3 **].
He reports having his last EtOH drink within the past two weeks.
The patient has had a complete liver workup at [**Hospital1 112**] and his liver disease is likely secondary to EtOH use.
The liver consult service saw the patient and recommended treatment of his hyperbilirubinemia with Ursodiol.
In terms of fluid balance, the patient was started on Aldactone 100 mg and Lasix 80 mg, which lessened his abdominal and peripheral edema.
The peritoneal fluid was negative for SBP.
At times, the patient seemed to be slightly encephalopathic (slower thinking, agitation), however, it resolved with Lactulose use.
Coagulopathy: The patient continued to have an elevated INR and PTT while in the hospital.
Both hematology and liver consults thought the elevations were secondary to his decreased liver function.
#ARF-The patient initially presented with an increased Cr to 2.1.
The patient's creatinine lowered to 0.6 and would raise higher with Lasix doses, likely due to volume depletion.
UTI:Tthe patient presented with a UTI on [**8-10**] with grossly pyuric urine which grew pan-sensitive Providencia.
Hematoma s/p IR embolization x 2 2.
End stage liver disease 3.
Acute blood loss anemia .
Urinary tract infection 2.
End stage liver disease   Discharge Condition: Hematocrit stable at 27.
You were found to have a broken rib and have bleeding from one of the arteries in your chest.
You also had bleeding from your right groin where the interventional radiologists did your procedure.
Over the past 5 days, your blood count has been stable and you have no signs of bleeding.
Despite using Aldactone and lasix, you continued to have fluid building in your abdomen and legs.
That fluid showed no infection.
You also were found to have a urinary tract infection.
You should come back to the hospital, you feel dizzy, have any signs of bleeding, feeling increased pain or have increased swelling in your abdomen.
