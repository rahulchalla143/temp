He has a poor baseline level of neurologic functioning, in particular his mental status (disoriented, poor attention).
He had an episode of stiffening last night and initially was found to have a mild right facial weakness and right arm drift, possibly secondary to [**Doctor Last Name 555**] Paralysis from a seizure.
However, on imaging, he has been found to have an interval increase in ventricular size suggestive of hydrocephalus.

Findings suggest a communicating hydrocephalus, possibly due to shunt failure.
Slightly more conspicuous hypoattenuation in a confluent nature throughout the periventricular white matter may simply reflect a progression of small vessel ischemic disease, although given the periventricular distribution, an element of transependymal CSF flow cannot be entirely excluded.
Encephalomalacia involving primarily the right temporal lobe and left frontal lobe, stable from prior study.
Prominent extra-axial CSF space in the  left middle cranial fossa, compatible with a preexisting arachnoid cyst.
Post operatively he was neurologically at his baseline, orientated X2, he was perseverative with poor comprehension.
Neurology was consulted given his seizure history and recent seizures.
On post op day one his CT scan showed stable placement of RVP shunt catheter with slight improvement of dilated ventricles.
Patient's pain is well-controlled and the patient is tolerating a good oral diet.
Pt's incision is clean, dry and inctact without evidence of infection.
7. quetiapine 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for severe agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Group home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hydrocephlus S/P Traumatic brain injury, Status epilepticus Anemia Chronic cholecystitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
