CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 58-year-old Caucasian female who presents with hypoxia, and mental status changes, and hypercapnia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presents with hypoxia, per [**Hospital6 407**].
The patient had been found by [**Hospital6 407**] on the morning of admission confused, with shortness of breath, and an oxygen saturation of 79% on room air.
The patient initially reported a sore throat, tightness, and chest pain which was not reported by the patient on presentation to the Emergency Department.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had recently been admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] a few days before with a workup for subacute renal failure.
At that time, it was decided that Ms. [**Known lastname 34727**] renal failure was likely secondary to hypovolemia.
She has no complaints of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, sore throat or shortness of breath.
q.d., Lasix 40 mg intravenously times one, Solu-Medrol 120 mg times one, albuterol nebulizers, bicarbonate, D-50, and intravenous insulin.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
There was also right atrial and ventricular dilatation, and severe global right ventricular hypokinesis.
There was also abnormal right ventricular wall motion abnormalities.
There was 4+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Dobutamine MIBI on [**2187-3-30**] showed no defects.
Osteoarthritis/rheumatoid arthritis.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient has a 72-pack-year smoking history, but no pulmonary function tests in the record.
Renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 0.7 up until [**2187-9-12**], and since then has been 2 to 4.
In general, she was a very morbidly obese Caucasian female in moderate respiratory distress.
The abdomen was obese, nontender and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Pretibial edema was present.
Thought that the year was 200; had no response to date.
Otherwise, there were no focal neurologic deficits.
Urine culture from [**2188-4-4**] showed Klebsiella sensitive only to imipenem with 10,000 colony-forming units.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray was limited, but no definite congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram showed low voltages, rate of 110, with atrial abnormalities, far right axis deviation.
No acute ST-T wave changes.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis in [**3-15**] showed moderate ascites.
She underwent paracentesis on [**2188-3-25**] which showed no spontaneous bacterial peritonitis by white blood cells or culture.
Hospital course prior to being transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] Service, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service for further management of her respiratory distress.
It was uncertain in the beginning as to whether her respiratory distress was secondary to congestive heart failure versus pneumonia/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
During her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, Mr. [**Known lastname **] also converted to new atrial flutter with transient hypotension.
Urine culture from [**4-9**] did eventually grow out 100,000 Klebsiella pneumoniae which was sensitive only to imipenem.
Nasal swab from [**2188-3-25**], showed positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
In general, this was an extremely obese Caucasian female lying in bed, in no acute distress.
Poor attention span.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops could be assessed.
Lungs revealed poor inspiratory effort, otherwise clear.
No masses could be palpated.
An extremely obese abdomen.
There was brawny induration with 3+ pitting edema up to her lower thighs.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  Arrhythmia:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted to be in new atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter but was not considered a candidate for electrocardioversion.
She had been attempted previously for chemical cardioversion with ibutilide drip without success.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone and liver function tests were recently checked and were within normal limits with the exception of a subclinical hypothyroidism.
(b)  Coronary artery disease:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was ruled out for myocardial infarction during her Medical Intensive Care Unit course.
(c)  Congestive heart failure:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has known right-sided heart failure secondary to extreme obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obstructive sleep apnea.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended holding off on Swan-Ganz catheter and suggested possible right heart catheterization at a later time.
RESPIRATORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 34727**] respiratory distress responded well to diuresis with Lasix up to 80 mg intravenously b.i.d.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to refuse BiPAP as well as nebulizers while on the Medicine floor.
RENAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was known to have recent acute renal failure with chronic renal insufficiency, likely secondary to hypovolemia.
In the intervening days after being transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, her creatinine and blood urea nitrogen continued to rise; likely secondary to prerenal picture including hypovolemia and possible congestive heart failure.
Urine electrolytes had been obtained prior to a Renal consultation which showed a urea of 26, which likely indicated prerenal state.
However, Renal was consulted and thought that only granular casts could be visualized on the urinalysis.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is not a candidate for dialysis at this time secondary to her preload dependence and poor blood pressure.
However, in the intervening days she began to have decreased oral intake.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was treated for hyperkalemia on admission with a potassium of 6.1.
This was likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency and poor Epogen production.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had a chronic indwelling Foley for greater than two years.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] understands that continuous venovenous hemofiltration does have risks involved including possible renal failure, heart failure, and other kinds of morbidities.
