Admission Date:  [**2200-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-8-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2160-11-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress .
Reason for MICU transfer: Critical tracheal stenosis   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy Rigid Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 39 yo WF with a hx of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG in [**7-10**] complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP, LV systolic dysfunction (EF 35%), HTN, HLD, DM who presented with to an OSH 3 days ago with dyspnea and was intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Her respiratory problems date back to her hospitalization for her CABG on [**2200-7-8**], after which she was intubated for 7 days for cardiogenic shock, successfully extubated and discharged on [**7-19**].
However, she re-presented to an OSH on [**7-21**] with chest pain and dyspnea and was found to have MRSA PNA and was treated with Vanc/Moxi.
During that hospitalization, she was also noted to have upper airway stridor and hoarseness [**1-1**] tracheal stenosis found on CT-Chest that was treated with steroids and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-31**].
During that hospitalization, the patient had a rigid bronchoscopy which revealed mucoid concretions that were obstructing the tracheal lumen and given a presumptive diagnosis of tracheitis.
Tissue culture grew out corynebactrium however BALs were negative.
She was covered empirically with vancomycin, clindamycin, and aztreonam, as well as micafungin for possible fungal infection and Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis given her course of steroids.
Post-bronch, her breathing was unlabored with no evidence of inspiratory stridor or hypoxia.
CT-chest also demonstrated LAD thought to be secondary to her infection.
Most recently, she presented to an OSH three days ago with worsening dyspnea was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Here, she had another rigid bronchoscopy that revealed tracheal stenosis with friable/necrotic tracheal mucosa obstructing ~80% of her tracheal lumen that was subsequently removed.
CT-Chest revealed a small amount of mediastinal air thought to be iatrogenic, LAD which was increased in size from prior, and diffuse ground glass opacities consistent with aspiration.
She was started on vanc+cipro on [**8-16**] for recurrent tracheitis and clinda was added on [**8-17**].
She also describes a periodic cough productive of small amounts of green-yellow sputum.
She continues to have pain over both her tracheostomy site and her sternotomy site.
She denies any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, or change in her bowel habits.

New tracheostomy with air visualized in the soft tissue spaces of the neck and tracking down to the mediastinum.
No CT evidence of tracheal perforation or mucosal tear (trachea above the tube is opacified with secretions and this section is not fully assessed) These findings are likely post-procedural.
Extensive bilateral opacities with bilateral ground-glass opacities with sparing of the periphery and more focal parenchymal opacities at bilateral bases.
These findings are concerning for edema overlying aspiration pneumonia.
Edema may be cardiogenic or noncardiogenic and an early ARDS picture cannot be excluded.
Nodal mass at the level of the right bronchus intermedius extending to the level of the takeoff of the superior segment of the right lower lobe superior segment bronchus appears more prominent.

Respiratory Failure: Presented to an OSH with dyspnea and was intubated and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
rigid bronch was performed which revealed tracheal stenosis with friable tracheal mucosa for which she underwent cryotherapy and forceps removal of the necrotic-appearing respiratory mucosa; she ultimately underwent a tracheostomy with a long tube [**Last Name (un) 295**] (terminating ~2cm above the carina).
[**Name2 (NI) **] likely this was a bacterial superinfection over already weakened/necrotic mucosa (patient had tracheal trauma from prior intubation).
She was initially treated with broad empiric coverage but this was narrowed to Clindamycin after cultures on this admission grew mixed oral flora.
Her tracheal tissue was noted to have grown fungal elements that were not treated and thought to be a contamination.
Pt continues to have mild pain in the throat and on the skin about the incision site which was well controlled with MS Contin and MSIR.
They have "red flagged" her file and those of her husband and sister in the past for possible narcotic dependence/abuse as they have frequently purchased large quantities of various narcotics, paying out of pocket, from multiple hospitals and clinics.
Pulmonary Edema: CT scan on admission showed diffuse ground glass opacities that were thought to be most likely pulmonary edema.
The etiology was suspected to be CHF vs negative pressure pulmonary edema from inspiration against narrowed trachea.
On the floor, she demonstrated a mild increase of her lower extremity edema and was effectively diuresed with PO lasix and did not have any worsening in her respiratory status.
Chronic Issues: .

Lymph Nodes on CT: She will need to follow up with Interventional Pulmonology for possible biopsy after resolution of her acute illness #.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having significant trouble breathing.
In the emergency room, you were intubated, and subsequently had a procedure known as a bronchoscopy, where the pulmonary physicians were able to look down your airway and see what was causing your shortness of breath.
They found that your airway was narrowed due to ongoing inflammation.
There, you were treated with antibiotics and pain medications, which continued when you were transferred to the general medical floor.
Your breathing subsequently improved and your pain was managed and you will be discharged home with appropriate respiratory services.
Please note the following changes in your medications: -START CLINDAMYCIN 600mg by mouth three times a day for the next four days -START METOPROLOL 12.5mg by mouth twice a day -START LISINOPRIL 2.5mg by mouth daily -START INSULIN GLARGINE 35 units at bedtime -START INSULIN LISPRO per the sliding scale we print out following your blood sugars with meals -START MORPHINE (EXTENDED RELEASE) 60mg by mouth twice a day -START MORPHINE (INTERMEDIATE RELEASE) 15mg by mouth every [**3-5**] hours as needed for pain -START LIDOCAINE OINTMENT around your trach site as needed every 4 hours -START PANTOPRAZOLE 40mg by mouth twice daily -START MUCINEX 600mg by mouth twice daily -START MICANAZOLE cream and apply to vaginal area -START IPRATROPIUM-BROMIDE NEBULIZER every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath -START ALBUTEROL NEBULIZER every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath -Continue your home atorvastatin, aspirin, plavix, mesalamine, paroxetine, quetiapine  Please bring this paper work with you to your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 4314**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] that they are aware of your recent hospitalization.
