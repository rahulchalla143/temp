He was noted to have bacteremia with GNBs, and GPC awaiting further micro data.
The Chest CT was concerning for possible septic pulmonary emboli, vs infection.
He got vanco, ceftriaxone, gentamycin, levofloxacin, dexamethasone, and morphine for muscle aches.

)Septic pulmonary emboli .
Physical Exam: PE: t 97.2, bp 92/51, hr 61, rr 18, spo2 99% 4lnc gen- well appearing, lying in bed, non-toxic, nad heent- anicteric sclera, op clear with mmm neck- supple, no jvd, no lad cv- rrr, s1s2, no m/r/g chest- port in place, non-tender, no erythema pul- moves air well, occ rhonchi, no wheeze abd- soft, nt, nd, colostomy in place, nabs extrm- no cyanosis/edema, warm/dry nails- no clubbing, no pitting/color changes/indentations neuro- a&ox3, no focal cn/motor deficits  Pertinent Results: CXR: New bilateral interstitial pattern as well as patchy areas of opacity in the right lower lobe posteriorly and in the periphery of the left mid lung zone, the latter with a slightly nodular configuration.
In the setting of fever, this may represent mycoplasma pneumonia or other atypical pneumonia.
Septic embolism should also be considered given apparent nodular configuration of peripheral left lung opacity.
No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse ground-glass opacities within both lungs, with more focal areas of nodular opacities, demonstrated in the periphery of the left lower lobe, lingula, and right middle lobe.
The absence of cavitation within these nodular opacities likely favors septic emboli as a possible process.
The patient is immunocompromised, a fungal infection is also a possibility.
Interlobular septal thickening with small bilateral pleural effusions, suggestive of mild volume overload .
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3)  are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.

He was noted to have bacteremia with GNBs, and GPC awaiting further micro data.
The Chest CT was concerning for possible septic pulmonary emboli, vs infection.
Nodules on Chest CT Possible septic pulmonary emboli vs infectious infiltrates, perhaps chronic since nodules also noted on previous CT.
The plan was to contine IV abx and to have a chest CT as outpt to assess for resolution.
Short gut syndrome: Pt eats small amounts at home, supplemented by TPN.
If you experience fevers, chills, sweats, or if you have tenderness or drainage at the site of your catheter, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
