Admission Date:  [**2125-5-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-6-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-12-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Bactrim / Ceftin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left thoracotomy and subxiphoid BiVentricular Internal Cardiac Defibrillator placement and epicardial lead placement [**2125-5-28**]   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Last Name (un) 107967**] is a 44 year old female with non-ischemic CMP (EF 25-30%), ESRD on dialysis, and anxiety presents with the complaint of shortness of breath for the last few months but worsening over the last week.
This patient reports worsening shortness of breath with exertion particularly over last few days as well as orthopnea.
Notes from her last interactions with her Atrius caregivers describe visits and telephone interactions related to her shortness of breath that are ascribed to various afflictions including anxiety and asthma/bronchitis.
She was given anxiolytic medications, albuterol and cough suppressants with apparent limited effect.
Past Medical History: Chronic and Diastolic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure(Non-ischemic), End Stage Renal Disease, Dialysis since [**2116**] Hypertension, Left Bundle Branch Block, Bells Palsy, Residual Facial Droop, Depressive Disorder, History of Suicide??
Morbid Obesity Asthma, Anemia, History of Small Bowel Obstruction?
Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: trace bilateral edema to ankles.
No discharge.
Dilated cardiomyopathy.
Shortness of breath.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Severe global LV hypokinesis.
No LV mass/thrombus.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.
Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with conduction abnormality/ventricular pacing.
Prominent moderator band/trabeculations are noted in the RV apex.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate to severe (3+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Given severity of TR, PASP may be underestimated due to elevated RA pressure.
Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
Although she has chronic heart failure an ACE-inhibitor was not added to her regimen as her blood pressure would not tolerate it.
6. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
8. trazodone 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
