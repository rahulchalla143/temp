This pregnancy was notable for 1) maternal class C diabetes mellitus since age 3, 2) conceived by IVF, 3) history of preterm labor on [**4-28**] treated with magnesium sulfate and betamethasone, presented with vaginal bleeding, likely placental abruption with a pitocin induction.
The infant was delivered for concerns of progressing placental abruption and nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing during monitoring in labor and delivery.
Anterior fontanel soft and flat with overriding sutures.
Bilateral breath sounds, slightly coarse and equal.
Straight spine, no dimple.
He remains in room air with bilateral breath sounds clear and equal, saturations greater than 95 in room air, and respiratory rate 30s-60s.
He has exhibited some apnea and bradycardia of prematurity, maximum of 2 in 24 hours.
2) CARDIOVASCULAR:  Baby initially received two normal saline boluses for marginally low blood pressures.
Baby looks well-perfused, slightly mottles with care, and pulses were 2+ and equal.
Soft systolic murmur initially audible is no longer audible.
3) FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Baby initially was NPO with peripheral IV fluid of D10W at 60 cc/kg.
On day of life #2, as his respiratory distress had improved, he started on enteral feeds.
He has advanced to 120 cc/kg/d of breast milk or PE20.
The baby has not had electrolytes, as he has advanced to full enteral feeds.
The plan is to check a rebound bili on [**5-29**] am.
6) INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Because of his prematurity and respiratory distress and unknown GBS status, sepsis eval was done on admission.
He has had no further issues with infection.
7) NEUROLOGY:  Head ultrasound has not been indicated based on gestational age of greater than 32 weeks and normal neurological examination.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:  1) Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  1) born at less than 32 weeks, 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for day care during RSV season, with a smoker in the household, or with preschool siblings, or 3) with chronic lung disease.
2) Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach 6 months of age.
Before this age, the family and other care givers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES LIST: 1) Former premature 33-6/7 week, nondysmorphic male.
2) Status post respiratory distress syndrome, probably transient tachypnea of newborn.
3) Infant of a diabetic mother.
5) Status post rule out sepsis with antibiotics.
