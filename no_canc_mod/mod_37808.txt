At rest and with no pressure, the pain was described as "achy" [**3-8**].
However, with any pressure or movement, the pain was described as sharp and [**9-7**].
Overall the pain was worsening, and on the day of admission she could not walk.
Pain was constant and not alleviated by anything she did, including taking "pain pills" she had from her recent procedure.
The pain interfered with falling asleep and also woke her at night.
Pt noted that her left leg swelled on the first day of the pain.
Pt recalled no recent trauma, bug bites, fevers, chills, vomiting, nausea, or difficulty breathing.
She states the pain began before that occurred.
In the last month, pt noted mood swings and a loss of memory.
She mentioned it may be secondary to her medications.
Past Medical History: renal failure secondary to diabetes mellitus on HD status post R nephrectomy for renal cell cancer depression cholecystectomy gastric ulcer PVD s/p Left SFA to dorsalis pedis artery bypass for L gangrenous heel in [**2187**]; R proximal SFA to proximal AT bypass on [**2191-3-31**] OSA on CPAP Gastroparesis Ischemic colitis Right thigh wound LVH, EF 55% COPD on 3-4L NC at home  Social History: Denies illicit drug use.
Family History: Mother died of stomach cancer in her 40s.
Father had an unknown cancer in his 70s.
Constitutional: Obese female laying in bed crying out in pain at times.
No focal deficits.
CRPS B/L LOWER EXTREMITIES  Final Report  RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:    22.3 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MDP ([**2191-7-8**]); HISTORY: Left lower extremity pain and leukocytosis with concern for possible infection.
Coned down flow and static images of both distal lower extremities were also obtained.
There is no focal abnormal uptake of the left lower extremity to suggest infection.
Increase uptake of the right ankle is likely due to degenerative stress changes.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
IMPRESSION: No abnormal uptake of the left lower extremity to suggest infection.
CXR [**2191-7-6**]:  INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease with fever.
No overt pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
Bilateral plate-like areas of atelectasis in the lateral mid lungs.
LLEG XRAY [**2191-7-6**]: HISTORY: 53 y/o woman with peripheral vascular disease and requiring bypass of bilateral lower extremities.
Patient with right wound infection.
Evaluate for osteomyelitis or fracture.
FINDINGS: There are no signs for acute fractures or dislocations.
Extensive vascular calcifications are present.
There is some flattening of the calcaneus posteriorly without discrete fracture line.
Vascular calcifications are seen throughout the medial aspect of the lower extremity soft tissues.
There is no abnormal soft tissue gas.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis or acute fracture.
FINDINGS:  Multiple [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale and color Doppler images were obtained in the region of MR abnormality in the anteromedial calf subcutaneous tissues.
Images revealing 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm complex cystic lesion without definite flow within or around it.
The lesion contains floating echogenic debris but no solid nodular component.
1.4-cm subcutaneous complex cystic lesion, likely representing a sebaceous cyst.
A small abscess would be considered less likely given the absence of associated vascularity.
This appearance is not consistent with a varicosity.
[**2191-7-3**] U/S Venous doppler to eval for DVT: INDICATION:  53-year-old female with three-day history of leg pain and swelling.
Augmentation in the left popliteal fossa could not be demonstrated secondary to patient discomfort.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT in the bilateral popliteal veins.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 53 year old female with history of PVD requiring bypass procedures in both lower extremities, diabetes, and renal failure on HD who presented with three days of pain on her lower left leg.
Differential includes DVT, complex regional pain syndrome, compartment syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, cellulitis, and diabetic neuropathy.
Her pain appears severe.
In the setting of recent surgery, increased immobilization, and obesity, the risk for DVT is high.
Complex regional pain syndrome is also possible, given her recent procedures and emotional stress.
However, fever and elevated white count (12.1 WBC) raise the concern for infection, especially because necrotizing fasciitis can present with few objective physical signs.
Compartment syndrome and cellulitis are less of a concern due to lack of obvious swelling and erythema.
Diabetic neuropathy seems less likely due to the pain's acute and severe nature.
- Control pain with oxycodone and acetaminophen; avoid dilaudid and morphine because they caused her to have mental status changes and agitation per discharge note from [**2191-5-17**] and daughter's report.
There was no evidence of DVT in the left common femoral vein and superficial femoral vein.

- Vascular Surgery following - Monitor for signs of local infection.
Regardless of the leg pain, addressing her mood may be therapeutic and necessary.
Self-reported recent mental status changes.
- Psych and Social work as above.
Pt has no respiratory complaints, but her respiratory rate was noted to be 24.
- continue CPAP at night - Oxygen requirement may be related to agitation; due to peripheral vascular disease, difficult to get accurate Sp02 [**Location (un) 1131**].
No complaints or symptoms of shortness of breath.
On the evening of [**7-11**], the patient was admitted briefly to the MICU reported hypertension to SBP 260.
She has no headache, vision changes, lightheadedness.
She denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

They prefer to treat symptomatically and follow rather than bx due to pt history of poor wound healing.
