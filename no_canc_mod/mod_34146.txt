He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
ECG showed septal q waves, possibly consistent with old anteroseptal infarct but no ST segment changes.
He was monitored on telemetry without arrhythmic events.
ETT was significant for ischemic ST changes and anginal symptoms.
Consequently, the patient underwent cardiac cath showing 3 vessel disease and left main disease.
After his cath he was placed on a Nitro gtt due to recurrent pain.
On post-op day two he had an episode of atrial fibrillation which was converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone and beta blockers.
On post-op day four EP was consulted d/t post conversion pause following a fib to sinus rhythm.
On post-op day five he had recurrence of atrial fibrillation and was treated with Lopressor and started on Coumadin (per EP recommendation).
Keflex was given for left arm phlebitis.
