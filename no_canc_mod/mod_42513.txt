Admission Date:  [**2132-10-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-10-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-3-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Azithromycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 67 yo female with history of left breast cancer and pericardial effusion in [**2125**] who presented to the CCU s/p pericardiocentesis for pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
Approximately two weeks ago, she reports feeling sore ribs in her back and pain with deeping breathing.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2204**] who felt this was most likely a viral infection given normal CBC and CXR.
She reports a large stressor after seeing her estranged sister at a family party on Saturday.
Her fever continued and a CTA was obtained on Wednesday which revealed an effusion but no PE.
Upon arrival, bedside echo revealed a large pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Repeat TTE this morning revealed a larger effusion and impaired ventricular filling with RV collapse.
On review of systems, she notes fever, dry cough, and nausea but denies vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, urinary incontinence, sinus tenderness or rash.
She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.
Echo done after the procedure revealed a thick pericardium but no residual effusion.
Right atrial pressures were also elevated and decreased but were still high at the end of the procedure.

Since [**2126-7-8**] and [**2126-6-7**], a simple pericardial effusion has increased, now moderate to large in size.
Moderate-sized left pleural effusion, increased since [**7-10**], [**2125**], but decreased since [**2126-7-2**].
Small right effusion and atelectasis.
No findings suggestive of pneumonia.
Radiation fibrotic changes in the left upper lobe.
No pulmonary embolism.
Moderate-sized left pleural effusion, trace right pleural effusion, and large pericardial effusion are unchanged since the chest CT performed yesterday.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
ECHO [**2132-10-10**] IMPRESSION: Large circumferential pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of impaired ventricular filling.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-10-9**], there is evidence of impaired ventricular filling.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Versy small residual pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-10-11**] the findings are similar  PERICARDIAL AND PLEURAL FLUID WERE NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS  Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo female with history of breast cancer and prior pericardial effusion in [**2125**] who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] with large pericardial effusion and tamponade after two weeks of fever and viral illness.
# Large Pericardial Effusion with Tamponade:  The patient presented with a large pericardial effusion with evidence of RV diastolic collapse.
She has a history of prior transient pericardial effusion, likely from a viral etiology.
The patient ins now s/p pericardiocentesis, tapped ~500cc of bloody fluid, which was found to be exudative.
A repeat TTE done after pulling the pericardial drain showed that there was no significant re-accumulation of pericardial effusion.
Unclear etiology of pericardial effusion, but differential includes viral pericarditis, idiopathic, radiation therapy-related, or malignancy induced.
PERICARDIAL AND PLEURAL FLUID WERE NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS .
# atrial fibrillation:  After the placement of the pericardial drain, the patient had a few isolated episodes of atrial fibrillation, that all self-resolved.
It is likely that these episodes are secondary to pericardial irritation from the drain.
# pleural effusion:  The patient has evidence of pleural effusion on CXR and ECHO.
She never had a white count, and fevers have resolved, and she is currently afebrile.
Moreover, patient denied any infectious symptoms besides dry cough and because of this, no antibiotics were started; upon discharge, the all blood cultures were no growth to date and the patient remained afebrile.
The patient's pressures were well controlled while in the CCU, and her metoprolol was uptitrated because of her elevated heart rates.
- Please follow up paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as an outpatient with cardiologist; the patient was started on daily ASA 81.
Medications on Admission: -METOPROLOL SUCCINATE 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] -LEVOFLOXACIN 500 mg Tablet daily since Monday [**10-6**] -No vitamins or supplements.
)(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Pericardial Effusion Pleural Effusion Paroxsymal atrial fibrillation  Secondary diagnosis: Breast cancer Viral infection   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Chest pain free.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having some soreness with breathing, and echocardiogram of your heart showed that you had some fluid in the bag that is surrounding your heart.
You also had a lot of fluid in the space around your lungs on the left side.
We did a similar procedure and inserted a needle into the area and drained about 600 cc of fluid from your lungs.
.. After your procedure, you had some instances of elevated heart rates.
We think that this happened because of some irritation that the fluid caused your heart.
.. We made the following changes to your medications: -CHANGE Metoprolol succinate to 100 mg daily -START Colchicine 0.6mg by mouth twice daily for 3 months or as directed by your PCP (hold for diarrhea) -START Ibuprofen 600mg by mouth three times daily for 1 month or as directed by your PCP (hold for upset stomach or GI bleeding) -START omeprazole 20 mg once a day while you are taking the Ibuprofen -START aspirin 81 mg daily for atrial fibrillation .
