Admission Date:  [**2207-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2208-1-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-12-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**] Chief Complaint: multiple falls, acute on chronic SDH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**12-15**] Right Craniotomy for SDH [**12-21**] IVC filter [**2207-12-31**] PEG [**2208-1-4**] MRI spine with sedation  History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year old Male who was switched from Cymbalta a few months prior to Prozac and noted some dizziness and lightheadedness episodes.
She finally noticed he had multiple ecchymoses and chronic falls and decided to bring him to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) **].
A CT head [**2207-12-13**] showed a grossly stable acute on chronic Right hemispheric subdural hematoma and scattered Right SAH; R cerebral sulcal effacement and roughly 6 mm R-to-L MLS (was 5mm) with no evidence of herniation.
No recent trauma or injury for at least 2 weeks.
He has a history of chronic anticoagulation for history of PE with Coumadin (INR 17.5 on admission).
He notes chronic peripheral neuropathy with no sensation, temperature or pain felt below the knees bilaterally, but ongoing.
-Status post clamshell repair of PFO: presented with massive bilateral pulmonary emboli and emboli in spleen -Hypertension -Hyperhomocysteinemia -Alcohol abuse -Cervical stenosis -Neuropathy -ETOH abuse  Social History: Works as a personal consultant.
No point tenderness.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
Sensation: Intact to light touch, propioception, pinprick and vibration bilaterally in upper extremities; below the knee, no vibration, temperature sensation bilaterally.
Shaved right head after craniotomy with scar Neck: JVP at 7 cm with possibly HJR Cardiac: irregular, no murmurs appreciable Pulm: lungs with some crackles in anterior lung fields bilaterally Abd: soft and nontender Ext: 1+ edema in upper and lower extremities.
Skin: Pt noted to have erythema and skin breakdown by PEG tube.
On back side, violaceous macular skin changes on left gluteal region along medial area area with no mass underneath, no fluid collections in left gluteal region.
Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2207-12-13**]: Grossly stable acute on chronic R hemispheric SDH and scattered R SAH; R cerebral sulcal effacement and ~6mm R-to-L MLS (was 5mm) with no herniation noted, final read pending, film reviewed with Neurorads.
CT head [**2207-12-14**] Interval enlargement of previously visualized right subdural hematoma with more of an acute component, more mass effect, and a greater shift of the normally midline structures.
CT head [**2207-12-15**] Interval decrease in thickness of the right convexity subdural hematoma, which may, in part, reflect redistribution and stable small left frontal subdural hematoma, with decreased leftward shift of normally midline structures.
CT head [**2207-12-16**] Stable overall appearance of bilateral subdural hematomas, with stable leftward shift of the normally-midline structures.
Focused examination demonstrates an abnormal, sludge-filled, distended gallbladder with wall edema, concerning for acalculous cholecystitis.
A hepatobiliary nuclear medicine scan with CCK may be of use if further assessment is desired.
Echogenic liver compatible with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded by imaging.
Evaluation for portal hypertension can be achieved with Doppler ultrasound if desired.
EEG [**2207-12-16**] This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence of a slow background which reached a maximum of 4 Hz frequency.
This is representative of a moderate to severe encephalopathy such as can be seen in diffuse ischemia, infection, toxic/metabolic, or other diffuse etiologies.
Of note, there was significant electrical artifact from 17:23 onward in the right hemisphere leads.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures noted.
EEG [**2207-12-17**] Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence of bursts of up to one minute each of periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) over the right central region.
PLEDs are commonly seen in the setting of acute structural brain lesions and can indicate epileptogenic cortex, although no frank electrographic seizures were seen.
The slow background also indicates a moderate to severe encephalopathy such as seen in toxic/metabolic, ischemic, or infectious etiologies.
CT head [**2207-12-17**] No significant change in the size of the right-sided subdural hemorrhage with mild mass effect on the cerebral hemisphere, cerebral edema and shift of the midline structures to the left side along with mass effect on the right lateral ventricles; along with a few foci of hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe at the vertex.
Mild improvement in the post-surgical changes noted before.
No new hemorrhage noted.
EEG [**2207-12-18**] This video EEG telemetry was abnormal due to the presence of a slow, disorganized background that was usually in the delta frequency range with superimposed bursts of generalized delta slowing, often with a bifrontal predominance.
These findings suggest the presence of a severe encephalopathy which can be due to diffuse ischemia, toxic/metabolic changes, infections, medication effects, or other etiologies.
No epileptiform features or electrographic seizures were seen.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2204-4-16**], the right ventricle is now dilated and hypocontractile, and the left ventricle is now hyperdynamic .
EEG [**2207-12-19**] This video EEG telemetry is abnormal due to the presence of a slow, disorganized background, mostly in the delta frequency range, with bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings suggest the presence of a severe encephalopathy such as can be seen from diffuse ischemia, toxic/metabolic changes, medication effects, infections, and other such etiologies.
Bursts of more prominent slowing were often seen in the right fronto-central region, sometimes with sharp features, suggesting the presence of more focal subcortical dysfunction in that area, but no frank epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were seen.
EEG [**2207-12-20**] This EEG gives evidence still for intermittent PLEDs-like discharges in the right central temporal region.
On occasion, these become more organized and appear to have electrographic seizure occurrence.
There is no obvious clinical accompaniment.
Over time, these seem, if anything, to be increasing in frequency of occurrence and in duration.
There is also a severe diffuse encephalopathy with some structural asymmetric features suggesting more right hemisphere involvement.
Overall stable appearance of bilateral subdural hematoma with stable leftward shift of normal midline structure.
Stable appearance of right parenchymal hemorrhage with slightly increased zone of surrounding vasogenic edema.
Stable appearance of small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage within the right hemisphere.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Stable size of right-sided subdural hematoma and small left-sided subdural hematoma.
Resolving right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with stable amount of surrounding edema.
No new acute hemorrhage.
NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW: There is 2.9x1.6cm mass lesion in the nasopharynx, similar the prior MR of [**2198-4-15**] with obstruction to the lumen; this was felt to represent a lipoma/cyst with dense contents, more likely the latter given the density on CT.
There is likely obstruction of the eustachian tubes.
There is diffuse mucosal thickening and fluid in the mastoid air cells on both sides.
No pulmonary embolus in the main pulmonary artery, right and left pulmonary artery and segmental branches.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Right heart enlargement.
CT head  [**2207-12-30**] IMPRESSION: Incomplete study with substantial artifact limiting evaluation for interval change.
Apparent residual right subdural collection with leftward shift of normally midline structures.
CT HEAD [**2208-1-3**] IMPRESSION: Limited study, demonstrating interval evolution of right subdural hematoma, without increase in size.
There is no midline shift, and mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle is unchanged  Venous Duplex [**2208-1-4**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of the left upper extremity.
There is new 2-3mm grade 1 retrolisthesis of C3 on C4 whcihc results in mild-to-moderate spinal canal narrowing without signal abnormality of the cervical cord.
No signal abnormality is identified on the STIR sequences to suggest edema suggesting this retrolisthesis is of a degenerative etiology.
Mild cervical and lumbar spondylosis without severe spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

He demonstrated a significant coagulopathy on admission with an INR of 17.5 and a PTT of 133.2 which was reversed with oral/IV vitamin K and 2U FFP in the ER at [**Hospital1 18**].
On [**12-14**] the patient experienced a LUE seizure and received 6 mg of Ativan which resulted in cessation of seizure activity.
He was taken to the OR on [**2207-12-15**] for right craniotomy and subdural hematoma evacuation.
Repeat imaging 4 hours post-op showed improvement of his right SDH with post-surgical changes and no complications.
On [**12-16**], his neurologic exam demonstrated continued difficulty with arousal and the patient followed minimal commands with slight response to noxious stimuli.
His neuro exam was followed by the neurosurgery service, and NSG continued to follow the patient after the pt was transferred to the Medical service for management of his tachypnea and atrial fibrillation (see below).
# Respiratory Status/tachypnea/hypoxia: Directly after the surgery, the pt was transferred to the ICU intubated.
The medicine consult service was consulted for persistent tachypnea and hypoxia.
Chest x-rays demonstrated pulmonary edema, and the patient was aggressively diuresed.
Out of concern for PE causing the tachypnea, a CTA was performed, which ruled out PE.
Also, the patient had a Cx that was positive for Moraxella, and so was treated with abx (broad spectrum, then narrowed to cefepime for 8 days).
Upon transfer to the medical floor, he was satting well on RA, but over time, required O2 and further diuresis in the setting of volume overload.
Also complicating the issue was a-fib which developed in the setting of diuresis, then contributing to volume backup into the lungs.
# Atrial Fibrillation - The patient is not an anticoagulation candidate given SDH.
Out of concern for underlying reasons for the Afib/RVR, the patient was treated for pain with fentanyl/dilaudid/lidocaine patch, and labs were sent to r/o other causes (pt has a normal TSH/Free T4).
Also, the pt had fevers upon transfer, however this subsided after the pt's subclavian line was pulled, and so fevers/infx were no longer thought to be the reason for his Afib-RVR.
Also, to ensure all causes of the tachycardia were r/o, we consulted the Cardiology service, which agreed with our work up, and recommended adding verapamil.
There was concern for hematoma or other compressive physiology on the spinal cord.
The MRI revealed no acute pathology or cord compression to account for the weakness.
A Neurology c/s was called who felt that this was c/w neuropathy of critical illness.
# Hypernatremia: Secondary to the patient's inability to take in water from thirst given AMS.
Recommends increasing further if hypernatremia persists.
# Fevers - The patient developed a fever during his hospitalization.
He was given tylenol prn for symptomatic treatment.
He had been afebrile for >1 week at the time of discharge.
# Report of bloody stools/Anemia: The pt was guaiac'ed and was negative, however was noted to have some blood on other instances.
Of note, earlier in the hospitalization, the pt did receive transfusions for low Hct.
# Hypertension - The pt's BP was normotensive to hypotensive with the titration of nodal agents for his a-fib.
He was actually advanced to a soft diet with NSG, however with further altered mental status, he was made NPO and all nutrition was done via NG tube.
His tube feeds were restarted after 24 hours without incidence.
(See below for management of erythema at site of PEG tube per Surgery team) .
# Gout vs Bursitis: L elbow eryhema and MTP erythema and swelling felt to be most consistent with gout.
# Erythema and skin breakdown at PEG site: Evaluated by surgery, feels no need to loosen stitches.
# Hyperlipidemia - On statin .
# Incidental findings on MRI: Patient noted to have infrarenal abdominal aneurysm on routine imaging.
