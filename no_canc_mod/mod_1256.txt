Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Low lung volumes significantly limit the evaluation, thought allowing for this, there is no focal consolidation, effusion, or signs of CHF.
IMPRESSION: Limited study without definite signs of CHF or pneumonia.
P-R interval prolongation.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.
- ECG	Study Date of [**2197-5-1**]  8:28:18 AM  Sinus bradycardia with frequent atrial premature beats.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Significant ST-T wave changes in leads II, III, aVF and V2-V6.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-4-30**] no diagnostic interval change.
No evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.
- CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2197-5-3**] 9:20 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-2**], there is no interval change or evidence of pneumothorax.
Single-channel pacemaker device remains in place and there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F NSH resident who presents with bradycardia in the setting of intravascular depletion and calcium channel blocker use.
# Sick Sinus syndrome/AF: Pt in slow AF with occasional pauses up to 3-5 seconds, thus occasionally with a HR in the 30s.

Pt without chest pain and no complaints of chest pain when examine.
Pt apepars clinically dry by further evidence of rise in BUN/Cr.
Was given gentle fluids and encouraged to take POs and Cr improved.
# Hyperkalemia: K 5.4 in setting of intravascular depletion.
