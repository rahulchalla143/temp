Per dishcarge summary, pt had no cardiac complaints during this admission.
However, she did have an episode of Afib with RVR thought to be secondary to electrolyte abnormalities.
Pt returned to [**Location **] where she developed sudden onset of CP and SOB.
In [**Name (NI) **] pt received 2mg Morphine with complete resolution of chest pain.
However, ECG concerning for new lateral TWI and ?
Repeat ECG when pain free showed improvement in ST changes.

History of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction over the past year.
Recent Adenosine MIBI stress test in [**2200-6-25**] with a mild inferior ischemia.

She has never been married and has no children.
NECK: No JVD appreciated CARDIOVASCULAR: RRR, no murmurs.
EXTREMITIES: chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally.
Low voltage, Resolution of ST elevation in V3-V6.
CXR ([**2204-11-15**]) - Interval development of left lower lobe opacity.
Anterior, distal septal and apical akinesis is present.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
MICRO: Stool - negative for C diff x 3; C diff B toxin pending; Giardia/crypto DFA negative Blood [**2204-11-15**] - negative URINE CULTURE (Final [**2204-12-2**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.

CHEST PAIN - On admission, the patient had chest pain that resolved with morphine.
She again complained of CP on the day prior to d/c but continued to refuse all interventions.
Her EKG continued to show lateral/inferior TWI c/w her presentation.
Her troponins were 0.01 on discharge and never elevated beyond 0.04 on admission.
Provided the patient continues to refuse intervention, nitroglycerin can be attempted for chest pain relief.
Her hypotension was thought secondary to infection (WBC 20/Lactate 2.7) and she was started on linezolid/axtreonam (multiple resistence organisms in the past with pen/ceph/tobra allergies).
Her original CXR did not show any acute pulmonary process.
She had two other episodes of hypotension on this admission with SBP to the 80's.
Her urine subsequently grew out Klebsiella and E. Coli, resistant to multiple drugs.
Antibiotic selection was further complicated by her penicillin allergy, and ID recommended transfer to the ICU for meropenem desensitization which was completed on [**2204-12-3**].
Initially, she required 3-4L O2 (increased from home 2LO2) though possibly secondary to fluid overload or COPD flare.
She was started on steroids in the setting of her ICU admission for hypotension, and these were continued via a slow taper as it was thought they may have improved her COPD.
CRI: Her creatinine was elevated on admission at 2.1.
HYPONATREMIA: The patient has long standing hyponatremia, most likely due to dehydration.
Stool cultures were sent for c. diff and returned negative.
She was also tested for giardia which was negative.
She continued to have high output from her ostomy.
A PICC was placed for hydration and electrolyte repletion.
GI was also consulted and reccommended dietary changes (low fat/carb/lactose, small freq feedings), anti-motility agents (immodium, cholestyramine), and also suggested that her ostomy output may be w/in the normal range for a patient w/ a total colectomy.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Sodium Chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**11-26**] Sprays Nasal [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for dry nose.
