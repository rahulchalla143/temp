Admission Date:  [**2194-10-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-10-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2173-7-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: ORTHOPAEDICS  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3645**] Chief Complaint: neck pain after fall from horse  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2194-10-18**]: halo application in the OR for C1, C2, C5 fractures.
History of Present Illness: 21yo female fell from a horse on [**2194-10-17**] and sustained a neck injury.
imaging showed C1, C2 and C5 cervical spine fractures, but no sensorimotor deficits.
no vessel injury on c-spine CTA.
Past Medical History: none  Physical Exam: well-appearing female in mild distress.
some posterior c-spine tenderness to palpation.
Evaluate for dislocation or fracture.
TECHNIQUE: Axial acquired images were obtained through the neck without contrast.
In addition, the posterior aspect of the body of C2 demonstrates a comminuted fracture which extends to the bilateral transverse foramina, bilateral pedicles, and bilateral transverse processes.
There is no retropulsion of fracture fragments although there is a tiny ossified density anterior to C2-3 which likely represents an anterior avulsion fracture.
A tiny ossified fragment is also noted laterally to the left of C1, although it is unclear if this is a fracture fragment as no donor site is seen.
A small broad-based disc bulge is seen at C3-4.
There is a minimally displaced C5 fracture involving the left pedicle, left transverse foramen and process, and the left inferior facet.
Comminuted fracture of vertebral body C2 which extends to the bilateral transverse foramina, transverse processes, and pedicles.
CTA of the neck is recommended for further evaluation of vascular structures.
MRI is also recommended to assess for ligamentous injury.
Minimally displaced fracture of the left C5 pedicle, transverse foramen, transverse process, and inferior facet.
EXAM: MRI of the cervical spine.
There is a complex fracture of the body of the C2 identified involving the intra- articular region in the left side.
There is edema seen in the posterior interspinous region at C1-2 level.
Small amount of prevertebral edema is seen extending from C2-3 to C4 level.
Increased signal is seen within the interspinous region from C2-3 to C4-5 level indicating mild injury without disruption of the ligaments at this level.
There is no intraspinal hematoma or spinal cord compression seen.
No abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord.
IMPRESSION: C2 fracture with associated adjacent soft tissue edema and edema in the interspinous region between C1 and C2.
No intraspinal hematoma or spinal cord compression.
Mild prevertebral soft tissue edema.
Abnormal signal within the interspinous region from C2-3 to disc C4-5 indicating interspinous ligament trauma without evidence of disruption of the anterior or posterior longitudinal ligaments or ligamentum flavum.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with C2 fracture, rule out vertebral artery injury.
FINDINGS: In the region of left vertebral artery at the site of fracture involving the intra-articular region no vertebral artery irregularity, occlusion or narrowing identified to indicate trauma.
The right vertebral and both carotid arteries demonstrate normal flow without evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
No other soft tissue abnormalities are seen.
No vertebral artery injury seen in the region.
No other abnormalities on CT angiography of the neck.
she was taken to the OR on [**2194-10-18**] by dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for application of a halo frame under sedation and with fluoroscopy.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
you can unbuckle the halo vest while lying supine in bed to wash your skin under the vest with a wash cloth, but otherwise you need to the have vest buckled at all times.
the skin should be loose around the pins and there should not be any scabs around the pins.
if erythema or drainage develops around the pins, call the office.
Please allow 72 hours for refill of narcotic prescriptions, so please plan ahead.
