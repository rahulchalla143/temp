Admission Date:  [**2189-3-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-4-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-3-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**] Chief Complaint: Dizziness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Angiogram with aneurysm coil [**2189-3-20**] Intubation   History of Present Illness: 66 year old female who reports dizziness since [**Month (only) 1096**].
She was scheduled for a MRI today by her Primary Care physician to further diagnose her dizziness and was found to have a large vertebral artery aneurysm.
She reports seeing floaters in her visual fields for the past few months and states that her legs feel "heavier" or "weaker", but denies any recent falls, use of cane or walker,or her legs giving out on her.
She denies bowel and bladder incontinence, numbness or tingling sensation, other visual disturbance, nausea, vomiting, headache.
Past Medical History: Left proximal PICA aneurysm w/mass effect on brainstem s/p coiling Emphysema Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Cholecystectomy Peripheral vascular disease, mild celiac stenosis and moderate-to-severe SMA stenosis s/p stent [**8-15**] with known [**Female First Name (un) 899**] occlusion.
S/P left ankle fracture Tobacco abuse Appendectomy Depression  Social History: She is married with four living children.
She works as bookkeeper for her husband [**Name (NI) **]   Family History: Her mother and father both had cancer (unclear which type)   Physical Exam: Vitals: T99.9 BP 103/92 HR 94 RR 33 100% 40% FIO2 Gen: intubated, awake and alert, following commands, no acute distress Neck: supple, no JVD CV: RRR, nl s1/s2, no appreciable murmur Resp: vented breath sounds, decreased BS at bases, no wheezing Abd: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding Ext: warm, no edema   Pertinent Results: CTA Head and Neck: 1.
3.2 cm extra-axial mass centered in the cerebello-pontine cistern on the left avidly enhances following contrast administration, and may originate from the proximal portion of the left PICA (though not from the origin).
However, given that it enhances slightly less than blood pool, unusual appearance of a mass lesion such as meningioma or other extra-axial neoplasm should also be considered.
MRI and angiography may be helpful for further evaluation.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Left upper pole homogeneously enhancing kidney lesion may represent a complicated cyst; however, further characterization of this cyst with MRI is recommended to exclude cystic renal cell carcinoma.
Indeterminate left adrenal lesion likely represents adenoma.
Dilation of the hepatic ducts may be related to ampullary stenosis or reflect postsurgical change.
Moderate emphysema.
Right lower quadrant lymph node and associated stranding are nonspecific.
They may relate to infectious process or recent procedure.
[**2189-3-31**] MRI Abdomen: 1) Limited study due to limited breath-holding capacity and lack of intravenous gadolinium.
2) Left adrenal adenoma.
3) Left renal cyst in question appears completely simple, but can be re- assessed at the time of MRCP with intravenous gadolinium.
4) Mild bilie duct dilatation with the suggestion of some debris within the common duct.
5) Bibasilar consolidation and effusions, new compared to the CT of [**2189-3-17**], likely secondary to aspiration.

She reported seeing floaters in her visual fields and leg heaviness over the past few months.
CT Head and Neck demonstrated a 3.2 cm extra-axial mass centered in the cerebello-pontine cistern on the left, consistent with a giant aneurysm.
She had an episode of desaturation immediately after extubation and received a bolus of Glycopyrrolate, and Neostigmine for suspected residual paralysis.
She developed a slight worsening left sided weakness on [**3-21**] w/ right sided sensory deficit, per nsurg c/w Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary infarct).
Also developed a femoral hematoma, but follow-up US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula.
Sputum was obtained on [**3-22**] given worsening hypoxemia and thick secretions, grew Moraxella and ceftriaxone was started.
During her first stay in the MICU, it was suspected that she was having aspiration events.
Passed bedside swallow eval, but due to high suspicion for aspiration a barium swallow was performed with aspiration of barium into the lungs.
Antibiotics were switched to Vanc/Zosyn and she required intubation for worsening respiratory distress.
On floor, she continued to be tenuous for a respiratory perspective with high oxygen requirements.
This was believed to be multi-factorial from VAP, repeated aspiration events, poor cough and baseline lung disease.
A repeat speech and swallow evaluation showed evidence of aspiration with deficits consistent with neurological deficit and it was decided to proceed with PEG tube placement on [**3-31**].
Following PEG placement, she had an episode of acute desaturation on the floor to 60% on NRB.
Hypoxemia was most likely [**2-9**] mucous plugging given that it resolved following ET suctioning.
She did have several episodes of acute desaturation due to mucous plugging which resolved with chest pt and suctioning.
Problem [**Name (NI) **]:  #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration Pneumonia: [**2-9**] aspiration of barium, with persistent thick secretions.
She has had recurrant difficulties due to mucous plugging exacerbated by generalized weakness and overall deconditioning.
Stable throughout admission with no change on serial head CT.  She is s/p PEG placement for dysphagia and aspiration.
-discharge to PT for rehab -would benefit from repeat swallow study once strenght improved to determine if dysphagia resolves.
It was removed at one point however replaced due to persistent retention.
On [**4-16**] her foley was discontinued and she was straight cathed q shift for urinary retention.
If her urinary retention does not resolve in [**1-9**] days she will likely require replacement of her foley catheter with outpatient urology follow up.
Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia: Her baseline hematocrit is mid 20's with a ferritin of 6.
Outside hospital records were obtained for EGD and colonscopy in [**6-15**] which showed only ischemic colonic ulcer.
She had this discontinued secondary to constipation and will continue on ferrous sulfate.
She should receive a colonoscopy to evaluate the iron deficiency anemia.
EGD performed during PEG placement revealed duodenitis for which she was placed on lansoprazole through the PEG tube.
Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: These were identified on Abdominal CT with concern for malignancy.
An abdominal MRI was attempted, but she was unable to tolerate this due to difficulty holding breath for extended periods of time.
PVD: Had evidence of ischemic colitis in [**2188-6-8**] and a BMS was placed in SMA on [**8-15**].
Pt has PMHx of depression but not currently on medications.
Significant nursing and family concern for depression during this admission.
Psychiatry evaluated patient and would recommend adding mirtazipine once she is stable from a pulmonary standpoint given risk of sedation and possible aspiration with this medication.
She was given an occasional one time extra dose of alprazolam for her anxiety.
A TSH was checked which was elevated at 7.1 with normal FT4 likely due to either sick euthyroid or subclinical hypothyroidism.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 100 % Powder [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia Mucous plugging 3 cm giant left PICA artery aneurysm Emphysema Left adrenal mass left kidney cyst Iron deficiency anemia, severe Horner's syndrome Low-density lesion in the thyroid.
Dyphagia s/p PEG placement   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
She has slight left sided weakness and dysphagia from her cerebral aneurysm.
If acutely desaturates, most likely due to mucous plugging.
After the procedure you had difficulty swallowing and aspirated into your lungs which caused difficulty breathing requiring intubation.
You developed a pneumonia that was treated with antibiotics and aggressive lung rehab.
Please inform you doctor or return to ED if you experience loss of vision, blurring, double vision, half vision, slurring of speech or difficulty finding correct words to use, severe headache or worsening headache not controlled by pain medication, sudden change in the ability to move or use your arm or leg or the ability to feel your arm or leg, trouble swallowing, breathing, or talking, numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities, temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours.
You also had some abnormal findings on your CT scan that requires follow-up with an abdominal MRI.
