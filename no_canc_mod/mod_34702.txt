Admission Date:  [**2122-11-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-11-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-8-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: Intermittent slow ventricular tachycardia Syncopal episodes  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 75 yo male with HTN, HL, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], aortic stenois and CAD s/p CABG/AVR on [**2122-11-5**] presented to ED on [**2122-11-25**] after being found to have ventricular tachycardia while at his cardiologist's office on the day of admission.
Patient had been feeling fatigued for the past week prior to admission, and also had reported decreased appetite during that same time frame.
Patient also reported having had two syncopal episodes recently, the first one week after the recent operation and the second one occurring five days prior to admission.
Patient had never had syncopal episodes in the past.
Both events occurred when patient was sitting down and then bent over; he did not report any prodromal symptoms and he was unconscious for about 5 seconds each time (patient's wife was at his side when both events occurred).
There was no post-ictal state or bladder/bowel incontinence after the episodes.
While at clinic on the day of admission, an EKG was performed which showed wide-complex ventricular tachycardia at 110 bpm and he was found to be hypotensive; patient was asymptomatic at the time.
The EKG at clinic showed wide QRS complex ventricular tachycardia at 110 bpm which is different from prior EKG.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denied exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema or palpitations.

No premature CAD.

NECK: No elevated JVP seen.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
Left atrial abnormality.
Intraventricular conduction delay with left axis deviation may be left anterior fascicular block.
Cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
- [**2122-11-25**] @ 7:32 PM: Wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia.
- [**2122-11-25**] @ 8:02 PM: Wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia with a brief pause followed by a probable sinus conducted beat and then resumption of wide complex tachycardia.
Since the previous tracing of same date there is no significant change.
Left atrial abnormality.
Modest intraventricular conduction delay with left axis deviation may be due to left anterior fascicular block.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of same date wide complex tachycardia is now absent.
- [**2122-11-25**] @ 9:19 PM: Wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia.
Left atrial abnormality.
Slight intraventricular conduction delay with left axis deviation may be due to left anterior fascicular block.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave abnormalities.
Cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
Since the previous tracing of [**2122-11-25**] ventricular tachycardia is now absent.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%).
A mild (1+) anterior paravalvular aortic valve leak is present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction and a depressed cardiac index.
Normally-functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis with mild paravalvular leak.
No evidence of vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis have worsened.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 y/o male with CAD s/p CABG/AVR, HTN, dyslipidemia presented with spontaneous converted monomorphic VT without symptoms.
Prior syncopal episodes likely related to dehydration given decreased appetite since surgery.
Intermittent slow ventricular tachycardia - Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for further management of ventricular tachycardia.
On arrival, telemetry showed that he was flipping into ventricular tachycardia with HR in the 110s to 130s out of sinus heart rate of 50s and 60s while remaining asymptomatic.
During his time at the CCU, he was still flipping into slow VT from sinus rhythm but episodes were not happening as frequently.
Pt remained totally asymptomatic during his stay in the CCU and he was transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for further management.
Dehydration - Dehydration is likely to have been the cause of his syncopal episodes given that his PO intake decreased significantly one week prior to admission.
Since his admission, he has been receiving IV fluids and pureed foods PO and no further syncopal episodes occurred.
By discharge, pt had increased PO intake and urine output improved subsequently.
Ventricular tachycardia was never associated with dizzyness/lightheadedness during the hospital stay.
Coronary artery disease s/p CABG/AVR, Systolic CHF with EF - During this admission, pt ruled out for an MI with cardiac enzymes negative x2.
A transthoracic ECHO performed on [**2122-11-26**] showed a dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction and a depressed cardiac index; it also showed a normally-functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis with mild paravalvular leak.
Hypertension - Patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled on this admission.
History of ureter perforation/leukocytosis -  At one point on this admission, he had one episode of leukocytosis with an WBC of 12.6 while remaining afebrile, and WBC subsequently went back down to 5.9 the following day.
Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] - During admission, patient was kept on pyridostigmine bromide 60 mg PO QID and mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg PO TID.
Chronic Systolic Heart Failure - Patient was dry on exam and continued to have relatively limited PO intake.
He was given IV fluids and never required diuresis or oxygen.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Nursing Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Intermittent slow ventricular tachycardia .
Secondary: Syncopal episodes secondary to dehydration Coronary artery disease s/p CABG/AVR Systolic congestive heart failure with EF of 20%   Discharge Condition: Discharged in good condition; patient oriented to person, place and time.
You have been diagnosed with brief episodes of slow ventricular tachycardia, which is a condition in which your heart rhythm is abnormal.
You did not have any symptoms from this, but it is a condition that is important to monitor on a regular basis and puts you at risk your heart stopping.
