s/p repair strangulated epigastric hernia/sm bowel resection on [**2186-8-6**].
History of Present Illness: 53 yo with a past history of HTN, Hypercholesterolemia underwent repair of a strangulated epigastric hernia and sm bowel resection on [**8-6**] presented to the ED on [**2186-8-14**] with hypotension, dehydration and acute renal failure.
This morning developed nausea, bilious vomiting, and abdominal pain LLQ & RLQ.
Denies BPR, hematemesis, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T-98.0, HR-72, BP-102/68, RR-14, O2-100% RA Constitutional: Obese man appears mildly uncomfortable Head/Eyes: anicteric sclerae Chest/Resp: CTA.
No crackles at apices.
Some mild dry crackles at bases bilaterally with cough.
No R/M/B GI: Incision site with erythema at staples, tender to palpation over RLQ/LLQ.
Mildly distended.
evidence of obstruction [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 53M with 2 days N/V hx of recent epigastric hernia surgery and SB resection.
INDICATION: 63-year-old man with two day history of nausea/vomiting, history of recent epigastric hernia surgery and small bowel resection.
Question evidence of obstruction.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with high-grade distal small-bowel obstruction.
presenting with [**Doctor Last Name **] Field of view: 47 INDICATION: 53-year-old male with two days of nausea/vomiting, epigastric suprapubic abdominal pain.
Recent small bowel resection for incarcerated hernia.
Multiple dilated small bowel loops with air-fluid levels in the mid- abdomen centered around the surgical site.
Given decompressed distal small bowel loops, these findings are consistent with high-grade distal small-bowel obstruction.
contrast has not passed beyond the stomach, which may also relate to the degree of obstruction.
Bilateral renal cysts, characterized previously.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Degenerative changes in the spine, most pronounced at the L3/L4 level.
Unchanged appearance of multiple dilated loops of small bowel, with relatively decompressed distal loops and colon.
Although no definite transition point is seen, there is suggestion of change in caliber near the site of previous small bowel resection.
Possibility of partial small bowel obstruction should still be considered.
Mesenteric lymphadenopathy is likely reactive to recent surgery, although possibility of infectious enteritis could also be considered.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate for obstruction INDICATION: Evaluate for obstruction.
IMPRESSION: Multiple gas-filled loops of small bowel most likely suggestive of ileus.
