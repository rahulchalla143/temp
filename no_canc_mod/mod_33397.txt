Admission Date:  [**2126-5-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-5-12**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Puncture Arterial Blood Gas Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 85375**] is an 87 year old woman with hearing impairment, atrial fibrillation, and recent hip fracture.
Her son noted a rapid heart rate and then called EMS.
She was in atrial fibrillation with RVR, but her blood pressure medications were hold because of concern for sepsis.
He notes that she has had a cough recently that has been non-productive.
She has had 1-2 episodes of urinary incontinence over the couple of months since her hip surgery.
Past Medical History: # CHF, chronic systolic & diastolic heart failure # Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin # S/p Right hip replacement [**1-9**] # Hypothyroidism # Hyperlipidemia # Chronic headaches # Depression # GERD, history of H. Pylori # History of bilateral pleural effusion thought [**1-1**] heart failure, s/p thoracentesis in [**2121**].
# History of fall and pelvic fracture # H/o pneumonia # H/o cataracts # Chronic Headaches   Social History: Married.
Brother with high cholesterol and heart disease.
Decreased breath sound at the right base.
Decreased breath sounds at left base.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Study unable to adequately assess diastolic LV function in the setting of what appears to be atrial fibrillation.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Extensive small vessel ischemic disease.
Right nasal polypoid lesion (2:4), arising from the nasal septum.
Large left pleural effusion and left basilar opacity, possibly represent atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.
Please note that a left hilar mass cannot be excluded and a CT chest with IV contrast can be otained for further evaluation.
Small right pleural effusion.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with mediastinal shift towards the right.
Atelectasis of the left lung with only minimal aeration of the left upper lung zone.
No evidence of underlying mass lesion.
Left atrial enlargement.
[**2126-5-5**] Thoracentesis Fluid NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Abundant neutrophils, mesothelial cells and histiocytes .
[**2126-5-5**] Chest Xray Moderate volume of left pleural effusion persist after large volume left thoracentesis.
No pneumothorax.
Moderate right pleural effusion is larger.
Mild pulmonary edema may be present.
Left lower lobe is largely airless and the left lower lobe bronchus opacified which could be due to obstruction or at least retained secretions.
[**2126-5-6**] Chest Xray Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right, is roughly unchanged since [**5-5**], but difficult to compare because of variations in patient position.
Left lower lobe remains collapsed and the lower lobe bronchus is airless, although it should be noted that intervening chest CT showed no mass or endobronchial obstruction.
The lower lobe bronchus could be malacic or otherwise collapsed due to the persistent left pleural effusion and/or chronic atelectasis.
Moderate cardiomegaly improved.
Left perihilar opacification is probably mild residual edema related to recent reexpansion.
Labs on discharge:  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 85375**] is an 87 year old woman with hearing impairment, atrial fibrillation, and large left sided pleural effusion.
She presented with altered mental status, tachycardia, and fevers.
Fevers: Patient was febrile to 103 in ED but remained afebrile througout the rest of her hospitalization.
Her U/A looked positive initially, but urine cultures had no growth.
Pulmonary infection thought the most likely process given possible consolidation/collapsed lung on CT scan.
Altered mental status: CT of the head showed no clear evidence of hemorrhage.
Pleural Effusion: Patient presented with a large pleural effusion.
She had a history of a prior pleural effusion in [**2121**].
Thoracentesis performed on [**2126-5-5**] and revealed transudative effusion consistent with CHF.
Atrial fibrillation: Upon presentation patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR.
If bradycardia becomes a problem would recommend decreasing Metoprolol to q8 hours.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) dose PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Haloperidol 0.5 mg IV Q6H:PRN agitation   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] of needham10  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
You were diagnosed with a pneumonia and received IV antibiotics.
