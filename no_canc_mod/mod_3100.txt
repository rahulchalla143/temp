Admission Date:  [**2146-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-5-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Lasix / Diltiazem / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: respiratory failure bradycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation, extubation Bronchoscopy, with Y-stent placement  History of Present Illness: This is an 83 yo female with a past medical history of COPD, HTN, CHF who p/w resp distress from home.
She was discharged yesterday from the hospital during which she was treated for hypertensive urgency in the setting of dyspnea and anxiety.
She responded promptly to SL nitroglycerin and BiPap and experienced no further dyspnea and was discharged to home on [**6-8**].
She was intubated for resp distress in the field and was given atropine for HR in 30s (unclear if for hypotension).
In the ED, she received glucagon, versed, levoflox, solumedrol, calcium and received fluid for an elevated lactate.
A CXR revealed interstitial edema.
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] was consulted but did not feel that her respiratory failure was CHF related.
Asthma/COPD -  Recently admitted for a flare on [**2146-3-29**] and treated with nebulizers, steroids, and a course of azithromycin.
Recommended a Cardiology consult at this time for what he believed to be significant diastolic dysfunction secondary to long-standing hypertension.
Paralyzed left hemidiaphragm s/p pericardial window procedure 3.
Severe hypertension with diastolic dysfunction - Per PCP notes typically controlled in the 160's unless patient experiences an asthma flare when it shoots to 170's-180's.
Patient is poorly compliant and most recently has not been taking her antihypertensives due to her ill son-in-law, unable to pick up her meds from the pharmacy.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
Chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine around 1.4).
Polymyalgia rheumatica.
Trigeminal neuralgia - reportedly seen by Optometry [**2146-4-26**] and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Last Name (STitle) 878**].
Iron-deficient anemia 10.
Gastritis  Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] is a widow of many years and a mother of three.
Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] would rather watch television, socializing with friends infrequently.
No bleeding or clotting disorders.
Mom with ?MI  Physical Exam: VS: T 96.8 R BP 114/47 HR 40 R 14 Sat 100% on A/C 400x14 FiO2 0.4 Peep 5 GEN: NAD, comfortable on vent HEENT: AT, NC, PERRLA, EOMI, no conjuctival injection, anicteric, OP clear, MM dry, Neck supple, no LAD, no JVD.
CV: Bradycardic, distant heart sounds, no m/r/g PULM: CTAB, no w/r/r, decrease breath sounds at left base ABD: soft, NT, ND, + BS.
Not responding to pain at this time.
Interstitial edema and right basilar atelectasis.
Large ovoid mass at the left lung base obscuring the diaphragm.
Diagnostic considerations include a lung mass, fluid-filled hiatal hernia or possible Bochdalek hernia.
EKG: Underlying rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation or slow junctional bradycardia, although there appear to be at least two sinus beats.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Ventricular premature beat.
Compared to tracing #2 atrial fibrillation and ventricular premature beat are new.
[**2146-6-19**] CXR: Mild failure probably present, persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
[**2146-6-21**] Video Swallow: No aspiration or penetration identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 83F with asthma, hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction who presented with sudden onset shortness of breath at home hours after discharge from hospital found to be in a junctional bradycardia and hypertensive.
# Respiratory Failure: Secondary to acute exacerbation of COPD/asthma as well as acute on chronic diastolic CHF.
She has a long history of COPD exacerbations and acute diastolic heart failure associated with refractory hypertension.
Chest film upon admit showed mild interstitial edema, and an elevated left hemidiaphragm, consistent with her history of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis.
Any insult to her respiratory status is obviously not tolerated well, given this neuromuscular deficit and underlying obstructive disease.
The patient was found to be bradycardic, hypertensive and in respiratory distress, most likely because increased diastolic filling times were not sufficient to maintain adequate forward flow with subsequent adrenergic response.
There was no evidence of pulmonary infection.
Her presentation was not consistent with ARDS and her initial ABG on the ventilator shows mild compensated hypercapnea without hypoxia.
However, she then became agitated and was given ativan.
# Junctional Bradycardia: The patient was initially in a junctional rhythm without antegrade or retrograde P waves, implying no AV nodal conduction.
The most likely etiology of this rhythm was recieving her doses of verapamil during the day in the hospital and then taking verapamil and a dose of her diltiazem in error after arriving at home (a medication she was supposed to stop).
She received the appropriate treatment for CCB toxicity regardless, including calcium gluconate and glucagon in the ED.
The patient has been in sinus rhythm, and is being discharged off all nodal agents (no CCB or BB).
# Hypertensive urgency: Patient has long history of refractory hypertension and was initially 200 systolic when EMS arrived.
# Diastolic heart failure, acute on chronic: CHF was felt to be contributing to her has mild interstitial edema and ultimately her respiratory failure on her 2nd ICU course.
However, since hyponatremia corrected when diuril was stopped, and since pt had been on Tegretol for some time prior for trigeminal neuralgia, Tegretol was resumed prior to discharge.
# Leukocytosis: Mild leukocytosis on admission, with pt on steroids.
No other evidence of active infection found.
# Elevated troponin: Mild troponin elevated which has been chronic over the last several months and the last several admissions.
Likely related to CHF and renal failure.
No evidence of ACS.
No BB (both due to COPD and with junctional rhythm as described above).
# Anemia: Known iron deficiency.
Hct stable near her baseline (trended down slightly over the course of the hospitalization, likely due to acute illness and blood draws).
# Trigeminal Neuralgia:  Initially held Tegretol given concern for hyponatremia (see above), but this was resumed prior to discharge.
# Urinary dysfunction:  Continue detrol.
# Ear discomfort: No evidence of infection on exam, but dry, hard cerumen present in canal.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
