Her course was complicated by graft versus host disease of the skin and lungs, hypertension and numerous steroid-related complications such as diabetes, steroid myopathy, and increased peripheral edema.

She [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] right heart catheterization on [**2126-12-6**] that showed pulmonary hypertension (systolic BP 45, diastolic BP 20, mean BP 28).
Her diuresis was discontinued on [**1-8**] because of development of hypotension occuring in the setting of a urinary tract infection.
Subsequently, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension (see below) where sildenafil was d/c'd as the patient was unlikely benefiting from it in the setting of relatively mild to moderate pulmonary HTN and overall systemic hypotension.
UTI: She developed a urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas on [**12-15**] and was treated with a two week course of levofloxacin then ciprofloxacin.
A repeat urine culture was obtained for followup on [**1-2**] although she was afebrile and had no urinary complaints.
She subsequently developed a fever to 101.3 on [**1-7**] and was started on cefepime, with addition of vancomycin and flagyl on [**1-8**].
Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension and tachycardia (see below), she was continued on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
After 24 hours in the ICU, the patient was on 3 pressors with the differential diagnosis including septic vs. cardiogenic shock.
Meropenem was added as for double gram-negative and Psuedomonas coverage.
Hypotension and tachycardia: She developed hypotension to the 70's sytolic on [**1-8**] which responded initially to fluid boluses.
She developed tachycardia to the 120's on [**1-9**] with a new RBBB.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was given adenosine 6 mg X 2 with conversion to sinus tachycaria after the second dose of adenosine.
However, she went back into a wide complex tachycardia with a RBBB pattern soon thereafter.
The cardiology team evaluated her and felt that this rhythm was most likely an SVT with rate related aberancy; however the following day, after reviewing the EKG strips with the EP attending, the patient was determined to have a fasicular ventricular tachycardia in the setting of no known prior CAD or ischemic scar.
The following day, a dose of verapimil was tried given concern for possibly worsening cardiogenic shock (however the patient's extremities remained warm to palpation, which suggested likely septic shock) with conversion back to sinus tachycardia.
C. diff colitis: She experienced loose stools after admission and a stool sample was positive for C. diff toxin on [**12-8**]; she was subsequently treated with a 14 day course of flagyl.
This was restarted on [**1-8**] as noted above in the context of recurrent fever and increased stooling.
Her anticoagulation was discontinued in the setting of heme positive stools and widely varying INR (thought likely to be due to interactions with her many medications).
A repeat ultrasound of the upper extremity showed no evidence of persistent thrombus therefore she was not continued on further anticoagulation.
Elevated LFTs: Her transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were moderately elevated and thought to be secondary to GVHD of the liver after review of her medication list and right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no other clear causes of these findings.
Her alkaline phosphatase elevation was probably due at least in part to her bony disease as the bone specific fraction was elevated as well.
Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 1.3 at admission peaking at 1.9.
She was thought to be intravascularly dry with prerenal failure.
Pulmonary hypertension: Ms. [**Known lastname 28331**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] right heart catheterization on [**12-7**] to assess whether pulmonary hypertension might be contributing to her significant edema.
Heme positive stools: As noted above, she had heme positive stools in the setting of anticoagulation with IV heparin and warfarin and recent C. difficile colitis infectoin.
In addition, she had a prior history of gastritis on endoscopy and was receiving steroids for her GVHD.
Hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency: The patient's PTH was rechecked as the differential for her bone changes noted on plain films included osteitis fibrosa.
She was evaluated by the endocrinology consult service who felt that her hyperparathyroidism was likely secondary, perhaps due to renal failure or steroid use.
Pulmonary osteoarthropathy: She complained of diffuse body pains and aches.
Imaging of her extremities was notable for diffuse periosteal reaction.
The endocrinology service reviewed the films and felt the history and imaging were most consistent with pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
Her pain was treated with oral dilaudid as needed for pain control.
