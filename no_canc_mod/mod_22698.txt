sternum stable incision-CDI Abdm soft, NT midline incision w/VAC-clean margins.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION: Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal, anterior and anterolateral wall hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-5-10**], the focal wall motion abnormality now includes the anterolateral wall and the mitral bioprothesis is new.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2134-6-10**] 10:44 AM CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Reason: assess for infiltrates [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old man s/p avr/cabg explor lap REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for infiltrates HISTORY: Status post cardiac surgery.
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**6-7**], the pulmonary vessels are somewhat less distinct, raising the possibility of increasing pulmonary venous pressure.
Blunting of the costophrenic angles are again consistent with pleural fluid.
The hemidiaphragms again are not well seen, consistent with some atelectatic changes at the bases.
IMPRESSION: Little change except possibly for some increasing vascular congestion.
MODERATE GROWTH.
ESCHERICHIA COLI.
OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  Upon opening the abdomen using a diagnostic laparoscopy, we identified normal small bowel and gangrenous changes of the cecum with near perforation.
The cecum had gangrenous changes.
In doing this, we were easily able to identify gangrenous changes in the gallbladder as well.
As we traversed the hepatic flexure and identified the transverse colon, we identified multiple patchy areas in the transverse colon as well as in the splenic flexure.
The sigmoid colon and distal descending colon were unremarkable.
We identified the cystic artery and duct which were individually ligated and divided.
A small circular incision just below the umbilicus over the rectus sheath was made.
We irrigated the abdomen with crystalloid solution.
Once we had satisfactory control of all bleeding and hemostasis was adequate, we then identified the stomach and placed two 2-0 silk pursestring sutures in the fundus of the stomach.
A small gastrotomy was made.
Therapeutic bronchoscopy.
He developed respiratory failure postoperatively and the thoracic service was consulted for placement of a tracheostomy.
There were some thick secretions from the central airways that were suctioned free.
We then gently hyperextended the neck and prepped and draped the anterior neck and chest in the usual sterile fashion.
We made a 3-cm collar incision one fingerbreadth above the sternal notch.
The cricoid cartilage was identified and elevated with a hook.
We made a  transverse tracheotomy incision between the second and third tracheal ring.
He was seen by dermatology and started on bactroban for his facial lesion.
On [**5-12**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a CABG x 3 and Mitral valve replacement.
He was confused and was started on haldol.
He remained in the ICU for pulmonary toilet.
He was started on amiodarone and then digoxin and heparin and seen by electrophysiology for atrial fibrillation.
Bedside swallow evaluation showed aspiration and he remained NPO.
On [**5-19**] he was found to be in respiratory distress, as well as bradycardic and hypotensive and he was reintubated.
Bronchoscopy after intubation showed large amounts of secretions.
He was cardioverted successfully for atrial fibrillation with hypotension.
He continued to be acidotic and underwent abdominal CT scan which showed ischemic bowel.
HIT antibody and SRA sent for thrombocytopenia were negative.
He was started on fluconazole for yeast in urine and sputum.
He was positive for cdiff and was started on flagyl and PO vanco.
The superior aspect of his abdominal wound opened and a VAC dressing was placed by the general surgery team.
