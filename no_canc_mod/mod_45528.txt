At the level of diaphragm, there is an intramural hematoma, also noting multilevel penetrating ulcers.
There is a near occlusion of the left common iliac artery just distal to the origin.
The right external iliac artery had a proximal mild aneurysmal dilation of 1.2 cm.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 81-year-old male transferred from an outside hospital with large complicated thoracoabdominal aneurysm.
The patient was determined to be a poor surgical candidate.
The patient subsequently became suddenly hypotensive and experienced respiratory distress.
The patient was intubated, and aggressive resuscitation measures were initiated with heavy fluid anatropes and chest compression.
An electrocardiogram revealed precordial lead ST depressions, and a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram revealed extremely depressed left ventricular function.
The etiology of the patient's hypotension was felt likely to be cardiogenic.
