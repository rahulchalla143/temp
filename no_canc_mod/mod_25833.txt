After several days his WBC count rose to 21k and repeat imaging demonstrating new RLL aspiration pneumonia.
He had a repeat CT [**7-15**] which showed slightly decreased fluid in the LUL bulla.
In the ED it was thought he had a COPD flare vs. PNA.
He was not given further abx or steroids, but was given a combivent neb.
He was also given ativan, after which time he became somnolent but in the ED was recorded as "resting comfortably".

1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Very elevated PCO2 initially, likely acute on chronic from somnolence [**2-15**] ativan, nonrebreather O2 in ED, as he is a CO2 retainer.
Goal O2 sats were in low 90%s, PCO2 50-60 to help drive down alveolar ventilation needed for extubation.
Likely had anaerobes which are not well grown from routine suptum culture.
5) UE edema: Improved but presumed to be secondary to aggressive fluid recuscitation.
