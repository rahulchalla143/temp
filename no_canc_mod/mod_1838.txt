Admission Date:  [**2133-3-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2133-4-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2072-12-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old man with CAD, PVD who had difficulty speaking after left carotid endarterectomy in [**2133-2-16**].
The patient has had bilateral carotid stenosis.
On [**2-21**] while he was sitting in a chair he developed sudden onset of right arm and leg numbness, followed by right arm and leg weakness.
He also had difficulty speaking.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] and underwent a left carotid endarterectomy on [**2-26**] and afterwards began having severe left sided headache behind his left eye that lasted for hours and was constant.
Nevertheless, he visited [**Hospital3 **] for continued headaches and nausea and vomiting.
During one of those visits he had a contortion of his right face and bilateral arm jerking and was started on Dilantin with presumptive diagnosis of seizures.
On [**3-13**] he again presented with persistent headaches, confusion and inability to talk.
He had difficulty getting his words out.
He had a head CT at [**Hospital3 **] which showed a linear hyperintense region in the left central temporal lobe but also other lesions in the left posterior parietal lobes.
MRI of his head showed left MCA/ACA and left MCA/PCA watershed strokes with acute and subacute hemorrhage conversions.
It was thought at that time that he had extended his watershed infarcts after carotid endarterectomy leading to a carotid hyperperfusion syndrome.
On Thursday, [**2133-3-26**], patient's wife noticed erythema on patient's face.
On [**3-27**] the visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) 8706**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11282**] of a rash on his arms as well.
2) CVA in [**2133-2-16**].
3) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7) History of amaurosis fugax.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Skin red maculopapular blanching erythema on face, torso and extremities, sparing the soles.
Bilateral lower extremity petechiae, no significant oral lesions noted.
The patient had worsening rash throughout his torso with lip swelling and tongue swelling.
The patient did not experience any respiratory difficulties throughout the course of his stay on the [**Company 191**] service.
Their thought was that the patient's symptoms were secondary to his hypersensitivity to Dilantin.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit overnight for observation given risk of respiratory distress.
Skin biopsy was also consistent with hypersensitivity reaction.
Over the course of patient's stay in the hospital, patient's rash started to improve with decreasing erythema and edema.
They recommended stopping all anti-epileptic medications since they thought that his symptoms were likely secondary to carotid reperfusion syndrome and anti-seizure medications are not necessarily beneficial under these circumstances.
GI:  Patient's LFTs were slightly elevated during his admission.
The patient's Lipitor was held due to increased LFTs.
His increased LFTs were likely secondary to Dilantin.
