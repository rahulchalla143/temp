Today he was coughing for several hours and at ~ 5 pm he was found vomiting, coughing and aspirating emesis.
His abdomen appeared distended so abd/pelvis CT was done.
It showed evidence of bowel obstruction.
Additionally CXR was done and showed a multifocal pneumonia.
CT c-spine did not show an acute fracture.
Past Medical History: Multiple sclerosis neurogenic bladder UTIs anxiety hypercholesterolemia  Social History: Per family he does not drink, smoke or do drugs.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T 100.2  HR 130  BP 110/63  RR 33 O2 sat 99% PCV:  FiO2 0.8  PEEP 15  Inspiratory pressure 28   RR 24 Gen: intubated, sedated male in NAD HEENT: intubated, anicteric sclera Neck: supple, RIJ in place Cardio: tachy with regular rhythms Pulm: CTA b/l ant Abd: soft, distended, hypoactive BS, NT Ext: trace peripheral edema, 2+ DP pulses Neuro: sedated, opens eyes to voice, does not respond to commands Pupils equal, round, slightly reactive to light   Pertinent Results: EKG: appears to be sinus tachycardia vs. aflutter at a rate of 153 ST, q waves in 2, 3 <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V2-v3 .
CT head [**1-14**]:  No acute intracranial pathology including no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Mild-to-moderate amount of chronic periventricular microvascular ischemic changes with mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci.
Paranasal sinuses show a minimal amount of mucosal thickening in the medial left maxillary sinus and ethmoid air cells.
CXR [**1-14**]:  Bilateral asymmetric opacities representing either multifocal pneumonia vs asymmetric pulmonary edema with infection more likely given lack of widening of the vascular pedicle.
Abd/pelvis CT [**1-14**]: Bilateral parenchymal consolidations in both lower lobes posteriorly, and there are multiple nodular densities in the right middle lobe.
The abdomen contains multiple dilated small bowel loops with air-fluid levels and a transition point in the right lower quadrant, consistent with small bowel obstruction.
There is no ascites or free intra-abdominal air.
No obvious fractures or malalignment.
RUQ U/S [**2130-1-20**]: No evidence for gallstones.
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] signs of acute cholecystitis.
Advance diet to ground solids & thin liquids by single     cup sip only, NO STRAWS!!
Remind him to eat & drink SLOWLY and     C.  No Talking w/food/liquid in his mouth     D.  Single cup sips of thin liquid, NO STRAWS     E.  Hold liquid in mouth & keep head level         (don't look up or throw head back when drinking)     F.  Alternate between bites and sips  4.
If he has any signs of coughing or choking     on ground solids, downgrade to Pureed foods.
Repeat the videoswallow if his mental status or medical     status worsens to be sure this diet is still safe  PROGNOSIS: Prognosis for safe swallowing without aspiration is good if he is supervised to take single sips of liquid and alternate between bites and sips.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen  ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears  structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 57 yo male with h/o MS who presents with hypoxia, hypotension, neutropenia, fevers, ileus with likely PNA and UTI, intubated for respiratory failure & sepsis.
# pulmonary: On arrival to the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 70884**] was hypoxic, hypotensive, neutropenic, febrile and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Source of his respiratory failure was likely aspiration in the setting of sepsis.
He was initially treated with treated with meropenem x 7 days given concern for aspiration pneumonia in this man who is chronic resident of an extended care facility.
Following extubation, he continued to have copious secretions with diminished gag, requiring vigorous chest PT.
On [**1-23**], CXR appeared markedly worsened consolidation representing aspiration.
Patient has weak gag and is not completely clearing copious secretions.
Due to leukocytosis, ?
consolidation, pt was started on Zosyn as empiric therapy for hospital acquired vs recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
A CTA was obtained [**2-9**] persistent tachycardia and oxygen requirement (2-3L), which revealed bilateral PE.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] his pneumonia, pt will complete a 14 day course of zosyn and vancomycin (via PICC) for hospital acquired pneumonia (day 1 [**2131-1-23**], last day [**2131-2-5**]).
# altered mental status: pt with h/o multiple sclerosis.
Of note, per family, patient's MS has been known to flare in the setting of infection and has caused paralysis.
While in the ICU, pt developed acute onset of weakeness in hiw upper extremities, whichw as felt [**2-9**] to his MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] demonstrated marked improvement over the course of his stay on the medical floor, and had [**4-12**] bilateral strength of biceps, triceps, and delts at the time of discharge.
# hypotension/sepsis:  Sources of infection considered included pneumonia (aspiration) and UTI.
Hypotension could also be [**2-9**] fluid losses in the setting of pancreatitis, cardiac causes such as AMI or inadequate CO in the setting of rapid heart rate.
Pt had a history of urosepsis, with MRSA and multidrug resistant proteus.
In the setting of profound septic shock, he was initially started on Meropenem & Linezolid given concern for aspiration pna and h/o VRE in urine.
Pt subsequently started treatment for a hospital acquired pneumonia on [**1-23**] given +BAL for GPCs, worsening sputum producing, and new leukocytosis.
# cardiac: no cardiac history, pt denies chest pain or shortness of breath upon admission to the medical service.
mild elevation in trop during ICU admission felt [**2-9**] demand in setting of hypotension and sepsis.
trop/ck trending down at time of transfer to medical floor, repeat cardiac enzymes unremarkable.
regarding rythym, pt with increased ventricular ectopy starting [**1-29**], and noted to have transient self-limited episodes of bradycardia to the 30's.
TTE performed which was unremarkable, sinus tachycardia was attributed to pt's PEs, and EP consult was obtained to evaluate bradycardia, which were felt to be vagal (gradual slowing observed on telemetry), and not requiring intervention as they were asymptomatic.
regarding pump function, pt initially frankly volume overloaded, however he autodiuresed without intervention, and was felt to be euvolemic upon discharge.
# HTN: pt without history of HTN, but intermittently noted to have elevated SBPs (150's) after extubation, possibly related to mobilization of fluid.
Upon arrival to the medical floor, his SBPs were well controlled without initiation of antihypertensive meds.
# Ileus vs SBO: On admission, CT Abd showed large amt of stool in colon.
Pt arrived on the medical service without abdominal complants, and +BM, with normoactive bowel sounds.
pt with h/o recurrent urosepsis, s/p course of cefepime which would have covered enterococcus UTI, surveillance culture ngtd.
Pt was aggressively autodiuresing s/p CTA, likely mobilizing fluid given during initial resuscitation, and on [**1-31**] was felt to be euvolemic.
He was encouraged to remain well hydrated upon discharge and to match his urinary losses with oral hydration.
# FEN:  Given pt's acute presentation s/p aspiration event, there was considerable concern regarding his ability to eat unsupervised upon discharge.
pt evaluated by the speech & swallow service who recommended: "ground solids & thin liquids diet by single cup sip only, NO STRAWS!!
No Mixed consistencies like cold cereal w/milk or chicken soup w/liquid and solids together.
Single cup sips of thin liquid, NO STRAWS.
Hold liquid in mouth & keep head level (don't look up or throw head back when drinking) Alternate between bites and sips.
If he has any signs of coughing or choking on ground solids, downgrade to Pureed foods.
