Brief Hospital Course: # Peritonitis.
She showed occasional signs of confusion throughout the day (difficulty reciting months of the year backward, slow response time), and had continued abdominal pain worse with palpation but was otherwise in NAD.
Overnight that evening, she developed a new oxygen requirement and chest pain with possible EKG changes.
She became hypotensive to 70s/40s and felt lightheaded.
With concern for pneuomonia, given a possible new right middle lobe opacity, she was started on IV ceftazadine and IV flagyl.
It was felt she had a significant infection, but unfortunately, no organism was identified.
Approximately, four days after completion of antibiotics, patient developed a wbc with left shift to 14,000.
Patient remained afebrile and was clinically without a focus of infection.
Since patient was not showing any signs of pneumonia and white count normalized the following day, she was not continued on antibiotics.
Patient did not show any further signs of infection and it was felt that she did not need any antibiotic treatment.
ID recommended repeat imaging in [**12-24**] weeks if the patient's hip complaints persist.

She was noted to have hypovolemic hypnotremia which improved with PD.
Sevelemer was up titrated to 3200 mg TID due to increased phosphorus.
# CAD: H/o IMI, CHF with EF 35% ([**2131**]).
EKG changes in setting of hypotension likely demand ischemia.
Pt without CP or shortness of breath.
New Echo showing depressed EF from prior and worsening MR.
# Mitral regurgitation: The patient had severe mitral regurgitation on an Echo from [**12-10**].
# Normocytic Anemia: HCT remained stable.

Orthopedics were consulted and felt patient did not have a septic joint.
# Depression and anxiety: She was continued on citalopram.
# Dysuria: The patient complained of dysuria on the last day of her hospitalization.

If the patient has further complaints of dysuria, it might warrant an outpatient workup.
# Vaginal bleeding: The patient stated on the last day of her hospitalization that she had vaginal bleeding in low amounts x 2 weeks.
