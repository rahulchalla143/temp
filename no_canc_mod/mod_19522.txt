Admission Date:  [**2146-6-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-6-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-10-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim DS / Levaquin / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation and mechanical ventilation with subsequent extubation  Bronchoscopy Replacement of 14F nephrostomy cath via loop ileostomy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old man with ESRD who has not been feeling well over the last couple of weeks.
Patient became pre-syncopal.
A CXR showed bilateral infiltrates.
EKG showed ST depression in lateral leads.
He received a chest CTA which showed prominent mucous plugging, complete blockage of R mainstem, collapse of RLL.
In the ED he was tachypneic, working to breathe, and denied any chest pain.
He was not short of breath and not moving any air on the right.
This was seen by cardiology and felt possibly related to demand and there would be no acute intervention.

Physical Exam: Discharge physical exam: Vitals: T 97.5 BP 134/61 (134-149/61-62) HR 88 RR 20 O2 Sat 97% on 2L via NC Weight 74.2kg General: Patient sitting in bed during HD session with HOB elevated in NAD HEENT: EOMI.
2/6 systolic murmur appreciated throught the precordium Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, anteriorly.
No crackles or wheezes appreciated.
Ext: No pitting edema bilaterally.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2146-6-3**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):  Cytology: Bronchial lavage:  	  	NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Imaging: Head CT: FINDINGS:  Presence of previous intravenous contrast slightly limits the evaluation for small intracranial hemorrhage but there is no large acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or territorial infarction.
The sulci are mildly prominent, consistent with age-related atrophy.
No acute skeletal abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.4 cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-7-6**], mild aortic stenosis, moderate left ventricular contractile dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and significant right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis are now present.

His fever curve trended down.
CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia, so he was run 3 L negative on dialysis with improvement in his vent settings.
Systolic Dysfunction: Patient's troponins were elevated on admission with TTE showing new inferoposterior hypokinesis, consistent with acute coronary syndrome at some point in the last several weeks.
ACE-I was initially held given low blood pressures.
Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had very brief runs of atrial fibrillation during dialysis the morning after admission.
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ Cardiology Floor course: # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure with evidence of focal hypokinesis: TTE showing EF of 35% with evidence of inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis, which is concerning for a missed coronary event.
Thought to be likely secondary to pulmonary edema and inability to clear secretions with mucus plugging leading to lobar collapse.
Chest PT and acapella were done during the patient's floor stay for chronic bronchiectasis and should be continued on an outpatient basis.
# Hypertension: Well-controlled, requiring no anyti-hypertensives as an inpatient.
Patient was afebrile with no localizing symptoms concerning for infection.
Leukocytosis was attributed to stress reaction in the setting of recent procedure.
# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Patient has been in sinus rhythm since ICU admission.
No prior history of Atrial fibrillation.
CHADS-2 score of 4, placing patient at elevated risk for stroke.
# Nephrostomy through kidney via patient's ileal conduit: Interventional radiology replaced replacement of 14-French nephrostomy cath via loop ileostomy.
# End Stage Renal Disease on HD: Patient on Tues/Thurs/Sat HD, which was continued through his cardiology floor course.
Calcium acetate was increased to 1000mg TID per renal recommendations in light of elevated phosphorous.
--Trend phosphorous with labs at hemodialysis and consider decreasing calcium acetate if phosphorous is lower.
5. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for Itching.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Cape & Islands  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory failure Mucous plugging Acute on chronic systolic heart failure  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: End-stage renal disease Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were hospitalized for respiratory failure secondary to mucous plugs in your lungs and excess volume in your lungs.
During your hosptialization, you were found to have depressed pumping function of your heart, called systolic heart failure, concerning for a missed heart attack.
You continued to have dialysis during this hospital admission.
Note the following medication changes: --*ADDED* Aspirin 81mg daily --*ADDED* Atorvastatin 80mg daily --*ADDED* Metoprolol succinate 50mg ONCE daily --*NEW* Sarna lotion 1 application to the back three times daily  Ask your cardiologist whether you start coumadin as an outpatient for your intermittent heart arrhythmia.
