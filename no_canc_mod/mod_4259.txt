An 11-mm nodular opacity overlies the right first anterior rib.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Prominent mediastinal contour and nodular right apical opacity, for which dedicated contrast-enhanced Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
ERCP: Impression: Successful biliary cannulation Stones at the main duct Successful stone extraction with spiral basket.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum  Recommendations: Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 2798**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2799**] with any further questions or concerns.
Please call the on call ERCP fellow at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**] with any immediate concerns such as fever, abdominal pain, bleeding, following your procedure.
Repeat ERCP in 3 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for stent removal and reassement of duct for residual stone or stricture.
CT CHEST: IMPRESSION: A roughly 11-mm wide right upper lobe nodule corresponding to lesion seen on recent chest radiograph should be considered malignant until proved otherwise.
Brief Hospital Course: 61F with history of prior chole c/b stump leak in past now admitted with findings c/w acute cholangitis / 5x7mm CBD stone.
# Cholangitis: Patient presented to OSH with symptoms os fevers, RUQ tenderness and jaundice.
CT scan from OSH demonstrated pneumobilia and a stone in the CBD with intrahepatic ductal dilation.
ERCP demonstrated successful biliary cannulation, stones at the main duct, successful stone extraction with spiral basket, pus exiting the ampulla, and successful placement of 10cm x 10F biliary stent.
Her diet was advanced the following morning to clears, which resulted in increased nausea and abdominal pain.
She then had intermittent abd pain for the next few days.
We suspected mild post ERCP pancreatitis.
After more IVF her pain improved.
Repeat LFTs showed improved T. bili, with mild transaminitis.
# Chest CT Abnormalities: Hilar and right apical abnormalities noted on initial CXR and on repeat PA/Lateral.
CT scan showed prelim read was 11 x 9mm pulmonary nodule in the right apex, also with right apical and basilar lung acarring/atelectasis.
PET/CT can be considered for evaluation of metabolic activity).
Given patient's 50 pack-year history and recent 30 pound unintentional weight loss, this will require close follow-up to rule-out malignancy.
Final read: A roughly 11-mm wide right upper lobe nodule corresponding to lesion seen on recent chest radiograph should be considered malignant until proved otherwise.
No evidence of DIC, fibrinogen was 712.
Likely Vit K def in the setting of poor nutrition.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Cholangitis Pulmonary nodule Fibromyalgia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
As we discussed, you were found to have a lung nodule of uncertain significance, though it might be a cancer.
