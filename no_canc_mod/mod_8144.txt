HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 47-year-old male with a history of cadaveric renal transplant in [**2149**] who was transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Medical Center with pancreatitis on [**5-26**] complaining of abdominal pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end-stage renal disease secondary to hypertension, hepatitis C, gout, HSV, history of motor vehicle accident with right tibia fracture, head injury, exploratory laparotomy and tracheostomy, history of CHF.
Abdominal CT demonstrated diffusely enlarged pancreatitis with infiltration of surrounding fat, renal transplant right iliac fossa.
Head CT demonstrated no evidence of hemorrhage, midline shift or mass effect.
Mild pulmonary edema was noted with possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm with a rate of 80, with possible left ventricular hypertrophy, with late transition.
This demonstrated extrahepatic biliary dilatation without intra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
The patient was status post cholecystectomy, but the degree of biliary dilatation was more than would have been expected for a patient of this age.
Given the presence of pancreatitis, a distal duct calculus or lesion was amongst the possible diagnoses.
No pneumothorax occurred.
The patchy opacity in the right lower lobe was thought to represent atelectasis.
The patient had serial chest x-rays that demonstrated development of vascular engorgement, and perihilar haziness was developing asymmetrical airspace disease within the right lung as well as a lingering right pleural effusion.
The patient experienced intermittent bouts of hypertension up into the 180s with stimulation with heart rate in the 90 to100s with occasional PVCs.
He continued to be treated with Versed and fentanyl drip for DTs and continued on a CIWA scale, ranging from 5 to 12.
The patient was administered Ativan for extreme agitation with a good result.
He was suctioned for moderate amounts of thick tan secretions from the ETT tube and bloody secretions from the supraepiglottis tube.
He experienced acute renal failure, most likely due to third spacing and pancreatitis as well as contrast effect.
On [**2151-5-30**] the patient required rapid sequence intubation with cricoid pressure for respiratory distress.
Chronic nonocclusive neural calcification of the superficial left brachial vein was noted.
On [**5-30**] the patient continued to demonstrate increasing symptoms of DTs.
He was agitated, anxious, and diaphoretic, and tachycardia to 110 despite q.2h.
He remained on a nitro drip for BP control as well as Ativan for DTs and fentanyl drip for pain.
The patient also experienced herpetic lesions on his penis.
Infectious disease followed the patient making recommendations that included sending a swab of the penile lesions for GC and chlamydia.
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg IV was started x1 and then 250 mg IV daily, as well as Flagyl 500 mg IV q.8h.. A nasal aspirate was sent for viral pathogens.
The patient was felt to have community-acquired pneumonia plus or minus aspiration.
He was treated with IV Lasix drip to keep 2 liters negative for fluid overload.
This demonstrated no evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
Psychiatry was consulted for concern for delirium.
He requested pain medication for chronic leg pain.
He was given a minimal amounts of Percocet with decreased complaints of leg pain  The patient continued to improve.
There was no evidence of obstruction.
Ossification in the paraspinal tissues was noted on the left.
A CT of the abdomen was done that demonstrated peripancreatic stranding consistent with pancreatitis.
There was no evidence of pseudocyst or pancreatic calcifications.
as needed for leg pain with 20 tablets being dispensed, Prograf 1 mg p.o.
