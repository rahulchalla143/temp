The patient denied any symptoms of claudication, orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lightheadedness.
The patient does have a history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and he is a former cigar smoker.
Prior to admission, the patient had cardiac catheterization on [**2200-9-3**], given exertional angina and positive stress test.
Cardiac catheterization showed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Specifically, the left main coronary artery had a 50% osteal lesion.
The right coronary artery had a proximal 20% stenosis and it was calcified.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented and in no apparent distress.
CARDIAC:  Examination revealed regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac catheterization performed on [**2200-9-3**] showed three-vessel coronary artery disease with normal systolic function and mild-to-moderate diastolic dysfunction.
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Service for a coronary artery bypass graft.
There were no complications.
In the Intensive Care Unit the patient remained in sinus rhythm with occasional paroxysmal atrial contractions noted.
He had a mild hypoxic episode.
The patient was re-intubated on postoperative day #4 for hypoxia and respiratory failure.
The patient continued to have occasional bursts of atrial fibrillation, but otherwise, remained in sinus rhythm.
The possibility of aspiration versus ARDS was raised.
Echocardiogram was obtained on [**2200-9-7**], which was limited, but did show a small pericardial effusion.
Blood cultures were obtained, which showed no growth.
The patient continued to have low-grade fevers, without clearly identified source.
On postoperative day #11, the patient was noted to have increased secretions.
He consequently underwent a bedside bronchoscopy, which showed minimal secretions present.

Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting times two.
