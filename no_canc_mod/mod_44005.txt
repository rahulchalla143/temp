He was in his usual state of health until around midnight [**6-11**] when he c/o acute SOB and chest pressure.
Around 6am, he developed substernal chest pressure in the ED, was given 2mg morphine, and subsequently became hypoxic to 90% on a NRB resulting in intubation.

With exercise, a wide comple tachycardia most likely SVT, developed.
MR Hip [**2152-6-23**]: Small right sided hip joint effusion with associated severe degenerative changes, unchanged when compared to [**2152-6-5**].
Fluid near the left hip joint and edema of the adjacent muscle groups and posterior lateral soft tissues is unchanged.
CT Abdomen [**2152-6-23**]: 1) Biliary ductal dilatation status post stenting.
2) Failure of left hip prosthesis with superolateral distraction.
Severe degenerative changes of the right hip.
3) No abscess or diverticulitis identified.
EKG [**2152-6-17**]: Sinus rhythm Left atrial abnormality Left axis deviation - consider prior inferior myocardial infarction and left anterior fascicular block but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult Low limb leads voltage - is nonspecific QS configuration in leads V1 and V2 - could be in part - ?
positional but consider also prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2152-6-13**], sinus bradycardia absent and left axis deviation now seen  Chest AP Film [**2152-6-11**]: Significant increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis of the lower lobes compared to prior film.
Brief Hospital Course: 72M [**Hospital3 2558**] resident admitted for 1 day history of acute shortness of breath/hypoxia due to pneumonia requring 24hrs of intubation.
His ICU course was notable for transient hypotension immediately after intubation requiring neosynephrine for a few hours, negative cardiac enzymes x 3, successful extubation [**6-12**], a mild transaminitis likely d/t poor perfusion/hypotension, a failed swallow evaluation [**6-13**], and new-onset asymptomatic bradycardia since [**6-13**] AM.
His sputum culture came back with moderate MRSA and sparse [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] as a result, he was started on a 14 day course of IV Vancomycin via PICC and PO Levaquin.
So his course by problems:  #MRSA Pneumonia - initially intubated x 24hrs for hypoxic respiratory failure and airway protection.
The patient remained afebrile but had gradual elevation of his WBCC and an accompanying bandemia beginning on [**6-18**].
Further w/u for source had been negative, including blood cx's, cxr, ua, ct abd/pelvis to r/o abscess, and MRI to evaluate for septic joint.
However on [**6-23**] a urine culture grew out yeast species.
Despite a negative UA, the patient was treated with a 5d course of fluconazole as it was felt that this was a possible of his elevated WBCC.
The other most likely etiology is intermittent biliary obstruction, as discussed below.
#Cholecystitis- in [**4-28**] pt was admitted with ascending cholangitis (was not manifesting any abdominal pain symptoms) and underwent ERCP stenting of his CBD.
#Bradycardia - During the first 48hrs of admission, telemetry revealed intermittent bradycardia to 30s-40s, but patient remained entirely asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
#Intermittent Chest Pain - has been occurring for past few weeks per patient, but no evidence of EKG changes and was ruled out by CE x 3 initially.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed some NSVT during the dobutamine infusion (not uncommon per cardiology), yet his ECHO failed to reveal any ischemic wall motion abnormalities.
Thus, it was thought that he probably does not have active coronary disease.
#Chronic Pain Issues ??????
#L Hip Dislocation/R Hip DJD - patient has had a long, complicated course with h/o a L septic hip prosthesis that was removed and replaced at the [**Hospital1 756**] [**2-27**] after 6 weeks of IV antibiotics.
An MRI was obtained of both hips which did not reveal any abscesses or anything suggestive of osteomyelitis.
After an infectious etiology was excluded, the patient was restarted on his outpatient anti-diarrheals (in discussion with his outpt GI doc, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] with dramatic improvement.
#Proph - the patient was placed on adequate DVT and GI prophylaxis with fall and MRSA precautions  #Dispo - PT was consulted, and given all his comorbidities and clinical condition, the patient was deemed most suitable for a skilled nursing facility.
Mirtazapine 15 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for depression and appetite.
