Skin: No lesions, ecchymoses over abdomen consistent with injection sites.
Intra-atrial conduction defect.
Left ventricular hypertrophy is probably present.
Since the previous tracing of [**2113-10-25**] sinus tachycardia is now present.
[**2113-10-27**] Chest X-ray: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in radiographic position of the endotracheal tube.
In unchanged manner, a small left-sided pleural effusion and a small left-sided retrocardiac atelectasis is seen.
The right lung has normal volume, but the transparency of the perihilar lung parenchyma has slightly decreased.
No right-sided pleural effusion.
Degenerative changes of the right shoulder.
There is a newly inserted central venous access line over the right internal jugular vein.
The extent of the left-sided pleural effusion has slightly increased.
There is moderate retrocardiac atelectasis.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
[**2113-10-30**] Chest X-ray: FINDINGS: The right IJ line has its tip projecting 1 cm distally of the carina over the right main bronchus.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2113-10-30**] Chest X-ray: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-22**] through [**10-30**], 3:54 a.m.: Mild edema has developed in the right lower lung.
Left lower lobe is chronically collapsed, small left pleural effusion unchanged.
Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior CVA who presents from her nursing home with respiratory distress, intubated in the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia, hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing.
#) Respiratory failure: It was suspected that the patient's respiratory failure was multifactorial.
She was hypercarbic in the emergency room, and may have tired out in the setting of volume overloaded state, with possible flash pulmonary edema.
Given that her extremities were cool and her lactate was elevated, sepsis from a hospital-acquired pneumonia was also a consideration in the setting of her recent admissions and intubations/extubations.
She was given 100 mg of IV lasix in the emergency room and put out over 600 cc, but then developed hypotension limiting further diuresis.
She also has marked pulmonary hypertension which could also have contributed, and was at risk for aspiration given prior CVA.
Patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible hospital acquired pneumonia, with vancomycin given her history of MRSA in sputum, and zosyn.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction; she had mildly elevated troponin values (0.05-0.08) which were within her baseline and felt to be related to her renal insufficiency.
After the patient's blood pressure stabalized based on arterial line tracings, diuresis was initiated with a lasix drip for her congestive heart failure.
Her extremities remained intermittently cool, and there was concern for cardiogenic shock and peripheral vasoconstriction.
#) Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure: Based on the patient's clinical exam, imaging, and laboratories (BNP >70,000), it was felt that an exacerbation of the patient's congestive heart failure contributed the decompensation in her respiratory status.
Her beta-blocker was held in the setting of hypotension and acute exacerbation.
#) Coronary artery disease: Patient was ruled out for an acute myocardial infarction.
Her CK remained flat, and her troponins were stable, mildly elevated in the setting of renal insufficiency.
She was not listed as taking coumadin or other anticoagulation agents, hoewver upon review of the records, she has had a mildly elevated INR, PT, and PTT in the past.
It was felt that some degree of coagulpathy was due to poor nutritional status and systemic absorption of subcuteanous heparin.
She had no evidence of bleeding.
She would open her eyes at times and move some of her extremities, however would not respond to any commands.
#) Acute renal failure: Her acute renal failure was suspected to be secondary to total body fluid overload with relatively intravascular depletion and poor forward flow.
Another consideration was ATN in setting of hypotension.
#) Rhythm: Patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation during her hospital stay in the days prior to her expiration.
Heparin drip was discussed, but given her history of stroke and coagulopathy, decision was made to defer initiating anticogulation until further details could be obtained from her family and other providers.
This was felt to be either secondary to diuresis, cardiogenic shock, or indicative of developing sepsis.
Cardiogenic shock was also a consideration.
On the evening of [**2113-10-30**] at about 7:30 PM, patient was noted to have repeated transient episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressure down to the 60's, that would resolve without intervention.
Around the same time, she was noted to have episodes of tachycardia to the 150's that did not correlate with drop in blood pressure, and was mildly tachypneic.
There was concern for mesenteric ischemia in addition to lactate production from ischemic tissue secondary to sepsis or cardiogenic shock.
It was felt that she was too unstable to send off the floor for completion of any additional imaging studies.
Her lactate trended down to 5.4, with improvement in her tachycardia and blood pressure.
There were no neurologic changes to suggest seizures.
She was noted to have an episode of bradycardia and tachypnea.
Dobutamine was initiated to help with any component of cardiogenic shock, as well as vassopressin.
No chest compressions were completed in accordance with the son's (HCP) wishes.
