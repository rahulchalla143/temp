Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
CXR There is opacity in the left mid and lower lung concerning for aspiration or pneumonia with associated pleural effusion.
Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible with a small pleural effusion.

Respiratory Distress: Pt with recent admission with sepsis/PNA followed by an admission for CHF who p/w tachypnea, hypoxia and dense LLL infiltrate.
Pt placed on BiPAP with improvement in sats and decreased distress.
Patient with hypoxia and tachypnea in the setting of metabolic acidosis.
Patient was empirically anticoagulated to treat potential PE while in the ICU, which could not be further evaluated with CTA due to renal failure.
TTE revealed possible volume overload on basis of IVC filling, so trialed lasix 40 mg IV x1 with good output and some improvement in oxygenation.
Pt will be discharged on PO concentrated morphine and sublingual ativan PRN dyspnea or pain.
Renal Failure: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.3 and presents now with PNA and creatinine of 2.3.
Appears clinically dry with low UOP and a tenuous respiratory status.
Given known prostate ca with chronic foley, will leave in place if promotes patient comfort.
# Metastatic Prostate Ca: End stage disease followed at [**Hospital1 3278**] with new indwelling foley.
Pt is now written for PO oral concentrated morphine for pain as per above.
# AFib: Currently in NSR, not anticoagulated per OSH records on amiodarone 200mg daily as outpt.

Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 5-10 mg PO q3-4 hours prn as needed for pain: pain or dyspnea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Major: hypoxia related to nursing home associated pneumonia acute systolic heart failure metastatic prostate cancer afib .
Minor: recent hospitalization for sepsis thought to be related to pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low oxygen levels, respiratory distress and found to have heart failure and pneumonia.
