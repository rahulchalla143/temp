Mr. [**Known lastname 46871**] was initially found unresponsive at the scene with an open left tibia-fibula fracture.
The patient was then flown by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital6 1760**] on route receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 liters of crystalloids.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Albuterol prn  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination demonstrated a heartrate of 60, blood pressure 160/80, respiratory rate, the patient was on an Ambu bag with pulse oximetry being 99 and 100%.
General, the patient was brought with his left leg splinted and wrapped with obvious deformities.
His pupils were 4 mm and unresponsive.
His chest and lungs demonstrated poor breathsounds bilaterally but were clear.
His abdomen was soft and nondistended.
There was no intracranial injury seen on initial computerized axial tomography scan.
There were multiple complex facial lax fractures which included bilateral zygoma fractures, maxillary fractures to the superior gingival line, bilateral mandibular fractures at the angle, blow-out of left maxillary sinus, left temporal bone fracture, bilateral medial and left lateral orbit fracture, bilateral pneumothoraces, there was a right total lung contusion, there was a left tibial plateau and proximal comminuted left tibia fracture which was opened.
There was a nondisplaced left sacral and acetabula fracture.
There was a right open medial plateau fracture and left patellar fracture.
Additionally there were hand lacerations, left humeral instability and ecchymoses.
The Plastic Surgery Service was consulted for facial fractures and lax.
The Orthopedic Service was consulted for extremity fractures which were too unstable for fixation on hospital day #1.
It was felt that he had a combination of Fort I, II facial fractures.
It was felt that he would initially need open reduction and internal fixation of his facial fractures when stabilized.
Once the patient was brought to the Intensive Care Unit the nursing consult assessed the patient in the following manner as far as his neurologic examination.
They were to control intracranial pressures for less than 25, wanting an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for mandibular fractures.
Also in the evening of [**2175-3-21**] the Anesthesia Service was called to change the patient's airway secondary to a significant air leak probably due to a ruptured cuff.
Since Mr. [**Known lastname 46871**] was breathing through the existing endotracheal tube they would like to do a temperature replacement tube without muscle relaxants.
Because of the blood in the airway attempts at using the fiberoptic bronchoscope were unsuccessful.
After that, they reoxygenated the patient with cricoid pressure and manual in-line stabilization.
Following this intubation, auscultation suggested a right lung collapse and pneumothorax with aspiration consolidation.
Vital signs were stable and a post intubation gas was 7.13, 42, 54, 19 and -11, which was probably felt due to the chest contusion and collapse of the lungs.
They felt that his orbital wall fractures did not require immediate intervention.
Their impression was that the patient would need repair of his mandibular fracture when stable, and they would coordinate that procedure with Plastic Surgery.
To review the patient's initial trauma series workup, a body C7 fracture was seen on cervical spine computerized tomography scan.
Over night from [**3-23**] to [**3-24**], the patient continued to have high intracranial pressures with pressures ranging anywhere from 2 to 37.
On [**3-24**], initially the Nutrition Service saw the patient again and felt given his need for multiple operative procedures they would begin total parenteral nutrition for him.
Again estimated blood loss was approximately 50 cc.
From [**3-25**] to [**3-26**], the patient continued to have high intracranial pressures with multiple repeated head computerized tomography scans which were all negative.
On the morning of [**2175-3-26**], the patient experienced a brief episode wherein the intracranial pressure rose to a value of 60 for several minutes.
On [**3-27**], with the patient's right chest tube put out very minimal amounts.
Additionally on [**3-27**], we decided to begin the patient on a pentobarbital coma for his persistently elevated intracranial pressures.
The patient additionally developed diabetes insipidus and a rise in his serum sodium to 170.
On [**2175-3-30**], the patient had an event where the tubing broke.
Because the patient had a functioning left ventricular drain, the Communo was removed on [**2175-3-30**].
On [**2175-4-3**], the patient's white blood cell count was stable and he had been afebrile for a number of days, it was decided to begin withdrawing the patient's antibiotics.
He was tolerating tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition without difficulty.
