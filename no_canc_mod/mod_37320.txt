Admission Date:  [**2126-8-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-8-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-5-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Cephalosporins / Penicillins / Erythromycin Base / Shellfish / Sesame Oil  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 301**] Chief Complaint: chest pain from known hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux, morbid obestity  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Open cholecystectomy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 54-year-old woman who complained of attacks of chest pain from known hiatal hernia.
She presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] having had a number of outside evaluations including endoscopy demonstrating a large hiatal hernia as well as a barium swallow showing a large 58% or greater of her stomach above the diaphragm at risk obviously for gastric volvulus.
She initially planned to undergo a gastric bypass, but elected to have a laparoscopic adjustable band placed instead, as well as a cholecystecomy and repair of hiatal hernia.
Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history includes gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, morbid obesity, type III hiatal hernia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, irritable bowel, back pain with fracture, rotator cuff, chronic fatigue, and fibromyalgia.
Breathing comfortably with decreased breath sounds probably related to thoracic aspect of her hiatal hernia.
Heart is regular with no murmurs.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, no rebound or guarding and infraumbilical scar.
Bibasilar pneumonia and atelectasis.
Pneumoperitoneum, likely related to recent surgical procedure.
[**8-14**] Portable Chest X-Ray - increasing pulmonary vascular congestion  [**8-15**] Portable Chest X-Ray - There is now dense confluent opacity involving much of both hemithoraces, with overall appearance suggestive of combination of pulmonary edema and posteriorly-layering pleural effusions; the heart size and pulmonary vessels are, therefore, difficult to evaluate, and a contribution of pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded.
The tip of the nasogastric tube is not well seen, and a circular gastric band overlies the central aspect of the upper abdomen.
[**8-15**] Portable Chest X-Ray - Severe bibasilar atelectasis persists following decrease in previously large bilateral pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary failure present.
[**8-18**] Portable Chest X-Ray - Lung volumes remain low minimally increased from the recent study.
Bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated as well as small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**8-15**] - Upper GI Study - Patient swallowed barium without difficulty.
Barium passed freely into the stomach without signs of obstruction or extravasation.
Pathology - Hernia Sac: 1.
Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (B,C): Mild fibrosis of gallbladder wall consistent with chronic cholecystitis.
As the patient was intermittently hypotensive with manipulation of the stomach and reduction of the stomach into the abdominal cavity, she was admitted to the surgical ICU post-operatively.
This was discontinued on post-operative day #0 secondary to hypotension, pain then controlled with PCA, normotensive with fluid rescusitation.
An upper GI study on post-operative day #2 demonstrated no leakage.
On post-operative day #6 she was afebrile with stable vital signs, pain was well controlled on oral pain medications and she was tolerating a stage III bariatric diet.
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette [**Hospital1 **]: [**12-11**] Drops Ophthalmic Q2-4H (every 2 to 4 hours) as needed for dry eyes.
