He is being transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] for ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus.
This pregnancy was uncomplicated until 22 and 2/7 weeks gestation when the mother developed preterm labor and had cervical changes.
This infant emerged with some respiratory effort.
Diffuse bruising noted over the lower half of the body.
Respiratory effort was poor air entry in the bases but equal breath sounds with retractions, improved after intubation and surfactant therapy.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
His chest x-ray initially showed some pulmonary interstitial emphysema which has since resolved and has evolved to chronic lung changes.
On examination, he has mild to moderate subcostal retractions.
His breath sounds have some scattered crackles and are equal.
On [**2185-7-29**], he had increasing ventilatory requirements and had an echocardiogram which showed a small, patent ductus arteriosus.
A clinical decompensation on [**2185-8-6**] prompted a repeat echocardiogram which showed a moderate sized patent ductus arteriosus, thus scheduling the ligation.
On examination, he has a grade one to two over six systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
It originates in the left antecubital area and has its tip in the junction of the innominate vein and superior vena cava.
Gastrointestinal:  He has been treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity from day of life one until day of life 11.
He has had some intermittently guaiac positive stools but his KUB's have shown well distributed polygonal bowel loops, no pneumatosis and no dilation.
Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname **] was started on Ampicillin and Gentamycin at the time of admission for sepsis suspicion.
On day of life ten, he presented with a clinical decompensation and was started on Ampicillin and Gentamycin.
He is currently on no antibiotics.
His second head ultrasound on [**7-22**] showed a left intraventricular hemorrhage.
The last head ultrasound on [**2185-8-2**] showed a resolving intraventricular hemorrhage.
The infant is transferred to [**Hospital3 18242**] for ligation of his patent ductus arteriosus.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome.
Evolving chronic lung disease.
Sepsis ruled out.
Patent ductus arteriosus Status post hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity.
Anemia of prematurity.
