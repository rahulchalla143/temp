HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old male status post liver transplant on [**2114-9-15**] complicated by mild acute cellular rejection treated with Solu-Medrol.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No habits.
General: No acute distress.
It was noted that the patient had a bone marrow biopsy in late [**2113**] that showed no evidence of overt myelodysplasia and maturing trilineage erythropoiesis.
Findings were consistent with peripheral destruction of his hematopoietic cells.
It was felt that the fluctuations in his platelet count was reflective of medication changes.
Hepatitis C infection was also felt to be a positive factor of the thrombocytopenia, as well as his liver dysfunction.
Stools were sent for C- diff x 3.
Given past history of hepatic artery stricture with stent placement, a cardiac echocardiogram was done.
Aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened with 1+ mitral regurgitation noted.
There was no pericardial effusion.
Post biopsy, he complained of some nausea and abdominal cramping.
This demonstrated a small subcapsular hematoma and a moderate amount of hemorrhage within the abdomen and pelvis intermixed with a large amount of ascites.
His liver biopsy tissue returned with changes consistent with a recurrent viral hepatitis C, grade II inflammation.
Findings were indeterminate for acute cellular rejection.
Recurrent viral hepatitis C grade II inflammation.
Hepatitis C virus status post liver transplant.
Subcapsular liver hematoma status post transjugular liver     biopsy.
