Admission Date:  [**2149-10-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2149-11-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-12-2**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cardiogenic shock, status post acute inferior myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes and coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2147-5-22**], status post right coronary artery stent times two in [**2148-9-21**], and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery in [**2149-7-21**]) who presented with 10/10 chest pain (persistent pressure similar to his past acute myocardial infarction) starting around 8 o'clock in the morning on the day of admission.
His repeat electrocardiogram showed high-grade atrioventricular block with acute inferior myocardial infarction.
He was given atropine and dopamine for bradycardia and hypotension in the Emergency Room, and he went into supraventricular tachycardia.
Coronary artery disease; status post 3-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2147-5-22**]; status post right coronary artery stent in [**2148-9-21**]; and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending artery in [**2149-7-21**].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Denies coronary artery disease.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in II, III, and aVF; ST elevations in I and aVL; right-sided electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in leads V2 through V6.
Severe diastolic dysfunction.
Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of 80% left anterior descending artery stenosis just distal to the anastomosis.
Catheterization on admission revealed left main coronary artery was normal, left anterior descending artery with severe proximal disease, left circumflex was nondominant with total occlusion of the first obtuse marginal.
Right coronary artery was dominant vessel with proximal total occlusion with thrombus.
The 18-hour course of post catheterization Integrilin had to be stopped prematurely due to epistaxis.
He also developed severe laryngeal edema secondary to traumatic intubation on admission.
He was also treated with a 7-day course of Levaquin for possible aspiration pneumonia given the prolonged course of intubation and a low-grade temperature.
Repeat echocardiogram showed inferoseptal hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 55%.
No evidence of ventricular septal defect.
Status post acute inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular infarct; status post proximal right coronary artery stent.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
