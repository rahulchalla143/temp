She does have difficulty with short term memory.
Lately, she has been missing some of her medications, and her son describes that she has been more "sleepy" lately.
At approximately 5pm this evening, the patient was riding in her husband's car to [**Holiday **] dinner and acutely started to moan incoherently for a few seconds, and then started to blankly stare.
She had a head CT that showed evidence of a 7cm IPH with midline shift and concern for an underlying mass.
There is a significant SAH component, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for a higher level of care.
Past Medical History: - Chronic kidney disease with baseline Cr 1.2 - Atrial fibrillation (not on anticoagulation), rate controlled - Hypertension complicated by hypertensive encephalopathy - History of SAH (see d/c summary from [**2113**]) - Right ICA occlusion thought to be chronic - Alzheimer's dementia - COPD on home oxygen   Social History: 55 pack year smoking history, baseline functioning as above.
Family History: Mother died from aneurysmal rupture in 50s, father died of prostate cancer in 70s.
HEENT: NC/AT, no conjunctival icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no masses or lymphadenopathy Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, no masses or organomegaly noted, C-section scar well healed Extremities:warm and well perfused Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
- Her eyes are open spontaneously, but with a prominent left ptosis - Pupils are reactive and equal bilaterally (5-3mm) - Corneal and VOR reflex are absent - Good gag/cough, and facial grimace is grossly symmetric - She does not overbreathe the vent.
- LUE localizes to pain, LLE triple flexes to pain - RUE just twitches to painful stimuli, RLE does flex slightly to pain - Toes are up bilaterally, reflexes are symmetric and present throughout  PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF DEATH at 9:00am on [**10-14**] GEN: elderly woman lying in bed, pale skin, not moving HEENT: pupils fixed and dilated CV: no hearbeat auscultated or palpated PULM: no respirations auscultated or palpated EXT: cool, not moving  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS:  [**2119-10-12**] 07:30PM BLOOD WBC-7.5 RBC-4.34 Hgb-12.5 Hct-37.5 MCV-86 MCH-28.7 MCHC-33.2 RDW-12.8 Plt Ct-215 [**2119-10-12**] 07:30PM BLOOD PT-11.2 PTT-20.7* INR(PT)-0.9 [**2119-10-12**] 07:30PM BLOOD Fibrino-461* [**2119-10-13**] 02:20AM BLOOD Glucose-147* UreaN-25* Creat-1.1 Na-138 K-4.0 Cl-99 HCO3-28 AnGap-15 [**2119-10-13**] 02:20AM BLOOD ALT-9 AST-31 CK(CPK)-128 AlkPhos-42 TotBili-0.3 [**2119-10-12**] 07:30PM BLOOD cTropnT-0.07* [**2119-10-13**] 02:20AM BLOOD CK-MB-10 MB Indx-7.8* cTropnT-0.40* [**2119-10-13**] 08:09AM BLOOD CK-MB-9 cTropnT-0.44* [**2119-10-12**] 07:30PM BLOOD Calcium-8.9 Phos-3.4 Mg-1.8 [**2119-10-12**] 07:30PM BLOOD ASA-NEG Ethanol-NEG Acetmnp-NEG Bnzodzp-NEG Barbitr-NEG Tricycl-NEG [**2119-10-12**] 07:31PM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-235* pCO2-41 pH-7.43 calTCO2-28 Base XS-3 Comment-GREENTOP [**2119-10-12**] 07:31PM BLOOD Glucose-133* Lactate-0.8 Na-145 K-3.7 Cl-105 calHCO3-27 [**2119-10-12**] 07:31PM BLOOD freeCa-1.08*  DISCHARGE LABS:  Did not obtain as pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] at time of death  IMAGING: CT HEAD [**2119-10-12**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, left frontal, parietal and temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage with effacement of the left ventricle and rightward shift of normally midline structures.
Right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] dilation is concerning for early ventricular entrapment and obstructive hydrocephalus.
Massive left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extensive vasogenic edema and approximately 7 mm of rightward shift of midline structures.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern, interpeduncular fossa, sylvian fissures, and perimesencephalic cisterns.
Intraventricular blood products in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
No evidence of aneurysm or other vascular anomaly.
Chronically occluded proximal right internal carotid artery with a small amount of reconstituted flow manifest as a string sign, unchanged from [**2114-3-5**].
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 78yo W with a history of CKD, COPD, 55 pack year smoking history, Alzheimer's dementia, atrial fibrillation (not anticoagulated), hypertension, history of right ICA occlusion and previous SAH who ws transferred from an OSH for an intracranial hemorrhage.
Her NCHCT done here showed worsening of her IPH, and  extension to 9x8cm over 19 slices with a significant subarachnoid component and intraventricular component that raiseed the possibility of an aneurysmal bleed, particularly given that there is a family history of catastrophic aneurysmal rupture and death, although most likely etiology was amyloid angiopathy.
CTA was done that showed no vessel abnormalities that led to the bleed, and pt was made [**Year (4 digits) 3225**] on [**10-13**].
