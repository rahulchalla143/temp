More inferiorly, there is a fluid hematocrit level (2:19), which may represent hemorrhage into an arachnoid cyst at this site.
Hyperdense material layers along the superior aspect of the right posterior tentorium consistent with subdural hematoma.
There is no shift of midline structures or herniation.
There is no acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is a left parietal vertex subgaleal hematoma (2:28).
The partially visualized paranasal sinuses, ethmoid and mastoid air cells are clear apart from minimal aerosolized material in the right sphenoid sinus (3:18).
Acute right parafalcine subdural hematoma extending inferiorly over the tentorium cerebelli.
In the posterior interhemispheric falx, there is an ovoid focus with discrete margins.
Internally, the is acute hemorrhage layering with CSF attenuation.
This raises suspicion of hemorrhage into a pre-existing arachnoid cyst, which was present at this site.
No midline shift and no herniation.
No hydrocephalus.
There is a right parafalcine subdural hematoma, which measures up to 9.8 mm, slightly smaller than the prior measurement of 10.8 mm.
There is persistent extension over the tentorium inferiorly, particularly in the right tentorial aspect.
There is unchanged low-attenuation focus in the posterior aspect of the right parafalcine subdural hematoma measuring 5.3 x 10.1 mm.
Differential considerations remain unchanged and include potential arachnoid cyst.
There are no new foci of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect, edema or shift of normally midline structures.
Again is noted a left posterior occipital scalp hematoma slightly smaller than the prior examination.
There are no fractures.
IMPRESSION: Slightly smaller right parafalcine subdural hematoma layering along the tentorium inferiorly.
Head CT [**8-19**]: FINDINGS: Again identified is a right parafalcine subdural hematoma with a focal area of hypodensity, minimally smaller in its widest posterior aspect when compared to prior exam (2a:20), but overall little changed.
No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
There is no evidence of edema in the brain.
Mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci due to cerebral atrophy is again seen.
A small left parietalr scalp hematoma is decreased in size.
IMPRESSION: Minimal decrease in the widest posterior portion of the right parafalcine subdural hematoma, which is largely unchanged, with unchanged extension along the right tentorium.
CT C-spine [**8-17**]: FINDINGS: There is no fracture or dislocation.
There are marked degenerative changes with loss of intervertebral disc height between C4/C5, C5/C6, and C6/C7 with anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6.
There are posterior disc osteophyte complexes at C4/C5 and C5/C6.
There is moderate canal narrowing particularly at C5/C6.
There is bilateral facet arthropathy, most marked at C5/C6.
There is no significant prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
The partially visualized lung apices demonstrate scarring with possible septal thickening, which may indicate volume overload.
No fracture or dislocation.
Multilevel degenerative changes with canal narrowing, which may predispose to cord injury in the setting of trauma.
Possible mild septal thickening of the lung apices may represent volume overload.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2131-8-20**] 8:34 PM Slight increase in the bibasilar pleural effusions with mild stable cardiomegaly and minimal pulmonary venous congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 89F who resides at an [**Hospital3 **] facility who is s/p mechanical fall while attempting to get up from her dining table on [**8-17**].
She was taken to an OSH where an acute subdural hematoma was identified along the falx with layering over the right tentorium.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive neurosurgical care.
She also complained of back pain, so imaging of the spine was obtained and determined to be without acute process.
Patient desaturated to 80s and was placed on lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] for CHF and pulmonary edema.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
3.Functional Baseline and Dispo Everybody agrees that Mrs. [**Known lastname 26802**] would benefit from PT/OT but there is a disagreement within the family about whether acute rehab or home PT/OT is most appropriate.
