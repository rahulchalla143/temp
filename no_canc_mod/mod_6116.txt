Admission Date:  [**2111-9-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2026-5-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Indocin / Minocycline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 85 y/o M with PMH of COPD, HTN and recent admission [**8-29**] to [**2111-8-31**] with chest pressure (negative stress test) who presents after 3-4 days of recurrent intermittent chest tightness/pressure.
Over the past week, he has noted recurrence of his symptoms, along with some dizziniess, lightheadedness and nausea associated with some of these episodes.
Saw his new cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who repeated a nuclear stress test and echo which were reportedly negative and given NTG for the chest pressure.
The chest pressure is associated with mild SOB and nausea.
Was still c/o intermittent chest discomfort.
ECG with prolonged PR but no e/o ischemia otherwise.
Pt was having chest pressure during and after the cath and was started on nitro gtt during and post-cath.
CT [**Doctor First Name **] made aware and will decide whether patient is a surgical candidate.
Pt was continuing to have ongoing chest pain, initially [**2109-12-14**] that increased to [**6-21**] despite treatment with imdur and IV morphine.
However, within ~ 15min of being on the floor, pt became acutely diaphoretic w/ chest pain [**6-21**] and hypotensive with SBP 56-60s.
After a few minutes, SBP increased to 120s, pt regained color in his face and his chest pain was much relieved.
Unclear as to the etiology of the acute hypotensive episode, but perhaps likely [**1-14**] nitro gtt.

EXT: wwp, no edema.
Right and left groin without echymosis or hematoma.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrates two vessel disease.
There is an 80% lesion at the ostium of the left anterior descending, and an 80% lesion in the right coronary artery involving the bifurcation of the posterior descending artery.
The left main and circumflex contain mild disease only.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY [**2111-10-1**] - The lungs feature bilateral dependent atelectasis with possible emphysematous changes, although extensive motion artifact limits evaluation.
There are no concerning lung nodules or diffuse opacities identified.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
There is a left periaortic mediastinal lymph node which does not meet CT size criteria for enlargement.
There is minimal fusiform dilation of the ascending aorta, with a maximal diameter of 4.44 cm x 3.69 cm occurring just proximal to the origin of the innominate artery (Series [**Numeric Identifier 34310**]:Image 7682).
There is no dissection flap identified.
Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aorta with more extensive disease of the imaged coronary arteries.
There is no pulmonary embolism.
There are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine but otherwise the imaged axial skeleton is unremarkable.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 34309**] is an 85 year-old male with PMH of COPD, HTN  and recent admission [**8-29**] to [**2111-8-31**] with chest pressure (negative stress test)who presented after 3-4 days of recurrent intermittent chest tightness/pressure and found to have LAD and RCA 80% stenosis.
CAD - Mr. [**Known lastname 34309**] presented following 3-4 days of chest pressure as above.
An ECG showed prolonged PR but no other evidence of ischemia.
Given the patient's symptoms he was taken to cardiac cath and was found to have an 80% lesion at the ostium of the left anterior descending, and an 80% lesion in the right coronary artery involving the bifurcation of the posterior descending artery.
During the procedure the patient described chest pressure.
No intervention was done and CT surgery consulted.
No ECG changes.
Started on a nitro drip which initially improved his symptoms however the pain did not resolve.
The pain did not improve and the decision was made to transfer the patient to the CCU.
His VS were otherwise stable and he did not have remarkable ECG changes.
In the CCU, pt continued to have transient episodes of chest pain, but that improved upon administration of a PPI and maalox/lidocaine.
He initially had ongoing chest pain without ECG changes, but by morning of discharge he felt the best he has felt in a long time.
COPD - Pt was switched from albuterol to atrovent so as not to irritate/aggravate the heart with beta agonist activity.
HTN - Held home anti-hyprtensives in the setting of being on the nitro gtt, but then re-initiated on his home atenolol as the drip was shut off and his blood pressure could tolerate it.
Atrovent HFA 17 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
6. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for Anxiety.

A cardiac catheterization showed that you have multiple blockages in the blood vessels that feed your heart.
This provided you with substantial relief from your chest pain.
Of note, you still have a blockage in one of the main vessels to the heart, and should see your cardiologist regarding possible further intervetion.
