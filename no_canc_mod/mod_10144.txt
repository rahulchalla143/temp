Admission Date:  [**2133-5-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2133-6-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2057-7-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2115**], hypertension and elevated cholesterol who presented on [**2133-5-28**] with burning epigastric pain.
This was originally thought to be cardiac ischemia and the patient was taken to cardiac catheterization and found to have patent vein grafts.
Laboratory studies then revealed that the patient had pancreatitis with an amylase of approximately 3300.
The patient was on dopamine transiently, which was thought to secondary to a gastrointestinal infection.
She also began to spike some temperatures on [**2133-6-1**], despite being on antibiotics and continued to have fevers up until her transfer to the floor.
Sputum grew out Serratia which was sensitive to ceftriaxone.
The patient also had some transient oliguria, presumably from fluid sequestration while in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient currently denies any shortness of breath, chest pain or abdominal pain.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft performed at [**Hospital1 2025**] 15 years ago with a diagonal to LAD graft and saphenous vein graft to PDA graft.
Hypertension 3.
Elevated cholesterol 4.
Question history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  HOME MEDICATIONS (to be confirmed by her primary care physician): 1.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient was awake, alert and mildly uncomfortable, appearing in no acute distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Dry oral mucosa, no oral lesions.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
There were no wheezes.
EXTREMITIES:  The patient complained of left wrist pain which later resolved after re-siting of the patient's peripheral intravenous.
In addition to sputum culture on [**2133-6-6**] revealing Serratia sensitive to ceftriaxone, urine cultures on [**2133-6-8**] revealed greater than 100,000 organisms per ml of yeast.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient ultimately presented to the Intensive Care Unit intubated with evidence of a vent associated pneumonia.
Sputum cultures were positive for Serratia, sensitive to ceftriaxone for which the patient received a 14 day course of antibiotics.
The patient was temporarily on anaerobic coverage for question of aspiration pneumonia, as well as for question of Clostridium difficile colitis.
The patient continued to have bilateral crackles which were thought to be consistent with some underlying interstitial lung disease which will be confirmed with her primary care physician prior to discharge.
The patient's only other infectious issue was a question of a sinusitis, given recurrent fevers on antibiotics and the patient's history of having a nasogastric tube in place while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.
CT of the sinuses did reveal some paranasal sinus thickening and partial opacification of the mastoid air cells.
Given that the patient was essentially afebrile following her transfer to the floor, she was taken off of Flagyl and this etiology was not further pursued.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Patient with presumed gallstone pancreatitis resolved by the time of her transfer to the floor.
The patient denied any abdominal pain through the remainder of her hospital stay and tolerated her advanced diet.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient with a history of hypertension by report.
The patient also with a history of coronary artery disease.
She underwent a cardiac catheterization when she was admitted thinking that her symptoms were related to cardiac ischemia.
She has an intact ejection fraction with some posterobasal wall motion abnormality as noted on recent cardiac echocardiogram.
The patient was noted to have some short runs of supraventricular tachycardia for which she was asymptomatic while in the Intensive Care Unit.
ENDOCRINE:  Patient with slightly elevated blood sugars while on TPN.
She had no known history of diabetes.
ORTHOPEDICS:  The patient initially complained of some left wrist pain while in the Intensive Care Unit.
After resetting of her intravenous, she exhibited full range of motion without pain of that extremity.
