Admission Date:  [**2146-11-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-12-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-4-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Known firstname 2565**] Chief Complaint: Colitis/diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: flexible sigmoidoscopy x2 Intubation Bronchoscopy IVC filter   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 74 yo man with h/o non-specific colitisi in [**2-18**], PMH CAD s/p MI, s/p prostatectomy, lung nodule/NSCLC s/p VATs removal in [**10-19**] now with recurrent colitis, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his colitis.
[**Name (NI) **] has a history of colitis (deemed ulcerative colitis), diagnosed in [**2146-1-12**] after having bout of diarrhea at that time, per report, diagnosed by colonoscopy (see below in PMH).
Had progression of symptoms from [**7-19**] to [**10-19**] with increased urgency, going to bathroom up to every 15 minutes, awaking at night to go to bathroom, diarrhea, gas, non-bloody bowel movements.
Patient was then admitted to the [**Location (un) **]/[**Hospital 1459**] hospital for removal of lung nodule via VATS procedure on [**2146-11-4**], symptoms of diarrhea/urgency were still ongoing at this time.
Post-procedure patient developed escalating amounts of diarrhea, without any unstable vital signs, but also developed severe abdominal distension.
Repeat CT scan per report demonstrated colitis, most prominent in sigmoid and left sided colon, without evidence of mechanical obstruction or ischemic bowel (per one report - but also demonstrated dilation of bowel loops in large and small intestine, no noted mechanical obstruction, per another report - awaiting fax of CT scan report).
His symptoms improved with these measures and the NGT/rectal tube per report had a lot of drainage, and after a couple of days he had his NGT and rectal tube removed.
Also states has developed lower extremity edema during prolonged hospital course.
Also reports some dyspnea on exertion which he attributes to deconditioning, denies CP/pressure, orthopnea, PND.
Per report that examination demonstrated colitis involving the rectum, sigmoid colon and left colon, with edema and erythema.
Left colon biopsies demonstrated active chronic colitis with low-grade dysplasia involving the left colon.
Right colon biopsies demonstrated focal mild acute colitis without dysplasia.
Of note, 2 prior colonoscopies performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80206**] in [**5-16**] and [**6-/2138**] showed only diverticulosis of sigmoid colon and a diminutive adenomatous polyp at 20cm.
- Non-small cell lung cancer s/p left upper lobe lobectomy in [**10-19**], clean margins - CAD s/p MI and LAD stent in 10/97 at [**Hospital1 2025**] - Hypothyroid - Tobacco use - Possible history of pancreatitis - H/o prostate ca s/p removal (?)
Family History: 1 daughter died at age 35 from metastatic lung cancer.
1 brother died of MI at age 45.
Family history of colon cancer in his father who died at age 59.
Physical Exam: Vitals - T 96.5, HR 77, BP 112/78, RR 22, O2 96% RA General - Patient is an ill appearing man, no acute distress ENT - moist mucous membranes CVS - RRR, no noted m/r/g Lungs - CTA b/l Abd - slightly distended, soft, midline scar noted (per patient from prostate removal for prostate ca), non-tender to palpation, hyperactive bowel sounds Ext - 3+ lower extremity edema, doughy texture   Pertinent Results: OSH labs: Na 137, K 4.2, Cl 110, CO2 20, Ca 7.7, Phos 3.2, TG 116, Mg 2.3, BUN 37, Cr 0.7 WBC 10.4, Hct 29.4, Plt 335 Somatostatin 18 TTG IgG 1.4, tissue trans 0.7 Gastrin 52 .
OSH imaging: [**2146-11-15**] CT scan:  Diffuse small and large bowel dilation with mild wall thickening.
There is trace amount of peri-hepatic ascites.
There is probably chronic pancreatitis.
No adenopathy, no free air.
Diffuse wall thickening and loss of haustra from splenic flexure to anus with adjacent fatty proliferation.
Findings consistent with ulcerative colitis, of indeterminate chronicity.
No free air, free fluid or bowel obstruction seen.
Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with related atelectasis.
Bilateral peripheral reticular honeycombing in the visualized lung bases.
Right lower lobe bronchiectasis with region of consolidation which could represent aspiration, atelectasis or infection.
Region of spiculated nodular opacity in the right lower lobe and also subpleural nodule in the right middle lobe.
Again comparison with prior study would be useful for establishing stability.
Scattered punctate calcifications in the pancreas could be related to chronic pancreatitis.
Rounded hypodensity in the right common femoral vein, consistent with DVT, and appearing to extend from the deep femoral branch at the level of the greater saphenous origin.
No evidence of thrombosis is seen in the common femoral vein below this level in the visualized distal common femoral vein.
Sclerotic and lucent lesions in vertebral bodies.
[**11-25**]: rectal bx: Chronic active colitis with ulceration; no granulomas or dysplasia are identified.
Diffuse wall thickening and loss of haustra from splenic flexure to anus, consistent with ulcerative colitis, of indeterminate chronicity, stable.
There is no free air, no free fluid or bowel obstruction seen.
No siginificant change in bowel apperance since [**2146-11-24**].
There are two tiny air pockets within the pleural fluid on the left, might be related to history of procedure in this area, but superinfection cannot be excluded.
Bilateral peripheral reticular honeycombing in the lung bases, stable.
Scattered punctate calcification in the pancreas could be related to chronic pancreatitis.
Rounded hypodensity in the right femoral vein, seen also on the previous study, likely consistent with DVT, unchanged.
Sclerotic and lucent lesions in the vertebral bodies in this patient with history of prostate cancer, correlation with bone scan is recommended for further followup.
Nodular prominence in the left adrenal gland.
Colonoscopy [**11-25**]: DIAGNOSIS: Rectum: Chronic active colitis with ulceration; no granulomas or dysplasia are identified.
It consists of multiple tissue fragments measuring up to 0.4 cm, entirely submitted in cassette A.
The patient has taken a better inspiration and there is still prominence of interstitial markings with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
No free air or pneumatosis.
There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Little interval change in appearance of multiple dilated, air-filled colonic loops.
Featureless appearance of the descending and sigmoid colon are consistent with chronic ulcerative colitis.
There is no bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis, or free air appreciated.
Left hydropneumothorax raises concern for bronchial stump leak.
No evidence of recurrent malignancy.
Very small cavities in the right upper and middle lobe require followup.
There is no evidence of active tuberculosis.
Severe emphysema.
Possible pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Focal focus of left anterior rib uptake which may correspond to a rib fracture.
No corresponding abnormal uptake in the lower thoracic or lumbar spine to correlate with CT findings.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 74 year old man with history of CAD, NSCLC, who presents with evidence of chronic diarrhea/colitis, transferred from outside hospital after worsening of symptoms after lobectomy (for NSCLC).
He had a repeat CT scan here that demonstrated bowel wall edema from anus to sigmoid colon.
He therefore underwent a sigmoidoscopy for further evaluation that demonstrated very friable erythematous mucosa consistent with colitis.
On [**12-15**], the patient had significant lower GI bleed (approx 4-5L blood pouring from rectum).
At that time the patient's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and we discussed the difficulty of resusitating him and necessity of pressors and large volume transfusion.
ARDS/Hypoxia: Pt had increasing O2 requirement and on HD 3 required transfer to ICU.
CT chest with multifocal opacities thought due to infection.
On [**12-8**] the patient had a witnessed aspiration and required intubation on [**12-10**] for tachypnea.
Eventually the patient's hypoxia was thought to be due to ARDS secondary to pneumonia and intraabdominal inflammation.
Sputum cultures were positive for Aspergillous.
Bronchoscopy was performed and BAL was negative for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was started on caspofungin for treatment of his fungal infection.
The patient was started on coumadin but this was discontinued in the setting of his continued GI blood loss.
Once stable, he was started on heparin, but noted to have low platelet count and transitioned to argatroban for possible HIT.
Coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction: During the hospital course he was kept on ASA 81 and beta-blocker when he tolerated it.
End of life care: As the patient continued his hospital course he had several episodes of massive GI bleeding.
That evening, the patient again developed extensive GI bleeding.
The family was consulted and requested that no resusitation measures be made.
