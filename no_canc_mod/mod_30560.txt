He was given atropine 0.5 for bradycardia with a pulse.
He cardiopulmonary arrested and received 20 minutes of chest compressions without shocking.
No breath sounds were heard so he was given bilateral needle decompressions and then bilateral chest tubes; right sided tube returned blood (probably secondary to a rib fracture from compressions).
On assessment from the cardiac surgery team the patient began to have a violent tremor throughout his body every couple of minutes lasting for over thirty minutes.
Osteoarthritis s/p left hip replacement back in [**2101**].
GF had diabetes requiring amputation of distal leg.
Brother had an aortic dissection.
He had a CT scan of chest which showed type a aortic disection.
An initial head CT was negative for significant intracranial pathology, but when the sedation was weaned to evaluate the patient's neurologic function he began to have seizure like activity.
The patient was evaluated by neurology, the CT scan was repeated without change and the decision was made to perform an EEG to evaluate the seizure activity.
We were notified by neurology that the patient's EEG trace showed "burst supression" and the on call neurologist explained to the family that meant that Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 99660**] had no chance of meaningful recovery.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] decided in light of the poor neurologic prognosis that the patient was not a surgical candidate and the family decided to withdraw care.
