Therefore she was diagnosed with hollow viscus perforation.
Initially we thought it may have been from the stomach or duodenum beacuse of chronic high does NSAID use; however, the CT was more suggestive of diverticular perforation.
Since she was stable it was decided to admit her to  ICU and watch her closely, following serial abdominal exams and hemodynamics, NPO and PPIs and antibiotics.
The decision to approach this non-operatively initially was based on the history of the acute onset of pain (actually worse than her current pain) more than 24 hrs ago, and the finding on exam that she was stable and her exam was not particularly impressive.
Decrease in amount of free air within the peritoneal cavity.
Increase in number and size of pelvic collections.
The findings were most in keeping with perforated diverticulitis as the sigmoid colon was thickened.
Low-density lesion in the right lobe of the liver.
There is no evidence of contrast leak from the known area of perforation in the sigmoid colon.
No residual collection surrounding the catheter drainage in the right pelvis.
Distended urinary bladder.
No evidence of pleural effusions which were seen on the prior CT. 6.
Diffuse osteopenia with old compression fractures along thoracic and lumbar spine.
US Showed  Loss of compressibility of the right distal brachial vein, just distal to the PICC line, with no flow demonstrated and possible echogenic material, most compatible with a thrombus.
