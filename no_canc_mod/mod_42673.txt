Admission Date:  [**2185-7-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-8-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-11-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Methyldopa / Clindamycin / Sulfamethoxazole / Trimethoprim / Tylenol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain --> NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac cath Pacemaker placement Pericardiocentesis and drain placement/removal Intubation and mechanical ventilation s/p left SFA thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy, right fasciotomy Right femoral line RIJ CVL Left brachial A-line Right radial A-line   History of Present Illness: 78F h/o PAF (not on coumadin due to fall risk), O2- and steroid-dependent COPD transferred for cardiac catheterization for treatment of NSTEMI.
Presented to OSH on [**7-20**] with chest pain rated [**11-19**], sharp, non-radiating, and constant in nature.
The patient was found to be in rapid AFib with HR in the 150's and was treated with a diltiazem gtt and eventually transitioned to PO dilt and digoxin.
Chest pain resolved and prior to transfer for cardiac cath, the patient was chest pain-free, V/S 98.5, 107/64, 60-70s, 18, 94%2L.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Atrial fibrillation (not anticoagulated due to prior fall) MVP Carotid stenosis COPD, oxygen (2.5L) and steroid-dependent Restrictive lung disease s/p RUL lobectomy SCC HTN Positive PPD s/p INH treatment Vertebral compression fractures   Social History: Lives in an assisted housing community.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
CARDIAC: Heart sounds difficult to auscultate due to diffuse wheezing.
Normal rhythm, No murmurs or extra heart sounds appreciated.
LUNGS: Barrel chested with severe pectus excavatum.
Bilateral diffuse expiratory wheezes and poor air movement.
Left lower and middle lobe with scattered crackles, right lower lobe clear.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: Right femoral catheter site with clean dressing in place and mild tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: Warm and well perfused, no rashes.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed one vessel coronary disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed low systemic blood pressure and high LV filling pressure.
Unsuccessful attempt at PCI of the ostial LAD stenosis was performed.
[**7-22**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a very small, echodense inferolateral pericardial effusion c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-7-25**], the inferolateral effusion is identified (prior study only had subcostal views and this may not reflect a true change).
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Left ICA 40-59% stenosis with bulky plaque noted bilaterally.
[**8-3**] CXR There is probably a small right pneumothorax primarily lateral and anterior, stable since [**8-2**] at 2:06 p.m.
Moderate cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion are also stable but there appears to be developing consolidation in the right upper lobe, particularly when compared to [**7-21**], concerning for pneumonia.
She had a brief loss of pulses (~20s) that returned upon drainage of her pericardial effusion and placement of catheter (600cc in the OR and then an additional 450cc in the ICU).
The patient underwent serial TTE that did not show tamponade and her drainage of her catheter stopped within 24hrs.
The patient's Hct remained stable and no further evidence of tamponade.
The patient did not show evidence of comparment syndrome and CK remained wnl.
HAP: The patient had a CXR that showed left retrocardiac opacity.
Sputum cultures were sent that initally grew GNR and GPC.
Her sputum culture subsequently grew pseudomonas and was changed to meropenem for a planned 14 day course.
Additionally, her cultures also grew stenotrophomonas sensitive to levofloxacin, which was not treated initially as her respiratory status seemed gradually improving.
However, daily CXR began to show increased RUL consolidation and treatment with Levofloxacin was started [**8-3**] for a full 10 day course.
CXR's then remained stable and she remained afebrile until discharge; WBC started to drift down steadily to the 7s by the time of discharge.
CORONARIES: Patient presented to OSH on [**7-20**] with chest pain and found to be in rapid AFib with HR in the 150's and was treated with a diltiazem gtt and eventually transitioned to PO dilt and digoxin.
Chest pain resolved prior to transfer for cardiac cath.
She underwent cardiac cath on [**7-21**], which showed a focal LAD lesions that appeared calcified that was not thrombotic or ulcerated in appearance.
TTE showed that the right ventricular cavity was moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis, EF 45%.
PUMP: Patient with elevated BNP on arrival to OSH and some crackles at the lung bases on physical exam.
Her CXR [**7-27**] showed volume overload and she was given 40mg IV lasix x2.
She continued to have worsening edema and started on a lasix gtt for diuresis.
This was due to increasing bicarb and minimal improvement in respiratory status on standing dose of Lasix.
RHYTHM: The patient has a history of paroxysmal AFib and was not anti-coagulated due to high risk for falls.
The patient was in a-fib w/ RVR at the OSH and required IV diltiazem and digoxin at OSH for rate control.
The patient ECG showed RBBB and LAFB with concern for AV disassociation.
She underwent EPS and pacemaker placement that was complicated by RV perforation and right leg ischemia on [**7-25**].
Anti-coagulation was not started given her RV perforation as well as her fall risk.
She was aggressively diuresed with lasix gtt and volume overload improved.
The patient eventually improved to 02 sats>95% on 2.5 L NC (her baseline home 02 setting), with occassional desaturations to 80%'s when eating or coughing.
Pt continued to have episodic desaturations to 88% on 2-3L face mask/nasal cannula.
By the end of her stay, her episodes of desaturation had decreased and pt responded well to repositioning, sleep (decreasing anxiety), suctioning.
COPD: The patient with severe COPD on home O2 (2-3L).
The patient also has a cushingoid habitus that is likely secondary to chronic steriod use.
On admission she had diffuse wheezes and poor air movement.
She was started on IV solumedrol 80mg q8 for COPD flare.
Her resp status improved, but continued to have diffuse wheezes.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for SOB, wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Heart attack (NSTEMI) Secondary: Abnormal heart rhythm, pacemaker placed; right leg thrombosis; hospital acquired pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Improved.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of a heart attack.
You underwent cardiac cath that showed an occlusion of your blood vessel in your heart.
It was deemed you were not a cardiac surgery candidate because of your other medical issues so you were treated with medications.
You also had a slow rate on your ECG and there was concern for an abnormal rhythm.
Additionally, you had a clot in your right leg that compromised blood flow.
