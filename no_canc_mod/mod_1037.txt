Unilateral Upper Extremity Ultrasound: No DVT.

[**11-5**] Upper Ext Doppler right side: no DVT  [**11-4**] Echo: The left atrium is dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with impairedfree wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo M hx CAD s/p CABG, PCI, DM, ESRD on HD p/w bradycardia and leukocytosis and episode of PEA arrest in the ED.
# PEA arrest: Unclear etiology.
Thought likely due to increased vagal tone during central line placement which resulted in hypotension and bradycardia and resultant brief PEA arrest.
No pulmonary edema, no pneumothorax.
Bedside U/S in ED showed no evidence of tamponade.
Not hyperkalemic or hypercalcemic.
No further episodes of PEA arrest.
# Bradycardia.
Initially with irregular bradycardia rhythm on presentation, possibly atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response.
# Coronaries: He has a strong history of CAD and numerous risk factors.
Elevated trop was at baseline and likely secondary to his underlying renal disease.
Continued his medical management of CAD with [**Hospital1 **], [**Hospital1 4532**], statin.
# Fever/Leukocytosis: Pt had recent enterococcus bactermia ([**2132-10-17**]) episode resulting in vegetations of his pacer leads after explantation on [**2132-10-23**].
Pt had leukocytosis and fever on admission and continued his outpatient coverage of Vancomycin, Gentamicin.
# Altered Mental Status: On admission to the CCU, patient has fixed, unreactive pupils (likely from atropine), not responding to commands, not withdrawing from pain, off all sedation.
AMS thought most likely to uremia or altered lytes that was improved after dialysis.
# HTN: Initially held amlodipine, metoprolol, and isosorbide dinitrate.
He says that he regularly has nausea, sometimes associated with hemodialysis, sometimes associated with activity.
Patient's nausea may be secondary to recent constipation.
Patient's diabetes makes gastroparesis higher on differential.
Zofran will be provided on discharge; cause of nausea can be investigated as outpatient.
# Chest pain, likely secondary to trauma caused by compressions during resuscitation.
Along with patient's back pain, chest pain has made him uncomfortable.
Patient received hydrocodone-acetaminophen with no allergic reaction and acceptable pain relief.
At discharge, pt had mild swelling of right upper extremity.
