HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 48 year old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was recently status post shunt, who was discharged from [**Hospital1 188**] on Saturday, [**5-8**], and has had dark stool since then with bright red blood per rectum on the morning of admission, and one episode of hematemesis, approximately one cup.
She also complains of lightheadedness and dizziness.
She denied chest pain or use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
She did complain of shortness of breath.
She was discharged after a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed a patent TIPS on [**5-9**] and she went home on Spironolactone and Lactulose.
Alcoholic cirrhosis, status post TIPS as above for recurrent variceal bleed after multiple instances of sclerotherapy and banding.
Negative for hepatitis A, B and C in [**2119**].
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Never married; no children, no tobacco.
FAMILY HISTORY:   No liver disease.
Alcoholism in multiple family members.
The patient is lying flat and is not dyspneic or uncomfortable.
Her neck is supple with no jugular venous distention noticed.
Her heart is tachycardia with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur noted at the left upper sternal border.
Extremities demonstrate one plus pitting edema in both ankles.
Palmar erythema is noted.
Electrocardiogram sinus tachycardia at a rate of 120 with normal axis and no ST segment or T wave abnormalities noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted with presumed recurrent variceal bleed.
She received intravenous Octreotide 25 micrograms per hour drip, intravenous Protonix, and packed red blood cells and platelet transfusion for hemodynamic support.
This showed a large esophageal ulcer with necrotic tissue at the sclerotherapy sites from [**5-5**].
There was organized clot with no sign of current bleeding.
The patient did have esophageal varices but no fundal varices, indicating that the TIPS has probably not closed.
Of note, it was difficult to draw blood from her peripheral veins and she required two femoral venous blood draws for routine laboratory monitoring.
The second of these two on [**5-14**], was complicated by femoral artery puncture with a #19 gauge needle; however, after pressure was held for 15 minutes and the patient remained in bed rest for two hours, there were no complications of this bleed.
