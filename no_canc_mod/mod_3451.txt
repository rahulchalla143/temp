Admission Date:  [**2109-10-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2109-10-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2039-8-22**]     Sex:  F   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis), peripheral vascular disease (status post below-knee (status post myocardial infarction times two) who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for arteriovenous graft removal.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] for low back pain in [**2109-8-27**].
She was found to have a compression fracture with questionable for rehabilitation three weeks ago.
On Friday, [**10-4**], the patient was noted to have pus draining from her old right arteriovenous fistula graft.
The patient reportedly had chills but no fever.
Today, the patient went for hemodialysis and was noted to have [**2-28**] positive blood cultures that grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and a wound culture that grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient became unresponsive on the surgery floor and was noted to have systolic blood pressures in the 70s; reportedly baseline is between 80 and 90.
End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday for two years).
The patient has a positive lupus anticoagulant antibody that was recently tested.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarctions, last one in [**2108-12-28**].
Status post catheterization in [**2108-12-28**] which showed 3-vessel disease and required a percutaneous coronary intervention of the left anterior descending artery.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%; catheterization showed severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
Atrial fibrillation.
Ventricular tachycardia; status post automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator in [**2108-12-28**].
Type 2 diabetes mellitus; now insulin dependent.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post right below-knee amputation.
Peripheral neuropathy.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Degenerative joint disease with chronic back pain.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is positive for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and seizures.
An obese elderly woman in no acute distress.
No jugular venous distention.
A [**1-2**] holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Lung examination revealed poor respiratory effort, diffuse rales.
The abdomen was soft, hypoactive bowel sounds, diffuse mild tenderness.
A fluctuant mass at the right arteriovenous graft site with ulceration and drainage of pus.
An ulcer on the left lower extremity without discharge.
A decubitus ulcer on the sacral region.
Deep peroneal ulcer with purulent discharge.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories were pertinent for an elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin; most of which was total bilirubin which was measured at 3.
The patient persisted to remain hypotensive after graft placement.
HYPOTENSION:  Question whether this was sepsis versus hypovolemia.
This was eventually switched to Levophed, and later she was put on Vasopressin with some success getting off the Levophed; however, the patient remained requiring Vasopressin until she expired.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis.
It was felt that the patient likely had intervascular infection and at some point would need an echocardiogram; or at some point evaluation to see if her dialysis catheter was infected.
This suggested it was likely due to decrease synthesis rather than destruction.
No signs of abscess.
She was hypotensive and was bolused carefully.
However, it appeared that she had gone into congestive heart failure to some extent as her chest x-ray showed signs of fluid overload.
The patient had atrial fibrillation; however, she was supratherapeutic on her INR, and Coumadin was held.
Amiodarone was held as it was a possible cause of her elevated liver function tests.
For her elevated liver function tests, the patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound and Doppler.
It did not show any signs of [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease or obstruction.
DIABETES:  She was started on an insulin sliding-scale; however, she remained hypoglycemic during most of her admission and required several D-5 ampules.
The patient was extubated, and within one hour after extubation she became even more unresponsive and went into ventricular tachycardia.
