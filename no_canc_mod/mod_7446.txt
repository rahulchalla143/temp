Admission Date:  [**2149-12-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-1-3**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) Open repair of ruptured infrarenal abdominal aneurysm with tube Dacron graft [**2149-12-5**] 2) Exploratory laparotomy, washout of abdomen, abdominal closure and placement of the gastrojejunostomy tube.
He recently underwent an endovascular repair of a type III endoleak from a stent graft placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2142**].
Upon presentation at that time, he complained of R-sided abdominal and flank pain.
His post-operative course was complicated by delirium to the point of occasional combativeness, and serous leakage from his bilateral groin incisions.
Cultures from an outside hospital purportedly grew MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
Today he presented to an outside hospital with complaints of L-sided abdominal pain.
Rather that subjecting this patient with chronic renal insufficiency to a dye load, the hospital elected to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up.
The patient complains of L-sided/LLQ abdominal pain.
He is a poor historian and is demented and delirious, and given these constraints in the history-taking, he denies radiation of pain, nausea, emesis, fever and chills.

He did code in the OR multiple times due to pulmonary embolisms.
On POD 2, he went into rapid a-fib and an amiodarone drip was started.
He did recieve 4 more units of FFP for coagulopathy.
At that time, he had an exploratory laparotomy, washout of abdomen, abdominal closure and placement of the gastrojejunostomy tube by general surgery.
A G-J tube check showed free passage of barium through stomach, duodenum and proximal jejenum through orogastric and J-tube.
A KUB showed mild dilatation of the distal jejunal loops and relatively slow transit time of the contrast material administered two hours earlier during an upper GI series.
He was felt to have prerenal azotemia and underlying ATN.
On POD [**9-28**], he got 2 units of RBC for blood loss anemia (hct 24).
Cultures were sent and he grew out a milti-drug resistent Klebsiella from his sputum and from his blood.
His central line was changed over a wire and the tip was subsequently positive for Klebsiella.
He was doing well from a respiratory standpoint.
On POD 17/13, he still had multiple dilated loops of bowel on KUB.
On POD 21/17, a CT sacn was done which showed no abscess, but did have bilateral effusions.
On POD 22/18, he got 2 units of RBC for blood loss anemia.
On POD 25/21, he became bradycardic to the 20s.
This was thought to be due to diltiazem.
Later that day, he became unresponsive and bradycardic to the 30s.
He was having copious secretions.
He was suctioned and was having significant mucus plugging.
The patient was also started on diltiazem extended release 120mg PO Q12h for rate control.
