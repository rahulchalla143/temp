IMPRESSION: No PFO, ASD, or cardiac source of embolism seen.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Echo esophageal: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s).
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No intracardiac thrombus/ masses seen.
Simple atheroma in the descending aorta.
CTA:  HEAD CT:  There is a large left MCA infarct involving the left frontal and temporal regions, the left internal capsule and basal ganglia.
There is isoattenuation of the left putamen, which likely represents microhemorrhage within the putamen and less likely sparing given the extensive infarct.
There is significant mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and body of the left lateral ventricle, with 3-mm rightward shift of midline structures.
Cervical portion of the common carotid arteries and the internal carotid arteries are normal.
The cervical portion of the right internal carotid artery maximally measures 5.9 mm and the left internal carotid artery measures 5.7 mm.
HEAD CTA: Intracranial portion of the internal carotid arteries are normal in course and caliber without evidence of flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion.
There is a focal filling defect suggestive of a clot within the distal portion of the M1 segment of the left MCA (3:280), with significant attenuation of the left MCA bifurcation.
The right MCA, both anterior cerebral arteries are patent without evidence of occlusion or significant flow-limiting stenosis or aneurysm formation.
The intracranial portion of the vertebral arteries, basilar artery and their major branches are patent without occlusion, flow-limiting stenosis, or aneurysm formation.
Large left MCA territory infarct, causing mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and 3 mm rightward shift of midline structures.
Iso-attenuation of the left putamen, likely represents microhemorrhage and less likely sparing given the extensive MCA infarct.
Filling defect suggestive of a clot is seen within the distal M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery with attenuation of the left MCA bifurcation.
Remainder of the intracranial and neck vessels are normal without significant stenosis or occlusion.
MRI: FINDINGS: There is a large left MCA infarct involving the posterior left frontal lobe, the left temporal lobe, the left basal ganglia and internal capsule.
Additional areas of slow diffusion in the left parietal lobe represent additional areas of acute infarction and were not seen in the prior CT study.
There is swelling, sulcal effacement and significant mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and body of the left lateral ventricle.
Mild rightward shift of midline structures, is unchanged since prior study.
There is no evidence of herniation.
Susceptibility images demonstrate areas of low-signal intensity involving the putamen and the caudate nucleus, consistent with microhemorrhages.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Large left MCA territory infarct, causing mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and mild rightward shift of midline structures is similar in appearance to the prior study.
Patchy areas of slow diffusion in the left parietal lobe, represent additional areas of infarction, which were not seen in the recent prior CT study.
LENIS IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 85443**] was admitted to neurology ICU for evaluation of large stroke.
On review of CT with the team, it was felt that the area of conern was an acute L MCA stroke and not mass.
The mechanism of stroke was thought to be most likely embolic.
He was loaded with dilantin in ED and started on prophylactic dilantin but later it was held as he did not have any clinical seizures.
He underwent repeat CT scan which showed no major changes.
He could also repeat very simple words and phrases.
CTA did not show any stenosis or dissection.
TEE showed no clot, but there was a PFO seen with Valsalva maneuvers.
It was therefore presumed that there was a paradoxical embolism leading to his stroke.
ESR was mildly elevated, which was consistent with recent CVA.
His mother says he takes baby aspirin and a medication for his attention deficit disorder  Discharge Medications: 1.
You were taken to a local emergency room where you were found to have had a large stroke on the left side of your brain.
This injury has made it difficult for you to speak and also has given you weakness on the right side of your body.
You were noted on CT scan to have a large stroke with some evidence of swelling.
You had an echo of your heart which did not show any source of blood clot.
You had a TEE which showed a small PFO (a hole between the [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] of your heart) with bearing down (called the valsalva maneuver).
If you have any worsening of your weakness, or become very lethargic, or have any new weakness on the other side of your body please call your doctor or return to the nearest emergency room.
