Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: Ms. [**Known lastname 46197**] required intubation secondary to hypoxic respiratory failure during her first evening in the ICU.
This was attributed to her underlying CAP in the setting of severe baseline COPD.
Despite this, she required reintubation after several hours for continued hypoxia.
A chest x-ray after extubation revealed a modest degree of pulmonary edema.
It was postulated that her continued respiratory failure was caused by a worsening pneumonia as well as flash pulmonary edema immediately following extubation.
At this point, she was restarted on vancomycin and zosyn for presumed VAP and was continued on bronchodilators and steroids for COPD management.
Despite these measures, she still failed extubation secondary to hypoxia and increased work or breathing with some evidence of mild pulmonary edema.
Procedure went well without complications.
Hypertension: Despite patient's presentation with bacterial pneumonia, she remained chronically hypertensive throught this hospitalization.
Her blood pressure was also extremely labile and difficult to control, especially in the setting of respiratory distress and agitation.
Multiple regimens were implemented in various combinations including increased beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, hydralazine and occasional nitroprusside or nitroglycerin gtts.
Though she is maintained with an ACE inhibitor at home, it was not initially used in her management as she had increased creatinine.
Acute-on-chronic RF: Acute component of renal failure attributed to hypovolemia and later, to ATN, as supported by a calculated FENa of >1%.
She was aggressively rehydrated initially, and eventually had increased spontaneous diuresis and creatinine returned to baseline (on discharge, 1.4).
Pt also noted to have sterile pyuria during hospitalization with bloody urine; foley was replaced and pt was treated 3 day course of ciprofloxacin for presumed UTI.
ESRD s/p transplant: Essentially stable during this admission.
Followed closely by the renal transplant team for titration of tacrolimus, cellcept, prednisone, espeically in the setting of receiving intermittent doses of stress-dose steroids for the COPD component of her respiratory disease.
