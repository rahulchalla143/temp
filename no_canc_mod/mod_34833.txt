No significant midline shift.
Normal-appearing CTA without evidence of AV malformation or aneurysm.
Bilateral frontal and left temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Small left posterior parietal epidural hematoma.
No significant shift of normally midline structures.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The lentiform extra-axial hematoma demonstrates internal low-attenuation, which may represent acute non- clotted blood ("swirl sign") and, given the overall appearance of the brain with multi-compartmental hemorrhage, may warrant close imaging follow-up.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo female transferred from OSH s/p unwitnessed fall with subarachnoid and epidural hemorrhages admitted to medicine for syncope work-up and transferred to ICU for management of hyponatremia.
Most likely etiology is worsening SIADH in setting of psychiatric medications, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Also given smoking history and unintentional weight loss neoplasm is of concern.
# Subarachnoid hemorrhage/epidural hematoma: No evidence of mass effect or shift.
Repeat CT head without progression.
# Altered mental status: Reportedly with subtle changes from [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] although mentating at [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] currently per family; neuro exam nonfocal other than reported instability in setting of subarrachnoid hemorrhage.
Being treated for UTI with no fevers or leukocytosis to suggest active infection.
# Syncope: Hemorrhage presumably due to rather than cause of syncope/fall.
Pt was orthostatic on floor.
No arrhythmia on EKG other than PACs.
# Hypertension: BP elevated after stopping dyazide, started metoprolol and this should be uptitrated as an outpatient.
# UTI: On methanamine for suppressive therapy but started on cipro for UTI.
# Stridor: Chronic per report and related with anxiety and COPD.
ENT was c/s for evaluation and they felt that there was no surgical issue or paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction or paralysis.
CT neck was also negative for pathology.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Bilateral frontal and left temporal subarachnoid hemorrhages Bilateral intraventricular hemmorhage Small left epidural hematoma Hyponatremia  Secondary diagnoses: Hypertension Anxiety Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic urinary tract infections  Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable and within normal limits, ambulating, tolerating oral PO, no changes in mental status, alert and oriented.
You apparently struck your head in this fall, causing some bleeding in your head.
If you should feel dizziness, a sense of losing consciousness, chest pain, trouble breathing or any other medically concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or 911 or go to the emergency room.
