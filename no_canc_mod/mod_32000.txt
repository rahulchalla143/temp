Admission Date:  [**2178-4-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-4-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-7-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Demerol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Transfer for cath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Central Line Placement PPM placement   History of Present Illness: 75 F with COPD, htn, bilateral hip replacements, depression, anxiety transferred from OSH for NSTEMI.
She was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] from [**4-10**] to [**4-13**] for a R hip dislocation s/p closed reduction.
The hospital course was complicated by respiratory failure requiring ICU stay for bilateral PNA and COPD flare.
She had trouble lying flat but did not notice weight gain or leg edema.
She also reports having increased clear sputum over the past three days.
She was brought to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital where initial CXR did not show infiltrate or CHF.
She was thought to have another COPD flare and was given Ceftriaxone and steroids.
During cath, she was found to have diffuse disease and she got 4 DES to the LAD.
Denies bleeding disorder or hematachezia or strokes.
Physical Exam: GEN: A+Ox3, NAD, mildly drowsy but answers questions appropriately HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, MMM NECK: JVP to angle of jaw CV: RRR, no M/G/R, PMI at 5th intercostal space midclavicular line, no heaves or thrills PULM: Diffuse crackles and tight air movement, minimal wheezing, no rhonchi.
ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS EXT: No peripheral edema NEURO: CN II-XII intact, mobilizes all extremities  Pertinent Results: Admission labs: [**2178-4-21**] 07:51PM BLOOD WBC-13.2* RBC-4.24 Hgb-12.7 Hct-39.6 MCV-93 MCH-29.9 MCHC-32.0 RDW-13.9 Plt Ct-221 [**2178-4-21**] 07:51PM BLOOD PT-16.5* PTT-51.1* INR(PT)-1.5* [**2178-4-21**] 07:51PM BLOOD Glucose-117* UreaN-18 Creat-0.9 Na-137 K-4.5 Cl-98 HCO3-35* AnGap-9 [**2178-4-21**] 07:51PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-110 [**2178-4-21**] 07:51PM BLOOD CK-MB-15* MB Indx-13.6* [**2178-4-22**] 02:51AM BLOOD ALT-165* AST-68* LD(LDH)-417* CK(CPK)-76 AlkPhos-83 TotBili-0.2 [**2178-4-22**] 02:51AM BLOOD Triglyc-81 HDL-52 CHOL/HD-2.8 LDLcalc-78 [**2178-4-21**] 08:30PM BLOOD pO2-166* pCO2-91* pH-7.18* calTCO2-36* Base XS-2 [**2178-4-21**] 08:30PM BLOOD Lactate-0.6  Micro: Urine cx: negative x2 Blood cx: NGTD x2 RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2178-4-24**]): OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
Imaging: [**2178-4-21**] Cardiac cath: Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed nonobstructive left main and 2 vessel obstructive coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had a 40% stenosis distally, extending into the ostium of the LAD.
There was a 40% ostial stenosis, followed by sequential 70% and 90% stenoses of the proximal and mid LAD.
The RCA had lumenal irregularities up to 30-40% stenosis of the proximal and mid vessel, but was otherwise patent.
[**2178-4-21**] CXR: The heart size is mildly enlarged.
The mediastinum is slightly shifted towards the right that might be due to atelectasis or scarring in the right upper lobe.
Lungs are overall hyperinflated with start increase in interstitial prominence in both lungs which might represent interstitial pulmonary edema in the presence of emphysema.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with slightly decreased heart size.
It might be due to initiation of mechanical ventilation.
The lungs remain over- inflated and essentially clear except for minimal opacity at the right base which may represent atelectasis versus small aspiration and linear right perihilar scarring.
Interstitial edema has resolved.
[**2178-4-22**] ECG: Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response rate at 165.
Non-specific generalized repolarization changes consistent with tachycardia and/or ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-4-21**] normal sinus rhythm with probable left atrial abnormality has given way to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and the heart rate has nearly doubled.
[**2178-4-23**] TTE: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 40-45%) with severe hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral segments and mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid anterior wall and anterior septum.
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
(1+) mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing sinus rhythm has replaced atrial fibrillation.
[**2178-4-26**] CXR: Severe hyperinflation reflects COPD.
Elevation of the minor fissure reflects volume loss in the right upper lobe.
Lungs clear of focal abnormality.
No pneumothorax.
Event possibly from OSH admission when she developed respiratory failure from bilateral PNA, or shortly after discharge.
Had diffuse disease now s/p 4 DES to LAD.
No further complaints of chest pain during hospitalization.
Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic HF: Had crackles all the way up the lung fields bilaterally on admission.
She was continued on her blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] (initially held with hypotension but restarted as hypotension resolved).
COPD: Increased sputum production and wheezing as well as hypercarbia suggestive of COPD flare.
Sputum culture with yeast and 1 colony of mold, no clinical evidence of infection.
Afib/Arrhythmias: Pt developed afib with RVR on [**2178-4-22**] with HR to 150s.
However, on [**2178-4-26**] she had a 20 second asystolic episode, likely secondary to vagal episode.
Review of tele appeared to have sinus brady and slowing before 20sec pause then sinus tachy with recovering of pulse.
Blood pressure: Patient developed hypotension requiring pressors after intubation likely related to intubation.
Given initial concern for infection or sepsis since she had a fever on arrival, she was treated with vanc <24 hours.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for anxiety.
Xopenex 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
COPD Exacerbation 2.
Atrial Fibrillation 4.
Vagal episode .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.
This is most likely related to your COPD and heart disease.
While you were hospitalized, you also had an abnormal heart rhythm.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, light-headedness, dizziness, passing out, wheezing, swelling in your lower extremities, headache, fevers, shaking chills, or night sweats.
