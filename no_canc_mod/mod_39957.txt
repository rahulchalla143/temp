Her hospital course by systems is below:  NEURO: Her C2 fracture identified on trauma work-up and after MRI was deemed non-operative and she was placed in a cervical collar for the entirety of her stay.
She received IV hydromorphone with good effect and adequate pain control.
Her CK's were only mildly elevated with a maximum of 21.
EKGs showed no serial changes.
It was believed the troponin rise was likely due to cardiac contusion or hypertensive urgency.
Prior to leaving the ICU, a TTE showed no pericardial effusion with left and right ventricular contractile function grossly preserved.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
She was started on a bowel regimen of stool softeners given the administration of narcotic pain medications, and was passing flatus and having bowel movements at discharge.
ID: Her white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
She was given a 3 day course of ciprofloxacin orally for urinary tract infection which was completed on [**2150-3-10**].
On [**2150-3-15**] she was noted to have pain and associated cellulitis on the dorsum of her right foot.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You sustained a fracture in one of the vertebrae in your neck as well as a fractures in two different areas in your right leg.
You also had some irregularities on your EKG obtained on admission.
This was likely related to you having an extremely elevated blood pressure on admission.
We have increased the dose of your lisinopril to 30 mg twice/day (from 20 mg twice/day) because your blood pressure was elevated on admission and during your hospital stay.
Because your blood sugars well elevated while you were in the hospital, the doctors [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] center saw you and started you on fixed doses of insulin.
Please call the doctor or come to the ED if you experience any of the following related to your blood sugars: *Glucose greater than 300 for 24 hours *Glucose less than 70 more than twice *Increased urination *Increased thirst Blurry vision  You were noted to have a skin infection on your right foot.
Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation so it is generally recommended that you take an over the counter stool softener such as colace or milk of magnesia to avoid constipation.
