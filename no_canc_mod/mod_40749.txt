Patient has hx of significant NSAID use for her chronic back pain.
At the OSH the patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath with mild abdominal discomfort.
The mild abd pain has been present for a couple of weeks.
The EGD showed large clot in the stomach with gastric varices.
No esophageal varices were identified.
no evidence of ulcer in duodenum.
No intervention was performed.
She was on sedation as well as an octreotide drip.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI   Past Medical History: Right Breast cancer [**2139**] with lumpectomy, Type 2 DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, hyperthyroidism, depression, anxiety, COPD  Tubal ligation, appendetomy, hysterectomy, tonsillectomy   Social History: - Tobacco:  Significant hx of previous tobacco use, quit about 3 yrs ago - Alcohol:  Denies - Illicits:  Family History: Not able to obtain currently   Physical Exam: Vitals: T:99.5 BP:134/58 P:92 R: 18 O2: General: Intubated, arousable to verbal stimuli, does not appear to be in distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, CV: A. fib; no M,R,G Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft,  non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly; active melena GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: intubated and sedated.
No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or mediastinal widening.
Diminished pulmonary vasculature suggests emphysema.
No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis and mild interstitial edema.
Thrombosed aneurysm at the origin of the SMA, with reconstitution of the distal SMA from adjacent vessels.
There was no evidence of esophageal varices or esophagitis.
Stomach: Contents: A large amount of clotted blood was seen in the fundus.
The GE junction was carefully examined and there was no evidence of gastro-esophageal varices.
Isolated fundal varices could not be ruled out.
Duodenum: Mucosa: Old blood was noted in the whole duodenum, however the mucosa was normal without ulcers     Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old female with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy in remission transferred from OSH with significant active upper GI bleed.
Emergent EGD showed extensive hemorrhage in the stomach; a lesion could not be localized.
CT abdomen suggested gastric varix due to splenic vein thrombosis was possible source of bleeding.
# FEN: IVF, NPO # Prophylaxis: Pneumaboots # Access: peripherals x 3, right IJ trauma line was placed # Communication: HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 732**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91259**]; discussed case # Code: DNR .
Following initial stabilization, patient had another episode of significant hematemesis and melena on the afternoon of [**2144-12-4**], and was hemodynamically unstable, requiring additional packed red cell transfusions.
An emergent conference was held involving attending physicians from the hepatology, interventional radiology, ICU and surgical services to discuss possible therapeutic interventions.
It was felt that no endoscopic options were possible and that, due to multiple varices and very difficult/calcified/aneurysmal anatomy, IR options were not optimal.
Surgery was felt possible but extremely high risk and with a low likelihood of long-term control.
No further interventions were pursued.
