Admission Date:  [**2185-6-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-7-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-8-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubated ([**2185-6-24**])  History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: 77M history of schizophrenia, neurogenic bladder presenting from NH with ACS with resuscitation at [**Hospital1 2177**] 1 month ptp, brought in by EMS due to hypoxia, concern for PNA at nursing home.
Per discussion with the floor nurse from his nursing home, a CXR was obtained 4 days prior to admission for a cough that was consistent with a pneumonia.
One day prior to admission, he developed tachypnea and started to desaturated in the the low 80's.
CMP showed hypernatremia of 150, Cl of 112, BUN 33, with rest of BMP in normal range,  Lactate was 2.1, and valproate level was 27.
Given tachypnea and hypoxemia as well as high work of breathing, patient was intubated with fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.
His CXR showed a questionable aspiration pneumonia as well as possible LLL process.
CT scan showed bilateral PE and likely pneumonia.

CTAB but intermediate aeration Abd: NT, ND, soft Ext: no peripheral edema Skin: no rashes or lesions noted; area around suprapubic cath is c/d/i without erythema or discharge   Pertinent Results: IMAGING: CT ANGIO CHEST [**2185-6-24**] - TECHNIQUE:  CTA of the chest was performed per department protocol.
CT OF THE CHEST:  There are small pulmonary arterial filling defects in the subsegmental bronchi supplying the lingula (4:71) as well as additional filling defect in the subsegmental right lower lobe bronchi (4:87).
An additional area of segmental pulmonary embolus is seen in the apical segment of the right upper lobe (4:33).
There is no evidence of right heart strain.
Within the right middle and upper lobe there are extensive nodular opacities as well as several more gound glass appearing areas of opacity (4:61 and 4:27).
There is extensive atelectasis of the right lower lobe (4.83) with relative [**Name (NI) 71062**] peripheral area within the collapsed lung.
No definitive arterial supply with embolus is seen in this area; however in the setting of other emboli and configuration of this finding, it is concerning for infarct.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
In the left hemithorax, there is a large hiatal hernia with stomach and GE junction above the diaphragm.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen within the bones.
Right middle and upper lobe nodular opacities as well as several areas of ground-glass opacity consistent with infectious process.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli in the segmental and subsegmental levels with no evidence of right heart strain.
There is an area of hypoenhancement within the atelctatic right lower lobe along the periphery concerning for infarction.
Complete right lower lobe atelectasis.
Large diaphgramatic hernia.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND [**2185-6-24**] - Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of the left common femoral, left superficial femoral, left popliteal vein show normal compressibility, flow and augmentation.
There is partially occlusive thrombus noted within one of the right proximal superficial femoral veins which is of unclear chronicity.
Partially occlusive thrombus noted within one of the two right proximal superficial femoral veins which is of unclear chronicity.
No DVT in left lower extremity.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) MR.  PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to position.
Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No definate aortic regurfgitation is seen.
The mitral leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a very prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
It overlies the lower chest, but appears to overlie the gastric fundus, which is elevated due to a diaphragmatic herniation, as seen on [**2185-6-24**] CT scan.
There is focal opacity in the right upper zone and patchy opacity in the right lower zone medially.
No vascular congestion.
CXR [**7-8**] Portable: IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification in left base with some volume loss.
CXR [**7-10**] Portable: IMPRESSION:  Possible area of loculated fluid with trapped air verses pneumothorax verses atypical appearance of stomach bubble near the left CPA.
Follow up upright chest radiograph with the patient swallowing 15 cc of barium just prior to imaging should help rule out these etiologies  CXR [**7-11**] PA/Lat: CONCLUSION: There is no significant pneumothorax.
Possible inferior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
The lateral lead Q waves are likely not representative of a myocardial infarction but rather septal Q waves.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-7-8**] the sinus rate has decreased by 20 beats per minute with no other diagnostic change.
MICRO/PATH:     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2185-6-26**]):       POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2185-7-1**]):    NO GROWTH.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2185-6-30**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.

# UTI- Currently has suprapubic catheter in setting of neurogenic bladder and was found to have GNR's 10-100K in urine on [**2185-7-3**].
Patient complained of need to void urine on [**2185-7-11**] several times which was new for him.
# Acute Pulmonary Emboli: Patient previously on Coumadin.
[**2185-6-24**] CTA showed bilateral pulmonary emboli in the segmental and subsegmental levels without evidence of right heart strain.
There was an area of hypoenhancement within the atelectatic right lower lobe along the periphery concerning for infarction.
If his INR <2, he should be bridged with Lovenox 60mg q12h due to high risk for thromboembolism.
On discharge, he is on room air, slightly tachypneic and tachycardic but has been stable.
Likely due to known pulmonary emboli with infection.
Patient does not currently have sx of infection, so sepsis is less likely cause.
# Schizophrenia- Difficult to evaluate mental status.
No evidence of responding to internal stimuli.
# Pneumonia, MRSA: Treated with 8 day course of Vanc/Zosyn for bilateral patchy infiltrate and found to be MRSA positive on bronchial washings.
Patient was hypotensive and hypoxic requiring intubation and pressors for 10 days in MICU.
[**2185-7-6**] CXR: Persistent opacification at the left base with progressive clearing of right base without vascular congestion.
# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine started this admission for TSH 8.6 in setting of acute septic shock.
He will need outpatient follow up of TSH in 1 month [**2185-8-8**]  # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes prn, ground solids, if ever needs tube feeds, needs post-pyloric b/c hiatal hernia  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Continued on Levofloxacin until [**7-24**] - Guardianship obtained during admission.
Patient started on levothyroxine [**2185-7-3**] for low Triiodothyronine Thyroxine (T4), Free 0.78* and TSH 8.5.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 71063**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 827**] on [**2185-6-24**] for shortness of breath at your nursing facility.
You were found to have pneumonia with MRSA in your lungs in addition to multiple blood clots in your lungs.
