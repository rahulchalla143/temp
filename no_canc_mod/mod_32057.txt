No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
No displaced rib fractures noted.
IMPRESSION: Allowing for portable supine technique, no acute trauma is seen.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-6-1**] 10:32 PM Wet Read: AGLc WED [**2174-6-1**] 11:14 PM right scalp swelling and rt temporal bone fracture extending into middle ear with blood in EAC and middle ear.
hemorrhagic contusion in left temporal lobe and inferior left frontal lobe.
while assessment degraded with recently administered IV contrast at OSH, likely SAH in left parietal regions, with likely SDH along left posterior superior convexity.
Radiology Report CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-6-1**] 10:33 PM Final Report CT C-SPINE: The skull base through the top of T3 demonstrates no evidence of acute fracture, malalignment, or paravertebral hematoma.
CT does not afford intrathecal detail as does MR; however, note is made of degenerative change, particularly at C5-6 and C6-7 where posterior disc and osteophyte causes narrowing of the canal and indentation of the thecal sac anteriorly.
Uncovertebral and facet arthropathy also causes severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at C5-6 and moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at C6-7.
Soft tissue gas is noted anterior to the right temporal bone, although the known right temporal bone fracture is not visualized.
Views through the lung apices show no gross abnormality.
IMPRESSION: No acute traumatic injury seen.
Canal narrowing at C5-6 and C6-7 are due to degenerative changes; correlation with mechanism of injury and neurologic exam is recommended, and if there is concern for cord injury, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-6-2**] 5:43 AM Final Report NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Areas of hemorrhagic contusion in the left temporal lobe and inferior left frontal lobe appear little change.
Again a linear high density along the sulci in the left parietal lobe, but also frontal and occipital regions persist consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Layering high density along the left posterior cerebral hemisphere is consistent with a small subdural hematoma, which demonstrates distribution since the last study and measures up to 4 mm in thickness posteriorly.
No interval development of new hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus is seen.
The soft tissues are again only remarkable for soft tissue swelling along the right scalp.
Right temporal bone fracture is redemonstrated with blood opacifying the external auditory canal in the middle ear as well as small amount of subcutaneous gas anterior to the fracture visualized.
IMPRESSION: Little change in exam compared to CT head of seven hours prior with right temporal bone fracture and left temporal and inferior frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhagic contusions, left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and left posterior subdural hemorrhage.
Unchanged region are sulcal effacement without new shift of normally midline structures, intraventricular extension of hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
PFI: Little change in exam compared to 7 hours prior with left temporal and left inferior-frontal hemorrhagic contusions, left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and left posterior subdural hemorrhage, which causes local sulcal effacement without shift of normally midline structures, without new intraventricular extension of hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-6-2**] 4:22 PM No mediastinal hematoma is noted.
Multiple non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal and axillary nodes are noted.
No pleural effusion is detected.
Mild atelectasis is noted within the lateral part of the left lower lobe.
These areas are underlying the rib fractures.

He was drowsy on examination, but moving all extremities and with full upper motor strength, due to his history of ETOH, he was placed on a CIWA scale to monitor for alcohol withdrawl.
Cervical spine was cleared by trauma and chest CT revealed left rib fractures, [**5-24**].
