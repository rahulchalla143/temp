was home alone morning of admission, fell forward while trying to get off of the toilet.
She broke her fall with her hands, and there was no LOC or head trauma.
At baseline, she is ambulatory at home, but over the last several weeks, she (and her sister) have noted increasing SOB/DOE, leg edema, general malaise/fatigue, and a ?new fine resting tremor involving her digits and lips.
On ROS, she denies HA, chest pain or pressure, cough, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation, fever/chills, dysuria, melena/hematochezia, recent illness.
She was initially admitted to the floor but given her decreased hematocrit was transferred to the CCU team.

at bases, no crackles or wheezes.
abd: Morbidly obese with abdominal binder in place, large ecchymosis involving RLQ/inguinal area to midline, morbidly obese, tender to palpation esp.
on L, +bs, no organomegaly.
extr: warm, no cyanosis, venous stasis changes in LE including excoriation on L inner ankle.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Absence of overt pulmonary congestion and significant pleural effusion speak in favor of appropriate clinical management.
More superior portion of large hematoma of the right flank and anterior abdominal wall has become more homogeneous in appearance on today's exam.
This may reflect prior amiodarone use or iron overload.
CT abd [**2187-10-23**]: There is a large soft tissue hematoma within the right flank and anterior abdominal wall, measuring 17 x 11 cm in maximum dimension.
This may reflect prior amiodarone use or iron overload - clinical correlation is recommended.
axis, low precordial voltages, no ST-T changes.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Severe global hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Left ventriculography revealed an EF of 30% with severe global hypokinesis.
There was no significant mitral regurgitation.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The LAD had a 30% distal stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: A 52yoF with Afib, s/p fall with large abdominal hematoma and 10 point Hct drop.
was transferred to the CCU for management of enlarging pannus hematoma, SOB/DOE, and anemia, all in the setting of severe CHF, and AFib with supratherapeutic INR.
Surgery team was consulted and agreed with reversing her coagulopathy and suggested applying an abdominal binder.
was also evaluated by EP and was initially scheduled to have a cardioversion but this was deferred given the reversal of her anti-coagulation.
was transferred out of the unit, and was initially restarted on a heparin bridge to coumadin, but unfortunately a rescan of her pannus hematoma showed extension of the bleeding, so all anticoagulation was stopped.
During this time, the patient had several episodes of hypotension (SBPs in 80-90s).
Larger boluses were not given due to concern for pulmonary edema and 3rd-spacing due to very poor LVEF.
became oliguric during this time, but her Cr remained normal.
Hypotension persisted, and due to blood pressure holding parameters on diuretics and AFib meds, the patient could not take these meds.
Further lack of response to fluid boluses and unclear etiology of hypotension (no evidence of sepsis, so either cardiogenic or distributive most likely) led to transfer to MICU.
was given a total of seven liters of fluid and was able to tolerate it well despite her severe CHF.
She developed mild pulmonary edema after about 5-7L of fluid and was diuresed with lasix.
was found to be total body fluid overloaded but was also likely intravascularly dry.
was found to have an Enterococcus UTI by urinalysis/culture on [**10-26**], associated with her foley; she was treated with ciprofloxacin for a two week course.
clearly has a small window of euvolemia with tendencies toward both hypotension on the one hand, and pulm.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Right pannus hematoma secondary to supratherapeutic coumadin level 2.
If you experience fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain, please call your PCP or return to the hospital.
You had a urinary tract infection, which we treated with antibiotics, you will take 3 more days of antibiotics after discharge.
