She was found to have multiple injuries including a subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely diaphragmatic injury, R ankle and thumb fractures, R L5 transverse process fracture, and bilateral L1 transverse process fractures.
She was found to have a L hemidiaphragm rupture with small bowel ischemia.
Neurosurgery was consulted for the subdural hemorrhage and lumbar spine fractures found on CT scan.
They recommended a repeat head CT with no intervention being necessary at that time.
A tentative diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome was made and it was decided to take her back for a second exploratory laparotomy.
Ischemic small bowel was found and she underwent small bowel resection x 2 followed by temporary abdominal closure.
On hospital day 3 ortho was consulted for a right ankle fracture found on secondary survey.
Patient was again taken to the OR for a third exploratory laparotomy.
Again small bowel was resected with a primary anastamosis, and the abdomen was closed primarily.
Plastic surgery was also consulted for her right thumb fracture again found on secondary survey.
A CT scan of the wrist demonstrated a right thumb [**Doctor Last Name 65097**] fracture as well as a nondisplaced R distal radius fracture and a R trapezium fracture.
She was placed in a R thumb spica splint for these injuries.
On hospital day 9 she was found to have a pneumonia and vanco/levo were started.
Some drainage was noted from the inferior aspect of the abdominal wound, and on hospital day 10 this portion of the wound opened and drained serous fluid.
The wound was packed with wet to dry dressings.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation for 4 weeks.
Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for back spasm/muscle pain for 4 weeks.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q 3-4H () as needed for pain for 4 weeks.

The abdominal staples have been removed, but there is still a small area at the bottom of the wound that is open.
Call your doctor or return to the ER if you experience: -chest pain or shortness of breath -fevers or chills -nausea/vomiting/inability to pass gas or stool -increased pain/redness/drainage from incision sites -anything else that concerns you  Followup Instructions: Follow-up with the Trauma Surgery Clinic in 2 weeks.
