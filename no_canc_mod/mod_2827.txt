with HTN, ESRD on HD, sarcoidosis, pulmonary HTN, HIT, and epilepsy who presents with hypotension and tachypnea.
From getting out of the car to walking into the [**Hospital **] clinic, she became short of breath.
She reported feeling dizzy and fatigued in addition to her SOB.
She has not had pedal edema in the last couple of weeks.
Pt reported a low grade temp of 100.3 last night.
Pt has been afebrile in the ED.
She is currently on medical disability due to her multiple medical illnesses.

No evidence of pneumothorax.
Slight worsening of extensive interstitial opacities which may be due to differing phase of respiration during scanning, although mild superimposed interstitial edema on chronic interstitial disease cannot be excluded.
No focal consolidation identified.
Small right pleural effusion.
Chest x-ray [**2185-4-29**]: No acute change.
Diffuse interstitial opacities involving the middle and upper lungs bilaterally are stable in appearance.
No new opacity.
Negative examination for pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Long tubular filling defect noted extending from distal right subclavian vein, through right brachiocephalic vein, into the superior vena cava is compatible with thrombus, probably related to prior hemodialysis catheter placed on right side.
Focal area of worsening of the pre-existing extensive interstitial lung disease suggest superimposed acute inflammatory/infection process.
Interval resolution of the right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 50 year old female with past medical history significant for HTN, ESRD on HD, sarcoidosis, pulmonary HTN, HIT, and epilepsy who presented with hypotension and hypoxia.
Hypotension: The patient initially required Levophed to maintain SBP 95-105, however did not become symptomatic aside from some lightheadedness prior to admission.
This was felt to be most likely secondary to sepsis.
The pt had mild tenderness at both line sites (right HD line had been removed on [**2185-4-27**] and re-sited to left) but denied any significant drainage.
The patient spiked a fever to 102.9 and received blood cultures from peripheral vein and CVC.
ECHO on [**2185-4-29**] was negative for vegetations, but did show mild global systolic dysfunction and severe pulmonary hypertension.
On [**2185-4-29**], the patient became tachypneic and hypoxic at dialysis, had an ABG of 7.56/36/98 and was transferred back to MICU.
# Hypoxia: On the floor the pt was noted to have increased oxygen requirements when compared to her home oxygen needs (oxygen for climbing stairs, other exertional activities), and it was unclear if this was related to worsening of sarcoid (DLCO lower in [**4-4**]) versus an acute process.
CXR did not show evidence of pna.
The pt had a CT-A which did not show PE, but did reveal a long tubular filling defect noted extending from distal right subclavian vein, through right brachiocephalic vein, into the superior vena cava which was compatible with thrombus, probably related to prior hemodialysis catheter placed on right side.
Pulmonary HTN: Her Sildenafil was initially held due to hypotension however this was restarted on [**2185-4-29**].
When the pt was noted to have persistent hypoxia, a pulmonary consult was requested and the pt's outpatient pulmonologist recommended that Sildenafil be stopped as it did not seem to be helping the pt.
