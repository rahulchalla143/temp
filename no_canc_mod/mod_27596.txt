Severe left main and a three vessel coronary artery disease.
Cardiogenic shock requiring IABP for hemodynamic support.
Severe systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
Echo [**2124-2-22**]: There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the anterior wall, apex, lateral wall and basal to mid inferior walls.
The distal inferior and basal anteroseptal walls contract best.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (EF 20-25%) The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Carotid u/s [**2124-2-23**]: Minimal bilateral ICA calcific plaque, no appreciable associated stenosis, however (graded as less than 40% bilaterally).
However, no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis .
Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Partially successful PCI of LAD with focal in-stent underexpansion with high risk of restenosis.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex, mid and apical portions of the inferolateral, lateral and inferior walls.
Right ventricular function is mildly depressed.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+)mitral regurgitation is seen.
R IJ tunnelled catheter placement [**2124-3-10**]: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided tunneled hemodialysis catheter placement via the right internal jugular venous approach with the tip positioned in the right atrium   Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo male w/ HTN, DM, s/p recent NSTEMI who presented to OSH after developing chest pain and SOB, intubated at OSH for increasing hypoxia and concern for pulmonary edema.
Cardiac cath revealed severe 3VD with decreased EF, elevated pulmonary pressures, and thrombocytopenia.
# Cardiogenic shock/CHF - The patient presented in shock, most likely due to LV dysfunction secondary to underlying ischemia.
This resulted in systemic hypoperfusion, hypoxemia and lactic acidosis.
He had elevated cardiac enzymes and severe 3 vessel CAD at cath, felt not ammenable for stenting initially.
Initially he had increased R and L sided pressures, w/ extremely elevated PCWP of 65; this improved after diuresis and placement of IABP.
He was started on CVVH for volume removal.
Initail echo showed EF 25%, but repeat TEE showed improvemed EF of 35-40%, with evidence of ant/lat wall hypokinesis, and MR.  His IABP and pressers were weaned slowly and the patient extubated.
# Ischemia - The patient had a documented NSTEMI and severe 3VD by c.cath, but was not a surgical candidate due to his poor overall functioning.
He underwent repeat cardiac cath for high risk intervention, and had rotational atherectomy and placement of 2 bare metal stents, to the LAD and diagonal branch.
# Rhythm - The patient had bigeminy initially causing technical difficulty with balloon pump.
# Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated on arrival at [**Hospital1 **] for increasing shortness of breath and dropping O2 sats.
This was likely due to acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema in setting of impaired cardiac function/shock.
He developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, initially with enterobacter in the sputum, then with MSSA.
# Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient was noted to have elevated bilirubin, (direct primarily) along with mild elevation in LFTs.
The likely etiology was acute inflammation.
# Renal failure - The patient had a baseline Cr 3.0- 4.0, but had not yet started Dialysis.
He was placed on CVVH for volume removal, and followed by the Renal Service.
# Anemia - Normocytic, likely anemia related to chronic kidney disease.
He had no obvious source of blood loss.
# HTN - He was initially on pressers and had a balloon pump.
# DM - His Diabetes is longstanding with nephropathy and blindness.
# Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on lipitor.
# Prophylaxis - The patient was on a heparin drip while on the IABP.
