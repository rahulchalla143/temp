The mother's medical history is notable for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for 28 years, treated with an insulin pump.
The pregnancy was notable for development of severe pregnancy induced hypertension, requiring treatment with magnesium sulfate.
There was induction of labor for worsening pregnancy induced hypertension.
Rupture of membranes occurred 14 hours prior to delivery.
There was no intrapartum antibiotic treatment or maternal fever.
She developed respiratory distress shortly after birth and was admitted to the NICU for further evaluation and treatment.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses.
Her chest x-ray was consistent with surfactant deficiency.
She had rare episodes of apnea and bradycardia but none for the 5 days prior to discharge.
No murmurs have been noted.
Her weight gain and urine output were decreased on the exclusive breast feeding so the infant is being offered a bottle of expressed breast milk after each breast feeding session.
Infectious disease:  The infant was evaluated for sepsis upon admission to the NICU.
Gastrointestinal: This infant required treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
With a negative Coombs test and a hematocrit essentially unchanged from birth it is unlikely that the persistently mildly elevated bilirubin levels are hemolytic in origin.
This process may be due to breast milk jaundice and an increased enterohepatic circulation as a result of delayed establishment of enteral nutrition.
Neurologic:  This infant has maintained a normal neurologic examination during admission and there were no neurologic concerns at the time of discharge.
This infant     was observed in her car seat for 90 minutes without any     episodes of oxygen desaturation or bradycardia.
No notification of abnormal results to date.
Immunizations recommended:     a.  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from         [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the         following four criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32         weeks; (2) Born between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with         two of the following:  Day care during RSV season, a         smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease,         airway abnormalities or school age siblings; (3)         chronic lung disease or (4) hemodynamically         significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the         child's life, immunization against influenza is         recommended for household contacts and out-of-home         caregivers.
Infant of a diabetic mother.
Respiratory distress secondary to surfactant deficiency.
