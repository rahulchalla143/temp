During cardiac catheterization, she clotted off her left circumflex artery and left anterior descending artery.
Patient became hypotensive requiring atropine and dopamine.
Emergent bedside echo showed no evidence of tamponade.She was successfully resuscitated using CPS with emergent deployment of drug eluting stents in LAD and LCx(Kissing stenting of the LMCA into the LAD and LCX ).Patient had resumption of pulsatile central aortic pressure after stenting of the LAD and LCx.
An IABP was placed.PA cath c/w ischemic MR.  She has massive blood loss during the procedure and has recieved 5U PRBC and 1u platelet prior to transfer to CCU.
Echo post cath showed small pericardial effusion, mild aymmetric LVH, nl LV size, mildly depressed LVEF  Patient did well in cath lab and ECMO weaned off.
Patient went to the OR and vascular surgery removed the ECMO catheters  Past Medical History: Diabetes mellitus Hypertension C section hysterectomy mild LV systolic dysfunction at baseline   Social History: Married, lives with her husband in [**Location (un) 686**].
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and inferoseptal akinesis.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed with apical akinesis.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is an echogenic density in the right ventricle consistent with a catheter.
PROCEDURE DATE: [**2127-3-24**] INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: chest pain FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Acute embolic occlusion of the LCx artery during cardiac catherization complicated by cardiac arrest requiring initiation of cardiopulmonary support.
In preparation for selective coronary angiography, the JL4 was advanced into the ascending aorta.
This was done without difficulty and the catheter was cleared and flushed per routine, with contrast clearing in the ascending aorta (well outside the sinuses of Valsalva).
The first cineangiogram showed mild LMCA plaquing with abrupt cutoff and total occlusion of the LCx.
There was mild diffuse plaqing in the LAD.
The patient became progressively bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP < 40mmHg) and a code was called.
The patient developed recurrent VT and VF and the patient was defibrillated at 360J approximately 7 times.
Emergent bedside echo showed no evidence of tamponade.
Patient had resumption of pulsatile central aortic pressure after stenting of the LAD and LCx.
It showed a marked increase in filling pressures (RA mean 23mmHg, PCWP mean 40 with tall v-waves and rounded dicrotic notch on PA pressure tracing.
Findings consistent with iscehmic mitral regurgitation.
Repeat emergent echo showed a small pericardial space, posterobasal hypokinesis and a hyperdynamic anterior wall with moderate mitral regurgitation.
Hand injection of the LFA showed no obvious major extravasation.
Vascular surgery consulted (together with CT surgery) regarding weaning of CPS and removal of CPS catheter  CT abdomen and pelvis [**2127-3-25**]:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar collapse/consolidation.
There is high attenuation fluid in the anterior and posterior pararenal spaces consistent with hemorrhage.
There is perihepatic ascites.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is diffuse stranding in the subcutaneous tissues in the left groin with obliteration of the normal fat planes with asymmetry with expansion of the anterior thigh musculature consistent with a hematoma.
There is low-density free pelvic fluid.
There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.
There are degenerative changes.
2) Retroperitoneal hemorrhage as described above.
3) Apparent low position of intraaortic balloon pump terminating with its inflated portion just above the aortic bifurcation.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No left ventricular aneurysm is seen.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include basal and mid inferior hypokinesis with basal and mid inferolateral and lateral akinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

She had 7 ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring ECMO being placed by surgery.
Post procedure, she went to the OR to have ECMO catheters removed on the right groin, IABP and PA catheter placed on the left groin.
However, she developed acute respiratory distress on the night of [**2127-3-26**] responsive to lasix, nitroglycerin drip and positive pressure ventilation with CPAP.
It was thought that she could have had acute  pulmonary edema.
Echo was performed on [**2127-3-28**] with the concern of posterior wall aneurysm seen by ECG changes.
SHe also had a short run of atrial fibrillation which spontanouesly converted on [**2127-3-29**].
During this hospitalization, she also had retroperitoneal bleed.
Vancomycin, levofloxacin and metronidazole was initially started for presumed aspiration penumonia given that she spiked temperature, had increased WBC and increasing sputum production.
