He states that his symptoms initially began with migraine headaches in his occiput and fatigue.
He then developed a dry cough with chest tightness, body aches, malaise, headache, fatigue, a "scratchy throat," rhinorrhea, fevers, chills and sweats.
These symptoms prompted a visit to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-11**].
He was told at that time that he had "pneumonia" and was started on Amantadine.
Since then, he states that he has had persistent tightness in his chest which is worse with cough.
He continued to have low-grade fevers until 3 days PTA but is unable to quantify his fevers.
Today, he became dizzy and pushed his daughter out of the way before falling down, prompting his father-in-law to bring him to the [**Name (NI) **].
He was found to have an anion gap of 25 with ketonuria and glucosuria.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 36 yo male with DMI who presented to the ED with DKA after a viral illness, he was initially admitted to the MICU on an insulin drip and was able to be transitioned to subcutaneous insulin and transferred to the floor the following day.
1) Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The patient presented with an anion gap of 25, glucosuria, and ketonuria.
Considered were dehydration vs. viral syndrome vs. drug/EtOH abuse vs. MI as possible triggers for DKA.
As his EKG was negative for ischemic changes and initial set of cardiac biomarkers were negative, and especially in the context of pain with palpation of the anterior chest wall-cardiac trigger of DKA was considered extremely unlikely.
His preceeding viral illness with recent alcohol use as well as poor adherence were considered factors in his DKA.
2)Anemia - he had a borderline microcytic (MCV 79) during his admission which is new.
Possibly due to combination of long term poorly controlled diabetes as well as hemodilution due to IV fluids during this hospitalization.
