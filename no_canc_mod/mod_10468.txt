REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital6 7472**] in [**Location (un) 31384**], [**State 350**] for treatment of probable fungemia and concern for ischemic colitis versus ulcerative colitis flare.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of severe ulcerative colitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency (on dialysis).
The patient was admitted to that hospital on [**12-28**] following an episode of hypotension during hemodialysis.
Later that day, the patient developed bloody diarrhea and was admitted to the [**Hospital6 7472**].
At that hospital, the patient underwent a colonoscopy which disclosed edema, redness, and necrotic mucosa in the sigmoid colon.
It was concluded that the patient was suffering from a flare of her ulcerative colitis or possibly from ischemic bowel.
A noncontrast computed tomography showed nonspecific colonic thickening.
Her white blood cell count began to normalize, but within two days she complained of increased abdominal pain and spiked a temperature on [**1-8**].
The patient did not have a surgical abdomen, yet it was decided that the patient would be transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management and possible colon resection.
The fungal infection was thought to be due to her indwelling right Perm-A-Cath and left hemodialysis tunnelled catheter.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times 30 years; the patient's illness is complicated by neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy.
Chronic renal insufficiency (on dialysis); dialysis was started in the middle of [**Month (only) 404**] due to "fluid overload."
Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2192**]; the patient now on Coumadin.
Following her stroke, the patient sustained a hypoxic brain injury.
Coronary artery disease; the patient noted to have anterior wall ischemia on a stress test done in [**2195-1-2**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history not elicited on admission due to the patient's poor mental status.
History negative for tobacco, alcohol, and drugs.
No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities revealed tenderness in the bilateral lower extremities, mild edema to shins.
Neurologic examination was difficult to assess secondary to agitation.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 140 beats per minute.
Left atrial abnormality.
No signs of ischemia.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 52-year-old female with multiple medical problems including ulcerative colitis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic renal failure who was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for treatment of fungemia due to indwelling venous catheters.
Intubation was without complications.
A bronchoscopy on [**1-18**] disclosed mild vocal cord edema.
An air leak was present with the cuff down.
Due to persistent fevers, and an abdominal computed tomography was done on [**1-14**].
There was no evidence of an abscess.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was done, and there was no evidence of vegetations.
The elevation was attributed to a troponin leak due to demand ischemia, since the patient was tachycardic.
As noted above, a transthoracic echocardiogram done on admission did not disclose evidence of vegetations.
The transesophageal echocardiogram done on [**1-15**] also showed no evidence of valvular vegetations.
Cardiac output was 7 and systemic vascular resistance was 640; consistent with a septic picture.
The patient will require further medication adjustments for treatment of her elevated blood pressure.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  At the outside hospital there was concern for ischemic colitis versus ulcerative colitis.
A computed tomography of the abdomen done on [**1-9**] disclosed thickening of the colonic wall.
A sigmoidoscopy on the following day showed diffuse disease from the rectum to the mid transverse colon.
There were both ulcerations and erythema; consistent with an ulcerative colitis flare.
Three stool samples were sent to the laboratory during her hospitalization, and all were negative for Clostridium difficile.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient has a history of chronic anemia.
In addition, she required a transfusion of fresh frozen plasma to reverse her coagulopathy on admission.
She has also be maintained on subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
The patient's renal dysfunction was attributed to diabetic nephropathy and/or hypertensive nephrosclerosis.
The Renal Service has noted that at the present time there was no indication for hemodialysis.
OPHTHALMOLOGIC ISSUES:  An ophthalmologic evaluation was done to rule out endophthalmitis.
There was no evidence of endophthalmitis.
There was evidence of moderate diabetic retinopathy in both eyes.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  As noted above, the patient was very agitated on admission with change in mental status; requiring intubation.
The patient has been administered Klonopin and as needed Haldol for her agitation.
Hyponatremia was attributed to loss of free water with diuresis.
