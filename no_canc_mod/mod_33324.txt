HISTORY: Status post aortic surgery with visual changes, rule out stroke.
There are no comparison studies.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence for acute transcortical ischemia.
There is a questionable focus of increased DWI signal within the left cerebellum with no associated mass effect or edema.
This could represent a tiny focus of acute ischemia.
No supratentorial evidence for acute ischemia is seen.
There is no mass effect or midline shift.
Bilateral mastoid opacification and under-pneumatization is seen.
There is mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid sinus.
There is apparent prominence of the left ophthalmic artery origin which may be artifactual.
IMPRESSION: Questionable tiny focus of possible acute ischemia in the left inferior cerebellum, without associated mass effect or edema.
Followup left lower lobe opacity.
Left lower lobe opacity has improved, but not completely resolved.
There are no large pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
Mediastinal widening has improved.
Mild interstitial edema has improved.
Left displacement of the distal external wire is unchanged from prior study, new from [**4-10**].
IMPRESSION: Improved, but not complete resolution of left lower lobe atelectasis.

No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Conclusions No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
A mobile density is seen in the aortic arch and descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There was no pericardial effusion.
[**Year (4 digits) **] surgery was consulted for left arm due to left subclavian dissection.
Due to prolonged ischemia he underwent fasciotomy of left arm.
Over the first few days postoperative days he remained intubated requiring increased PEEP for hypoxia and supportive care.
On postoperative day three he had decreased urine output however myoglobin was decreasing from admission and CK decreasing from peak of  55,950 and receiving fluid.
He continued with oliguria and was treated with diuretics but no response.
He remained intubated and sedated due to volume overload however hemodynamically stable on heparin for mechanical aortic valve with resolving rhabdomylosis.
On [**4-6**] due to increased white blood cell count he was started on antibiotics to cover sputum that had gram negative and gram positive, and lines were changed.
He developed a rash on vancomycin and zosyn, the vancomycin was stopped and the zosyn was changed to meropenum.
The rash progressively resolved, and the meropenum was discontinued after course completed.
He continued on ultrafiltrate with aggressive fluid removal until [**2106-4-8**], and he was monitored for the next few days but restarted ultrafiltrate due to increased ventilatory requirements.
On [**4-15**] he was again extubated, he remained in the ICU for several additional days for pulmonary toilet and hemodynamic monitoring.
He was noted to have two episodes of bradycardia while off oxygen, resolving when oxygen was replaced.
Therefore, he may benefit from an outpatient sleep study.
