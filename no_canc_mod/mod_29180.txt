Admission Date: [**2133-4-30**]        Discharge Date: [**2133-5-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-4-30**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NB  IDENTIFICATION: Baby Girl [**Known lastname 2433**] is a 1 day old former 31 [**3-21**] week infant with recurrent Atrial Flutter and Hydrops who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 18**] NICU to [**Hospital3 1810**] Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.
HISTORY:  Baby girl [**Known lastname 2433**] is a 31-4/7 week gestation female infant admitted to the newborn intensive care unit because of prematurity and a prenatal diagnosis of fetal tachycardia and hydrops.
This pregnancy was complicated by the development of maternal hypertension noted 3 days prior to delivery when she was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital.
Fetal assessment revealed fetal tachycardia and hydrops and the mother was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further care.
A fetal echo done after admission to [**Hospital1 69**] revealed intermittent fetal tachycardia sometimes with rates into the 270 range.
Also noted was moderately severe ascites, mild pleural effusions and scalp edema and polyhydramnios.
Because of worsening pregnancy induced hypertension and concern for persistent fetal tachycardia, the baby was delivered by cesarean section.
She was bulb suctioned and intubated orally and was noted to have equal breath sounds.
EXAM:  Initial exam notable for an LGA infant with moderate edema and significant ascites.
Infant was tachycardic with a systolic murmur.
Lungs were coarse and moderately aerated.
An EKG at that time revealed a diagnosis of atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
The infant was then treated with 2 joules of synchronized cardioversion with immediate conversion to normal sinus rhythm.
There was a subsequent successful conversion back to normal sinus rhythm with a procainamide bolus at that time.
At that time, she received a 5 per kilo bolus of procainamide, without effect.
Preliminary findings showed a moderately depressed ventricular function, AV regurgitation and a patent ductus arteriosus.
Chest x-ray was notable for mild RDS.
Moderate ascites is notable on exam, and an abominal ultrasound can be considered in the future.
DISPOSITION:  Due to recurrent atrial flutter thus far not amenable to medical therapy, infant was transferred to [**Hospital3 18242**] Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Atrial flutter, status post cardioversion.
