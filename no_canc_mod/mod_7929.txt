Admission Date:  [**2193-4-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2193-5-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-1-19**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath times four days.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve prosthetic replacement, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presents with shortness of breath progressive over the past four days after undergoing a transesophageal echocardiogram several days prior to admission.
He denies orthopnea, reports increased O2 requirement at home now.
He also reports a chronic cough with yellow sputum, which is mostly unchanged.
He denies fevers or chills, nausea.
He notes that his chronic lower extremity edema is unchanged.
He denies chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea or sore throat.
Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in [**2189**], coronary artery bypass graft times four in [**State 108**] in [**2189**].
Atrial fibrillation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1 in [**2189**] of .3 on 2 liters home O2.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Bilateral carotid stenosis status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to the left ICA.
History of gastrointestinal bleed with an arteriovenous malformation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of mediastinitis secondary to coronary artery bypass graft.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.5.
Anemia secondary to chronic disease.
He has a positive asbestos exposure.
General, this si a pleasant elderly gentleman in mild respiratory distress who can speak in full sentences.
Normal S1 and S2 with a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Chest decreased breath sounds on the right, diffuse wheezes, increased expiratory phase.
Abdomen soft, nontender with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities with 2 to 3+ pitting edema left greater then right to the knees with good dorsalis pedis pulses.
Chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion unchanged, possibly a small left pleural effusion.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with frequent premature atrial contractions, left axis deviation of the right bundle branch block and a left anterior vesicular block.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare:  The patient was treated with nebulizer and intravenous steroids.
Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm with thrombus as noted on transesophageal echocardiogram.
Anticoagulation was held, because of recent gastrointestinal bleed.
Mitral valvular regurgitation with mild paravalvular leak:  CT surgery was consulted and they did not advise any acute intervention.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient did not have evidence of ischemia by history or electrocardiogram, but he was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes and he was continued at this point on his aspirin and statin as beta-blocker was held, because of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
Carotid stenosis with left stent:  The patient was continued on a baby aspirin, but [**Name (NI) **] was held, given the history of gastrointestinal bleed.
On [**2193-4-10**] the patient developed the acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath with oxygen saturations in the 70s.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of his respiratory failure.
Anemia and blood loss:  As noted the patient had a history of gastrointestinal bleed on anticoagulation in the past and had a slew of heme positive stools, melena and hematocrit drop, which required approximately one unit of packed red blood cells per day for several days to maintain his hematocrit above 28.
No clear source of his bleeding was found.
He was noted to have significant chronic gastritis, but without acute bleeding.
He was also noted to have a small red vessel in his jejunum that was not currently bleeding.
At the time of discharge his hematocrit was stable at 32 and he had a guaiac negative stool.
Atrial fibrillation:  As noted the patient had recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and hypotension in the MICU.
Beta-blocker is being held at this time given the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease though since his flare seems to have resolved one could consider restarting a beta-blocker in the near future.
He is not anticoagulated at this time given his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, though he obviously remains at risk for clot given his known left ventricular thrombus, known left superficial femoral vein deep venous thrombosis status post IVC filter and his atrial fibrillation.
There was high suspicion for C-diff, but eh was negative for C-diff times three test.
If he should develop diarrhea again C-diff would be a likely culprit.
Status post MRSA pneumonia:  The patient remained afebrile with a normal white blood cell count at this time.
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 35% on his echocardiogram on [**2193-4-10**]:  The patient was diuresed with Lasix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d.
for several days.
We feel that he may have several more pounds of fluid to come off with a gentle diuresis over the next week and he should certainly not become fluid positive at this time.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient is on a Prednisone taper from his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
Left superficial femoral deep venous thrombosis:  The patient has an IVC filter in place, but as noted above is not on anticoagulation given his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient's creatinine has actually improved over his baseline in the mid 1s with a creatinine of 1.1 on discharge.
Ideally he wold be on [**Month/Day/Year **], but again this is being held given his recent gastrointestinal bleeding and hematocrit drops.
FEN:  The patient has been on a cardiac and [**Doctor First Name **] diet, however, he certainly could use nutritional consultation and supplementation given his low albumin of 2.6 recently and his mild whole body edema.
He should contact his primary care physician or come to the Emergency Department with any chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, bleeding from your bottom or coughing up blood.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Anemia with presumed gastrointestinal bleeding source.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
Coronary artery disease.
History of left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
