However, there is evidence of a small right subpulmonic effusion, new since the prior study.
There is also similar fullness of the pulmonary vessels bilaterally, consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension.
ECG: Atrial fibrillation with somewhat rapid ventricular response.
Since the previous tracing of [**2141-2-13**] atrial fibrillation is a new rhythm.
There is a large groin hematoma measuring at least 18.5 x 7.9 x 8.3 cm.
Again demonstrated is pulsatility of the right common femoral venous waveform with markedly elevated velocities of 180 cm/s consistent with an arteriovenous fistula.
These findings are consistent with a hematoma which appears more organized than on prior exam.
He had a h/o of GIB in the past but his Hct remained stable and no evidence of active bleeding on exam.
He was noted to be in an atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, requiring max diltiazem gtt and IV lopressor at one time.
U/S revealed an AV fistula.
Repeat u/s following day showed no flow.
There, a history of preceding diarrhea was elicited.
His presenting hypotension was presumed secondary to hypovolemia from C Diff associated diarrhea.
For this reason, he was not anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation.
