CT abdomen: There is loss of haustral folds involving the cecum and ascending colon.
The transverse colon demonstrates mesenteric combing, and the descending colon and sigmoid demonstrate mild colonic wall thickening.
Mesenteric combing is also seen involving the sigmoid colon, more prominent in appearance than that seen in the transverse colon.
Also, there is mucosal enhancement of the Sigmoid colon suggesting hyperemia/inflammation.
There are multiple small mesenteric lymph nodes, greater than typically seen, but all less than 1 cm in size.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo female with h/o CAD, MR, Crohn's Disease not on outpatient medication admitted with diarrhea, hematochezia and anemia.
LGIB and blood loss anemia: Patient was thought to have a LGIB on admission.
She underwent a gastric lavage with no evidence of active bleeding.
She underwent a CT of the abdomen with changes consistent with chronic Crohn's colitis and a new area of inflammation in the sigmod colon.
She then underwent EGD which was negative and a colonoscopy which demonstrated cobblestoning and friable mucosa with blood throughout colon c/w Crohns as well as small non-bleeding ulcer in ascending colon.
She continued to have small amounts of melena, but it was felt to be secondary to old blood as her hematocrit remained stable.
