She was initially admitted to [**Hospital6 5016**] Psychiatric Unit on [**2125-2-8**] for depression with psychotic features and suicidal ideation.
She was transferred to the Medical Unit at the [**Hospital6 5016**] on [**2125-2-22**] for an episode of chest pain and dyspnea.
Chest x-ray at that time showed mild CHF and bibasilar infiltrates.
She was sent back to the Psychiatric Unit between [**2125-2-24**] and [**2125-2-27**] when she became increasing dyspneic and had a decreasing oxygen saturation.
Her chest x-ray showed worsening bilateral infiltrates.
On the night of [**2125-2-27**], the patient had acutely worsening hypoxemia and respiratory distress requiring 100% nonrebreather mask.
A V/Q scan showed low probability for pulmonary embolism and chest x-ray showed increase in the bilateral consolidations.
She was transferred to the ICU and was intubated at 3:00 p.m. on [**2125-3-1**] for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Chest CT was performed and was read as diffuse consolidation of the lungs consistent with pulmonary edema with multiple bilateral air bronchograms.
There were bilateral pleural effusions.
She went into rapid atrial fibrillation on [**2125-3-1**] and was loaded with digoxin.
She was transferred on [**2125-3-2**] for a question of ARDS and persistent hypoxemia with hypotension and anuria.
Depression with history of multiple suicide attempts.
Pancytopenia, question of whether this is related to hepatitis C or her antipsychotics.
Question of history of diabetes mellitus type 2.
Vertebral fracture at L1.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
No scleral icterus.
Neck:  No appreciable JVD, obese neck.
No bruits or thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac, normal S1, S2, distant, no murmurs or extra heart sounds heard.
Pulmonary:  Diffuse fine crackles and rhonchi with tubular vented breath sounds, bibasilar crackles.
Abdomen:  Obese, soft, decreased bowel sounds, no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  There was 1+ palpable dorsalis pedis pulses, 1+ lower extremity edema.
Skin:  No diaphoresis.
No spontaneous movement.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 87 with early R wave progression, axis 0 degrees, normal intervals, no ST changes, no Q waves.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 62-year-old female with a history of intravenous drug use, pancytopenia, psychiatric disorder, hepatitis C virus, presenting from the outside hospital with hypoxemic respiratory failure most consistent with ARDS and sepsis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The etiology of the patient's ARDS and sepsis were investigated and no definitive source was ever identified.
Question of vasculitis was raised but rheumatologic workup was negative.
In terms of her respiratory status, she improved very little over the course of the first week of her admission.
Upon reversal of the paralysis and repositioning supine, the patient gradually worsened over the next several days.
She as re-paralyzed and re-proned but this had no significant benefit.
She became anuric and the Renal Service was consulted to perform CVHD which was done beginning [**2125-3-15**].
Her pancytopenia was felt to be secondary to hepatitis C.  Due to the patient's multiorgan system failure (liver, renal, pulmonary).
