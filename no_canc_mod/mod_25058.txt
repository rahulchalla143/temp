No hx of migraine, DVT, PE, or thrombophilia 3.
No tobacco, no illegal or injectable drugs per sister in law and roommates.
No recent travel.
Family History: No strokes.
WDWN, NAD Skin:	No rashes or bruising.
Neck: 	Supple, No Thyromegaly, No LAD, No bruits, no meningismus Chest: 	CTAB with good flow.
MS: Awake, alert, and appears oriented to self but given poor comprehension and global aphasia other than "[**Last Name (un) 46536**]" and occasional "no".
III,IV,VI  EOMI w/o nystagmus or ptosis.
V:      Responds to light touch in bilateral face.
Motor:	Mild weakness on R compared to L but able to ambulate.
Grasps and manipulates cell phone with no apparent loss of coordination.
No truncal ataxia.
At the frontotemporal area, there is geographic region of hypoattenuation over the insular cortex.
Distally, in the ipsilateral posterior middle cerebral artery distribution, there is a more typical wedge shaped area of diffuse homogeneous hypoattenuation more reminiscent of classic infarct with cytotoxic edema.
There is sulcal effacement overlying the hypodense regions.
There is no focal hyperdensity to suggest an acute hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
No acute fracture is detected.
IMPRESSION: Large hypoattenuating lesions within the left temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes into the cortex of the frontoparietal lobes, with neighboring sulcal effacement.
No ventriculomegaly or herniation is seen.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Findings are concerning for a possible underlying mass with downstream infarction.
CTA on admission [**2175-12-28**]:  Compared to the prior study there has been no change in the large area of cytotoxic edema involving the left MCA territory.
There remains no shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or evidence of hemorrhagic transformation (though please note that the subsequently performed MRI demonstrates suggestion of hemorrhagic transformation in the area involving the left temporal lobe).
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK: The aortic arch, great vessels arising from it, common carotid arteries, internal carotid arteries, and vertebral arteries are normal in caliber, configuration and appearance.
Intracranially there is focal high-grade narrowing of the superior and inferior division M2 branches on the left.
The major dural venous sinuses and large cortical veins are patent.
There are no thyroid lesions.
Osseous structures are unremarkable without concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There is no upper mediastinal adenopathy.
The distal cervical right internal carotid artery measures 4.8 mm in maximal diameter.
The distal cervical left internal carotid artery measures 4.7 mm in maximal diameter.
High-grade short segment stenoses involving the left MCA superior and inferior division M2 branches.
Please see subsequent MRI for details regarding progressive left cavernous ICA narrowing by the time of that study.
Findings raise the possibility of vasculitis, also consideration should be given to cerebrovascular disease related to drug use, or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.
TEE [**2175-12-29**]:  No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No source of embolism seen.
MRI on admission [**2175-12-29**]:  FINDINGS: There is an extensive acute infarct involving the majority of the left MCA territory, with some sparing of the portions of the deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter and portions of the superior most gyri in the MCA distribution.
There is no shift of normally midline structures, no hydrocephalus.
There is some gyral form susceptibility artifact in the left temporal lobe portion of the infarct, which may represent an area of hemorrhagic transformation.
The intracranial flow voids appear to demonstrate mild narrowing of the cavernous left ICA relative to the contralateral side, though this was not evident on the CTA (4:10).
Large but stable area of acute left MCA territory infarction.
Apparent interval narrowing of the left cavernous internal carotid artery flow void without development of any abnormal signal, of unclear significance given that this was not present on the CTA done approximately six hours earlier.
Doppler evaluation of the kidneys shows no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
She had been recently more fatigued than usual, sleeping through much of the [**Holiday 1451**] holiday, and skipping exercise sessions with her friends.
She was found to have a large Left-sided MCA infarct on NCHCT, and this was confirmed by MRI as a large area of restricted diffusion on DWI/ADC imaging conforming to the inferior and part of the superior division of the Left MCA.
Over the course of her hospital stay, there was initial concern for malignant MCA syndrome (pathologic swelling of the infarcted MCA territory causing herniation and death), especially given the initial degree of edema and sulcal effacement (but no midline shift) seen on MRI and HCT on HD1-2.
Although there was never an increase in her serum Na or pOsm (never greater than ~142 or ~290, respectively) despite 3% NaCl infusion rates up to 80mL/h, she never developed exam findings or imaging changes c/f worsening edema or herniation (no lethargy, no cranial nerve findings, no autonomic changes).
She was started on verapamil 40mg PO q8h to mitigate the risk of vasospasm (esp.
with RCVS on the DDx and a focal M2 stensois on CTA).
Her exam has been essentially stable, with minimal improvement, but surprisingly little impairment given the extent of the lesion.
Persistent mild Right pronator drift.
There is no neglect.
The etiology of her stroke is currently uncertain.
On cerebrovascular imaging (CTA and MRA), there were no findings suggestive of atherosclerosis or vasculitis.
She does not have atrial fibrillation by history or on several days of cardiac telemtric monitoring here at [**Hospital1 18**], and does not have an ASD/PFO or intracardiac embolic source on TTE/TEE, which were normal.
The appearance of her infarcted brain territory fits an Arterial vascular distribution (Left MCA), and not a pattern of venous infarction; in any event, venous sinus thrombosis was essentially ruled out by the absence of any consistent findings on CTA and a negative/normal D-dimer on admission (257).
There no physical exam findings suggestive of venous thrombosis disease.
The only aspects of her recent history and initial workup that may be worth mentioning, but of uncertain significance are the following: First, there was a stenosis of the inferior M2 division proximal to the infarcted territory (with preserved flow distally) seen on CTA; it is uncertain whether presumed vasospasm this was a consequence of, versus a cause of, the infarction here, but this finding raises the possibility of an entity such as Reversible Cerebral Vasospastic Syncrome /Call-[**Doctor Last Name 8271**] syndrome.
She does not have any known risk factors for this entity (she is female, but there is no known history of recent marajuana use, no SSRI, and she is not post-partum).
Second, she had a clot in her Left high-cervical jugular vein (ipsilateral to the stroke), of uncertain significance.
Third, she had severe iron-deficiency microcytic anemia (MCA 63, Hgbs in the 7s down to the high 6s) with an inappropriatly-low reticulocyte count of 2.4% and extremely low ferritin of 4.3 and iron of 14 (TIBC 569, TRF 438, also homocysteine 4.8, haptoglobin 66, LDH 215, fibrinogen 390, B12 359).
TSH was 1.7 (wnl), urine and serum tox screens were positive only for amphetamines (pt takes Rx Adderall at b/l) and UA was normal on admission (and UCx and MRSA screen were negative and pt remained afebrile throughout this admission).
An elevated platelet count on admission (in the 500s, but resolved to normal over the following week) with anemia and low albumin (2.9) suggest an inflammatory condition, although this could have been simply [**2-14**] the stroke.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: -Ischemic stroke (cerebral infarction), Left-Middle Cerebral Artery territory; etiology uncertain  Secondary diagnosis: -Severe iron-deficiency anemia, likely chronic   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - difficult to assess given very poor comprehension.
Discharge Instructions: You came with confusion and inability to speak.
You were found to have a large Left-sided middle cerebral artery stroke.
CT images of the arteries in this region of the brain (branches of the middle cerebral artery) showed a narrowing just before the tissue that had a stroke; it is uncertain whether this is a cause or a consequence of the stroke.
