History of Present Illness: Patient is an 86 yo male with h/o CAD s/p CABGx3, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, parkinsons and known aortic stenosis who presented with c/o's of worsening dypsnea on exertion, fatigue and a presyncopal episode.
He was evaluated for options at [**Hospital1 2025**], was found to be of high surgical risk, and aortic annulus too large for TAVI options available there.
He was evaluated including a neurology consult to examine his Parkinson's disease severity which was determined not to be prohibitive for surgical AVR.
He enrolled in the Corevalve TAVI study and was excluded due to large annular size.

On [**2134-3-17**] he was brought to the operating room where he underwent aortic valve replacement with #27mm tissue valve.
Immediately post-operatively he was hypotensive and required blood and pacing, to which he responded.
He was initially very sleepy, but he has a history of parkinsons with [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia.
Pacing wires and chest tubes were removed without difficulty.
