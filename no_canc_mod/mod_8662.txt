Admission Date: [**2119-4-13**]        Discharge Date: [**2119-4-13**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:  CCU   The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented to the Cath Lab for an elective cardiac catheterization.
He has a history of recurrent chest pain and was referred to the [**Hospital3 **] Cardiac Cath Lab by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
Other than recurrent chest pain over the last several weeks he had no further symptoms.
He states that his last cath was in [**2115**], and at that time, he has had only occasional chest pain usually occurring at night after being out drinking and would easily respond to nitroglycerin.
He has not noticed any exertional or rest angina, although when he was on a cruise several weeks prior to admission, there were several days where he awoke with mild chest discomfort.
Upon returning back home from his cruise, he had daily mild anginal symptoms and was therefore referred for catheterization by his local cardiologist.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease status post cardiac bypass surgery x2.
He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and status post appendectomy as well as a history of high cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.
No obvious murmurs.
No peripheral edema.
Diagnostic catheterization revealed native vessel coronary disease similar to his previous.
He also was found to have a thrombus in his SVG to RCA that was initially treated successfully with angioplasty and stenting.
However, several minutes after achieving an open SVG to RCA graft, he had an acute closure, which resulted in a cardiac arrest with a ventricular fibrillation arrest.
Cardiac Surgery was consulted and initiation of ECMO occurred, which was initiated in the Cath Lab with eventual re-flow in the SVG graft.
Unfortunately, the patient became progressively edematous and poor flow through the ECMO despite repositioning as well as bilateral chest tubes.
The patient also developed increasing abdominal distension suggestive of an catastrophic intra-abdominal event.
