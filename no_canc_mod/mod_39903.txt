The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
Right apical pneumothorax is small.
There are widespread consolidations seen.
The left lung is almost entirely obscured by consolidation with air bronchogram, most likely consistent with large infectious process.
On the right, there are focal consolidations with some lucencies that might represent cavitary lesions and should be correlated with cross-sectional imaging.
Bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.There is mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
DVT of the left femoral vein in its mid and distal part and of the left popliteal vein.
DVT in the right posterior tibial vein and peroneal vein.
CT CHEST [**2130-8-22**]: Marked pulmonary parenchymal damage with multifocal cavitary consolidations, ground-glass opacity and nodular opacities, all compatible with advanced infectious process.
Probable bronchopleural fistula of a right upper lobe branch which extends into the main right-sided lung cavity.
Increasing pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Near complete resolution of the subcutaneous emphysema within the chest but persistent subcutaneous emphysema in the abdomen.
Within this limitation, no acute intracranial abnormality is seen.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a possible right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage (series 2a, images 19 and 20).
This may be an artifact due to extensive motion.
No disproportionate fluid collection along the fascia to suggest fasciitis.
No subcutaneous emphysema.
Patchy enhancement in the musculature could reflect myositis, areas of ischemic change, or altered hemodynamics.
No evidence of osteomyelitis.
No evidence of intramuscular abscess on this exam.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

Mild resting LVOT obstruction.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with borderline preserved global systolic function.
No valvular vegetations or abscesses appreciated.
At least moderate pulmonary artery systolic pressure (patient intubated, cannot assess estimate of RA pressure from IVC).
Since [**2130-8-27**], bilateral cavitary consolidations with right bronchopleural fistula are unchanged whereas non-cavitary multifocal consolidations have improved.
Moderate left pleural effusion has developed several small loculated components whereas right loculated collection near the lung base has decreased in size.
Within the limitations of the CT technique, the pulmonary emboli in the left interlobar branches appear unchanged whereas the bilateral lower lobe segmental artery emboli have minimally resolved.
Minimal decrease in the size of mediastinal lymphadenopathy  CXR [**2130-9-11**]  In comparison with the study of [**9-9**], there are slightly lower lung volumes but little overall change in the bilateral lung abscesses.
Continued bilateral pleural effusions and elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
Stomach:  Contents: A large amount of bilious fluid with mx pills was seen in the body of stomach.
Excavated Lesions A single chronic cratered non-bleeding 2-3 cm ulcer was found in the pylorus and antrum.
Greater than 6 cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the end and base of stomach antrum ulcer.
Impression: Grade [**1-5**] esophagitis in the distal esophagus compatible with esophagitis Ulcer in the pylorus and antrum (biopsy) Retained fluids in stomach Recommendations: follow-up biopsy results Further recommendations per the GI consult team .

BRONCHOPLEURAL FISTULA/TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX:  She was admitted to OSH with a spontaneous right apical and posterior tension pneumothorax related to a large pulmonary abscess.
Two chest tubes placed on [**8-15**] and removed on [**8-18**] prior to transfer for hypoxic respiratory failure.
She was placed on a single ventilator within two days, and then underwent bronchoscopy on [**8-24**] by IP, revealing air leakage of most major segmental bronchi which essentially precluded an endoscopic plugging of the BPF.
Thoracic surgery followed throughout the hospitalization, and intermittently applied pressure dressings to prevent air efflux.
She was ventilated with a low tidal volume, low PEEP, and high rate system to prevent excess pressure on the fistula site.
She did require oxygen during her hospitalization, but it seems likely that there is a component of anxiety as she was satting 100% on 2L but would not allow weaning initially.
HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  She presented in respiratory failure from an OSH, intubated, due to a multifactorial combination of right sided pulmonary abscess and bronchopleural fistula, left sided diffuse consolidation, right tension pneumothorax, and bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Sputum culture from [**8-22**] showed pan sensitive MSSA and sparse GNR.
Bronchoalveolar lavage on [**8-24**] showed no organisms, including PCP/acid fast/fungi.
CT scan of chest on [**8-22**] showed marked pulmonary parenchymal damage with multifocal cavitary consolidations, ground-glass opacity and nodular opacities, all compatible with advanced infectious process.
CT torso on [**2130-8-27**] revealed improvment of his RML/RUL cavitating lesion with a new fluid level within the cavity and a more dense consolidation RLL.
Abdomen and pelvis revealed no strikinga abnormalities.
Clinical and radiographic improvement noted thereafter, with removal of the drain on [**2130-9-2**].
Her sputum culture from [**8-27**] revealed ALCALIGENES FAECALIS, which was treated with meropenem from [**Date range (1) 91431**].
PULMONARY EMBOLUS, BILATERAL:  She underwent CTA prior to transfer that demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli.
She had bilateral lower extremity DVT on ultrasound following transfer as well.
The source of her clots were unclear, but she was apparently extremely sedentary for several months prior to admission.
Consideration for bridging to coumadin in the future is indicated, after the patient has met with surgery and interventional pulmonary regarding her care and they have determined her need for intervention.
With leukocytosis to 23 with heavy bandemia, fevers, and multifocal pneumonia, a septic source was likely.
He was broadly covered with vanco/tobra/zosyn initially as above with resolution of the leukocytosis and improvement her hemodynamics.
TTE failed to reveal evidence of cardiogenic shock.
LOWER EXTREMITY ULCERATION:  She carries a diagnosis of hereditary lymphedema.
OSH records note a chronic left lower leg ulcer prior to transfer.
A gradually enlarging bullous, hemorrhagic lesion was noted on her left calf.
The wound was improving with decreasing areas of necrosis.
She requires morphine with dressing changes, we were using IV morphine because of the patient's nausea and vomiting, but recommend transition to PO and eventual discontinuation, especially given her hx of opioid abuse.
VRE BACTEREMIA:  Blood culture from [**2130-8-26**] grew out vancomycin resistant enterococcus, likely from a femoral line that subsequently became contaminated.
NUTRITION/WEIGHT LOSS:  A 30 pound weight loss was noted prior to admission.
TPN was continued during her acute illness, with her GI tract slow to regain motility.
She was likewise slow to resume PO intake following extubation and experienced significant anxiety and nausea related to eating and pre-treatment with lorazepam and zofran did not improve her appetite.
She was engaging in behaviors, such as breaking her food into small pieces but not eating anything, which are classic for anorexia but she denied body image issues.
Tubefeeds were not tolerated due to vomiting as above.
Psychiatry and social work were consulted to help advise regarding her food aversion, and they thought that her medical problems (ie gastric ulcer) might be contributing and it is difficult to assess her underlying disorder while these are ongoing.
ANEMIA: Patient had persistent anemia to the low 20s during her hospitalization.
Source of bleeding unclear, with iron studies reflecting some degree of chronic inflammation.
A low retic count of 1 likely reflected a sluggish marrow in the context of systemic illness.
No further UGIB was seen although she was diagnosed with an ulcer on EGD.
OPIATE DEPENDENCE:  She was on methadone 137mg daily at home, and had large sedation/narcotic requirement while intubated.
This should be re-checked in about 6 months to see if the patient's hypothyroidism is related to her acute illness.
GASTRIC ULCER: the patient was diagnosed with gastric ulcer by EGD.
As mentioned above, a small amount of blood had been seen at OSH with NGT placement and the patient had been c/o ongoing nausea and vomiting.
No bleeding was seen on the EGD and so recommendation for continuation of Lovenox (for bilateral PEs).
ISSUES OF TRANSITIONS IN CARE: # Communication: Mother [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91432**], sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91433**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91434**] share HCP # Code: Full (discussed with mother and confirmed with patient)  # PENDING STUDIES AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: - [**2130-8-29**] pleural fluid acid fast preliminary - [**2130-9-8**] bronchial washings acid fast preliminary # ISSUES TO FOLLOW UP ON: - the patient had subclinical hypothyroidism.
This may have been related to her acute illness so the TSH and T4 should be rechecked in about 6 months or so.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 4587**], You were admitted to the hospital because you had shortness of breath.
You were found to have a collapsed lung and you had tubes placed to repair the lung.
You were also found to have an infection in your lung and so you were treated with antibiotics.
You were also found to have bacteria in your blood, so another antibiotic was used.
As  you know, you had difficulty with eating and you became malnourished.
Also, you had clots in your lungs on both sides.
You were found to have an ulcer in your stomach and you will need another scope in [**5-10**] weeks to assess this as well as follow up with GI to follow up biopsy results.
