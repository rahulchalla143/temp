Hypoglycemia alone was most likely explanation for initial unresponsive state.
On night of presentation patient had intermittently low fingersticks requiring 1 amp of D50 on 2 separate occasions.
CT head negative for intracranial bleeding at presentation.
# Hypoglycemia / Diabetes: After initial night in the MICU with several D50 administrations, the patient had no more hypoglycemia while hospiatlized.
Patient was subjected to Q2H fingersticks on the floor to monitor for and acute drops in blood sugar; however, the patient was never below mid-100s.
Patient received multiple doses of insulin overnight to keep sugars from climbing over 400 (up to 20+ [**Location **]) and there was a concern for stacking due to patient's poor renal function; however, the patient's blood sugar never dropped.
Discussion with rheum consult also revealed possibility that hypoglycemia could be attributed to insulin autoantibodies that spontaneously release a large pool of insulin rather than antibodies to the insulin receptor itself.
Regardless, given patient's uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, dose of prednisone was reduced to 15 mg twice daily and patient was started on azathioprine prior to discharge.
# Chronic kidney disease: Patient presented with Cr of 6.5 up from his previous baseline of 5.5 to 6.0; however, this dose not represent a significant worsening of GFR.
Nephrology was consulted and reported that the patient had been approached about dialysis and about having a fistula placed in preparation, but he had thus far refused the idea of initiating preparation for dialysis.
He had recently been discontinued from the ACE inhibitor monapril in the outpatient setting for unclear reasons.
As his refractory hypertension was thought to be partially associated with volume status, the patient was started on [**Hospital1 **] 60 mg IV furosemide with appropriate diuresis and a reduction in his edema.
Hypoglycemia Secondary Diagnoses: 2.
Diabetes Mellitus 3.
Chronic Kidney Disease 4.
Hypertension 5.
Anemia 6.
You were found to have a very low blood sugar level.
Once you were transferred to the floor from the intensive care unit, you were observed on the floor due to concern for high blood pressure and low blood sugar.
