The day prior to admisssion she had substernal CP, diaphroesis which occured for a few minutes.
Her EKG showed NSR in the 90s with no ST segment changes, however her Trop was 1.8.
She was taken to cath today where she complained of chest pain.
She became acutely anxious and agitated.
As the procdure continued she began complaining of SOB and worsening chest pain so the procedure was stopped.
Here she is confused and only occasionally will answer questions.
She does admit to continued chest pain, but denies shortness of breath.

No acute fractures are identified.
There is hyperostosis frontalis.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 2 vessel obstructive coronary artery disease.
There were dual ostia giving rise to the LD and LCX.
The LAD had a tubular 65% stenosis in the proximal portion just before D1.
The LCX had a 95% subtotal occlusion in the AV groove segment immediately after OM1, which was a tortuous vessel.
The [**Month/Day (2) 11641**] had a hazy proximal 70% stenosis followed by a mid 75% stenosis.
The RCA tapered in the proximal to mid portion suggestive of moederated disease with diffuse plaquing througout.
Limited resting hemodyanmics demonstrated severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension with a SBP >200mm Hg.
There was evidence of diastolic heart failure with an elevated LVEDP of 23.
There was no transaortic valvular gradient on careful pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.
The patient became progressively uncomfortable, dysnpneic and  agitated during the procedure, which was terminatned.
Renal angiography was planned but not attempted.
Multivessel coronary artery disease involving LAD, [**Month/Day (2) 11641**], AV groove CX, with diffuse disease in the RCA.
Mild to moderate LV diastolic heart failure.
Severe systemic arterial hypertension.
Selective coronary angiography showed 2-vessel coronary artery disease.
There was a 90%  stenosis in the distal AV groove LCx that was of small caliber.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 175/75 mmHg.
Interim angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
Moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
[**12-27**] Echo There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-12-4**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo female with pmh of htn and DM admitted with an [**Hospital 7792**] transferred to the CCU after an attempted cath due to a hypertensive emergency secondary to anxiety and agitation.
She was taken to cath on [**12-25**] where she complained of chest pain.
She became acutely anxious and agitated.
As the procdure continued she began complaining of SOB and worsening chest pain so the procedure was stopped.
Her CP resolved as her anxiety and agitation decreased.
The heparin gtt was held given her recently elevated SBP due to the risk of hemorrahage.
She had elevated BS in the 430's which remained elevated after 6 units of humalog x2, so she was started on an insulin gtt until the morning when she was weaned off and given 4 units of lantus and covered with SSI.
She was delirious overnight and was given 5 mg of zyprexa x2 and 2.5 mg iv haldol x1 for agitation and required restraints to avoid her from climbing out of bed and pulling out her IVs.
The cath from [**12-25**] showed multivessel CAD involving the LAD, [**Last Name (LF) 11641**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] grrovve Cx, and diffuse disease of the RCA.
Problem Based Hospital Course:  # s/p NSTEMI:  The patient had no prior history of CAD, but had positive Cardiac enzymes in the setting of hypertensive emergency.
On cath, she was found to have multivessel CAD involving the LAD, [**Month/Day (2) 11641**], AV groove Cx, and diffuse disease in the RCA, however the major occlusion was a 95% subtotal occlusion of the AV groove Cx.
She underwent a second cath [**12-27**] as the first was terminated due to agitation and hypertension.
# Hypertensive Emergency:  Blood pressues controlled in the 130s-140s on discharge.
The patient had very labile blood pressures during admission and was placed transiently on a nitro drip.
# Chronic kidney disease Stage III: Patient with baseline Cr baseline 1.3-1.8.
Patient had tranient elevation in Cr that improved with fluids, likely sec to dye load.
Patient was called Saturday Evening on day of discharge to resume the above medications and the following blood pressure medications  Atenolol 25mg daily (patient has at home) Lisinopril 20mg daily (patient has at home) Amlodipine 10mg daily (this Medication called to [**Location (un) **] Pharmacy)   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Two vessel coronary artery disease Hypertension Secondary Hypercholesterolemia Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vitals stable   Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized because you had heart attack.
Additionally, your blood pressure was significantly elevated during your hospitalization.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet  If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms, please call your PCP or return to the ER.
