Admission Date:  [**2102-3-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-3-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2022-2-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: nausea, emesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2102-3-13**]: Retrievable IVC filter placed   History of Present Illness: This is a 80 year old woman with dementia (baseline oriented to self, location), seizures, HTN, on coumadin (reason unknown), breast cancer, carotid stenosis, presented to [**Last Name (un) 1724**] with with nausea and vomiting, found to have SBP >200 and 3cm cerebellar bleed on NCHCT with INR 4.9.
Her dementia at baseline is significant but she can answer simple questions and follow simple commands.
Past Medical History: Seizures:[**Doctor Last Name 11332**] mal Seizures for >20 yrs, last 2 years ago associated with hypokalemia always.
Breast CA s/p  left mastectomy Dementia (alert and oriented X2 at baseline, lives in ALF) R. hip fx ([**2100**]) s/p ORIF Carotid stenosis dementia hyponatremia hypokalemia DJD in spine tmj osteoporosis htn lacunar infarct L LE DVT [**4-/2101**]  Social History: Lives in nursing home, no ETOH/Tobacco.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Mild cogwheeling rigidity.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There are minimal bibasilar atelectases.
There are bilateral healed rib fractures.
Multiple surgical clips project in the left axilla  CT head [**2102-3-12**] FINDINGS: Again seen in the right cerebellum is a 3.2 x 4.2 cm hyperdense focus compatible with known cerebellar hemorrhage.
There is a small amount of surrounding edema, not significantly changed from the prior study, with mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
Hypoattenuation in the subcortical and periventricular white matter is likely sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
There is a right thalamic lacune, unchanged.
There are atherosclerotic calcifications in the cavernous portions of the carotid arteries bilaterally.
There is no shift from normally midline structures.
No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
IMPRESSION: No significant change from [**2102-3-11**] in right cerebellar hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
MRI Brain [**2102-3-12**] IMPRESSION: Extensive early subacute right cerebellar hematoma with significant mass effect and distortion of the fourth ventricle but no evidence of acute hydrocephalus.
Ring enhancement along the margins is less likely reactive, and raises suspicion for underlying lesion.
However, given the masking effect of T1 bright early subacute blood products, followup exam should be obtained sustantiate concern for underlying mass.
LENIS [**2102-3-13**] No DVT seen on bilateral lower extremities   CTA Pelvis/Abd [**2102-3-13**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Chronic thrombus within the left external iliac and common femoral vein which is diminutive in size.
There is air and dense contrast within these vessels, likely from attempted opacification during IVC-gram performed the same date.
Extensive arterial atherosclerotic calcifications within the caliber abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.
Superimposed cystitis cannot be excluded on CT. 4.
Extensive colonic diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis.
Osteopenia with chronic rib fractures, scoliosis and degenerative changes.
Head CT [**2102-3-14**] ReportIMPRESSION: Stable right cerebellar hemispheric hemorrhage with mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle with unchanged mild ventricular dilatation as well as unchanged mild right tonsillar herniation into the foramen magnum.
She had a L LE DVT in [**4-/2101**] and has been on coumadin since.
On the DOD, patient is afebrile, VSS, tolerating POS and pain is controlled.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] of Arlinton  Discharge Diagnosis: Right cerebellar hemorrhage Left femoral vein DVT   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
** Stroke Neurology would like to see you again in about [**2-10**] months with an MRI brain to assess for an  underlying mass.
Please follow-up in the [**Hospital 878**] Clinic, Dr [**First Name (STitle) **], in [**2-10**] months with a MRI Brain with and without contrast to assess for an underlying mass.
