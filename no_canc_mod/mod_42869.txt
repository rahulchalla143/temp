Admission Date:  [**2115-2-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2032-3-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5831**] Chief Complaint: labored breathing, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation [**2115-2-12**]  History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 101787**] is an 82 year old male with a history of hypertension, hyperthyroidism, depression and coronary artery disease who was recently admitted from [**Date range (2) 101788**] for a right basal ganglia bleed who was found to be unresponsive this morning.
Since discharge, patient has been verbal with single phrases, but minimal output per patient.
He has had some episodes of pneumonia and was treated at [**Hospital 8**] hospital.
Last night at 11:30 pm he was noted to have labored breathing.
He has a long history of elevated blood pressures and he had deferred his blood pressure pills and he was found to have a significant left arm, face and leg weakness with a left visual field cut and left complete hemisensory loss.
A stat NCHCT showed the presence of a right basal ganglia hemorrhage with interventricular extension.
He was noted to have one episode of vomitting in the ED, and was subsequently intubated for airway protection.
Initial vital signs were significant for elevated blood pressures to the 190s systolic.
A CTA head/neck was obtained in the ED which did not show any underlying vascular malformation.
An MRI of his C-spine did not show evidence of soft tissue or ligamentous injury, and subsequently his C-collar was discontinued.
Follow up CT scans did not show any hematoma expansion.
However, on his third hospital day, he was noted to have a new left sided VI nerve and possible IV nerve palsy, for which he received two doses of mannitol.
Following extubation, the patient's exam was such that he was abulic and mute but would follow simple midline and appendicular commands.
He had a left partial pupil sparing CNIII palsy and an almost complete left VI palsy.
He had significantly increased tone in all four extremities (legs>arms) with hyperreflexia and an upgoing toe on the left.
Given his continued hemodynamic and pulmonary stability, he was transferred to the step down unit of the Neurology wards on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 11.
[**Name (NI) **] began spiking fevers and CXR showed evidence of a pneumonia.
He was started on empiric Vanc and Zosyn to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia on [**2114-12-17**].
We repeated a head CT to ensure no acute findings.
This repeat CT showed only the evolution of the hemorrhage but no other findings of concern.
HEENT: NC/AT, poor oral hygeine, endotracheal tube in place Neck: rigidity, appears from cervical spine disease Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities:warm and well perfused Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Neurologic: -Mental Status: grimaces to noxious, but no eye opening.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities:warm and well perfused Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Face grossly symmetric  -Motor/ sensory: Hypertonic in b/l LE, LUE flaccid, no movement.
New small hyperdensity in the left thalamus, likely representing a small new hemorrhage.
Significant decrease in mass effect and there is no midline shift.
[**2115-2-12**] CXR Retrocardiac opacity likely representing consolidation and volume loss in the mid and lower left lung.
Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: He was admitted to the Neuro ICU for monitoring in the setting of the interval new small hemorrhage and for further antibiotic treatment and ventilatory support for a bilateral pneumonia.
He remained afebrile and was transitioned to levaquin to complete a total 10 day course for his pneumonia .
He will need to be monitored closely for signs of increasing residuals/delayed gastric emptying .
Heme: During the admission, he developed a 9 pt drop in his HCT.
It is most likely that he was hemoconcentrated/dehydrated on arrival and that his discharge HCT of 28 is closer to his baseline.
Disp:*5 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3504**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia History of intracranial hemorrhage hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Level of Consciousness: Alert, but not very interactive (minimally verbal) Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because you were found to have decreased level of alertness at your nursing home.
We obtained a Head CT that showed the changes expected with your prior brain bleed, and a very small area of bleeding on the other side (left).
You were admitted to the ICU for 2 days because you had a pneumonia and needed assistance breathing.
You were discharged to the floor in stable condition and remained afebrile for 2 days before you returned back to your facility.
