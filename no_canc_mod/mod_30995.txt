Admission Date:  [**2194-7-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2194-7-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2132-9-14**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction and four vessel coronary artery bypass graft who developed substernal chest pain while walking on the morning of admission.
The pain was similar in quality to that he experienced with his past myocardial infarction and did not respond to three sublingual nitroglycerins.
He presented to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department where he was noted to have [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in the lateral leads which persisted despite medical treatment.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2181**].
Status post myocardial infarction times two.
Elevated cholesterol.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  Morphine causes nausea and vomiting.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a temperature of 96.2.
In general, the patient was anxious and uncomfortable.
Head and neck exam revealed moist mucous membranes, anicteric sclera and no elevated jugular venous distention.
Cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities had no edema with 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
The patient was status post catheterization with a right femoral sheath in place and no hematoma.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute with right axis deviation, Q waves in leads V5 and V6, poor R wave progression with ST depressions in leads V1 through V3.
Left heart catheterization demonstrated the following: Left main coronary artery was normal, left anterior descending had a less than 50% proximal lesion, left circumflex had a 70% ostial lesion and totally occluded lesion distally at OM1.
The right coronary artery was totally occluded proximally with collaterals from the left anterior descending and OM.
The patient had persistent chest discomfort without ECG changes following catheterization attributed to post- infarction pericarditis, and a transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no pericardial effusion with an ejection fraction of 25 to 30%.
Also noted were inferolateral akinesis and inferior and anterior hypokinesis with mild mitral regurgitation.
On the fourth hospital day, the patient experienced recurrent anginal chest pain while climbing stairs with Physical Therapy.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated ST depressions in leads V3 and V4 which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
Later that evening, the patient experienced recurrent chest pain while at rest in bed and again his electrocardiogram had [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in V3 and V4.
Electrocardiogram changes and chest pain resolved with heparin, Integrilin, and nitroglycerin drip.
The following morning, he was taken for a repeat cardiac catheterization.
At this time, the previously stented saphenous vein graft to D1 to OM jump graft was found to be patent, and the 60% mid left anterior descending lesion was ballooned and stented.
The 80% ostial left circumflex lesion was also stented, and the 90% distal left circumflex lesion was ballooned only.
Following the procedure, the patient's chest pain resolved completely and he continued to be asymptomatic until the time of discharge.
The patient had a persistent tachycardia with heart rate ranging 90-100 and hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80s and 90s.
Status post myocardial infarction.
Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent of saphenous vein graft to D1 to OM graft, left anterior descending, and left circumflex arteries.
The patient should follow daily weights and call his physician if his weight increases by greater than two pounds per day.
