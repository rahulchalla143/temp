She has had a distant right nephrectomy after traumatic injury in [**2147**].
She presented to an outside hospital on the [**7-18**] with progressive shortness of breath.
She was initially treated for an exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She was seen by a nephrologist there and her shortness of breath was determined to be of possible cardiac origin and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2181-5-30**] for cardiac catheterization after having undergone a stress test, which was markedly positive.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cerebrovascular accident times two in [**2165**] and [**2174**], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal insufficiency.
The patient also has bilateral proximal ICA stenosis and chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  The patient states she has no known drug allergies.
Her echocardiogram revealed mild global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 40%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Renal medicine consult was obtained on the day of admission due to her chronic renal insufficiency with elevated creatinine.
On [**2181-6-6**] the patient underwent a carotid ultrasound, which showed a significant hemodynamic lesion in the left internal carotid artery with narrowing of approximately 60 to 70% with mild plaque and the right ICA with narrowing of less then 40%.
A cardiothoracic surgery consult was obtained on [**2181-6-4**] after cardiac catheterization demonstrated significant three vessel coronary artery disease.
The patient was placed on stress dose hydrocortisone due to her chronic Prednisone usage for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She was reinitiated on her Plavix due to her carotid artery disease and was transferred to the surgical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient continued to progress well, although she was slow to wean off supplemental oxygen due to some hypoxia.
She was being maintained on aspirin and Plavix due to her peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease and on the [**6-17**] postoperative day six a urology consultation was obtained.
It was their recommendation to continue the aspirin and the Plavix and to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9125**] as an outpatient for possible cystoscopy and CT scan or an MRI.
[**First Name (STitle) **] in one to two weeks for continued assessment and treatment of her ongoing hypertension.
