She was recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 76893**]) for right pleural effusion and 1.2L were removed.
It was consistent with a transudate and no malignant cells were seen.
ECHO showed EF >55% and no liver lesions seen on MRI.
The effusion was thought to be a sympathetic effusion from ascites.
However, 1-2 weeks prior to admission she began to become short of breath.
She is unable to sleep because she needs to sleep propped up due to SOB when supine.
She also reports increasing lower ext edema and increase in her abdominal girth.
She denied any abdominal pain, N/V/D/F/C.
She denies urinary symptoms.
She denies changes in bowel habits, denies melenotic stools or hematochezia.
HIV (CD4 670, vL ND [**1-/2178**]) - diagnosed in [**2157**], presumed from IVDU versus sexual transmission from husband, who was long-term IV drug user - started ART 1 year ago d/t elevated vL, low CD4 in setting of acute illness, per patient not diagnosed with OI 2.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis (HepC vL 1,090,000 [**3-/2177**]) - diagnosed in [**2176**] - on transplant list - complicated by ascites, encephalopathy, grade 1 varices - history of elevated AFP without focal liver lesions 3.
History of necrotizing fascitis [**2163**]   Social History: The patient lives with her mother and does not work due to diability.
The patient reported that she stopped consuming alcohol two years ago and prior to that only consumed very occasionally.
Family History: Her mother is currently alive and doing well but suffers from high blood pressure.
Physical Exam: Admission: VS: T 97, BP 114/76, HR 92, RR 18, 98% RA GEN: middle-aged women, generally well appearing with appropriate affect and behavior, who is lying in bed and speaking comfortable in no apparent distress, not dyspenic or tachypneic HEENT: moist mucous membranes NECK: supple, no JVD, no LAD CV: S1&S2 RRR, 2/6 SEM CHEST: decreased breath sounds on the right to [**Date range (1) 55744**] up the lung field with dullness to percussion in the same region.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2178-4-5**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2178-4-8**]):    NO GROWTH.
Cytology Pleural Fluid:   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CXR: [**4-1**] IMPRESSION: Large right pleural effusion, increased in size since prior study.
CXR: [**4-2**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-4**] and [**4-1**]:  Right lung base is still elevated but there has been a substantial decrease in the volume of right pleural effusion.
Substantial right lower lobe atelectasis persists, though improved.
No appreciable pneumothorax.
CXR: [**4-2**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-2**] at 6:31 p.m.  Elevation of the right lung base due in part to subpulmonic pleural effusion has worsened, and volume of right pleural fluid layering posteriorly and collecting in fissures has increased.
Severe atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobe persists.
No pneumothorax.
Large right pleural effusion.
No evidence of acute hemothorax.
Complete right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe collapse likely secondary to the adjacent large right pleural effusion.
6-mm peribronchovascular nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe which is new compared to the prior study and is most likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
There is no change in the right pigtail catheter.
There is no change in the position of the right hemidiaphragm and the degree of aeration of the right lung base.
The left basal atelectasis is new since [**2178-4-3**], chest radiograph but is not included in the field of view of the study obtained on [**2178-4-4**], at 4:24 p.m. No pneumothorax is present.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and no failure is seen.
Significant decrease in right pleural effusion.
Small to moderate right pleural effusion remains.
There is new minimal pneumothorax on the right following pigtail catheter placement.
New atelectasis at the left lung base.
Moderate loss of aeration in the right lower lobe.
This could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.
Indeterminate nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe.
No change in the appearance of the right pleural effusion and no evidence of pneumothorax.
The mild opacification in the retrocardiac area has reduced since the previous study.
# Hemothorax: The patient was found to have reaccumulation of her right pleural effusion over a 4 week period.
A CXR on admission showed right effusion likely a sympathetic effusion secondary to ascites.
The patient's INR was 2.2 and she recieved 4U of FFP and underwent thoracentesis at the bedside and 1.6L were removed [**4-2**].
The fluid was consistent with a transudate, cultures negative and cytology negative for malignant cells.
During the night the patient became hypoxic requiring 2-3L NC and Hct drop to 22.8 from 27.2 .
The patient under CT scan of the chest that showed large right pleural effusion that was not consistent with hemothorax.
The patient remained stable, but again became hypoxic on [**4-4**] requiring NRB and continued Hct drop to 17.
A repeat diagnostic thorocentesis revealed bloddy fluid.
Repeat CT scan and CXRs showed continued small right pleural effusion.
Her pain was controled with demerol and oxycodone.
# Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine peaked at 1.5 in the setting of acute bleed.
# Hepatitis C: Currently on the transplant list.
Lung Nodule: CT-scan showed indeterminate nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, measures about 7 mm.
# FEN: Low sodium .
# Access: PIV .
Percocet 10-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for pain for 1 weeks: Do not drive while taking this medication.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of fluid in your lungs.
