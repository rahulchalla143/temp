While looking at the paintings, suddenly he noted that he had some difficulty in seeing things on the left side.
he didnt have any other symptoms and immediatley told his wife.

DISCHARGE EXAM (pertinent): CV: irregular rate, no murmurs NEURO: visual fields full to confrontation and with red pin examination.
Mild cogwheeling, stooped posture and turning en bloc, positive pull test.
Diminished L knee jerk.
Atrophy of R calf and EDB.
Region of abnormally-increased MTT within the right PCA territory, involving a large portion of the right occipital lobe with a smaller region of decreased rCBV in the same distribution is consistent with a small "core" of infarcted tissue surrounded by a penumbra of ischemic tissue.
There is an associated abrupt "cut-off" of the P2-P3 segment of the right PCA, with "meniscus" appearance, suggestive of acute embolic occlusion.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Minimal calcified plaque at the origin of the right vertebral artery, without hemodynamically-significant stenosis.
Small acute infarctions within the right PCA territory, specifically within the right body/tail of the hippocampus, right temporal lobe, and right thalamus.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
ECHO No cardiac source of embolism seen.
R PCA STROKE The patient presented with a left superior quadrantanopsia.
A code stroke was called and the CT/CTA/CT perfusion showed a R P2 cut-off, with large penumbra in that vascular territory.
MRI was done 24 hours after tPA, there was no bleed, and 3 small areas of infarction in the R medial temporal lobe and thalamus, consistent with PCA stroke.
The etiology was most likely atrial fibrillation.
CTA showed no other vascular abnormalities in the posterior circulation.
Transthoracic echo showed mild left atrial enlargement, but normal global systolic function, and bubble study was negative for ASD/PFO.
The patient was started on dabigatran (Pradaxa) for stroke with atrial fibrillation.
He was seen by PT/OT, and given a prescription for outpatient PT for his Parkinsons.
?RADICULOPATHY The patient had a diminished L knee jerk compared to the right side.
He has a history of chronic low back pain, though denies any radiating pains down the legs.
He likely has bilateral radiculopathy.
He had 1 episode of rapid ventricular response at rest that resolved with 1 dose of IV metoprolol.
He did have tachycardia to 140-160s during this exercise, but remained asymptomatic.
Outpatient Physical Therapy evaluate and treat diagnosis: Parkinsons 4. amantadine 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for parkinson's disease.
5. carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QAM AND Q NOON () as needed for parkinson's disease.
7. pramipexole 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QPM (once a day (in the evening)) as needed for Parkinson's Disease.
8. pramipexole 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO NOON (At Noon) as needed for Parkinson's Disease.
9. pramipexole 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QAM (once a day (in the morning)) as needed for Parkinson's Disease.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: R PCA stroke atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a small stroke caused by a blocked blood vessel.
The stroke was caused by atrial fibrillation.
