Admission Date:  [**2183-10-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2183-11-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-9-5**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old female with a history of CHF and peripheral vascular disease with cardiac risk factors significant for elevated cholesterol, hypertension, 70 pack year history of tobacco and increased age, who presented with a two week history of progressive shortness of breath with acute exacerbation in the 24 hours prior to admission.
The patient was in her usual state of health until two weeks prior to admission when she developed slowly progressive shortness of breath.
There were no associated fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, cough, chest pain or lightheadedness.
The patient reported to have gone to the bathroom and shortly after returning to bed developed acute onset exacerbation of shortness of breath approximately 24 hours before admission.
Chest x-ray demonstrated florid pulmonary edema.
The patient was started on Lasix 20 mg IV times two and was also started on BiPAP for respiratory distress.
The patient was evaluated in the emergency department by the CCU team and noted to have both hemodynamic instability as well as respiratory distress.
Physical exam was notable for decreased heart sounds with normal S1, S2.
Lungs were clear to auscultation in the upper half with bilateral crackles half way down the lower lung fields posterior greater than anterior.
She had nonpalpable bilateral lower extremity pulses, however, both were dopplerable.
She had 1+ femoral pulses bilaterally and demonstrated no clubbing, cyanosis or edema in four extremities.
Admitting EKG was significant for a-fib which was taken down in the E.D.
She demonstrated left bundle pattern with ST depressions in V5 and V6.
EKG was consistent with LVH with strain and possible dig effect as the patient takes dig at home.
A few hours after admission EKG converted to normal sinus rhythm which continued to demonstrate LVH with ST depressions in V5 and V6 that were also consistent with dig effect.
Chest x-ray on admission demonstrated bilateral vascular markings that went out to the periphery, curly B lines, questionable right middle lobe infiltrate as well as diffuse opacification of her lung fields consistent with florid pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION:  At that point the patient was assessed to be a 69 year old female with a history of CHF, peripheral vascular disease with flash pulmonary edema probably secondary to fluid overload as well as new onset a-fib who was experiencing acute renal insufficiency as well as currently in respiratory distress.
The decision was made for the patient to undergo diagnostic catheterization to evaluate for possible cause of rising cardiac enzymes.
Cath demonstrated main coronary artery stenosis of 20%, left anterior descending demonstrating moderate diffuse disease with serial 50% stenoses before and after D2 and D1 of 50%.
The patient experienced loss of both potassium and magnesium secondary to diuresis and was repleted as needed.
On the night of admission the patient was noted to have a fever spike to 103.8 and was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia.
She remained afebrile through the course of her hospital stay and was receiving a 10 day course of Flagyl and Levaquin for treatment of possible aspiration pneumonia.
safety evaluation and VNA followup visit to evaluate patient's aspiration precautions.
[**Last Name (STitle) 36361**], on Friday, [**11-7**], at 10:45 when she should have her electrolytes checked, especially potassium and magnesium which had been running low, as well as INR as the patient had been receiving heparin and Coumadin while hospitalized.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  CHF with flash pulmonary edema secondary to a-fib and volume overload.
