Admission Date:  [**2182-5-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-5-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-6-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lasix / Betalactams / Haldol / Ceftriaxone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10370**] Chief Complaint: Tachypnea, hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 61 yo Russian-speaking man w/anoxic brain injury and with hx of  DMI, s/p cadaveric kidney transplant([**2175**]), h/o CVA and chronic  aspiration (multiple admissions for aspiration PNA - last [**3-19**]),  CABG in [**2170**], widespread tracheomalacia with trach stent, and recent admission to the ICU from [**Date range (2) 21579**] for PNA, stent removal and tracheostomy.
He was seen by IP due to possible air leak as he was pulling tidal volumes of 200.
Past Medical History: - Cadaveric renal transplant in [**2175**] - CVA-residual right hemiparesis - DM Type I - HTN - Hx non-QMI and Vfib arrest [**2169**] with anoxic brain injury - CAD/CABG [**2170**] - Swallow study-showed silent aspiration - hx of aspiration pneumonia - tracheomalacia after long intubation requiring trach stent and button complicated by site cellulitis and granulation tissue requiring cryoptherapy.
Family History: No history of lung disease   Physical Exam: General: Awake, in no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Course breath sounds bilaterally, left sided rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: + foley with brown sediment Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: TRANSTHORACIC ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and apical septal akinesis/dyskinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Focal apical septal hypokinesis was present previously.
Inferolateral /inferior akinesis is new (there may have mild inferior hypokinesis previously).
Distended azygous contour, could represent volume overload with part of the RUL opacity representing early edema.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia with mild volume overload.
Hyperdensity projecting over the left inferolateral frontal lobe (3:20) is likely a bone-related artifact in the setting of motion.
Otherwise, there is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema or major vascular territorial infarct.
The prominent ventricles and sulci are unchanged in size or configuration.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Moderate periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are compatible with known chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
There is persistent moderate opacification of the left sphenoid sinus.
No evidence of an acute intracranial process on motion-limited evaluation.
Moderate chronic microvascular ischemic disease with numerous lacunar infarcts.
Unchanged moderate opacification of the left sphenoid sinus without evidence of acute sinusitis.
There is increased aeration at the left base with minimal residual atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old man with history of multiple strokes, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after witnessed aspiration event with hypoxia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and NSTEMI.
Hypoxia: This was most likely due to an acute aspiration event given his history and witnessed aspiration.
He was initially covered with broad spectrum antibiotics although culture grew out sparse commensals and imaging was thought to be more consistent with atelectasis and volume overload than pneumonia so antibiotics were stopped after two days.
NSTEMI: Patient with EKG changes, elevated cardiac biomarkers with troponinT peaking at 1.8, and transthoracic echo with new wall motion abnormalities.
After discussion with the patient's wife it was decided not to pursue cardiac catheterization due to the patient being 5 days post medically treated NSTEMI and the complications that could arise with this procedure.
CHF: Patient was found to be volume overloaded on admission.
This was thought to be the cause of his initial hypoxia and was probably caused by his NSTEMI given the new wall motion abnormalities and depressed EF of 35-40% (previously 55%) on TTE.
He was treated with bumex boluses and his volume overload resolved.
# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: In the emergency department, he had hyperglycemia, an anion gap in the twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.
He had several episoded of hypoglycemia on his home dose of glargine that were atributed to poor PO intake.
He then had episodes of hyperglycemia and his HSS was adjusted further.
Acute renal failure: He was found to have an elevated creatinine of 2.2, up from his baseline of 1.1-1.3.
This was thought to be pre-renal azotemia in the setting of dehydration with osmotic diuresis due to DKA and poor forward flow due to his NSTEMI and acute CHF exacerbation.
The renal transplant team was consulted given his history of cadevaric renal transplant in [**2175**].
Once his renal function returned to his baseline enlapril was re-started without complications.
Altered mental status: Patient was found to have acute mental status change after he was transfered to the cardiology service from the ICU.
This was thought to be due delirium as the patient was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] between agitation and somnolence.
A CT head was done to evaluate for an intracranial process causing his AMS but this was negative.
His tacrolimus level was monitored closely in the setting of acute renal failure.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital-[**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: NSTEMI  Secondary Diagnosis: Cadaveric renal transplant in [**2175**] - CVA-residual right hemiparesis - Hx NSTEMI and Vfib arrest [**2169**] with anoxic brain injury - Swallow study-showed silent aspiration - hx of aspiration pneumonia - tracheomalacia after long intubation requiring trach stent and  button complicated by site cellulitis and granulation tissue requiring cryoptherapy.
- recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheal stent removal and tracheostomy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were initially admitted to the intensive care unit were they treated you for pneumonia.
Upon further testing you were found to have had a small heart attack.
Your heart attack caused acute systolic heart failure that we treated with diuretics.
We spoke with your family about doing a cardiac catheterization but this was not pursued as you had already been treated medically.
