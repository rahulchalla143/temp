She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] where head CT showed 4mm acute epidural hemorrhage vs subdural hemorrhage w/very mild midline shift as well as suspected L eye globe hemorrhage.
A repeat CT Head demonstrated no interval change in what was determined to be an epidural hematoma.

Inferolateral ST-T wave changes consistent with digoxin effect.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Given this, no focal consolidation is seen.
There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle which is likely positional, although a trace effusion cannot be entirely excluded.
No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
No displaced fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION: No focal consolidation.
Minimal blunting of the left  costophrenic angle is likely positional, although a very trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Mild cardiomegaly.
FINDINGS: There is extensive soft tissue swelling of the left periorbital and preseptal region.
The left globe contour is intact with no CT evidence of rupture, but ophthalmology examination is advised.
There is hemorrhage seen within the left globe both in the anterior and posterior [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
Vitreous hemorrhage is seen contiguous with the anterior chamber hemorrhage.
The hemorrhage within the posterior chamber along the posterior aspect of the globe likely represents choroidal hemorrhage/detachment as the hemorrhage is seen to cross the optic nerve.
No retrobulbar hematoma is seen.
Osseous structures of the orbits appear intact with no fluid or blood seen within the paranasal air spaces.
Minimal mucosal thickening is seen in the left maxillary sinus.
Vitreous hemorrhage is seen contiguous with the anterior chamber hemorrhage.
Posterior hyperdensity most likely represents choroidal hemorrhage/detachment.
2) Left periorbital and preseptal soft tissue swelling/hematoma without underlying fracture seen.
No retrobulbar hematoma.
FINDINGS: There is a small 4-mm epidural hematoma seen in the left occipitoparietal region with possible subdural hematoma extension, unchanged from previous outside hospital study.
There are periventricular white matter hypodensities most likely representing chronic small vessel disease.
There is mild prominence of the ventricles but the sulci are of normal size and configuration.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is extensive soft tissue swelling in the left periorbital and preseptal region.
There is hemorrhage seen within the left globe in the posterior and anterior chamber as well as the vitreous.
The posterior hemorrhage most likely represents choroidal hemorrhage.
There is no hemorrhage seen within the orbits or evidence of extraocular muscle entrapment.
There is opacification of several ethmoid air cells on the left, which most likely represent inflammatory changes; however, hemorrhage cannot be ruled out.
4-mm epidural hematoma in the left parieto-occipital region with possible adjacent subdural hematoma.
Hemorrhage in the left globe both in the posterior and anterior [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
Posterior hemorrhage most likely represents choroidal hemorrhage.
See dedicated maxillofacial CT for further details.
Opacification of a very few left mastoid air cells, most likely representing inflammation; however, but in the setting of trauma, hemorrhage and a nondisplaced temporal bone fracture can not be excluded.
If there is clinical concern, temporal bone CT can be obtained.
FINDINGS: Foci of hyperdensity in the left occipitoparietal region previously described as epidural hematoma are more likely in the subdural space.
There is evidence of thin subdural hematoma, unchanged from the prior study.
Mild prominence of ventricles and sulci are unremarkable for the patient's age.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are unchanged from the prior study.
Soft tissue swelling in the left periorbital, preseptal region is unchanged.
Amorphous material in poster chamber and hyperdense layering material in dorsal part of the left globe.
No fractures are seen in the osseous structures.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F (Haitian Creole speaking) with baseline dementia/psychosis presented to OSH after unwitnessed fall with subdural hematoma, hemorrhage in anterior and posterior chamber of left globe, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management.
# Hypertensive Urgency: Patient on nicardipine gtt in the ED that was stopped secondary to hypotension.
Neuro checks q 4hrs with no acute changes.
Cardiac enzymes were sent and were negative for acute ischemic event.
Patient is paranoid/actively hallucinating and believes that staff is trying to poison her and so would not take PO meds.
# Subdural hematoma: Stable on repeat head CT, with no need for neurosurgical intervention at this time.
Neuro exam non-focal, neuro checks q4 hours throughout hospitalization showed no acute changes.
Final Report of his repeat head CT ([**8-30**]) showed "unchanaged areas of subdural hematoma when compared to the study from [**2180-8-29**].
#Episode of unresponsiveness on [**2180-9-1**]: The patient was unable to be arroused by sternal rub and so an extensive and emergent unresponsiveness workup ensued.
A NCHCT showed no acute changes.
Infection unlikely as CBC wnl and no fever.
The patient was loaded on dilantin and there was no seizure activity on EEG.
The patient did have some cogwheeling on exam and had received haldol for hyperactive delerium about 24 hours before the episode, and so extrapyrimidal symptoms secondary to dopaminergic medication was considered; patient treated with benztropine and patient returned to baseline.
# L globe hemorrhage: Patient evaluated by optho in the ED and were initially discussing role for surgery although there was no acute need.
No fevers or leukocytosis to invoke infectious process.
No events on telemetry.
# Urinary retention:  patient had difficulty urinating at times throughout her admission.
Patient was not drinking much during her admission, and so low volume status could have been a contributor.

After you fell, you have been diagnosed with multiple bleeds in your brain and left eye.
In the future, you should avoid one medicine in particular which is called Haldol or haloperidol.
