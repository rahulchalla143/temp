Brief Hospital Course: 89 yo female with dementia transferred from OSH for traumatic SDH on [**2167-8-28**] and discharged on [**2167-9-4**].
# SDH: Ocurred in setting of trauma at her nursing home.
Pt had a repeat head CT 12 hrs after the first head CT which did not show interval change.
Mental status remains altered from baseline which certainly could be related to SDH but is likely also a manifestation of delirium.
She was extubated on [**2167-8-29**] without complications.
# Aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.
While in the MICU, patient was suspected to have aspiration pneumonia and was treated with Unasyn [**2167-8-30**]- [**2167-9-2**].
However, she had episodes of loose bowel movement, nausea and vomiting with repeat CXR showing retrocardiac opacification, suggesting aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
Patient's respiratory symptoms and lowered O2 saturation was treated with O2 supplement and morphine as needed.
Discussion was made with family regarding her diet, and daughter agrees to trials of oral food at this time, knowing that she has increased risk of aspiration.
# Metabolic acidosis, noted on [**2167-9-3**] after the event mentioned above.
No additional monitoring was done after discussion with family regarding goal of care.
# Acute renal failure, noted on [**2167-9-3**] after the event mentioned above, likely result of nausea, vomiting, and loose bowel movement.
No additional monitoring was done after discussion with family regarding goal of care.
