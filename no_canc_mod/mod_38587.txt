Serial echocardiograms have shown a progressive decrease in his aortic valve area and now a slightly depressed left ventricular function.
He is symptomatic with dyspnea and chest heaviness with exertion as well as a generalized fatigue.
Given the progression of his disease and early decline in LV function, he has been referred for surgical management.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=40-45 %).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: There is a mechanical valve in the aortic position.
There is no evidence of paravalvular leaks.
The LV systolic function remains mildly impaired, unchanged from pre-op, estimated EF=40-45%.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
He received Cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without complication.
He remained in a normal sinus rhythm without atrial or ventricular arrhythmias.
