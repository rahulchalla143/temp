He was discharged to rehab and presented with hypotension to the 70's systolic nd lower abdominal/left lower extremity pain for the previous day.
He began to have LLE swelling the previous day and underwent duplex ultrasound demonstrating a DVT in his left common femoral vein.
He was given 3u pRBC, FFP, and Vitamin K. CT scan demonstrated large RP hematoma and he was taken to IR for possible embolization.
Catheterization of left lumbar arteries at L2, L3 and L4 with angiography,Common iliac artery angiogram, left internal iliac artery angiogram and a left internal epigastric artery angiogram.No source of bleeding was identified despite catheterization of all visualized lumbar vessels, the left common iliac, internal and external iliac and left internal epigastric arteries.
Because of his DVT and his demonstrated tendency to bleed he required an IVC filter.
The hematoma also appeared to compress the left ureter and Urology was consulted because ehis creatinine was trending downwards it was determined that the patient did not require a ureteral stent.
There were no acute events overnight and he was made NPO for his IVC filter placement.
Interventional radiology declined draining the hematoma because there was no evidence of extravasation.
On [**2126-6-26**] he received his IVC filter placement with no complications.
Post operatively his groin was stable with no hematoma.
Urology evaluated the patient for L ureter compression.
