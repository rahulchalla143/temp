She reports symptoms were present for two days prior to admission.
On initial admission she was found to be anemic with workup showing multiple lacerations in the stomach.
Echo showed EF of 55% with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Cath showed mild pulm HTN, LM 60%, LAD 80%, LCx 60%, RCA 90%.

No edema, trace varicosities.
Her underlying rhythm was a SR with first degree AV-block.
Her heart rhythm continued as a first degree block with multiple bursts of atrial fibrillation continuing until post-operative day 12 -- these bursts were rate controlled with IV lopressor.
She was put on coumadin for these continued bursts of atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative six she had an acute desaturation thought to be related to a possible aspiration event.
CXR at this time showed a right lower lobe opacity.
A nutrition consult was obtained because of the thoughts of possible aspiration and they recommended regular diet/regular consistency as patient had no signs/symptoms of aspiration.
Sputum culture from [**10-23**] grew sensitive Staph aureus.
A workup of the possible sources of infection was undertaken with final diagnosis being probable aspiration pneumonia with possible early C. diff infection.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 14218**] also experienced a significant degree of post-operative confusion and anxiety for which the neurology service was consulted on post-operative day two.
Her initial head CT was negative for any acute infarct and reason for confusion was thought to be sedative medications.
