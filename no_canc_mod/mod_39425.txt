Small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci of the right temporo-parietal lobe.
Hyperdense focus in the right frontal lobe, likely contusion.
Possible contusion in the left frontal lobe.
Fracture of the right zygomatic arch and lateral wall of the right maxillary sinus with hemorrhagic fluid within the right maxillary sinus.
Facial bone fractures are better seen on subsequent CT sinus.
Subcutaneous emphysema as outlined above.
No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment of the cervical spine.
Displaced fractures of the second and third ribs on the right.
Left apical pneumothorax and atelectasis at the lung apices.
Large amount of subcutaneous emphysema tracking to the fascial planes of the neck.
No evidence of airway injury.
Minimally displaced fractures of the right zygomatic arch, and lateral and anterior walls of the right maxillary sinus with hemorrhagic fluid within the sinus cavity.
Minimally displaced fractures of the bilateral orbital roof with a small amount of associated subcutaneous emphysema.
Mucosal thickening in the ethmoidal sinus as well as minimal mucosal thickening in the left maxillary and left sphenoid sinus.
Cervical subcutaneous emphysema, better assessed on concurrent C-spine study.
[**1-7**] SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) TRAUMA RIGHT Bone fragments projecting superior to the narrowed acromioclavicular joint could be acute avulsions.
There also appear to be areas of erosion on the distal clavicle suggesting a chronic degenerative component.
The head of the humerus is smooth, and there is no dislocation.
No new focal consolidation.
Increased small right pleural effusion and new, loculated, right pleural or extrapleural fluid, could be due to interval bleeding of displaced rib fractures.
Pulmonary edema has resolved.

Plastic surgery saw the patient and determined that her facial fractures were nonoperative and she will follow up with them in clinic and sinus precautions while she was hospitalized.
Her pain was difficult to manage because of the suboxone but became manageable after the medication cleared her system.
acute pain consult - unable to place epidural.
She remained alert and oriented and neuro checks were performed q8h, with no changes in neuro status.
Her pain was frequently assessed and she remained on the Dilaudid PCA initially and was transitioned to an oral narcotic pain regimen subsequently, with which she reported adequate pain relief.
She was placed on telemetry with continuous O2 monitoring given her rib fractures.
The patient denied SOB and incentive spirometry and pulmonary toileting were encouraged.
However, difficulty remained weaning supplemental oxygen and a chest xray was obtained  on [**1-9**] which showed a very small right pleural effusion  (old) and new, small loculated, right pleural or extrapleural fluid.
However the xray showed resolution of prior pulmonary edema when compared to prior xrays, no new focal consolidation, and no evidence of prior pneumothorax seen initially on CT scan at admission.
The patient continued to deny any shortness of breath, and O2 her sats at discharge remained between 89-93% on RA (patient with significant smoking history).
A foley catheter was placed on admission and removed on [**1-5**], at which time she voided without difficulty.
Plastic surgery was consulted initially for her facial fractures.
It was determined that her facial fractures did not require operative intervention at that time.
Orthopedics was consulted for new complaints of right shoulder pain.
She was noted to have weakness in her right shoulder which may be secodary to pain vs. from a rotator cuff injury.
However it was decided that there was no acute injury and the patient was scheduled for orthopedic follow up as an outpatient.
Opthlomology was consulted when the patient was in the ICU for her eye fracture who deferred to the plastic surgery team for acute management and recommended routine annual exams for DM/HTN.
Neurosurgery was consulted initially for cerebral ecchymosis and SAH.

You sustained multiple injuries including a small head bleed and bruising, multiple facial fractures, multiple rib fractures, and a laceration on your neck.
You are being discharged with the following instructions:  You sustained rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
You should take your pain medicine as as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedation, take half the dose and notify your physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is a complication of rib fractures.
You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short periods may ease the pain.
Return to the ED right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your rips (crepitus).
If your doctor allows, non steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs are very effective in controlling pain (i.e.
You were also seen by the opthomology doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 1028**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were in the hospital who recommended that you have annual eye exams given your history of diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure.
