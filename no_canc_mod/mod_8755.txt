Brief Hospital Course: 66 y/o female with CAD s/p acute IMI [**3-/2091**] managed with thromboylysis and succesful PTCA and stenting of the distal RCA, EF 50% on most recent echo, DM, HTN, HLD, now transferred from an outside hospital with increasing chest pain, occuring at rest, relieved with Ntg spray.
She ruled in for MI with Troponin 0.35, 2.62.
EKG with anterolateral t wave inversions.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
