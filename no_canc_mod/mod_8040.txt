Bibasilar atelectasis with no definite focal consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo F presents with tremors, weakness, falls and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Hypercarbic and Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to hypoventilation from opioids/benzodizapenes with possible contribution from asthma/COPD exacerberation plus H. influenzae CAP.
Also concern for ingestion given difficult social situation at home (husband with multiple myeloma, verbally abusive per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 12883**]), h/o depression and positive amphetamines, although patient adamantly denies any inappropriate ingestions.
She was placed on a fast steroid taper for possible asthma exacerbation.
She was noted to be volume overloaded secondary to extensive fluids given during initial presentation.
She was also noted to have a high TSH and as such, her synthroid dose was increased though this is not very likely to be the cause of her tremor.
Altered Mental Status: UTox screen positive for amphetamines and opiates plus her home meds.
Also, home meds plus acute renal failure may have worsened mental status.
Possibly secondary to pre-renal etiology in setting of acute illnes and improvement with IVFs.
