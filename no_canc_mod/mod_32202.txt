INDICATION: 51-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: There is mild increase to the degree of communicating hydrocephalus width the left lateral ventricle currently measuring 19 mm, previously measuring 17 mm.
There is no evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures or evidence of new major territorial infarct.
Basilar artery tip coiling is again noted with streak artifact obscuring detail in this region.
Linear hyperdensity within the left sylvian fissure is less apparent on the current study (series 2, image 11).
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain clear.
No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage or major territorial infarct.

Provisional Findings Impression: AFSN SUN [**2123-9-19**] 4:47 PM PFI: Moderate ventriculomegaly with ventricular size increased since the CT of [**2123-9-18**].
Mild nonocclusive vasospasm on CT angiography.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient is status post coiling, rule out vasospasm.
FINDINGS:  CT HEAD:  There is a moderate dilatation of the ventricles identified with prominent of temporal horns indicative of communicating hydrocephalus.
Left-sided shunt track is visualized from frontal region extending to the ventricles.
There is no evidence of loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation seen.
No evidence of hemorrhage identified.
CT PERFUSION:  CT perfusion demonstrates symmetric mean transit time, blood volume and blood flow bilaterally.
No focal abnormalities are seen to indicate ischemia or infarct.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY:  CT angiography demonstrates mild non-occlusive spasm of the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
A small protuberance at the origin of left posterior cerebral artery appears to be due to the residual portion of the aneurysm.
There is no vascular occlusion identified.
Moderate ventriculomegaly with temporal horns are slightly increased since the previous CT of [**2123-9-18**].
Normal CT perfusion without focal abnormalities.
CT angiography demonstrates status post coiling of the basilar tip aneurysm with a small residual portion of the aneurysm on the left mid aspect near the origin of posterior cerebral artery.
Mild non-occlusive vasospasm is visualized.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Wet Read: JXKc MON [**2123-9-6**] 3:52 AM WET READ: Non-contrast CT: Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with hemorrhage layering within the lateral ventricles bilaterally and associated hydrocephalus.
CTA: 1.0 cm fusiform basilar tip aneurysm, with two saccular 5 mm aneurysms involving the right MCA (one involving M1 segment just proximal to the bifurcation, and one at the bifurcation), and a 3 mm aneurysm arising from the left ICA.
- jkang   Final Report HISTORY: 51-year-old woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CT HEAD: There is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage tracking in the sylvian fissures bilaterally, and extending into the interpeduncular cistern.
There is intraventricular blood layering the occipital horns bilaterally.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation is preserved and there is no evidence for infarction.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized and clear.
CTA HEAD: The intracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries are patent without evidence for stenosis.
There are multiple aneurysms visualized.
There are two additional aneurysms in the right MCA, one measuring 6 mm in the M1 segment just proximal to the bifurcation, and a slightly smaller aneurysm measuring 4 mm at the bifurcation.
There are small infundibulums at the origin of the left PCOM and a left lenticulostriate artery.
However, there is no definite left ICA aneurysm.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage involving bilateral sylvian fissures extending into the anterior cistern and anterior to the brainstem.
Multiple aneurysms as described above in the right MCA and at the basilar tip.
