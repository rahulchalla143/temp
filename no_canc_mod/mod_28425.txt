He turned up Lyme IgM (+) with 2 band of IgG positivity as well as CMV IgM and IgG positive.
On neurological exam on discharge, he still has significant facial weakness B/L, but can now show twinges of movement, which represents an improvement.
He has had a persistent tachycardia to the 100's to 110's that we feel is likely secondary to dysautonomia secondary to the GBS.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: GBS   Discharge Condition: still with B/L LE and UE weakness and facial weakness, but improving.
