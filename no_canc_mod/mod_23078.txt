Bilateral periventricular white matter hypodensities especially within bilateral frontal lobes are likely related to chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
There is no depressed skull fracture.
There are mucosal retention cysts within the right maxillary sinus.
There is mild right nasal septal deviation with right-sided sparing.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
CT C-Spine ([**8-13**]) FINDINGS: There is no fracture.
There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of C3 upon C4 with mild posterior disc bulge causing mild narrowing of the spinal canal at this level.
There is disc space narrowing and posterior disc osteophyte formation at C5-C6 causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
There is facet joint hypertrophy and uncovertebral spurring causing mild-moderate right neural foraminal narrowing at C3- C4 and also facet joint hypertrophy and uncovertebral spurring causing mild-moderate right neural foraminal narrowing at C5-C6.
IMPRESSION: No fracture of the cervical spine.
Mild grade I anterolisthesis of C3 upon C4.
While this finding may be degenerative in etiology, an MRI is recommended for evaluation of ligamentous and spinal cord injury.
Multilevel degenerative changes with mild-moderate central canal narrowing and right neural foraminal narrowing at C3-C4 and C5-C6.
ERCP ([**8-13**]) - Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
There was a small amount of biliary sludge on the papilla which was cleared.
No fresh or old blood seen.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a balloon catheter over the existing guidewire.
The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts were filled with contrast and well visualized.
The course and caliber of the structures are normal with no evidence of extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities, and no filling defects A balloon sweep was performed which did not show any blood or stones.
