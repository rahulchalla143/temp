ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
This is a 56-year-old male who has had several week symptoms including dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] and transferred for cardiac catheterization on [**2142-11-19**] to [**Doctor First Name **]-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Cardiac catheterization revealed 80% left main disease and 100% right coronary artery disease.
The patient's creatinine level prior to admission was 3.8 and ranged to 4.2 precatheterization with his chronic renal insufficiency due to his diabetes and hypertension.
The patient also had decreased urine output and a blood pressure of 65 for which he was administered 2 mg of Neo-Synephrine and administered Lasix for the decreased urine output.
They also felt that the patient's volume status appeared intravascularly depleted with a low CVP and they recommended to give volume and hold the diuretics.
They thought that the metabolic acidosis was secondary to acute renal failure and, therefore, to administer the bicarbonate as suggested earlier.
The patient was still with variable urine output and acidosis.
with meals for phosphorus binding.
with meals for increasing the phosphorus until the phosphorus level was less than 5, decrease the Zantac from 150 mg p.o.
However, they do not want to remove fluid too quickly whether by diuresis or hemodialysis because this might induce more hypotension and it would decrease the patient's chance for renal recovery.
The Renal attending came by the same day and stated that once a line is placed he felt that it would be necessary to proceed with hemodialysis and ultrafiltration, at which time they will give some IV Epogen.
Renal came by and saw the patient again, at which time they stated that there was no need for dialysis that day; however, he may need it in the morning.
with meals and snacks for hyperphosphatemia and the patient received Epogen yesterday for his mild anemia.
They recommended to check the patient's calcium and phosphorus and to avoid NSAIDs, to use Lactulose for constipation and to avoid magnesium-containing compounds due to his renal failure.
On postoperative day number nine, regarding 24-hour events, the patient was reportedly feeling well and anxious to leave the hospital.
They recommended to repeat a stat potassium and if the potassium was better to hold off on hemodialysis with the potassium being 5.0 with slight hemolysis that day.
The physical examination remained unchanged with lungs that were clear and lower extremities with mild edema.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three on [**2142-11-20**].
Chronic renal failure.
