History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old male with known CAD and AS/bicuspid valve.
He has a history of a positive stress test and recently underwent cardiac catheterization which showed right dominant coronary circulation with a 70% stenosis in the diagonal artery with 90% lesion in the mid right coronary artery.
Left ventriculography revealed a preserved ejection fraction and very calcified aortic valve with reduced mobility.
There was severe aortic stenosis with aortic valve gradient of 57 mmHg and valve area of 0.6 cm2.
A recent chest CT scanz([**2182-4-19**]) found dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta.
Of note, the CT scan in [**2182-4-10**] was also notable for a focal abdominal aortic dissection at the level of the renal arteries extending over approximately 3.5 cm.
There is no extravasation of contrast from the aorta.
Past Medical History: Coronary artery disease, Bicuspid Aortic Valve, Aortic Stenosis, Ascending Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal Aortic Dissection, Hypertension, Elevated cholesterol, BPH, History of C. diff, s/p Right TKR, s/p PTCA of RCA   Social History: Widowed, lives alone.
Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 130/69, HR 67, RR 22, SAT  97% on room air General: well developed male in no acute distress HEENT: oropharynx benign, edentulous, MMM, PERRL Neck: supple, no JVD, transmitted murmur vs bruit noted bilaterally Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, harsh SEM noted Lungs: clear bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Ext: warm, no edema, no varicosities Pulses: 2+ distally Neuro: nonfocal   Pertinent Results: [**2182-4-17**] Carotid Ultrasound: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
Focal abdominal aortic dissection at the level of the renal arteries extending over approximately 3.5 cm.
There is no extravasation of contrast from the aorta.
The abnormal dilatation begins at the level of the sinus of Valsalva and extends to the ligamentum arteriosum.
There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.
[**2182-4-11**] Cardiac Cath: 1.Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with one vessel coronary artery disease.
LMCA was free of angiographically apparent disease, LAD had minimal disease except for a 70% origin of a small D2 branch.
LCX was without obstructive disease.
Left ventriculography revealed a preserved ejection fraction and very calcified aortic valve with reduced mobility.
Hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures and normal left sided filling pressures with mild pulmonary hypertension.
There was severe aortic stenosis with Ao valve gradient of 57 mmHg and valve area of 0.6 cm2.
There was no mitral stenosis.

All chest tubes were gradually removed without complication.
His oxygen saturation was 95% on room air and the discharge chest x-ray showed only small bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
