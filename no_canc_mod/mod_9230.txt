Ultrasound of the lower extremities, extensive thrombus within the left superficial femoral vein.
No right sided thrombus.
Chest CT [**2101-1-7**] no evidence of pulmonary embolus, right lower lobe consolidation and pulmonary consolidation of the left lower lobe with fossae of consolidation in the upper lobes bilaterally, emphysematous changes in both lungs.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES PRIOR TO DISCHARGE:  CT of head [**2101-1-19**] no evidence of  hemorrhage.
No evidence of C spine fracture.
Bilateral mastoid sinus opacification probably inflammatory in nature.
Cyst at the floor of the maxillary sinus with a sclerotic margin probably a benign process, may represent an otogenic lesion.
Chest x-ray [**2101-1-24**] persistent bilateral retrocardiac consolidation persistent rounded opacity in the left inferior hilum, diffuse linear opacity with areas of tram tracking and peribronchial cuffing suggestive of bronchiectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 70 year-old male with alcohol abuse and a history of deep venous thrombosis who was admitted after pedestrian motor vehicle accident.
The patient was brought to the Operating Room for left tibial open reduction and internal fixation and repair of left humerus fracture.
Pulmonary:  Postoperatively, the patient was found to be agitated, hypertensive, tachycardic and diaphoretic and felt to be in alcohol withdrawl.
In the MICU the patient became febrile to 102.4 with sputum culture growing Serratia.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral pneumonia and the patient was started on Clindamycin and Levaquin.
The patient subsequently developed a diffuse erythematous rash and Clindamycin was discontinued and the patient was started on Flagyl.
The rash persisted and became more diffuse and Ceftriaxone was discontinued and the patient was started on Gentamycin.
Due to persistent fevers, the patient underwent right pleural thoracentesis.
Pleural fluid culture showed no growth.
Repeat chest x-ray showed evidence of congestive heart failure and the patient was diuresed over 5 liters with improvement in oxygen saturation.
The patient remained afebrile for the seven days prior to discharge and maintained adequate oxygenation on nasal cannula O2 on the day of discharge.
Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with a history of hypertension with no known coronary artery disease.
The patient developed transient hypotension on hospital day number seven requiring a short course of Norepinephrine.
Hypotension occurred in the setting of respiratory decompensation and hypoxia.
After transfer to the floor the patient developed increasing O2 requirements.
On hospital day eighteen chest x-ray done showed evidence of congestive heart failure.
There was lipomatous hypertrophy of the atrial septum, LV cavity size was normal.
There was mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
There were no valvular abnormalities.
Infectious disease:  The patient developed bilateral pneumonia in the setting of depressed mental status.
Sputum cultures were positive for Serratia marcescens.
Blood cultures, urine cultures and pleural fluid cultures show no growth.
Of note, the patient developed diffuse erythematous rash on Ceftriaxone and Levaquin.
The patient remained afebrile in the week prior to discharge.
Repeat chest x-ray on [**2101-1-24**] showed persistent bilateral retrocardiac consolidation, persistent rounded opacity in the right inferior hilum and diffuse linear opacities with areas of tram tracking and parabronchial cuffing suggestive of bronchiectasis.
As the patient remained afebrile with decreasing white blood cell count and decreasing oxygen requirement, no additional course of antibiotics were given.
Neurological:  The patient presented with altered mental status likely secondary to alcohol intoxication.
Postoperatively, the patient remained confused with altered mental status.
CT of the head showed no evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
The patient's delirium was likely secondary to ongoing pulmonary infection.
Of note, the patient had received Haldol for periods of agitation, which during this hospital course was likely contributed to his decreased mental status.
Gastrointestinal:  On hospital day number six the patient's hematocrit decreased from 27.8 to 26 associated with OB positive stools.
Repeat speech and swallow evaluation on hospital day twenty six showed the patient was able to tolerate po without signs of aspiration.
The patient was started on soft solid diet with monitoring for signs of aspiration.
Hematology:  The patient presented with a history of deep venous thrombosis.
Repeat lower extremity ultrasound showed extensive thrombus within the left femoral vein with no right sided thrombus.
In addition, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by a reactive thrombocytosis in the setting of bilateral pneumonia.
Left humerus open grade two fracture and left proximal third tibial fracture at the metaphysial/diaphyseal junction.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Deep venous thrombosis.
