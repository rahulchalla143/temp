Admission Date:  [**2167-10-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2167-10-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-10-30**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Reason for transfer from an outside hospital was for further treatment of severe congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (status post myocardial infarction in [**2161**] and status post right coronary artery stent), rheumatic heart disease (with 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation, moderate mitral stenosis with a valve area of 0.9 cm2 and a gradient of 11 mmHg), congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%), atrial fibrillation (status post biventricular pacemaker placement but not cardioverted due to left atrial clot seen on [**2167-7-19**] and [**2167-9-18**] transesophageal echocardiograms).
The patient also had a chronic right pleural effusion (status post therapeutic thoracentesis) in the recent past and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on home oxygen).
She presented to an outside hospital with weakness, hemoptysis with dime-size clots, and worsening dyspnea on exertion.
The initially impression at the outside hospital was that she was in decompensated congestive heart failure and was given Lasix as well as antibiotics for a possible pneumonia.
Cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, severe mitral regurgitation, and mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic fever.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction in [**2161**] and status post right coronary artery stent, atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin).
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic right lower lobe infiltrate (on home oxygen).
ALLERGIES:  Allergies include AMOXICILLIN.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Examination on admission revealed the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 97.4, heart rate was 104, blood pressure ranged from 96 to 108/62 to 70, respiratory rate was 35.
She had mild scleral icterus.
Her lungs had decreased breath sounds; particularly at the right base, with dullness to percussion and diffuse rales.
Her heart examination revealed normal first heart sound and second heart sound with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur with a diastolic soft component.
Her abdomen was soft and nontender.
Her extremities had 1 to 2+ peripheral edema with dopplerable pulses bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  On the morning following admission, the patient was found to be in worsening respiratory distress using multiple accessory muscles for respiration and was found to be tiring.
Shortly thereafter she had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed elevated filling pressures with pulmonary artery filling pressures of 60/35, and a wedge pressure of 30.
She was tried on multiple combinations of pressors including dopamine, dobutamine, Milrinone, and Natrecor; none of which effectively increased her renal perfusion and urine output nor her cardiac output and index.
Sputum cultures ultimately grew out Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The patient developed septic physiology with a transient increase in her cardiac output and a decrease in her systemic vascular resistance.
The patient's skin became further jaundiced, and a right upper quadrant ultrasound had been ordered to evaluate for acute cholecystitis as gallstones had been seen on ultrasounds from the prior hospitalization.
On [**2167-10-26**], the patient's right pleural effusion was tapped; removing 1400 cc of cloudy pleural fluid.
The cultures from the fluid grew no organisms, and this appeared to be exudative; likely a parapneumonic effusion.
