In the ED, he was initially thought to be in acute heart failure, given that he was hypertensive to the 170's, so he was given lasix 40mg IV x1, placed on a nitro gtt and bipap.
CXR revealed a large RLL consolidation, so the patient was also covered for HAP with vanco and zosyn, but only vanco given.
Labs were significant for a large bandemia, lactate of 5.1, troponin 0.19 and mild renal failure.
Past Medical History: Anterior MI in [**2088**], Cath showed LAD disease s/p LIMA to LAD [**2088**] Aortic Valve Repair - porcine prosthesis for aortic Stenosis (valve area 0.9 in [**2088**]) Valve and LIMA done at same surgery Atrial Fibrillation Tachy-Brady syndrome s/p [**Company 1543**] sigma DDI pacemaker [**2100-7-18**]  Ischemic Cardiomyopathy - EF 25% Hypertension IDDM Dyslipidemia.
Family History: His father died at the age of 63 from liver and rectal cancer colon ca.
metastatic to liver?).
His mother died of alzheimer's disease at 63.

Physical Exam: VS:  HR 147  BP  107/50  R 32  Sats 95% on Bipap at 0.50 GEN: Moderate respiratory distress HEENT: AT, NC, PERRLA, EOMI, no conjuctival injection, anicteric, OP clear, MM dry, Neck supple, no LAD, +accessory muscle use CV: Tachycardic, no m/r/g PULM: diffuse rhonchi ABD: soft, NT, ND, hypoactive BS EXT: diaphoretic, +1 distal pulses NEURO:not responsive to voice, moving ext x 4  Pertinent Results: [**2103-7-17**]: Cxray: Of note, the patient was unable to lie still and the image is limited by respiratory motion.
However, there has been interval development of a focal patchy airspace opacity involving the right lower lung zone.
There is a persistent large left-sided pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of patchy, focal airspace opacity involving the right lower lung zone.
This may represent a pneumonia or possibly asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Persistent moderate-to-large sized left-sided pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 7435**] is an 89 yo M with history of CAD, ischemic CMY with CHF, IDDM here with severe sepsis from likely RLL pna.
1)Respiratory Distress/severe sepsis: Likely dyspneic acutely from RLL pneumonia, seems to be very dry on exam with elevated blood sugars.
Differential also includes PE and asymmetric pulmonary edema, but exam is not consistent with these etiologies.
