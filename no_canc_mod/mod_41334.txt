No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe LVH c/w hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Extensive pneumonic consolidation is again visualized in the left perihilar and basilar regions with adjacent moderate left pleural effusion, but no definite pneumothorax or hydropneumothorax is visualized on this semi-upright study.
New patchy opacity at right lung base could reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration or additional site of pneumonia.
Extensive left upper and lower lobe consolidation consistent with given history of pneumonia with right lower lobe atelectasis and superimposed consolidation.
Trace right-sided and small-to-moderate left-sided pleural effusions.
No evidence of hydropneumothorax.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be reactive and can be reassessed after resolution of pneumonia.
Nonobstructing right upper pole renal stone.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe LVH c/w hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
RHC ([**2116-7-15**]) RA: 21/17 (20) RV 31/17 (28) PA 55/22 (36) PCWP 21/20 (24-30)  [**2116-7-29**] CXR FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-28**], there is probably little overall change in the multifocal pneumonia involving the right base medially and the mid and lower portions of the left lung.
This could be a manifestation of elevated pulmonary venous pressure due to overhydration.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Hypertrophic bladder wall suggesting the presence of a neuropathic bladder abnormality.
Small right renal cyst incidentally noted.
Right and left pleural effusions.
[**2116-7-10**] Legionella urinary antigen: positive   Brief Hospital Course: 37 year old male with severe HTN, dCHF, T2DM with Legionella sepsis and MICU stay complicated by multiorgan failure and severe hypertension.
# Legionella sepsis and respiratory failure: Patient originally presented with nausea, vomiting, and an episode where he fell while walking home from [**Last Name (un) 1445**] [**Doctor Last Name **].
He was initially admitted to the MICU for DKA but developed hypoxia and respiratory distress and was intubated on [**7-10**].
Urine Legionella was positive, and sputum culture grew Legionella, consistent with serotype 1.
Blood cultures showed no growth.
His course was complicated by septic shock requiring pressure support.
His course was complicated by aspiration as discussed below and he was broaded with flagyl and his course of antibiotics was extended to [**8-3**].
After coming off of pressors on [**7-22**] for hypotension, patient became very hypertensive to the 250s.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient developed acute kidney injury with creatinine as high as 4.0 in the setting of Legionella sepsis and prolonged hypotension.
His baseline creatinine is ~1.3 per OSH records (likely secondary to chronic hypertension and T2DM).
# Volume overload: Due to septic shock, patient received approximately 35L of fluids while in the MICU and required several days of CVVH.
His lung exam demonstrated bibasilar crackles, sacral edema and his CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.
# Aspiration: Patient was initially evaluated by speech and swallow in MICU for aspiration concerns and was cleaned for regular diet and whole meds.
His course was complicated by two episodes of vomiting on [**7-28**] due to GI discomfort caused by his medications.
He was asymptomatic and had good O2 saturations.
Cause is unclear, but likely related to his sepsis.
Labs were not suggestive of hemolysis, reticulocyte count was appropriately elevated and he was guaiac negative.
He was started on Iron and Vitamin C.  Repeat hematocrit can be checked at rehab in [**4-20**] days or sooner if there is concern for worsening anemia.
#DM type 2 - Patient originally admitted to MICU for hyperglycemia and DKA.
# Diarrhea - Patient has had loose stools for past week.
If patient continues to have loose stools multiple times a day, would consider a repeat C. diff at LTACH after his antibitoic course is finished.
# Low CD4: Likely due to his sepsis and severe infection, HIV antibody and viral load were negative this admission.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Consider re-sending C. diff assay if still having multiple loose stools a day after stopping antibiotics.
# Will need further titration of his antihypertensives # Will need follow-up arranged with his PCP after discharge from LTACH # Follow-up reinin and aldosterone levels as well as 24 hour urine for metanephrines for secondary HTN work-up.

Ascorbic Acid 500 mg PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 686**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Legionella pneumonia/sepsis Aspiration pneumonia Severe hypertension  Secondary diagnoses: [**Last Name (un) **]   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were found to be very high blood sugars as well as signs of a serious infection and were admitted to the intensive care unit for care.
You were found to have a lung infection caused by Legionella.
You also experienced very low blood pressures requiring medications for support.
Your kidney function was also severely affected and you were on hemodialysis for a brief time.
You were transferred to the medicine service after your lung function improved and your blood pressure stabilized in order to further manage your Legionella pneumonia, acute renal failure, and severe hypertension.
You experienced two small episodes of vomiting and may have aspirated food into your lungs.
You spiked a fever and developed troubling breathing at that time.
You had fluid in your lungs and we gave you medicine to remove the fluid, improving your lung function.
