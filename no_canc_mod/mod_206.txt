Admission Date:  [**2178-11-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2178-12-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2112-4-25**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 66-year-old female who was initially admitted on [**2178-11-12**], complaining of increased weakness and groin pain since nine days prior to admission when she had a fall.
According to her family, the patient had been not very mobile for some time prior to admission, mostly because of severe exertional dyspnea.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, history of vitamin B12 deficiency.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
The neck showed no jugular venous distention, no bruits.
The lungs showed decreased air movement and were wheezy.
Extremities were clear, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, good pulses distally.
Chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate.
Hip films were suspicious for a left femoral neck fracture.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 66-year-old female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, who presented with right upper lobe pneumonia and a possible left hip fracture and generalized weakness.
She was put on ethanol and nicotine withdrawal precautions, given deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, and was seen by Orthopaedic Surgery consult.
Orthopaedic service decided to treat her left hip fracture nonoperatively because it was stable and impacted in an acceptable but not ideal position.
Pinning the hip in that position would have been technically difficult and has drawbacks and, because of her severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia, it was decided to avoid surgery.
She was discontinued from her Premarin because this increases the risk of deep venous thrombosis.
The patient was noted to have a weak cough.
Chest x-ray showed worsening right upper lobe pneumonia.
She did not tolerate BiPAP secondary to depressed mental status and secretions, and therefore was intubated for pulmonary toilet and more adequate respiration to protect mental status.
Later that day, after a lengthy discussion with the son, [**Name (NI) 1704**], and daughter, [**Name (NI) **], it was learned that the patient had been completely noncompliant with medical care prior to admission.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4427**] had previously expressed to her primary care physician that she wanted to have all medical interventions, but no be on a breathing machine for a prolonged period of time.
Given her acute decompensation and pneumonia, there was reversible component to her situation, however, it was explained to them the severity of the underlying lung disease and the chance of prolonged intubation.
[**Doctor First Name **] expressed that her mother has been severely depressed for the past 15 years, since her husband and two children died, and has been committing slow suicide by abusing her body with tobacco, ethanol and caffeine.
Chest x-ray showed emphysematous blebs in her left lower lobe, and continuing right pleural effusion that layered.
Pleural effusion was stable, acid fast bacilli negative x 3.
On [**11-21**], it was discussed with the family and it was decided that it would be attempted to avoid tracheostomy and attempt ventilatory wean because the wishes of the patient and the family were to not have long-term intubation on a tracheostomy, and that she would not want to be reintubated.
She spiked to 101 and was cultured, grew 4+ gram-positive cocci, and the patient was started on vancomycin over concern for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
She was continued on antibiotics, continued on tube feeds, prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis.
On [**11-24**], later in the day, Mrs. [**Known lastname 4427**] was able to communicate her wishes to proceed with a trach and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and her son consented for the procedures.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, but with some chest pain at the tracheostomy site.
Chest pain was without electrocardiogram changes, and with stable vital signs.
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes.
During this time, she was also treated with prednisone for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, as well as antibiotics.
The patient remained afebrile throughout her hospital course, was continued on tube feeds with intravenous fluids as necessary, was seen by Physical Therapy services, was found to be requiring daily mobility and exercise for two to three weeks to regain her strength.
