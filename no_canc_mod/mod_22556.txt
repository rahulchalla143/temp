He felt chills and began having shortness of breath.
He used his inhalers (Advair and Combivent), without relief.
He said he knew he had a pneumonia, because his symptoms were so similar to his previous admissions.
He denied having a cough, chest pain, or GU/GI symptoms.
Twice he was told he had viral colds.

Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - are in in part primary and cannot exclude in part ischemia.
Since previous tracing of [**2185-4-16**], no significant change.
Emphasematous changes are present in the lungs.
There is an interstitial opacity in the left lower lobe, which appears nonspecific and, in an appropriate clinical setting, may represent pneumonia.
2) Continued cardiac failure, with cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascular markings, and bilateral small pleural effusions.

There are changes of emphysema with bullous disease in the upper lobes.
There is no effusion or bone destruction.
IMPRESSION: Emphysema with improvement in the appearance of the chest over the past three days.

INDICATION: COPD and resolving pneumonia.
Persistent tachycardia and hypoxia.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST: There is no sign of filling defect within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There is a high-grade stenosis within the left subclavian artery.
There is diffuse severe emphysema bilaterally.
Focal areas of consolidation are noted on the right, some of which are slightly mass like.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
A small upper mediastinal node measuring 7 mm in greatest short axis dimension is noted.
There are dense calcifications within the aortic arch and within the coronary arteries.
Small left hilar lymph nodes are also seen.
Limited images of the upper abdomen demonstrate dense calcifications within the aorta and branches.
No other gross abnormality is appreciated.
BONE WINDOWS: There are degenerative changes within the spine including a thoracic kyphosis.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Diffuse emphysema.
Right-sided consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
Follow up chest CT in 6 weeks after treatment is recommended to ensure that these changes resolve.
3) 8-mm anterior superior mediastinal node as well as small lymph nodes in the left hilum.
4) High-grade stenosis of the left proximal subclavian artery.
Brief Hospital Course:    Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 7173**] is a 76 year-old male with a history of severe COPD requiring intubation, trach and multiple hospitalizations in the past.
On the day of admission, he called 911 and was brought in to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED by EMS for increased dyspnea.
He denied GI/GU symptoms, cough and chest pain.
He was given albuterol and atrovent nebs in the ambulance without improvment.
He was intubated for acute respiratory distress.
He received levofloxacin and IV steroids for COPD exacerbation.
Enzymes revealed a troponin leak, though ECG in the ED showed only tachycardia and RBBB.
Vancomycin was added for MRSA coverage, given history of hospitalizations at VA with MRSA.
On [**2185-4-16**] he continued to have tachycardia.
Subsequent ECG's revealed inferior-lateral ST changes.
Two sets of enzymes were negative, and his ECG changes were attributed to demand phenomenon in the setting of hypoxia and tachycardia.
The patient had no chest pain, other clinical symptoms or signs of ischemia.
Repeat chest xray revealed LLL opacity, pleural effusions and signs of pulmonary edema and left heart failure.
)LLL PNA: This continued to show radiographic and symptomatic improvement on levofloxacin (10 day course) .
This was felt to be the main exacerbant of his COPD flair.
Mr. [**Known lastname 7183**] unfortunately responded relatively slowly to this treatment, following a gradual waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course of both symptoms and oxygen saturations.
Given his slow improvement and low oxygen sats there was some concern for a PE and a CTA was obtained.In addition, patient received fluids in the MICU, and chest x-ray at that time was consistent with heart failure, however patient diuresed well on his own with improvement.
However, since then he remained quite SOB and was low 90s on five liters NC, a CTA was done- no evidence of PE.
Patient will likely need a repeat CT in [**6-15**] weeks to look for resolution of changes associated with pneumonia.
His prednisone was increased back to 40 mg qd given his persistent hypoxemia and will need a slow taper.
)Elevated cardiac enzymes: Mr. [**Known lastname 7183**] has no known history of CAD, with no prior anginal symptoms.
He had minimally elevated troponin-t (0.02) with a CK of 279 and 221 on two separate values when first admitted that subsequently trended down to <0.01 (with normal CK's), where they remained.
This was felt to be secondary to his COPD flair; the resultant hypoxia and tachycardia may have induced a moderate degree of demand ischemia.
Iron studies were checked that demonstrated an anemia of chronic disease.
)Anxiety -- Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 7173**] appears to have some baseline anxiety that was certainly made worse by his marked dyspnea.
6) C. diff- Upon transfer to floor, patient had some diarrhea and tested positive for c. diff, this was treated with flagyl for a 14 day course.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation Pneumonia Secondary: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with history of intubations in past   Discharge Condition: Fair, with improved O2 saturation and decreased work of breathing, patient being transfered to VA for further evaluation  Discharge Instructions: Please call your PCP or return to the emergency department for worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, worsening cough, fevers/chills or other concerning symptoms.
