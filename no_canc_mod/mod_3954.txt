Admission Date:  [**2101-3-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-4-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2019-12-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: headache, nausea, vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cerebral Angiogram [**3-24**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   History of Present Illness: 81 yo Mandarin-speaking female p/w HA, neck pain and dizziness.
Patient reports symptoms initially began on the date of admission at 8PM when having a bowel movement.
Upon admission she reported a bifrontal headache as well as neck pain mildly improved since time of onset.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
3-mm bilobed aneurysm projecting anteromedially at the junction of the ACOM and left A2 segment with diffuse subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Though ventricles are prominent, they appear appropriate in size for the patient's age of 81 years without definite evidence of hydrocephalus.
No acute territorial infarction.
Small amount of layering hemorrhage within the occipital horns, unchanged.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
No hydrocephalus.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CT perfusion of the head demonstrates increased mean transit time and decreased blood volume in the left anterior cerebral artery territory indicative of acute infarct.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates occlusion of the A2 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery.
No evidence of vasospasm or other vascular occlusions are seen.
There is persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral effusions and basilar atelectasis.
Redemonstration of the subacute infarction involving the vascular territory of the left anterior cerebral artery, the area of infarction appears more conspicuous with no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation or significant shifting of the normally midline structures.
There is minimal mass effect in the left frontal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
No new areas of ischemia are identified.
The CTA demonstrates lack of filling of the left anterior cerebral artery at the level of the A2 segment.
Streak artifact related with coils obscures anatomical detail in this area.
There is no evidence of diffuse or focal vasospasm.
Redemonstration of subacute infarction of the left anterior cerebral artery vascular territory.
No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
Unchanged mild mass effect on the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Similar amount and distribution of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage.
No evidence of vasospasm.
Unchanged lack of filling of the left anterior cerebral artery at the level of the A2 segment.
Streak artifact from the coils again obscures the anatomical detail in this area.
There are small-to- moderate left greater than right pleural effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Minimal upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
Her blood pressure was kept from 120-140, and she was placed on nimodipene for vasospasm prophylaxis.
On [**3-24**] she went to the angio suite for coiling of the ACOMM aneurysm;  however, the patient suffered a left sided infarct during the procedure due to a dislodged coil.
She returned to the ICU and had a worsening exam; she was completely plegic on the RU and RL extremities, and moved spontaneously on the left.
They wised to make the patient DNR/DNI, as the patient had previously stated wishes of not being intubated or having any extreme interventions or procedures.
Her CTA showed no evidence of vasospasm and patient was transferred to step down.
Polyvinyl Alcohol 1.4 % Drops Sig: 1-2 Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dryness.
Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: [**11-27**] 5 mg PO Q1H (every hour) as needed for sob or pain .
