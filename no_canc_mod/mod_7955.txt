intake, loose bowel movements with diarrhea and no blood, decreased urine output, no sick contacts, had flu shot this year.
Her usual is systolic blood pressure in the 120s, this was despite two liters of intravenous fluids and she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring for possible early sepsis.
She was ultimately changed to Levaquin for a possible early pneumonia pending cultures.
The Intensive Care Unit course was also notable for negative chest x-ray, two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 24.0 with appropriate bump in her hematocrit and no evidence of bleeding, stable blood pressure despite a net fluid balance of negative 2.5 liters.
She also had a right lower extremity noninvasive ultrasound that was negative for deep venous thrombosis.
Invasive mucinous carcinoma with estrogen receptor positivity and HER2/NEU negative.
Question of vertebral basilar cerebrovascular accident in [**2160-7-30**], with associated limb ataxia.
Magnetic resonance imaging was negative except for some microvascular cerebral white matter changes.
Left hip arthritis.
History of urinary tract infections.
Anemia, with a baseline hematocrit of 31.0, with a TIBC that was low and a high ferritin.
Echocardiogram in [**2160-8-29**], with preserved ejection fraction of 60 percent with trivial mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial enlargement.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General - The patient appears stated age, found lying flat in bed, in no acute distress.
Neck - No jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, I/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities - No calf tenderness, no edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, chest x-ray with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Electrocardiogram notable for sinus tachycardia with a rate of 104 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, new T wave inversion in III and old T wave inversions in aVL and V1.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 80 year old female with a history of Stage I breast cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, who presents with a leukocytosis/bandemia, hypotension in the setting of dehydration and influenza.
[**Last Name **] problem list is as follows:  Hypotension - This was likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of a diarrheal and viral respiratory syndrome.
There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleed or adrenal insufficiency during the course of her evaluation.
The initial bandemia would not have been consistent with a typical influenza presentation, so she was continued on a fourteen day course of Levaquin to eliminate any possibility of a bacterial superinfection or early pneumonia.
Loose bowel movements - This problem was resolved and had been a viral syndrome on presentation.
There was no evidence of diarrhea during medical [**Hospital1 **] stay.
Anemia - This is a chronic problem.
There was no evidence of bleeding.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Influenza A.  Hypotension secondary to volume depletion.
