pig tail chest catheter placement [**2125-8-28**] left pigtail catheter placement [**2125-9-7**] Mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: 75M with CAD s/p BMS, CHF, COPD, pleural effusions, PVD s/p femeral endarterectomy and fem to posterior tibial bypass with saphenous vein graft [**2125-5-28**] who was admitted [**8-4**] with a Right Lower extremity MRSA surgical wound infection.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On admittance PE: Gen: mild distress, diffuse erythema HEENT: WNL Chest: CTAB, A-fib Abd: S/NT/ND Ext: 5 cm open wound with purulent drainage on medial aspect of right calf.
blanching erythema from R toes to R thigh.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Right [**Doctor Last Name **] lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema superimposed over diffuse emphysema.
Large solitary left paratracheal lymph node.
No evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis.
Extensive vascular calcifications including coronary arteries and great vessels (arteries), aorta, iliac arteries, common femoral arteries.
Minimal arterial flow diffusely through out lower extremities.
Focal aneurysmal dilation of right common femoral artery where in-situ saphenous bypass arises.
CT CHEST [**2125-9-6**] CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Since the prior CT, there has been placement of a right posterior pleural pigtail catheter which terminates in the major fissure at the base of the right lung.
There is a moderate pneumothorax including a basal component and smaller component along the anterior junction line and the pleural catheter courses through the largest air pocket.
The fluid component is also moderate in size and is mostly unloculated, but the attenuation of the adjacent pleura is increased which can be seen in empyema.
This becomes a further possibility as there is a large airspace consolidation in the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia  On the left, there is a moderate partially loculated pleural effusion which is relatively unchanged with the prior, with associated atelectasis.
There is severe emphysema of both lungs and severe anasarca of the soft tissues.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, largest 22-mm left paratracheal (2:23), are very slightly enlarged and likely reactive.
There are severe coronary artery calcifications and severe aortic valvular calcifications.
Study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but no abnormality is noted except for high attenuation of a medullary pyramid in the right upper renal pole.
No suspicious lesions are identified in the bones.
Moderate right hydropneumothorax with large right lower lobe pneumonia.
Stable partially loculated moderate left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis.
Severe anasarca.
Severe coronary artery and aortic valvular calcifications.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW STUDY [**2125-10-18**]  This study was performed in conjunction with speech pathology department.
Continuous fluoroscopic observation was provided during administration of pudding and nectar-thick consistencies.
Subsequent delivery of pudding and nectar-thick consistency redemonstrated prolonged transit times of the oral phase and decreased epiglottic deflection.
While no laryngeal penetration or aspiration was identified during swallow, there appeared to be at least episodes of laryngeal penetration after swallow from leftover residue within the piriform sinus.
IMPRESSION:  Episodes of laryngeal penetration and aspiration as described above.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-8-10**], right ventricular cavity size is smaller and the severity of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation are reduced.
Aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation are not appreciated on the current study, but the image quality is suboptimal and may not reflect a true change.
Abnormality on recent chest radiograph corresponds to an enlarging loculated left pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of a discrete lung abscess in this region.
Persistent pneumonia in the right upper and right lower lobes with likely necrotizing component in right lower lobe.
New obstruction of airway proximal to the tracheostomy tube, likely due to intraluminal secretions.
Mild hydrostatic edema superimposed on emphysema.
Widespread anasarca.

He was initially treated with Vancomycin, however, developed an exfoliative rash to this medication.
He developed pancytopenia during this time.
Hematology was consulted; it was thought to be secondary to Linezolid.
He also developed acute renal failure and a NSTEMI during this time.
The patient developed increasing respiratory distress on [**8-26**]; eventually a respiratory code was called.
Nursing assessment at this time noted necrotic L toes, necrotic calcaneous, as well as having thick bloody secretions.
A R pigtail chest tube was placed for his pleural effusions.
On [**9-5**], the patient had an episode of respiratory distress with hypertension to 190's/100's.
On [**9-6**] he developed fever and hypotension and was transferred to the MICU.
Sepsis: He grew acinetobacter from his pleural fluid (right).
He then developed another Klebsiella & Acinetobacter pneumonia, so was treated with Meropenem/Bactrim which was switched to Mereopenem/Cefepime when his acinetobacter was found to be resistant to Bactrim.
4.Pain control: Patient was continuously experiencing intense pain with any type of movement of his lower extremities.
He was treated with gabapentin, oxycodone, and a fentanyl patch to achieve ideal pain control.
5.Respiratory Status: Patient had a continued and persistent hypercarbic respiratory acidosis, likely from underlying COPD, and several episodes of pneumonia.
Then over [**10-30**] developed worsening infilatrates, reaccumulation of pleural fluid and fever on Mereopenem/Cefepime.
6.Cellulitis: The patient developed a left knee cellulitis.
Daptomycin was chosen because the patient had a history of MRSA infection and he had an allergy to vancomycin.
8.Congestive heart failure: The patient was total body fluid overloaded.
He still remains fluid overloaded, but diuresis has not yet been initiated.
Plavix was held due to coffee ground emesis from NGT.
Patient was initiated on lovenox when he was found to have a RLE DVT.
Patient has bilateral pleural effusion.
