The patient had gone to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Month (only) 958**] to undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis which was performed there.
She had a complicated postoperative course including two non ST elevation MIs, PE, and pneumonia.
She denied any chest pain or shortness of breath at that time.
She had recently been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis and was on Flagyl since [**2135-7-11**].
Cardiac disease with Persantine MIBI showing reversible ischemic in the anterior wall and an EF of 70%.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  She was a pleasant elderly woman speaking Russian and is oriented and appears not to be in any acute distress.
Chest:  Crackles at the left base with diminished breath sounds at the right base.
Abdomen:  Soft but diffusely tender and exquisitely tender in the right upper quadrant.
Rectal:  Stage I decubitus ulcer with Guaiac negative stool and the presence of external hemorrhoids.
Extremities: There was 2+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally.
Her U/A revealed small blood and trace leukocyte esterase, otherwise a normal U/A with 6-10 white blood cells and [**4-13**] squamous epithelial cells.
The EKG showed a sinus rhythm at 88 beats per minute with a normal axis and T wave inversions present in V1 through V4.
The chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with a right lobe collapse and a retrocardiac infiltrate versus atelectasis.
HYPOXIA/FEVER/HYPOTENSION:  The patient's source of sepsis was thought to possibly be from two different sources including pneumonia and a biliary source given the right upper quadrant pain and fever and complicated postoperative course.
On the CT of the chest, she had some evidence of small segmental pulmonary emboli in the periphery bilaterally with some right lower lobe collapse/consolidation.
On the CT of the abdomen with contrast, she was revealed to have pneumobilia with intrahepatic ductal dilatation with no bowel wall thickening.
There was also noted evidence of a left adnexal cyst measuring 2 by 2.
Both the GI and the Surgery Services were consulted for a question of cholangitis and a question of intervention.
She was empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime in addition to the Flagyl for coverage of biliary source as well as a pulmonary source.
She was also covered with Flagyl for the question of a recurrent C. difficile.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  It was recommended a HIDA scan which was done to evaluate for biliary obstruction and this scan was normal.
Finally, the blood cultures taken on arrival eventually grew out Klebsiella pneumonia that was pan sensitive as well as Enterococcus, the speciation of which is still being identified.
She has been completely afebrile on the regimen of ceftazidime and levofloxacin.
She also had a TTE to demonstrate that there was no endovascular source, i.e., endocarditis that was the source of her bacteremia and this was negative for vegetation.
The EF was 60% and there was mild aortic stenosis on this transthoracic echocardiogram.
TROPONIN LEAK: Cardiology was consulted for troponin leak in a patient who has a reversible ischemic defect found after her surgery at the outside hospital as well as multiple complications.
She did have yet another troponin leak but this was not deemed an indication for cardiac catheterization.
She did have one episode of chest pain which was evaluated by EKG showing no significant ischemic changes from prior EKG but did show what seemed to be some wandering atrial foci with intermittent tachycardia.
given some evidence of liver dysfunction and potentiation by Flagyl.
She will remain in the hospital until she can be taken off her heparin drip when her INR becomes therapeutic for PE which should be continued for at least a total of six months from the time of diagnosis which would put her at [**2135-10-10**].
LEG PAIN:  She did complain of leg pain on [**2135-7-28**] which appeared to be more in the knee.
There does not appear to be any effusion or warmth or erythema over the area.
Therefore, hip films are being done to rule out a hip fracture.
Also, an ultrasound of the lower extremity is being done to rule out [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4675**] cyst.
