Admission Date:  [**2107-7-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2107-7-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2061-3-4**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 9513**] is a 46-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes, and hypertension who was in her usual state of health until 2 a.m. this morning when she had the acute onset of dyspnea.
She did have a cough productive of pink-tinged sputum.
No diaphoresis.
No palpitations.
She denies a history of cardiac disease.
She has no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
No lower extremity edema.
She denies any recent weight change.
She diuresed greater than 1400 cc with a significant improvement in her symptoms with improvement in her hypoxia initially with PO2 levels in the 50s on room air and an arterial blood gas of 7.49/39/39 to 95% to 100% on a 100% nonrebreather.
Pneumonia in [**2103**].
Father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 67.
In general, a pleasant and obese middle-aged woman in no acute distress.
Neck examination revealed jugular venous distention at 8 cm to 9 cm.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
No calf tenderness.
Chemistry-7 was within normal limits other than hypokalemia to 2.4.
Urinalysis revealed trace protein.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed pulmonary edema; right greater than left, and cardiomegaly.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial flutter at 142.
ST depressions in V4 through V6 which resolved on later electrocardiograms with rate control.
Poor R wave progression.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Ischemia:  The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
The source for her congestive heart failure exacerbation with negative cardiac enzymes.
Of note, though, the patient did have a slight troponin leak as high as 0.9.
(b)  Pump:  In terms of pump, the patient presented with an acute congestive heart failure exacerbation; likely precipitated by severe hypertension and atrial flutter.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with the septum of greater than 2 cm.
She was tried on verapamil; however, she was unable to tolerate secondary to hypotension.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient maintained a normal sinus rhythm after spontaneously converting from atrial flutter.
She also had a temperature spike and a chest x-ray which could have represented an atypical pneumonia.
She was started on treatment with azithromycin and ceftriaxone with an appropriate response in her temperature and oxygenation.
She was also maintained on occasional nebulizer treatments for her asthma and was to continue outpatient inhaler treatment.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION ISSUES:  The patient developed frequency, burning, and urgency on the two days prior to discharge after Foley catheter removal; for which she was treated with cefpodoxime and azithromycin (as above) as well as Pyridium for symptomatic relief.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Congestive heart failure exacerbation secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
Atrial arrhythmia.
