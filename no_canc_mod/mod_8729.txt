Admission Date:  [**2125-10-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2125-11-13**]   Service:  VASCULAR  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old woman with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension and a history of atrial fibrillation who had a status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in [**2123-7-13**].
She was found to have a thoracoabdominal aneurysm during an echocardiogram in [**2125-8-12**] after which he subsequently underwent an aortogram which noted a markedly dilated tortuous thoracic aorta with a normal distal suprarenal aorta with patent renal vessels and bilateral iliac disease.
She had guarding and minimal staining of her abdominal dressing.
Her pulses were palpable bilaterally of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.
She had a chest x-ray that was done that showed the chest tube at the apex of the lung with minimal pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
She had a urinalysis at the time that showed 10 red cells, 6 white cells and many bacteria.
However, she had continued significant facial edema which lead to a need for reintubation and return to the Intensive Care Unit on approximately [**2125-10-19**].
Subsequent, she had a presumed aspiration pneumonia which developed into an acute respiratory distress syndrome type picture.
Her Intensive Care Unit course was prolonged with a slow wean on the vent at which point she received a trach and a feeding tube.
In early [**Month (only) 359**], she had been stable for a short while and was determined to be fit for transfer to rehabilitation facility for continued management of tracheostomy.
Her condition of discharge is to rehabilitation for continued nursing care and monitoring of her trach and respiratory care.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Thoracic abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair with reimplantation of mesenteric and left renal arteries.
Her INR had been appropriate at Coumadin dose of 2.5 mg but had been elevated recently so the Coumadin has been held.
