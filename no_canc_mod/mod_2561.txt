A Code stroke was called on [**2145-6-19**] for right arm weakness and decreased speech output.
MRI revealed left MCA parietal infarct.
PMH  includes colon CA s/p resection, sinusitis, bipolar d/o, melanoma right back s/p resection, CCY, bilateral TKR, sinus surgery '[**41**]  The pt has been tolerating POs well without signs of aspiration.
Speech was 100% intelligible however noted to have intermittent mild dysarthria.
She presented with a mild to moderate anomia that was more obvious in confrontation tasks than in conversational speech.
several phonemic paraphasias were also observed in conversational speech.
There was also evidence of perseveration that the pt was not aware of.
There was also evidence of difficulty retaining information in lengthier segments and had difficulty recalling details from paragraph level information.
COGNITION: The pt presented with moderate cognitive deficits with limited insight into her deficits.
SUMMARY: Ms. [**Known lastname 14800**] presented with a mild expressive and receptive aphasia with moderate cognitive deficits.
She is currently able to express all basic needs and can participate in conversational level speech, but does have word finding difficulties, occasional perseveration and paraphasic errors.
Auditory comprehension breaks down at the 2 step level and she has difficulty recalling information from lengthier strings of information.
The tiny left apical pneumothorax is not well seen on today's study, likely resolved.
Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis is again present.
There are no signs of overt pulmonary edema.
Small pleural effusions are present.

[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:       Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 14800**] was admitted and ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction.
Cardiac catheterization was significant for a severe 90% ostial lesion in left anterior descending artery along with a 70% stenosis in the diagonal branch(see result section for additional detail).
However surgery was delayed secondary to development of abdominal pain.
Given concern for possible ischemic bowel via embolization during cardiac catheterization, an abdominal CT scan was obtained.
CT scan was essentially negative for any intra-abdominal pathology.
Given her stable cardiac status and a recent Plavix load prior to catheterization, it was decided to delay surgery for several more days and perform additional workup.
Carotid ultrasound showed no significant disease on the internal carotid arteries.
She remained pain free on intravenous Heparin and her abdominal pain gradually improved.
On [**6-16**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed coronary artery bypass grafting.
She experienced postop atrial fibrillation which successfully converted back to sinus rhythm after Amiodarone.
She was transferred to the floor on POD #1 and was doing well until POD#3 when she developed R hand weakness and slurred speech.
She had a head CTA which was negative for a bleed or infarct and then had an MRI which revealed a R parietal infarct.
She was evaluated by PT, OT and speech therapy.
