Patient presented to [**Hospital3 26615**] hospital with a 3 day hx of fever (to 102) and worsening back pain with assoicated urinary incontinence and numbess of bilateral lower extremities.
Labs were notable for normal WBC, K of 2.7 and Cr elevated at 2.7 from a baseline for approximately 1.1  She was given dilaudid for pain, vancomycin and ceftriaxone and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given concern for potential epidural abscess or cauda equina syndrome.
Of note patient was recently discharged from OSH in [**4-29**] after presenting with weakness and altered mental status.
She was also noted to have acute renal failure (Cr 1.5) and hypokalemia (K 2.9) which were attributed to volume depletion.
She had a troponin bump to 0.17 and rule out ultimately thought not to be ACS in addition to a COPD exacerbation treated with steroids.
Hospitialization was complicated by hypotension requiring transient dopamine for blood pressure support.
A spinal MRI was done given concern for epidural absecess or cauda equina syndrome which was negative for abscess but did show moderate to severe spinal canal narrowing at L3/4 due to lig.
The patient was given 1 mg of dilaudid, 5 mg of IV diazepam, and 1 mg of Lorazepam after which she was noted to have increased solmonence and hypotension to the 80s systolic.
She was evalutated by neurology who felt symptoms were most likely reflective of a toxic metabolic encephlopathy and recommened infectious work-up with plan for LP today should symptoms fail to improve in order to evaluate for a potential viral myelopathy.

Hypotension was felt most likely reflective of volume depletion in the setting of poor oral intake in addition to polypharmacy (requiring narcan).
She did report fevers at home which was concerning for sepsis however she was without evidence of infection on exam, WBC was normal, CXR was clear, UA was unremarkable.
Blood and urine cultures showed no growth.
# Back Pain: Patient has a long history of chronic back pain with acute worsening with symptoms initially concerning for epidural abscess or cord compression.
However MRI spine was without evidence of abscess, cord compression, and Neurology feels that exam is not consistent with primary neurologic etiology.
Concern for somatization or other non-organic etiology.
Per her daughter she does have a history of similar presentation of lower extremity weakness and numbness felt to be somatization which resolves spontaneously.
Pain was managed with lidoderm patch, neurotin and tylenol.
She was not complaining of significant back pain at the time of discharge.
