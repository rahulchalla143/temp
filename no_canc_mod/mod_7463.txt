with small bowel obstruction  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Incarcerated right femoral hernia with bowel obstruction.
INDICATIONS:  [**Known firstname **] is a 78-year-old female, with a history of Crohn's disease and multiple surgeries, who presented with nausea and vomiting for 5 days.
She was evaluated by the emergency medical staff, a CT scan was performed that showed a small bowel obstruction.
On exam, she had a lump in her right groin consistent with an incarcerated hernia, and the CT scan was reviewed and this was clearly the transition point of the bowel obstruction.
There was dusky bowel within the hernia sac.
The wound was irrigated with sterile saline and small bleeders were controled with electrocautery.
FINDINGS:  Incarcerated right femoral hernia with small bowel without strangulation.
PORTABLE DUPLEX DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE RIGHT GROIN AND RIGHT DEEP HEMIPELVIS CLINICAL INDICATION: 78-year-old woman with retroperitoneal bleed and question of pseudoaneurysm on recent CT scan.
No hematoma or extravasation was seen in the thigh.
Several small tortuous branches were seen extending from the iliac artery into the pelvic floor, but all of these appear to show normal albeit tortuous branching patterns.
There was no definable pseudoaneurysm identified.
No pseudoaneurysm identified around the large pelvic wall hematoma.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST There are small bilateral low-density pleural effusions, slightly larger than before, with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
No focal hepatic lesions are identified.
Small calcified dependent gallstones are noted within the gallbladder.
There is a small cystic lesion within or along the neck of the pancreas, which measures 12 x 11 mm in axial dimensions, and is unchanged since the earliest study available, which is a CT of the lumbar spine from [**2173-7-22**].
On more recent scans, it is difficult to visualize because of the presence of adjacent ascites and edema.
There is no biliary or pancreatic ductal dilatation.
There are diffuse splenic arterial calcifications, as well as calcifications in the aorta and common iliac arteries and their major branches.
There is new mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis of the right kidney.
Of note, small-bowel obstruction has resolved.
There is persistent slight herniation of non-obstructed bowel into the upper portion of the right femoral tunnel.
There is no free air or lymphadenopathy.
There is, however, mild ascites and edematous change throughout the mesenteric fat, with edema also demonstrated diffusely within the subcutaneous soft tissues.
This appearance suggests volume overload or an edematous state.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a new large acute hematoma in the right lower pelvis, which measures 8.9 x 5.2 cm in maximum axial dimensions, and extends superiorly along the right pelvic side wall.
Extending from the posteromedial aspect of the right common femoral artery, and coursing medially anterior to the acetabulum, is a small arterial branch, which may represent the right epigastric artery or another small arterial branch.
Along the anteromedial edge of the acetabulum and adjacent to the large hematoma, there is an 8-mm diameter focus of nodular arterial contrast, which collects and exhibits a round configuration of 13 mm in diameter on delayed- phase imaging at three minutes.
This appearance is most consistent with a pseudoaneurysm with associated large recent hemorrhage into the pelvis.
There is also a separate hematoma in the subcutaneous tissues overlying the right lower anterior pelvis, measuring 5.1 x 2.3 cm in axial dimensions.
There is distal right hydroureter up to 13 mm with apparent ureteral obstruction by the large pelvic hematoma, which also displaces the bladder and rectum toward the left.
There is atherosclerotic change but no abdominal aortic aneurysm.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Hematoma in the right pelvis associated with nodular contrast collection most consistent with a pseudoaneurysm.
A supplying artery to the pseudoaneurysm is noted, which emanates from the medial right common femoral artery and courses along anterior to the acetabulum to the pseudoaneurysm possibly representing the inferior epigastric artery.
New right-sided hydronephrosis associated with obstruction by the pelvic hematoma.
Unchanged cystic lesion in the neck of the pancreas, with stability demonstrated retrospectively since 6-[**2173**].
The differential diagnosis includes a pseudocyst or low-grade neoplasm such as an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).
Bilateral pleural effusions, mild ascites, and diffuse edema, which likely relates to volume overload or an edematous state.
Resolution of small-bowel obstruction.
The presence of acute hematoma and a pseudoaneurysm were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 33863**] from Surgery shortly after the study.
RENAL ULTRASOUND ------------------ The left kidney is surgically absent and bowel loops fill the left renal fossa.
The right kidney measures 12.5 cm and demonstrates moderate hydronephrosis and distention of its extrarenal pelvis.
There is no evidence of stones or solid mass.
A small amount of ascites is noted around the liver and in Morison's pouch.
An abdominal CT scan showed small bowel obstruction and rectal thickening.
Urine was positive for infection.
An ECHO was performed which showed normal LVEF and mild TR/AI.
The CT scan was reread and showed a right femoral hernia with right groin bulge on exam.
There was some bloody drainage from the NGT for which was attributed to mucosal irritation and Protonix was started with improvement.
She exhibited signs of postoperative delirium.
No neurological deficits were noted.
She continued on TPN for nutritional support.
At POD 6 she was afebrile and doing well.
At POD 7 she had a short run of asymptomatic vtach.
Urine was negative for infection.
A KUB was performed which showed no evidence of obstruction.
She was afebrile and her pain was controlled.
There was a large area of ecchymosis at the right flank and abdomen.
CT was completed which showed a hematoma in the right pelvis with right hydronephrosis.
There was suspect for pseudoaneurysm at the right femoral artery.
Vascular ultrasound showed no aneurysm.
The bleeding had stopped and serial Hcts were stable.
Her wound was healing nicely and without signs of infection.
