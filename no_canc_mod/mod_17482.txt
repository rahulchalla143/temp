When the police arrived, patient reported SOB and was brought to ED for further evaluation.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] any CP or recent illnesses.
Labs notable for normal WBC, anemia with HCT 30.9, hyperkalemia with K 5.5, and elevated BUN/Cr of 71/11.4.
EKG showed sinus rhythm with Q wave in III and TWI in III.
CXR demonstrated right-sided effusion.
Sats were dropping to mid 80s on 5L NC, and patient became responsive only to sternal rub, prompting a trigger for hypoxia and AMS.
Had nausea earlier and reports cough productive of mucous.
He [**Last Name (Titles) **] fever, chills, headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.

DISCHARGE EXAM: vitals: T96.8 63 140/70 62 95% 3L NC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress.
MICROBIOLOGY: [**2148-2-6**] Blood Cx: pending [**2148-2-8**] Sputum Cx x2: contaminated [**2148-2-8**] Rapid Resp Viral Cx: pending [**2148-2-8**] Pleural Fluid Cx: pending .
IMAGING: [**2148-2-6**] CXR: Moderate pulmonary edema with right-sided moderate pleural effusion.
Renal osteodystrophy.
Patchy opacities at both lung bases, likely atelectasis.
Multifocal pneumonia raises the distinct possibility of empyema.
Moderately severe central adenopathy could be reactive.
Diffuse alveolitis could be due to chronic inhalational exposures.
Renal osteodystrophy.
Brief Hospital Course: This 45yo male with CHF, COPD, OSA, and ESRD on HD MWF, who presented with shortness of breath and hypoxia in the setting of recent cocaine use, with CXR demonstrating right sided effusion.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress: Patient's dyspnea was felt to be multifactorial in nature, secondary to volume overload in setting of CHF and missed HD sessions, right sided pleural effusion, and bilateral pneumonia.
ACS was felt to be unlikely etiology of dyspnea and acute hypoxia, in absence of chest pain, EKG w/o evidence of ischemia, and flat cardiac enzymes.
He was initially admitted to the floor, but subsequently transferred to the ICU given increased lethargy and worsening respiratory acidosis/hypercarbia.
CT chest demonstrated loculated right pleural effusion, concerning for parapneumonic effusion and possible empyema in setting of multifocal PNA.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/levofloxacin given concern for multifocal pneumonia.
Thoracentesis on [**2148-2-8**] yielded ~1L of serosanguionous fluid, which was sent for cell count, gram stain, culture and cytology.
The patient was continued on BiPAP at night given history of OSA and chronic CO2 retention, and also continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed for dyspnea.
# CHF: Patient's baseline cardiac function unknown.
As above, possible that patient had CHF exacerbation from increased salt intake and missed HD sessions with volume overload.
Imaging on admission was suggestive that pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions could be contributing to acute presentation.
EKG did not demonstrate any evidence of ischemia to suggest acute worsening of CHF secondary to an ischemic event.
# ESRD: BUN/Cr elevated at 71/11.4 on presentation.
CT showed evidence of renal osteodystrophy.
Unclear if patient has had recent PFTs.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **], You were a patient at the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2148-2-7**] - [**2148-2-10**] where you were treated for a serious pneumonia and pleural effusion.
While in the ICU you were found to have a loculated pulmonary effusion and had a thoracentesis positive for blood and puss.
