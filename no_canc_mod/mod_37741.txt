Is transferred from an outside hospital after he presented there with epigastric pain since [**9-1**], which had worsened and was unresponsive to pain medicine.
At the outside hospital, he was found to have gallstones and a dilated common bile duct on ultrasound.
He underwent ERCP again on [**2165-11-10**], was very difficult to intubate due to his ankylosing spondylitis, and he was stabilized in the MICU postoperatively due to result in bleeding and edema secondary to intubation attempts.
He had a sphincterotomy, balloon dilation of the common bile duct stricture, and a common bile duct stent placed at this time.
After ERCP, he was feeling better, and denied any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and was reporting minimal epigastric pain.
Status post umbilical hernia repair.
In general, he was a well-nourished male, appearing stated age in no acute distress, and alert and oriented times three.
His oropharynx was with moist mucous membranes, and he had no JVD or lymphadenopathy.
He had no appreciable scleral icterus.
His heart was regular, there were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

He had no rebound or guarding.
His extremities were without edema, and he had dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Gastrointestinal:  As mentioned above, patient was transferred from an outside hospital with epigastric pain, laboratory findings and ultrasound findings consistent with gallstone pancreatitis.
At that time, findings included a 15 mm common bile duct stricture, and he underwent sphincterotomy and common bile duct stent placement.
Differential of his common bile duct stricture included PSC, cholangiocarcinoma, and chronic pancreatitis, or some sort of other external mass including a pancreatic tumor compressing the common bile duct.
At the time of ERCP, he had common bile duct brushings sent for cytology, which revealed no malignant cells.
It was recommended by ERCP to be followed up with a CT angiogram of the abdomen to rule out any pancreatic or other mass in the area around the common bile duct possible compressing common bile duct.
He underwent a CT angiogram, which revealed edema in the head of the pancreas, but no obvious mass.
At the time of discharge, it was unclear the etiology of his common bile duct stricture, however, it was felt that cholangiocarcinoma and tumor at the head of the pancreas was ruled out based on common bile duct cytology and his abdominal CTA.
The idea of primary sclerosing cholangitis was still being entertained, however, he had a normal ANCA, and not have characteristic appearance of the common bile duct for primary sclerosing cholangitis on his cholangiogram.
Infectious disease:  Patient reported one episode of subjective fever prior to admission, however, he was afebrile throughout his admission.
