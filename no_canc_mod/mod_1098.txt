As his fall was unwitnessed, he is unsure if he had any head or other trauma, but now has soreness in his neck, and awoke near a metal chair.
Pt also describes diaphoresis and feeling hot.
On arrival of EMS, pt had low SBP, was given 500mL IVF and SBP and color improved.
Patient was admitted to the medical floor for w/u of syncope, while on the floor, patient had large volume of coffee ground emesis.
Past Medical History: CAD HTN HL atrial fibrillation s/p PCI with stents [**2122**]   Social History: Denies tobacco, alcohol, drug use   Family History: No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No murmurs LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Mild basilar rales ABDOMEN: Soft, obese, ND.
Mild tenderness to palpation epigastric/LUQ EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e.
No femoral bruits.
No acute fracture or malalignment.
Severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine, causing multilevel neural foraminal narrowing and moderate-to-severe canal stenosis as described above.
In the setting of trauma, these degenerative changes predispose the patient to ligamentous injury and cord contusion.
MRI should be considered for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
Aspiration precautions.
[**2126-4-5**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF = 35-40%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w diffuse process (tachycardia, toxic, metabolic, etc.)
Mild global right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 9765**] is a 62 yo M with hx CAD, afib, cardiac stents who presented to the ED with a syncopal episode in the setting of mild epigastric abd pain x1d, admitted to medical service for syncope work-up, had episode of large volume coffee ground emesis and found to have HCT drop 4 points, tranferred to MICU for UGIB .
GI consult performed EGD on MICU admit which was significant for ulceration in antrum of stomach with overlying clot.
Epinephrine and clips placed with no active bleeding seen during EGD.
# Syncope: This was thought to be [**2-4**] acute GI bleed although TTE was done on the 3rd with results above and pt was ruled out for MI.
Telemetry was unremarkable for any arrhythmia which could have caused syncope.
# Leukocytosis: Without signs of infection, was thought most likely related to stress reaction from GI bleed.
# Anemia: Hct 36 on admission with drop to 32, previous HCT 39 back in [**2122**], likely acute blood loss.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Hx afib on digoxin, atenolol.
Atenolol was initially held [**2-4**] concerns about hypotension but pt was discharged on a higher dose of atenolol for better HR control as well as digoxin.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Continued zocor  Medications on Admission: [**Month/Day (2) 9766**], plavix, atenolol, simvastatin, digoxin  Discharge Medications: 1.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Bleeding Gastric Ulcer Secondary diagnoses: Blood loss anemia s/p several transfusions CAD Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Good.
At the time of discharge, you are doing well without evidence of further bleeding.
We started  you on a twice daily acid blocking medication called pantoprazole or protonix.
If your gouty pain does not resolved in [**1-4**] days, call your PCP.
