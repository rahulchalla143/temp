Admission Date:  [**2130-11-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-11-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-8-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**] Chief Complaint: Fever, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 12130**] is a 69 year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, RA on prednisone, AAA, HTN frequent admits for LE ulcers, who has been admitted twice recently for fevers of unclear source.
On his last admission in mid-[**Month (only) **], he received 1 dose of vanco for fever in ED but afebrile thereafter and not c/w with RA, pneumonia, cellulitis, osteomyelitis by Xray.
He presents from [**Hospital 38**] Rehab this time with intermittent fevers fever for one week, and fever to to 102.5 s/p right LE angiography yesterday.
Patient reports that he was felt well after the procedure but was a little depressed because he was admitted for RLE angiogram for RLE ischemia and gangrene and no intervention was performed.
Angiogram had demonstrated severely diseased right superficial femoral artery and occluded posterior tibial artery requiring a femoral to below-knee popliteal bypass graft in order to heal his RLE gangrene.
He went to physical therapy but went back to his room shortly after as felt fatigued, had 4 bouts of emesis prior to falling asleep.
He woke up with fevers and chills and was noted by Rehab to have had a rectal temp of 101.3, vomited once, and had drop in BP from 160/50 to 116/70 as well as desatted to 80% on RA, improved to 98% on 4LNC.
He was hypotensive to SBP high 70s which increased to 100-105 with 3L IVF.
Pancultured and started on CTX, vanco, and azithromycin for concern for pneumonia (CXR read as no consolidation), and transferred to ICU.
Of note, he had a systolic ejection murmur which had not been documented in prior notes.
ROS: No headaches recently, vision changes, jaw claudication.
Intentional weight loss.
Pt reports having had alternating diarrhea and constipation over the past several days, not bloody or black at that time.
Reports clear rhinorrhea x 1 week; no h/o allergies, no shortness of breath, cough, or sinusitis.
Chronic back pain.

[**2130-11-17**] 6:54 am BLOOD CULTURE    Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2130-11-23**]):    NO GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2130-11-19**]**    FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2130-11-19**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2130-11-19**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
ECG: Sinus rhythm at 86 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals no ST or T-wave changes.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2130-11-16**] 6:37 PM: FINDINGS: The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
There is minimal tortuosity of the atherosclerotic aorta.
No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
Again there is no change in appearance of the heart and lungs.
Specifically, no evidence of acute pneumonia.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No obvious valvular vegetations, but limited views of the aortic and tricuspid valves.
If clinically indicated, a TEE may better assess for endocarditis.
Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Trivial aortic regurgitation.
There are multiple gas-filled loops of small and large bowel without any air-fluid levels and no free air.
ANKLE XRAY [**2130-11-20**]: There is patchy demineralization about the ankle.
No fracture is identified.
Small plantar calcaneal spur is again identified.
No soft tissue gas or radiopaque foreign body is identified.
No acute injury identified.
Whole body delayed images in anterior and posterior projections were also acquired.
Blood flow images demonstrate asymmetric increased flow over the left lateral malleolus.
The blood pool phase also demonstrates asymmetric increased uptake over the left lateral malleolus.
No abnormal right lower extremity uptake is identified on blood flow, blood pool, or delayed images.
The previously identified linear uptake involving the L2 vertebral body is somewhat less conspicuous but again consistent with prior compression deformity.
Uptake involving the cervical spine and at L5/S1 is again consistent with degenerative changes.
While the two previously described foci of right rib uptake have diminished, an adjacent focus of rib uptake is more prominent, but likely also consistent with traumatic changes.
No foci of uptake worrisome for metastatic disease are identified.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
Uptake over the left lateral malleolus on all three bone scan phases may be consistent with osteomyelitis, however correlation with a white blood cell scan is recommended for further characterization.
Focal uptake involving a lower right rib is adjacent to prior rib uptake and likely traumatic in origin.
No uptake worrisome for metastasis identified.
Somewhat limited assessment of the pulmonary arterial vasculature.
No definite central or segmental pulmonary embolism or evidence of aortic dissection.
Extensive coronary artery calcific disease.
Right lower lobe mass slightly smaller when compared to the CT of [**2128**].
No associated pleural effusion.
This may also represent a focus of round atelectasis.
Left pulmonary nodule seen on previous exam is not visualized on the current study and may be related to slice selection and/or motion degradation.
Several hyperenhancing lesions of the liver, incompletely characterized but unchanged compared to the CT of [**2128**].
Tagged WBC Scan [**2130-11-23**]: INTERPRETATION: Following the injection of autologous white blood cells labeled with In-111, images of the whole body with dedicated views of the feet and ankles were obtained at 24 hours.
These images show very mild nonfocal uptake involving the left lower extremity in comparison to the right.
No focal uptake to suggest osteomyelitis is observed.
Decreased WBC uptake in the bone marrow at L2 corresponds to the known site of compression deformity.
IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of osteomyelitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year-old male with a history of Prostate cancer, RA, CAD, AAA, s/p RLE angiography yesterday who presents with recurrent fevers.
# Fevers of unknown origin: Patient received CTX, Vanco, Azithromycin in the ED and continued on Vanco and Zosyn in MICU given hypotension.
TTE done with no evidence of vegetation.
Although pt remained afebrile and without leukocytosis, it was not clear that C. diff was the etiology for his recurrent fever over the past month, and there was concern for an underlying infection not fully treated.
In terms of infection, no evidence of upper respiratory tract, urinary infection, cellulitis, endocarditis, prostatis (low PSA and s/p chemo/XRT, rectal not specific), bacterial gastroenteritis.
No osteomyelitis of spine.
In terms of inflammation, not consistent with acute RA flare, temporal arteritis.
In terms of malignancy, [**10-29**] CTA not very concerning for lung or liver malignancy (Compared to [**2128**] CT, RLL mass slightly smaller without associated pleural effusion; hyperenhancing liver lesions); no lung nodules on CXR or recent CTA chest; last colonoscopy 1 year ago w/ benign polyp; completed treatment for prostate CA; no evidence of bone marrow suppression or multiple myeloma (bone pain but no reported lytic lesions, renal failure, or hypercalcemia, SPEP neg).
Bone scan was pursued, and there was a question of possible osteomyelitis at that site.
Tagged WBC scan to further evaluate was (on prelim read) significant for some abnormal uptake but no definite evidence of osteomyelitis.
As patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable without leukocytosis off vanco and zosyn, he was discharged back to Rehab to complete treatment for C. diff (14 days total after the cessation of Vanco and Zosyn).
If he spikes again, would consider checking MRI of left foot to evaluate for osteomyelitis but no further work-up indicated at this time.
# Altered mental status: Resolved in the ICU after receiving antibiotics and IV fluids.
# Hypotension: Differential dx includes dehydration versus infection (pre-sepsis), hemodynamically stable after receiving IVF and antibiotics in the ICU.
BP meds held initially in setting of hypotension but restarted gradually as pt remained hemodynamically stable even off antibiotics.
# Anemia: Hct stable in mid-20s over past month (baseline in 30s as recently as [**9-20**]).
Rectal exam positive for small amount of bright red blood, likely secondary to inflammatory changes s/p radiation for prostate cancer, stools not grossly blood and Hct stable.
Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
# Peripheral vascular disease: Pt evaluated by Vascular Surgery and determined to have no evidence of cellulitis or osteomyelitis related to ulcer or graft sites.
# RA: Pt still with upper extremity weakness but improved since flare.
