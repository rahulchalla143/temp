History of Present Illness: The patient is a 75 year-old female who presented for elective cerebral angiography for evaluation of dural arteriovenous malformation.
She developed respiratory distress and was intubated for a short period of time.
Past Medical History: -history of SAH and SDH after falling and hitting her head([**6-11**]), at which time the question of a possible dural AVM was discovered on imaging.
-Hypertension -Zoster L leg and foot, now with postherpetic neuralgia -Chronic low back pain  Medications: -metoprolol 25mg po bid  Allergies: benzodiazepines  Social History: -she lives at home with husband.
Family History: -hypertension and diabetes mellitus (father).
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
There is no ptosis bilaterally.
Tongue protrudes in midline; no fasciculations.
There is no ptosis bilaterally.
Tongue protrudes in midline; no fasciculations.
-Gait: slow, mildy unsteady, no ataxia   Pertinent Results: Laboratory Data upon admission:  Hgb:11.0 CalcHCT:33  Na:139 K:3.4 Cl:108 Glu:89 freeCa:1.13 .
Radiologic Data: CT head: Note is made of hyperdense left frontal subdural fluid collection, which may represent acute subdural bleeding, or accumulation of the contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in this patient status post cerebral angiography.
Previously noted right frontal subdural hematoma has resolved.
Note is made of cortical and subarachnoid high densities in left frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes as well as left thalamus, which may represent hemorrhage or enhancement, due to acute infarction in this patient with left middle cerebral artery infarction noted during angiography.
No mass effect is seen.
High-density left frontal subdural fluid collection, which may represent acute subdural hemorrhage versus accumulation of the contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in this patient status post cerebral angiography.
Previously noted right subdural hematoma has resolved.
Cortical and subarachnoid high-density areas in left frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes as well as left thalamus, which represent either blood or enhancement due to acute infarction.
Arteriovenous malformation in the right frontal lobe, as noted in the previous CTA .
Note is made of a small esophageal hiatus hernia.
Small esophageal hiatus hernia.
Repeat CT-scan [**8-12**]: no evidence for a post tPA-hemorrhage; the reconstructions (to determine whether the blocked vessel had re-canalized) are pending.
ABDOMINAL/PELVIC IMAGING: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases demonstrate minuscule amount of pleural fluid and adjacent atelectasis.
The unenhanced images of the liver, spleen, adrenals, pancreas and unopacified loops of abdominal large and small bowel are unremarkable.
The kidneys demonstrate several bilateral low attenuation lesions, most pronounced in the renal pelvis which is most consistent with a parapelvic cyst.
A tiny nonobstructing 1-2 mm stone is appreciated in the interval region of the right kidney.
There is no free air or free fluid.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy.
Small amount of atherosclerotic vascular calcifications along the abdominal aorta is noted.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Stranding is noted in the right groin consistent with recent puncture site.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Degenerative changes are noted in the visualized vascular skeleton.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 75 year-old female who presented for elective angiography for evaluation of a dural AVM, complicated by a left-MCA stroke with right hemiparesis and aphasia.
The stroke was treated with [**Month/Day (4) **]-arterial t-PA and mechanical thrombolysis.
The etiology of the stroke was likely embolic from a dislodged plaque along the aortic arch.
Stroke: The hemiparesis resolved with no residual weakness on formal strength testing.
A CXR did not show pathology (other that small hiatal hernia).
Her LFTs were within normal limits and her amylase was elevated 205 but trending down (lipase was not elevated).
Her Hct was low, but no sources of bleeding were found (see next paragraph).
A repeat CT-scan [**8-12**] did not show evidence for a post tPA-hemorrhage (there was some mild contrast enhancement seen in the old frontal subdural hygroma although this could have been fresh blood; the reconstructions (to determine whether the blocked vessel had re-canalized) were pending.
Given her impressive rapid improvement, it is very likely that the vessel re-canalized.
Iron studies, B12, folate, and hemolysis labs did not point to any specific pathology.
Monitoring of stools and frequent checks of Hct are recommended as outpatient to make sure the Hct remains stable, which it was at discharge.
For tachycardia she was given lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] after the acute phase of the stroke.
FEN: She passed a speech and swallow evaluation and tolerated a cardiac healthy diet.
PPX: A PPI was dosed [**Hospital1 **] to prevent gasterointestinal bleeding post t-PA. Pneumoboots were in place when the patient was in bed.
Disposition: Due to an unsteady gait which improved with physical therapy in-house, the patient will need rehab.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: Good; no residual weakness, unsteady gait, difficulties in registration  Discharge Instructions: Please continue your medications as instructed.
If you experience symptoms of weakness, numbness, slurred speech, or a new headache, please seek medical assistance immediately  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your Primary Care Physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1 week after discharge from rehab.
