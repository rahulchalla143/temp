Though there is a relative paucity of bowel gas in the colon, air is evident in the rectum.
No free air or pneumatosis is identified.
IMPRESSION: Borderline dilated small bowel loops, which can be seen with an ileus, though an early and/or partial small bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.
Patient had persistent diarrhea during her hospitalization and had at least 8 C. Difficile samples sent to the laboratory, all of which have returned negative.
They initially recommended stool cultures (negative), a clear liquid diet, and observation for clinical improvement.
An Anti-transglutaminase was sent to evaluate for Celiac disease and was in the normal range.
Disease The patient # Infectiouswas maintained on her home dose of Vancomycin for her previous MRSA bacteremia and MRSA L2-L3 osteomyelitis.
The Infectious Disease service was consulted on [**2199-9-4**] and followed her for several weeks.
On [**2199-9-12**], the patient was found to have a urinary tract infection.
Ultimately, she completed her treatment for UTI with macrobid.
There was no further dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
On HD # 20, her vancomycin was discontinued and she was started on Bactrim DS for her discitis  This was discontinued after 3 days due to worsening renal function.
On [**2199-9-20**], the patient was brought to the operating room to have her existing tunnelled catheter removed due to the fungemia and a new Hickman catheter was placed without incident.
They found no evidence of fungal endophthalmitis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
# Renal on [**2199-9-24**] the patient was noted to have hyponatremia with a sodium of 130.
Nephrology recommended discontinuation of the bactrim as this was likely contributing to her worsening creatinine level.
Her opiate use was curtailed and her free fluid was limited and her hyponatremia resolved.
Renal recommended the discontinuation of all IV blood pressure medications as they were likely causing relative hypotension and hypoperfusion of her kidneys.
During the admission, she complained of RUE numbness and tingling and had a negative duplex ultrasound performed.
On [**2199-9-21**], the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 21.1 due to blood loss on top of anemia of chronic disease and she was transfused 2units of pRBCs with appropriate increase in hematocrit.
# Neurologic On HD # 10, a trigger was called as the patient was exhibiting seizure like behavior.
Nursing staff and the patient's husband report [**Name2 (NI) 97262**] but rhythmic contractions and relaxations of her upper extremities.
This reportedly lasted for two minutes at which point she appeared to have a blank stare and was non-verbal.
She showed no evidence of tongue laceration or incontinence.
At that time she obtained a head CT:  HISTORY: 67-year-old female with small-bowel obstruction, now with tonic- clonic seizure.
Here to assess for intracranial process.
CT HEAD BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or large vascular territory infarction is seen.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are mild, likely due to chronic microangiopathic ischemic change.
After administration of gadolinium, no abnormally enhancing mass is seen.
Vascular calcifications are noted along the dominant right vertebral artery, as well as the carotid siphons.
There is also normal enhancement of the venous sinuses.
Minimal layering fluid or mucosal thickening is noted along the sphenoid sinus, which was not present on [**2199-8-3**].
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process nor abnormal enhancing mass seen.
Neurology commented on how the postictal period was remarkably short and atypical for a tonic-clonic seizure.
They recommended a 24 hour EEG with video as well as a lumbar puncture.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing or epileptiform features seen.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to sleep with no additional findings.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed no clear epileptiform features.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were eight entries in this file for muscle and movement artifacts, rhythmic alpha activity but no ongoing seizure activity.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations and no interictal epileptiform activity.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing or epileptiform features seen.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to sleep with no additional findings.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were three entries in this file for movement and muscle artifacts.
There was no ongoing seizure activity seen.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations and no ictal or interictal epileptiform activity.
The study was obtained on [**2199-9-19**]:  HISTORY: 67-year-old female patient with osteomyelitis and discitis.
Patient with mental status changes and new onset seizures.
No previous MRI.
FINDINGS:  MRI BRAIN: There are nonspecific non-enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintense foci within the bilateral centra semiovale and periventricular regions likely representing chronic small vessel ischemic changes in a patient of this age.
There is an ill-defined focus of FLAIR-hyperintensity, with no enhancement, within the medial inferior right cerebellar hemisphere/lateral vermis, with no evidence for restricted diffusion likely representing chronic infarction.
There is moderate diffuse parenchymal volume loss with associated proportionate prominence of the ventricles and sulci, likely reflecting age-related volume loss.
There is no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, abnormal enhancement, or hydrocephalus.
No mesial temporal sclerosis, cortical dysplasia or heterotopia is seen.
There is mucosal thickening of the bilateral ethmoid air cells and a mucus-retention cyst in the right sphenoid sinus.
Otherwise, the remainder of the paranasal sinuses as well as mastoid air cells are clear.
MRA BRAIN: ANTERIOR CIRCULATION: The bilateral MCAs and ACAs are unremarkable without evidence for aneurysm (greater than 3 mm), AVM, or stenosis.
POSTERIOR CIRCULATION: Bilateral PCAs and basilar artery are unremarkable.
There is no evidence for aneurysm (greater than 3 mm), AVM, or stenosis.
No acute infarction or hemorrhage, and no pathologic focus of enhancement.
Right inferior cerebellar/lateral vermian chronic infarction, and likely mild chronic small vessel infarction in a patient of this age.
No significant neurovascular abnormality identified.
After this extensive workup, it was ddecided that the patient had pseudoseizures rather than a true seizure disorder and that anticonvulsants were not required.
Psychiatry was consulted for her abnormal behavior.
# Musculoskeletal The patient was evaluated by Orthopaedics/Spine due to her recent L2-L3 osteomyelitis.
HISTORY: 67-year-old female presents with history of lumbar osteomyelitis.
The configuration of the lumbar spine appears similar, with marked abnormality of the disc space at L2-L3 with an associated fluid cleft.
There is likely at least moderate narrowing of the spinal canal at the L3 level.
There is slightly increased prevertebral soft tissue, displacing the aorta anteriorly.
Again noted is a kyphotic deformity at T10 associated with the disc protrusion and associated osteophytes.
Severe central canal stenosis with possible compression on the cauda at L2-3 and L3-4 levels, incompletely assessed.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO Q6H as needed for anxiety.
Vicodin 5/500mg 1-2 tabs QID prn pain 15.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 6-8 hours as needed for pain for 10 days.
