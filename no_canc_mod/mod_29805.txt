Admission Date:  [**2141-10-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-11-1**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Keflex / Clindamycin / Vancomycin / Lipitor / Bacitracin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxic respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intuabtion central venous line placed (right IJ)   History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with a recent hospitalization for healthcare-associated pneumonia ([**Date range (1) 79563**]) who presented to the ED this morning with palpitations and SOB.
The patient had been feeling fine as as of last night and went to Church yesterday which requires her to walk up 17 steps which she did without too much difficulty though she had some left leg weakness which is her baseline.
CXR showed a large right sided infiltrate.
Diphendydramine was being given prior to vancomycin due to history of vancomycin allergy, and this pretreatment has been successful in the past.
There was transient hypotension to SBP 70s-80s prior to intubation, which resolved with IVF.
She was also given TMP-SMX to use if she developed increased LE skin breakdown or infection, but it is not clear if this was taken.
In addition to recent PNA hospitalization, she also was recently hospitalized for cellulitis.

Physical Exam: Admission Physical: GEN: intubated, sedated, NAD HEENT: dry mm, PERRL, no JVP though difficult to asses given body habitus RESP: rhonchorous throughout with bronchial bs on right CV: irregularly irregular, no mrg ABD: obese, NABS, soft, NTND EXT: 2+ [**Location (un) **] with chronic venous stasis changes, no ulcerations SKIN: no rashes or jaundice NEURO: withdraws to pain RECTAL:  deferred .
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
[**10-23**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation.
Possible left anterior fascicular block.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes in the high lateral leads.
[**10-23**] CXR: Interval development extensive right mid and lower lung consolidations, compatible with right middle and lower lobe pneumonia.
Possible additional consolidation is seen at the left base.
Slight improvement in airspace consolidation within the right lung, sparing extreme right apex and right base, and likely due to pneumonia.
Resolution of interstitial edema.
[**10-25**] CXR:  Large right mid lung consolidation has improved.
Left retrocardiac opacities are unchanged.
Moderate right pleural effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.
Left pleural effusion is small.
CHF with interstitial edema, right greater than left pleural effusions, and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Allowing for technical differences, no definite change in the degree of consolidation c/w [**2141-10-25**].
Gas over cardiac silhouette may represent a hiatal hernia.
[**10-30**] CXR PA & Lat: In comparison with the study of [**10-27**], there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the right, and basilar compressive atelectasis.
Evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure is again noted.
The possibility of supervening pneumonia can certainly not be excluded.
[**2141-11-1**] transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe pulmonary hypertension (TR gradient + RA pressure).
Moderate right ventricular dilation and mild global hypokinesis.
Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved left ventricular function.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild to moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation.
The severity of mitral, aortic, and tricuspid regurgitation have all increased.
Ca    Phos   Mg 8.1*  2.1*   1.8    Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year-old W with a recent healthcare-associated pneumonia ([**2141-7-13**]), presented to the ED with dyspnea and palpitations, was found to be in hypoxic respiratory failure and sepsis in setting of a new large R-sided pneumonia.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, extubated without difficulty, and transferred to the Medicine floor for further management.
# Pneumonia: Possibly occurred secondary to aspiration, although unable to tell definitively per a Speech and Swallow evaluation.
The patient received eight days of intravenous vancomycin, aztreonem, and ciprofloxacin to treat her large right-sided pneumonia.
These antibiotics were chosen in light of her many antibiotic allergies.
She never had a leukocytosis or fever.
Repeat chest imaging suggested an increasing component of fluid overload, for which she was treated with diuretics.
# Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's diuretics were held upon admission to the hospital secondary to low blood pressures and concern for sepsis.
After transfer to the floor the patient began to demonstrate signs of increasing volume overload on her CXR and physical exam.
Her dyspnea and peripheral edema improved.
A repeat echocardiogram was obtained and showed severe pulmonary hypertension, moderate right ventricular dilation and mild global hypokinesis, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved left ventricular function, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and mild to moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Once her blood pressures were stable, the patient was continued on her home regimen of Metoprolol 25 mg twice daily for rate control, and Coumadin for anticoagulation.
Her INR level fluctuated, likely secondary to concurrent antibiotics, so this will need to be monitored and re-dosed as needed in the future (goal INR [**2-15**]).
# Acute exacerbation of chronic venous stasis: Upon transfer to the floor it was evident that the patient was experiencing an acute [**Month/Day (3) 9140**] of her chronic venous stasis.
# Delirium (resolved): During majority of her hospital admission the patient was alert, attentive, and oriented to person, location, and date.
She did experience an episode of visual hallucinations and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] consciousness in the setting of not having a bowel movement in two days.
# Anemia: The patient has evidence of a chronic normocytic anemia.
Fe studies revealed a low Fe (19), low-normal ferritin (74), and decreased TIBC.
# Speech and Swallow: The patient was evaluated a number of times by Speech who advanced her diet to soft solids and thin liquids, meds whole with puree, and recommended swallow follow up in rehab to ensure diet tolerance and consider further upgrades.
13. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) inhalation Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for dyspnea, wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**]- [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Pneumonia, possibly aspiration -Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure -Acute stasis dermatitis .

You were recently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit of [**Hospital1 69**] for palpitations and were found to have a pneumonia.
You were doing well and so you were transferred to the General Medicine floor, where we continued your antibiotics and re-started medications to remove excess fluid from your body.
