He presents for repair of his mitral valve.
No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Severely dilated LV cavity.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Partial mitral leaflet flail.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is systolic flow reversal seen in the LUPV.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mitral valve annulopasty ring is present and well seated.
There is no evidence of mitral regurgitation, prolapse or flail.
Prior to coming off CBP, there was visible air in left ventricle with inferior wall dyskinesis, which improved with nitroglycerin and inotropic support.
Inferior wall post bypass is normal.
Aortic regurgitation remains mild 1+.
