Admission Date:  [**2103-5-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2103-5-28**]   Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain, non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old female with a history of hypertension, who presented to outside hospital on [**2103-5-10**], with a two day history of right sided chest pain radiating to the scapula.
She had been having about two weeks of progressive exertional chest pain and dyspnea on exertion without radiation or associated symptoms and resolving with rest.
The patient's initial electrocardiogram at outside hospital showed no ST elevations but questionable Q waves in V1 through V3.
She was noted to have a troponin I leak with peak of 0.2 with flat CKs.
Chest x-ray at that time was consistent with congestive heart failure and BNP measured was 2710.
She had recurrent anginal episodes without ST segment changes with another troponin I leak and peak at 0.11 and new T wave inversions in V2 through V6.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix aggressively for congestive heart failure with creatinine rising to 2.3 from baseline of 1.6.
On [**2103-5-13**], the patient complained of chest pain radiating to the back and had CTA which ruled out dissection and abdominal aortic aneurysm but showed bilateral lung effusions which were small.
The patient also received transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2103-5-11**], at outside hospital which by report showed ejection fraction of 25 to 30% with anterior, inferior, and apical akinesis, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation.
By report, she also had a urinary tract infection on transfer and received one dose of Levofloxacin.
On catheterization at outside hospital, she had three vessel disease reportedly left anterior descending 90%, left circumflex 80%, right coronary artery 90% stenoses and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for consideration for coronary artery bypass graft.
On arrival, she denied chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lower extremity edema and weight loss or weight gain recently.
Anemia on weekly B12 shots.
Status post appendectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of myocardial infarction at unknown age.
In general, an elderly female, hard of hearing, in no acute distress.
Lungs revealed rales at bilateral bases, right greater than left, and otherwise clear anteriorly.
No groin bruits.
Right venous and arterial sheaths in place.
Extremities - trace to 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally, warm and well perfused.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission laboratory data was significant for laboratories from outside hospital showing hematocrit 37.2, creatinine 1.6, partial thromboplastin time 41.2.
Urinalysis showed positive nitrites, large leukocyte esterase, 90-100 white blood cells, many bacteria, greater than 100,000 gram negative rods.
Coronary artery disease - Status post non ST elevation myocardial infarction - The patient was evaluated by CT surgery here and catheterization films reviewed by cardiology and CT surgery staff.
She was deemed to be a poor surgical candidate and given discrete lesions on angiography it was determined to have her left anterior descending stented.
While awaiting to have her stent placed, secondary to elevated creatinine, and debates as to surgery versus PCI, the patient developed recurrent episodes of chest pain associated with 2.
[**Street Address(2) 2811**] elevations in V1 and V4, and upright T waves in leads II and III with T wave flattening across the precordium.
Her baseline electrocardiogram on arrival had been notable for deep T wave inversions in the precordial leads.
Each of these episodes of chest pain was in the setting of the patient being hypertensive to systolic blood pressure of 180s to 190s and tachycardic to low 100s.
After resolution of chest pain, electrocardiogram noted to revert to prior with deep T wave inversions across the precordium.
It appears that hypertension and tachycardia were directly related and resulted from chest pain rather than preceding it.
The patient had intra-aortic balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion given tight left anterior descending stenosis and recurrent chest pain and was started on Heparin and Integrilin.
She was noted the next day to have nosebleed and groin bleed secondary to supertherapeutic Integrilin and these drips were then held.
Several hours afterward, she complained of vague chest/left shoulder/back pain not associated with hypertension or tachycardia.
Her hematocrit was rechecked and noted to be stable and groin sites intact without abdominal or lower back pain, suggesting no retroperitoneal bleed.
Her electrocardiograms were unchanged at this time, suggesting her pain was not cardiac in nature.
She was relieved with Morphine and this pain did not recur.
Congestive heart failure - The patient with ejection fraction of 25 to 30% noted on recent transthoracic echocardiogram with apical akinesis.
We started her on Coumadin given apical akinesis and the patient will follow-up with primary care physician for INR levels as an outpatient.
Rhythm - The patient continued in sinus bradycardia with one episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia of three beats only.
Hypertension - We initially increased Diovan to 240 mg a day for control of blood pressure as increase of beta blocker limited by bradycardia.
Thus, Diovan was stopped and Hydralazine and Norvasc initiated for blood pressure control as unclear if this may have contributed to recurrent demand ischemia and chest pain.
On discharge, we have restarted low dose of [**Last Name (un) **] as creatinine decreasing and stopped Hydralazine.
The patient had renal ultrasound to rule out renal artery stenosis given large episodic increases suddenly in blood pressure though these were associated with chest pain.
She had slightly atrophic kidneys bilaterally but no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Acute on chronic renal failure - Unclear reason of baseline chronic renal failure.
Creatinine here peaked at 2.4 likely secondary to prerenal cause and contrast dye induced nephropathy.
Urinary tract infection - The patient was treated with Levofloxacin which was given daily though ordered to be q.o.d.
She had no further dysuria during admission.
Hematology - The patient with thrombocytopenia noted after intra-aortic balloon pump placed, improving after removal.
Likely was secondary to destruction from intra-aortic balloon pump.
Anemia - We continued p.o.
Depression - Continued Sertraline.
