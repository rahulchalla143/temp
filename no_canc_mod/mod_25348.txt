She underwent a gastric bypass which resulted in substantial weight loss but she did develop a near critical condition with open abdomen and hernia.
A hernia repair was done in [**2127**] but still there was a significant area of herniation and she is here for hernia repair.
Complicating factors is that she has an aortic valve and is on Coumadin.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well developed female in no acute distress.
There is a large central midline hernia.
The repair itself was uneventful and the wound was closed over large drains.
Unfortunately that led to the development of a very large hematoma in the abdomen which required transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.
Ultimately by the end of her stay she had no hematoma.
She had a closed wound with no hernia and was ready for discharge.
