Brief Hospital Course: ID wrote: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year old man with a history of significant abdominal infectious issues after complications of embolization of pancreaticoduodenal artery for GI bleed in 4/[**2200**].
Currently, he is readmitted with fevers, rigors and vomiting after a recent definitive surgery for treatment of his abdominal issues.
Worrisome for etiology of his current symptoms is a recurrent abdominal process, particularly in the setting of the peri-drain purulence.
Third, further/Jtube dysfunction may account for his symptoms.
Lastly, he has a prominent murmur on exam.
If fever or infectious symptoms persist or worsen, or if a blood culture is positive, investigation for endocarditis (possibly from hematogenous seeding during recent procedures) is warranted with echocardiography.
For antibiotic coverage, would s suggest continuing with current antibiotics.
CV:Monitor blood pressures, bolus IVF for hypotension.
Resp:WNL GI: There was a small area along the incision that was draining minimal serous fluid.
Heme: follow CBC, leukocytosis trending down Endo: RISS ID: He was started on Tobramycin 120 mg IV Q18H, Meropenem 500 mg IV Q8H, Vanco 1g q24.

The initial WBC was felt to be related to aspiration pneumonitis.
