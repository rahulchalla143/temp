GI Bleed - patient presented with melena most likely secondary to an upper GI source of AVM.
During her hospital course, she did have multiple bowel movements with minimal black stool and mainly brown stool.
The GI team was consulted who felt that given she has had multiple scopes in the last couple of months, she most likely would not benefit from another EGD with push enterscopy or a pill study.
She did have a GI bleeding scan study that showed no active bleeding at that time.
Coronary Artery Disease - She was continued on her outpatient regimen of B-blocker, Lipitor and Lasix.
Her Aspirin was held in the setting of her GI bleed.
Hypothyroidism - Continued home dose of Levothyroxine  4.
Renal - She has known chronic renal insufficiency, and during her stay, her Creatinine remained stable at her baseline.
Diabetes - she was continued on her home regimen of Insulin 70/30 at 30 unit sq q am, and 10 u sq q pm.
Coronary Artery Disease 2.
Hypertension 3.
