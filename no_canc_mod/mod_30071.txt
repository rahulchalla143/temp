No significant change from the tracing of [**2195-9-26**].
The tracing continues to show left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage in lead aVL and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities which may be due in part to the left ventricular hypertrophy.
Radiology [**12-3**] CXR: No evidence of cardiopulmonary process.
[**12-6**] bleeding scan: No GI bleeding focus identified.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon.
[**11-24**] upper endoscopy: Patchy discontinuous erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the stomach body and antrum.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the stomach antrum (normal pathology)   Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old female with type II diabetes presents with nausea/vomiting/melena.
She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit, where she became hypotensive and  her HCT dropped to 23.
1) GI bleeding/acute blood loss anemia: The melena/coffee-ground emesis on admission was most likely secondary to gastritis versus possible [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear in the setting of vomiting (possibly from gastroparesis versus gastroenteritis).
She remained stable until [**2195-12-6**], when she had bright red blood per rectum and a hematocrit drop to 25.
She was transfused 2 units of PRBC along with 1 unit of platelets given thrombocytopenia (see below) with stabilization of her hematocrit.
The GI service felt that her rectal bleeding was most likely from her [**11-24**] polypectomy sites.
3) Type II diabetes poorly controlled with complications: The patient had previously been on 22 units of lantus with a sliding scale in [**9-/2195**], recently switched to metformin alone.
The etiology is unclear, but it may have been related to acute illness.
Her fibrinogen/PT/PTT were not consistent with DIC and HIT antibody was negative.
7) CAD: The patient's EKG showed lateral ST depressions on admissions, however cardiac enzymes were not consistent with active ischemia.
