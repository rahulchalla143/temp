CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with status post fall four days ago, not waking up appropriately, neurosurgery would like further evaluation to exclude diffuse axonal injury.
FINDINGS: There are several areas of T2 hyperintensity with associated low signal on susceptibility images seen in both frontal region at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction.
Additional area of signal abnormality and blood products is seen in the inferior right frontal lobe.
Subtle increased signal in the sylvian fissures indicate associated subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is widening of the subdural space in both frontal region measuring approximately 1 cm with CSF intensities indicative of bilateral subdural effusions.
There is no evidence of acute infarct seen.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus identified.
Evaluation of the brainstem demonstrate no focal abnormalities or blood products to indicate brain stem injury.
The corpus callosum also demonstrate no focal abnormalities.
Extensive soft tissue changes are seen in the paranasal sinuses, which could be related to intubation.
Multiple small white matter hyperintensities seen indicative of small vessel disease.
There is a tiny left parietal subdural collections seen measuring 2-3 mm.
No associated mass effect seen.
Bilateral frontal lobe [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction abnormalities with blood products are suggestive of diffuse axonal injury.
Inferior right frontal lobe abnormality could be due to hemorrhagic contusion.
Bilateral frontal subdural effusions and probable subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right sylvian fissure.
No evidence of brain stem injury.
No evidence of acute infarct.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2200-7-11**] 10:36 AM  CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIA  Reason: S/P FALL, EVAL FOR FRACTURES  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 60 year old man s/p fall w/ multiple facial fractures.
FINDINGS: There are multiple displaced fractures including fractures of the anterior, medial, and lateral wall of the left maxillary sinus.
There is also a fracture of the left lateral anterior inferior orbital rim that extends posteriorly into the left orbital floor.
There is no evidence for displacement of this fracture, and there is an no herniation of orbital fat.
There is also a fracture of the right posterior maxillary sinus and nondisplaced fracture of the right zygoma.
A small minimally displaced left nasal bone fracture is also present.
The globes appear normal and there is no evidence for intra or extraconal abnormalities.
There is near total opacification of the left maxillary sinus and both ethmoid sinuses from a combination of blood and mucous.
Lobulated mucosal thickening in addition to fluid is present within the right maxillary sinus as well.
The lamina propecia appear intact, there is mild mucosal thickening of the frontal sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Multiple facial fractures including both maxillary sinuses and right zygoma, and left nasal bone, as well is a nondisplaced fracture from the lateral inferior orbital rim extending posteriorly into the left orbital floor without evidence for fat herniation or orbital abnormality.
The previously identified mild congestive heart failure has been improving.
There is also gradual improvement of the multifocal pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration.
There is continued tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No evidence for pneumothorax is identified.
Neurosurgery was consulted because of his head bleed.
Serial head CT scans were followed and were stable; an MRI of the brain also revealed Diffuse Axonal Injury ([**Doctor First Name **]).
His Dilantin dose has been adjusted several times because of subtherapeutic levels; these levels will need to rechecked in the next several days.
Behavioral Neurology was consulted because of the behavioral issues associated with his head injury; he was started on Olanzapine standing dose; a prn dose was added for episodes of increased agitation.
His mental status has improved, although there are still problems with decreased short term memory; there have been no further episodes of agitation.
He had episodes of loose stool during his hospital stay; a stool for C-Diff was obtained and was negative.
His WBC was also elevated; thought to be related to a small aspiration pneumonia noted on chest radiograph.
Speech and Swallow were consulted to evaluate for dysphagia given his head injury and altered mental status; initially he did not pass the bedside evaluation.
As his mental status improved his diet was upgraded to regular with thin liquids.
Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have recommended rehab for improving function and cognitive abilities.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB/wheeze.
