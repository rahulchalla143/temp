Admission Date: [**2177-1-14**]        Discharge Date: [**2177-1-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-5-6**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   REASON FOR ADMISSION:  On [**1-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for scheduled pulmonic valve repair, and right ventricular aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass grafting, and a planned biatrial maze procedure.
The patient was on Coumadin for a preoperative history of cerebrovascular accident.
This gentleman has a long history of cardiac disease with    a diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot.
In [**2134**] he had a classic right Blalock-Taussig shunt.
In [**2166-12-28**] he had right ventricular outflow tract    construction with a 24-mm aortic homograft.
In [**2170**] he had a history of ventricular tachycardia by    Holter.
Atrial fibrillation.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with mild    restrictive and obstructive disease by pulmonary function    tests.
No alcohol history.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A MRI in [**2175-12-28**] showed a dilated right ventricle with severe dysfunction and an ejection fraction of 21 percent, unobstructed RV/PA homograft, mild proximal PA narrowing bilaterally at the insertion of the conduit, mild left ventricular dysfunction, with an ejection fraction on the left side of 45 percent, dilated ascending aorta to 3.2 cm, vein graft to RCA had calcified disease, the RCA from the right coronary cuff was rotated clockwise, the graft in the aorta to the LAD and circumflex was patent, and the left anomalous vein was occluded.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 66 with frequent PVC's, ST depressions in V1 through V5.
Pulmonary function tests previously from [**2176-6-27**] in [**State 1727**] showed mild obstructive/restrictive disease which responded to bronchodilators.
A sleep study was also recommended to the patient which - in [**Month (only) 205**] - showed a mild sleep-related disorder with no CPAP; although this was recommended to the patient.
He had branch PA stenosis at the insertion of the conduit, and conduit stenosis with a peak gradient of 20 mmHg.
There was no left main disease.
There was focal stenosis of the LAD proximal to the graft.
There was mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation.
He was in atrial fibrillation at 68, temperature was  93, the blood pressure was 120/70, and the respiratory rate was 20.
No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
He had decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the bases.
Heart rate was irregularly irregular with a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
There was a well-healed sternal scar.
He had 2 plus bilateral femoral pulses, 2 plus bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses, and 1 plus bilateral posterior tibial pulses.
No radial pulse on the right and a 2 plus radial pulse on the left.
On [**1-15**], the patient underwent a redo sternotomy with a vein graft to the left anterior descending, coronary artery bypass grafting times one, biatrial radiofrequency maze, pulmonic valve replacement with 27 pericardial tissue valve, and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract with a 24-mm gel weave graft.
The patient also had right ventricular plication and intraaortic balloon pump was placed.
The patient continued to have respiratory failure.
He remained on maximal pressure support as well as some inotropic support.
Postoperative laboratories were as follows.
On postoperative day one, a right femoral arterial line was placed for monitoring his hemodynamics and a right femoral Quinton catheter was placed to initiate continuous venovenous hemodialysis after the patient's very long pump run for management of his fluid volume status.
He had bilateral coarse breath sounds.
The Renal staff continued to consult on the patient for his oliguric acute tubular necrosis with very high filling pressures.
On[**Last Name (STitle) 14810**]perative day two, the patient also developed some ischemia in his left lower extremity.
On [**1-17**], at 12:30 in the evening, the patient continued to have an ischemic appearing left lower extremity and remained clinically ill.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59846**] noted that the patient likely had compromised blood flow to the left leg secondary to ECMO cannula.
The plan was to sew two grafts to the right femoral artery and perfuse the graft while decannulated in the left femoral artery to allow the patient to have antegrade and retrograde flow on the ECMO to provide for the amount of time it was needed off ECMO.
At 9:30 a.m. the patient's clinical condition remained very critical.
The ECMO was turned off, and the patient became hypotensive as well as a complex bradycardia that then led to asystole.
Status post ventricular tachycardia and atrial    fibrillation.
Cerebrovascular accident with left hemiparesis.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
