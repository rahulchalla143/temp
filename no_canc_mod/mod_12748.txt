No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mildly dilated LV cavity.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Simple atheroma in aortic root.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
No valvular AS.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is both anterior and posterior leaflet retraction with a dynamic central to posteriorly-directed jet.
There is dilation of the mitral annulus which measures 3.4 cm.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
He was seen by electrophysiology for bradycardia/atrial fibrillation on admission and his digoxin and atenolol were discontinued.
He was also seen by sleep medicine after periods of apnea were noted preoperatively, and he will need outpatient follow up approximately four weeks after discharge.
He was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] for hyperglycemia, and was started on Lantus.
Discharge Instructions: Call with fever, redness or drainage from incision or weight gain more than 2 pounds in one day or five in one week.
