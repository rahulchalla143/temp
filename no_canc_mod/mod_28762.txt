The patient required quite a lengthy extrication and was without a definitive airway for an undetermined period of time.
The chest x-ray revealed a diffuse whiteout of the left chest compatible with both hemorrhage and contusion.
The CT scan revealed diffuse loss of great white matter, differentiation loss of the sulci secondary to a combination of head injury and diffuse anoxic injury.
There was a right to left shift of approximately 1 cm at the level of septum pellucidum and the suprasellar cisterns were nearly completely effaced.
The findings were most consistent with acute anoxic injury superimposed on intracranial hemorrhage.
The family was informed by both the neurosurgery service and trauma service of the critical nature of the head injury that it would likely preclude survival.
All these efforts were to no avail.
The patient subsequently began having excessive hemorrhage out of his left tube thoracostomy.
