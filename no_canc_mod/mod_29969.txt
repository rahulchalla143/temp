Three hours after arrival in the [**Name (NI) **], pt noted to be more lethargic with labored breathing and SBP had dropped from the 100s to the 80s/40s.
He was sent for head CT which showed a lacunar infarct.
CT chest/abd negative for abscess, UA positive for infection and pt was admitted to the SICU.
Cardiology was consulted given the hx of pericardial effusion on prior CT. An echo showed that the pericardial effusion was stable in size without evidence of tamponade.
Hypertension 3.
Scoliosis/Kyphosis 6.

Interval development of simple-fluid containing collection within the right inguinal region, and interval increase in size of two left inguinal fluid collections.
There is no evidence of rim enhancement, surrounding inflammatory fat stranding, or extravasation of contrast into these simple containing fluid collections.
Stable appearance of aortic endovascular graft without evidence of endoleak.
Stable appearance of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar collapse/consolidation.
Head CT [**1-19**]: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Chronic microvascular  angiopathy.
Left basal ganglia lacunar infarction.
- Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
- Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
- Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
- There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
- Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
- There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
RUE LENI [**1-23**]: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the imaged vessels .
Micro: Urine Cx [**1-19**]: MRSA, enterococcus Urine Cx [**1-19**]: MRSA, enterococcus Right Groin Swab: MRSA Rectal Swab for VRE: positive Blood cx: pending Stool for c diff: negative   Brief Hospital Course: 85M with hx of Parkinson's disease, AAA s/p repair in [**11-29**] admitted on [**1-19**] from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with fever and leukocytosis and subsequently became hypotensive and unresponsive in ED with intubation for airway protection likely [**2-26**] MRSA UTI .
Due to a persistent elevated WBC and MRSA in urine, ID was consulted.
A possible pneumonia was seen on CXR, likely ventilator-associated so patient was continued on Levofloxacin/Flagyl for 10 day course.
Likely elevated in setting of pneumonia and urinary tract infection and also high dose steroids.
Acute renal failure this admission is likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis during hypotension in ED.
Volume overload: EF normal and with normal E/A ratio so no clear evidence for heart failure.
AAA s/p repair: no evidence of infection of graft, vascular was involved throughout hospital stay .
It was probably due to small vessel disease from long standing diabetes.
It is not likely related to his dysphagia.
His swallowing problem was probably from deconditioning and post intubation.
His Parkinson disease was also thought to be stable.
