He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU [**Date range (1) 51549**] with coffee-ground emesis though his EGD at OSH revealed nonbleeding varices and evidence of portal gastropathy.
He underwent ERCP at [**Hospital1 18**] because there was bleeding noted from a prior CBD stent, which was retrieved and replaced.
During this procedure, 5 cords of grade II esophageal varices were banded.
Prior to the aforementioned episode, patient was admitted [**2075-7-11**] to an OSH with hepatic encephalopathy complicated by alcohol withdrawal and delirium tremens requiring lorazepam gtt.
Previous [**Hospital1 18**] notes suggest OSH admissions for encephalopathy also occured in [**5-/2163**] and 6/[**2162**].
Today, patient came for ERCP because of biliary stricture and dilated CBD previously stented 3-4 times.
Exam was notable for afebrile, BP 90-100/50-60, swollen legs, and mildly distended abdomen.
Procedure held because of encephalopathy, and eventually will likely return for procedure.
Low suspicion for biliary obstruction per GI.
They said patient has NOT filled his rifaximin or lactulose since [**Month (only) **], while he has filled all of his other medications as of [**Month (only) 462**].
Denies recent drug use, new medications, or medication changes.
Also for some coughing with brown sputum production, although unclear how frequently.
Also complains of abdominal pain primarily in the middle of the abdomen.
Past Medical History: -Cirrhosis (presumably secondary to EtOH/HepC) c/b grade II varices ([**6-/2163**]), hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, hematemesis, portal gastropathy -biliary stenosis s/p numerous ERCP and CBD stent placements / replacements -History of alcoholic hepatitis -EtOH abuse (history of DTs, withdrawal [**6-/2163**]) -HCV (VL negative [**2-/2162**]) -Depression -Peripheral neuropathy -Ulcerative colitis -History of diazepam overdose -History of opiate abuse   Social History: Lives alone, though was in rehab prior to admission.
No history of IVDU.
Family History: No history of liver disease.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Distended but Soft, mildly tender to palpation.
No fluid wave appreciated.
EXTREMITIES: Warm and well perfused, no clubbing or cyanosis.
Nl S1, S2, no murmurs auscultated ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended.
Mildly tender to palpation over liver.
No focal deficits.
Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen, though no evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
The Dobbhoff tube has been removed  PERITONEAL FLUID CYTOLOGY [**9-21**] Peritoneal fluid:   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Coarse and echogenic liver with multiple hypoechoic regions scattered throughout the liver corresponding to areas of hypodensity seen on today's noncontrast CT scan highly concerning for a widespread neoplastic process.
Contrast-enhanced CT scan or MRI study is recommended for further characterization of these lesions.
Diffusely coarse and echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration and history of alcoholic cirrhosis.
Heterogeneous echogenic material within the main portal vein raises possibility for nonocclusive portal vein thrombosis.
Heterogeneous appearance of liver could be related to malignancy, infectious process or cirrhosis.
Marked ascites with no evidence of hemorrhage.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Right middle lobe patchy ground-glass opacities, likely infectious versus inflammatory.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
CT HEAD [**9-21**] IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage or edema.
Global atrophy, more prominent in the frontal lobes bilaterally, likely related to chronic alcohol abuse.
CXR [**9-23**]: FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**9-22**], there is mild increase in opacification at the right base, consistent with the CT diagnosis of right lower lung pneumonia.
Less prominent changes are also seen at the left base.
This suggests that there may be some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure adding to the overall pattern.
There is a dense streak of atelectasis seen at the left base.
EEG [**2163-9-27**]: Abnormal EEG due to markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the slow disorganized background, the lower voltage background over the left side, and the bursts of generalized slowing.
The first and final abnormalities signify a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
The lower voltage background on the left side raises the possibility of material interposed between the cortical surface and recording electrodes, e.g.
There were no clearly epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
There is a nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
This along with generalized increased abdominal densities is consistent with ascites.
IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of obstruction.
Mild aspiration with thin and nectar consistencies.
For further details, please refer to the note by the speech and swallow division in the OMR  MR Abdomen/Liver [**2163-10-1**]: FINDINGS:  The liver has a nodular contour and is shrunken in keeping with cirrhosis.
There is signal loss in the liver between the in-phase and out-of-phase sequence, consistent with hepatic steatosis.
There is also peripheral arterial hyperenhancement within segment VII (sequence 1501, image 77) - again this area has no T2 correlate and does not demonstrate washout on the delayed phase.
Both of these areas likely represent transient hepatic intensity differences.
The hepatic artery is patent, and there is conventional hepatic arterial anatomy.
There is also central intrahepatic duct dilatation.
There is moderate volume ascites within the peritoneal cavity.
Multiple distal esophageal and gastric fundal varices are identified.
The pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas appears prominent, with the distal duct appearing within normal limits.
Within the lower pole of the left kidney, there is a subcentimeter focus of T1 hyperintensity (sequence 12, image 25) which does not enhance post-contrast and likely represents a hemorrhagic cyst.
There is a nasogastric tube in situ within the stomach.
No retroperitoneal adenopathy.
There are bilateral pleural effusions - the right-sided pleural effusion has increased in size since the previous CT.
No destructive osseous lesions.
Cirrhotic liver with evidence of secondary portal hypertension (splenomegaly and distal esophageal varices).
No focal liver lesions.
No lesions suspicious for HCC.
Biliary stent in situ within the CBD with residual intra and extrahepatic duct dilatation.
Moderate volume ascites.
Bilateral pleural effusions - the right pleural effusion has increased in size since the previous CT. 6.
Mild residual atelectasis at the left lung base.
-Stent in the major papilla (stent removal) -Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome -A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 16 mm up to the ampulla, suggesting papillary stenosis.
No stone or sludge were noted.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum  [**2163-10-5**] CXR Feeding tube loops in the stomach and passes out of view.
No pleural abnormality.
[**2163-10-6**] VIDEO SWALLOW IMPRESSION:  Mild penetration with thin and nectar consistencies.
No aspiration with any consistency barium.

# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS and ICU COURSE: After initially admitted, patient noted to be confused, agitated, with likely combination of alcohol withdrawal and hepatic encephalopathy.
Infectious workup on the floor was unremarkable, but ceftriaxone was initiated because of clinical picture and risk of SBP.
Patient triggered on CIWA repeatedly, becoming more agitated and then started to experience visual hallucinations.
There was also concern for continuing infection.
Peritoneal tap performed which did not fnid evidence of SBP.
Chest CT showed ground glass opacities suspicious for pneumonia, for which patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia (vancomycin and cefepime).
Head CT was negative for acute process.
Abdominal ultrasound found no evidence of clot.
Patient also found to have [**Last Name (un) **], which resolved with fluid resuscitation and albumin.
Because of respiratory distress with desaturations, worsening encephalopathy, patient returned to the ICU again, where antibiotics were continued for a full course for HCAP (1 week) and patient was treated aggressively with lactulose for encephalopathy.
# ETOH/HCV CIRRHOSIS: Patient with history of cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension, varices, variceal bleed.
Because of diffuse liver nodularity appreciated on CT and ultrasound when patient first admitted (as well as known lesion in the past), MRI was conducted, which did not show evidence of HCC.
Patient did develop a transient leukocytosis on the floor.
Diagnostic paracentesis performed which showed no evidence for SBP; other infectious workup was unremarkable.
Strictures potentially [**12-30**] ulcerative colitis with PSC seen on ERCP.
Patient underwent ERCP for stent removal and sphincterotomy on [**2163-10-4**] after stabilization s/p ICU course, without complication.
# HCAP: Patient treated with course of vancomycin/cefepime for HCAP as described above.
Speech and swallow followed closely along with a workup including video swallow studies.
# HYPERKALEMIA: Patient's potassium trended up towards the end of admission, felt to be likely [**12-30**] potassium sparing diuretic use.
Inactive issues: # HYPONATREMIA: Likely hypervolemic hyponatremia [**12-30**] liver disease.
# ULCERATIVE COLITIS: Not currently on treatment # DEPRESSION: Continued citalopram # HEPATITIS C: Infection cleared [**2-/2162**]  PENDING LABS: - cytology from ERCP brushings - peritoneal fluid culture [**10-5**] - blood cultures 11/6  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient will need very close follow-up for relapse prevention - Patient will need close follow-up for electrolytes (hypomag, hyperK, hyponatremia) (labs checked [**2163-10-14**] and [**2163-10-21**] with results faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] - S&S at rehab - Transplant eval in 6 months if sober  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
Ciprofloxacin HCl 500 mg PO Q24H For SBP prophylaxis   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Alcohol withdrawal Hepatic encephalopathy Healthcare associated pneumonia Alcohol/HCV cirrhosis Biliary stricture of unknown etiology   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment of altered mental status.
It was likely that your altered mental status was due to both hepatic encephalopathy (especially because you had not been taking lactulose/rifaximin) as well as alcohol withdrawal (because of your heavy alcohol use).
In addition, you were found to have a likely pneumonia, for which you were treated with IV antibiotics.
Our speech and swallow experts advised us to take advancement of your oral intake slowly, because your swallowing muscles was rather weak.
We performed this procedure, in conjunction with an EGD/endoscopy, and the stent was removed without complication.
Several days after returning to the medical floor, you were found to have an elevated white blood cell count (often a reflection of an infection).
You felt well otherwise and did not have a fever.
Your white blood cell count returned to [**Location 213**] without intervention.
