Alert and oriented x3, mildly anxious.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, mucous membranes moist with poor dentition, oropharynx clear.
Neck: Supple, no appreciable JVD, no lymphadenopathy Resp: Lung fields clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rales or rhonchi Cardio: Regular rate and rhythm, nml S1/S2, no murmurs appreciated Abdomen: Obese, soft, non-distended.
Tender to palpation bilaterally over lower quadrants without guarding or rebound tenderness.
1+ pitting edema on lower extremities, R>L.
Left posterior tibial and peroneal veins show normal flow.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in left lower extremity veins.
[**2179-7-17**] CTA: CT OF THE CHEST: The visualized lungs show trace bibasilar atelectasis, but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Mediastinal, axillary and hilar lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
No filling defects are noted within the pulmonary vasculature to suggest pulmonary embolism.
No intramural hematoma or dissection is noted.
This study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Within this limitation, there is a small hiatal hernia noted.
Multilevel degenerative changes are noted but no focal lytic or sclerotic lesion suspicious for malignancy are identified.
No acute pulmonary embolism or acute aortic injury.
Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
[**2179-7-17**] CT Abd/Pelvis: ABDOMEN: The visualized lung bases demonstrate minimal dependent atelectasis.
There is a small hiatal hernia but the stomach and abdominal bowel loops are otherwise normal in their appearance.
No free air or free fluid or adenopathy is present.
PELVIS: No free air or free fluid or adenopathy is present, although the deep low pelvis is difficult to evaluate due to extensive streak artifact from the right hip fixation hardware.
Colonic diverticula are present without diverticulitis.
BONE WINDOWS: There is right femoral and acetabular fixation hardware which appears intact.
Scoliosis is present with degenerative changes but no suspicious bone lesions are present.
No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis although low pelvic evaluation is limited by streak.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Intact right hip fixation hardware with an acetabular fixation screw traversing through the acetabulum into the pelvic musculature but no hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year-old female with a history of recurrent DVT/PE, RCA dissection during cardiac catheterization [**3-/2179**] s/p BMSx6 presenting as transfer from OSH with chest pain, now resolved, later abdominal pain and hypotension NOS.
Patient was afebrile without WBC elevation, and was mentating well at baseline with adequate urine output.
She was transferred to the MICU for blood pressure monitoring without need for peripheral pressors, and was transferred to floor on HD#2.
CTA negative for PE, LENI negative for DVT, CT abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of acute process.
Bedside FAST exam in ED did not show any evidence of pericardial effusion or intra-abdominal bleeding.
TTE compared with prior from [**5-/2179**] demonstrated moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, RA enlargement, and LV hypokinesia, which were consistent with previous findings.
Etiology of hypotension is unclear but thought to be due to combination of autonomic dysfunction and over-diuresis on home Furosemide regimen, which had recently been increased.
Abdominal pain: Patient mildly tender to palpation in the epigastric region, which was noted several hours after onset of her chest pain.
During admission, pain persistent for several days and was noted in the epigastric region, RUQ, and bilateral lower quadrants; she was without rebound or guarding throughout.
It is unclear from the history if it is temporally related to eating, but the patient states it increases with reclined position.
Abdomen/pelvis CT scan showed no evidence of infection or diverticulitis.
Upon discharge, her abdominal pain was absent.
Furosemide (home dose 60 mg) was discontinued in setting of hypotension.
Dissociative identity disorder/anxiety: Patient endorsed baseline levels of anxiety and denied SI/HI, feels safe at home.
Patient stated that she desired to not have chest compressions or intubation if she were critically ill; she demonstrated full understanding of the consequences of her DNI/DNR status.
The status was documented and with the awareness of the attending physician.
6. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual PRN as needed for Chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hypotension Atypical chest pain  Secondary diagnosis: CAD with RCA dissection s/p BMS Congestive heart failure Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, s/p pacemaker placement   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] intensive care unit from [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation of low blood pressure after you experienced chest pain and abdominal pain.
Your labs and EKGs indicated you did not have a heart attack.
You have had tricuspid regurgitation in the past as well, so this is likely not the cause of your low blood pressure.
If you have a weight gain of >[**3-4**] lbs in one day or feel more short of breath, call your doctor about when to restart Lasix.
