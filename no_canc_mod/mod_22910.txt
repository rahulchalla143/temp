She didn't initially note weakness or difficulty with speech although her mental status limits the history she provides.
CT head revealed small wedge shaped srea of low density in the right parietal lobe, atrophy, small vessel disease, and a posterior scalp mass.
CXRAY showed left sided opacification.
CT neck done without obvious fracture and pelvic films also negative.

There is streaky density in the lower right lung likely representing subsegmental atelectasis and evidence of a small right effusion as before.
EEG ([**12-29**]) This is an abnormal routine EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the low voltage background, indicative of a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
No evidence of epileptiform discharges, electrographic seizures or nonconvulsive status epilepticus was seen during this recording.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
Acute infarction, predominantly in the right MCA territory, but also involving left corona radiata, redemonstrated.
No evidence of extension, new infarction, or hemorrhagic conversion.
Large posterior scalp soft tissue mass redemonstrated, again possibly representing extensive venolymphatic malformation or hemangioma, or other non-aggressive process, with other differential diagnostic considerations as outlined in the report of very recent MRI.
TTE [**2156-12-20**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
She was found to have a right parietal infarct.
Her exam worsened during the hospitalization and she required intubation for pulmonary distress.
Stroke was thought secondary to cardioembolic source and patient was found to be intermittently in Atrial Fibrillation.
Vessel imaging and cardiac echo revealed no dissections and no vegetations.
Pneumonia Patient was in respiratory distress and required intubation.
She had two bronchoscopies which did not reveal any culture positive organisms.
She was extubated after discussions with her HCP, but continued to be in respiratory distress requiring 40% facemask with sats in the 80s-90s.
3. morphine concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 0.25 - 1.0 ml PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for discomfort.
4. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 11729**] Home - [**Location (un) 686**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left parietal stroke Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Level of Consciousness: Lethargic and minimally responsive Activity Status: Bedbound.
Initially the patient was in respiratory distress and intubated in the ICU.
Bronchoscopy was negative for infection, and endotracheal tube was taken out after discussion with health care proxy.
