The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are  mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Also noted is a left pleural effusion.
There are two loops of dilated small bowel measuring up to 4 cm in the left lower quadrant.
Dilated loops of small bowel with a transition point seen in the right abdomen, with decompressed small bowel seen distal to the transition point to the teminal ileum.
Findings suggest early small bowel obstruction.
Small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis and consolidation, concerning for left lower lobe pneumonia.
Low attenuation left adrenal nodule, incompletely characterized on this non-contrast study.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 87yoW with h/o DM and [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with Afib/RVR, UTI, Pneumonia, SBO and GI bleed.
Afib likely occured in setting of acute infection and SBO with dehydration.
Pt was initially started on aspirin but had to be discontinued due to her GI bleed.
The patient's oxygen saturation was stable and the patient had no respiratory distress while in house.
The coverage was changed to ceftriaxone and her elevated WBC count resolved.
#  SBO:  No prior abdominal surgeries.
Bowel sounds returned and the pt began to pass flatus and have small bowel movements.
# GI bleed: While hospitalized the patient had 2 episodes of maroon colored, guaiac positive stools.
She underwent a colonoscopy which revealed multiple diverticuli but no active bleeding and noted that the terminal ileum was patent.
The GI service suggested a small bowel follow through study as an outpatient if the family and primary care provider were interested in further investigating the cause of the SBO.
Her ARF was likely due to dehydration and her UTI.
#  Hypernatremia:  Likely hypovolemic due to SBO obsrtuction.
The hypernatremia resolved once the SBO resolved and the pt had normal sodium levels throughout her hospital stay.
#  Hyperglycemia:  Patient has a h/o type 2 diabetes.
Her diabetes was difficult to manage because of her nutritional status and receiving IV D5W.
# Vaginal discharge: The patient was noted to have copious amounts of yellow vaginal discharge.
The patient receieve a dose of diflucan for treatment of possible yeast infection.
The discharge was cultured but was negative for bacterial growth and yeast.
