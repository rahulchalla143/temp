The patient presented with an oblique left femur fracture which required surgical correction by orthopedic surgery.
However, given elevated troponins, echocardiogram with multiple wall motion abnormalities in the setting of low EF (35%), and patient's complaints of chest pain on admission, the patient's surgery was postponed until cardiac risk assessment was completed.
The patient was initially maintained with ASA, Nitro patch, metoprolol, SL NTG, and morphine PCA pump with resolution of chest pain.
The risk of peri-operative cardiovascular event was estimated at about 20%.
The patient's warfarin was initially held given the amount of blood loss and need for surgery.
There was some concern for new elevations in his cardiac enzymes and he was transferred to the CCU team for further care.
He was noted to be hypoxic and in sinus tachycardia to the 120s.
The source of his shock was initially unclear (sepsis vs cardiogenic shock vs secondary to pulmonary embolus), and a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed under fluoroscopic guidance.
The Swan numbers showed elevated right-sided pressures and a narrow pulse pressure which was concerning for PE.
He was started on a heparin gtt, electively intubated, and underwent a CT angiography which showed no evidence of PE as above.
The etiology of hypotension was not entirely clear but PA catheter numbers were not consistent with cardiogenic shock; the shock was presumed secondary to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia and postoperative hypovolemia.
After hemodynamic stability, the patient was extubated without difficulty.
The patient completed a 7-day course of Zosyn and a 14-day course of vancomycin started [**2189-4-4**] for MRSA in the sputum and [**2-12**] blood cultures with S. faecium.
Prior to transfer to the floor, the patient had a pulseless polymorphic VT/VF arrest with QT prolongation.
The arrest was believed secondary to QT prolongation from haldol.
The patient's cardiac enzymes were stable and ischemia was not believed to be responsible for the patient's arrhythmia.
The patient was evaluated for ICD placement because of his depressed EF, but this was not further pursued because of the patient's decreased mental status.
The day prior to transfer, the patient became hypotensive in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
The day of transfer to the floor, the patient received diagnostic/therapeutic cardiac catheterization to evaluate for ischemia given the history of NSTEMI early in his hospital course.
The report is as above; there were no intervenable lesions.
The patient was restarted on coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and should receive INR checks regularly at least twice weekly until stable to ensure that INR is at goal [**3-14**].
The patient is taking tylenol and tramadol as needed for left hip pain.
Of note, the patient had a diagnosis of early Alzheimer's dementia prior to admission.
The patient should have further management of COPD diagnosed on chest X-ray as needed.

TIA  Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with a left femur fracture.
While hospitalized, you had a cardiac arrest from QT prolongation from haldol.
You pacemaker rate was increased to 90 to decrease the QT interval and you should recheck this with your cardiologist.
Please contact a physician if you experience fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms.
