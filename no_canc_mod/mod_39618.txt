Patient has a h/o anaphylaxis with aspirin.
She reports that she first developed symptoms in response to a midol, and developed hives, her throat closed and her tongue and lips swelled.
Her symptoms resolved with benadryl.
Several years later, she again tried half of a baby aspirin, and again developed similar symptoms, relieved again with benadryl.
<br> Patient reports that she had a recent carotid artery doppler which indicated 40-59% stenosis of the right carotid artery.
Given her family history of CAD and patient's h/o HTN and recent fatigue with exercise, PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] stress echocardiogram which indicated an anterior infarct.
<br> Patient reports that she has never experienced frank chest pain or pressure.
She has been feeling progressively more fatigued recently after completing her games, but denies shortness or breath, lightheadedness or chest pain while playing.
<br> On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
She denies abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.
She denies dysuria, hematuria, or urinary incontinence.
<br> Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

DISCHARGE EXAM XXXXXXXXX   Pertinent Results: Admission labs: WBC-4.0 RBC-3.98* HGB-12.7 HCT-36.0 MCV-91 PT-11.4 PTT-24.2 INR(PT)-0.9  GLUCOSE-191* UREA N-18 CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-3.5 CHLORIDE-96 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-16  ALT(SGPT)-19 AST(SGOT)-23 ALK PHOS-55 TOT BILI-0.3  Chol 222  HDL 117 LDL 96  TGs 43  Studies: Stress echocardiogram ([**2108-6-15**] at [**Location (un) 11252**] Cardiology): Questionable anterior septal ischemia, mild to moderate aortic insufficiency, aortic sclerosis without significant aortic stenosis, mild mitral insufficiency and tricuspid insufficiency, borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Patient exercised for 10min, reached 11 METS, with no angina.
CXR ([**2108-6-28**]): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
P wave inversions in V1 concerning for left atrial enlargement.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically flow limiting stenoses.
The RCA had mild diffuse non-obstructive disease.
Brief Hospital Course: REASON FOR ADMISSION 67 yo F with HTN, HL, recent stress echo evidence of anterior iscemia and h/o anaphylaxis to ASA presenting for aspirin desensitization prior to cardiac catheterization.
ACTIVE ISSUES # Aspirin allergy:  Patient has a known history of angioedema with aspirin intake.
One hour following the final aspirin dose, patient developed lip tingling and swelling and was given diphenhydramine 25mg x1 which resolved her symptoms.
Patient was encouraged to take diphenhydramine in the future if similar symptoms developed.
# Abnormal stress echo: Patient has no history of chest pain with exercise or at rest.
However, recent stress echo showed question of anterior septal ischemia.
Patient has been on clopidogrel for carotid stenosis in the setting of an aspirin allergy.
Catheterization on [**2108-6-29**] showed no significant stenosis or lesions.
She denies chest pain, shortness of breath.
Differential diagnosis includes coronary artery disease, effect of recent radiation, anemia, hypothyroidism, pulmonary disease (asthma, pulmonary hypertension).
Patient has known asthma and recent echo did show mild pulmonary hypertension.
Follow-up with PCP regarding recent onset of increased fatigue.
Hypertension 2.
Asthma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
If you experience any lip swelling or rash or itching, take one benadryl 25 mg by mouth, as this relieved your symptoms while you were in the hospital.
Your cardiac catheterization did not show any significant lesions in the arteries surrounding the heart.
