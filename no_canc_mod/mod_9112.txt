HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 8529**] is a 73-year-old female with adenocarcinoma of the lung several times status post multiple wedge resections and a right upper lobectomy on [**2173-4-29**].
She also has a history of significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She is brought into the Emergency Department here at [**Hospital3 **] by EMT after experiencing three hours of shortness of breath on the day of admission.
Patient's postoperative course was notable for heavy secretions which she had difficulty expectorating, requiring frequent suctioning and bronchoscopy several times with intubation 4x during these bronchoscopies.
The patient was discharged on [**5-27**] and was stable until the day of admission, where she is noted to be confused by her family and having increasing shortness of breath with coarse breath sounds.
She was brought to the Emergency Department, where the patient had progressive hypercapnic respiratory failure culminating in a intubation followed by hypotension which required wide open IV fluids and double pressors.
Multiple lung cancers, adenocarcinoma of the lung, negative nodes each time.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a FEV1/FVC preoperatively of 34%.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
Peripheral neuropathy secondary to chemotherapy for the [**2166**] adenocarcinoma.
ALLERGIES:  Aminophylline causes nausea and vomiting.
There was bounding bilateral carotid upstrokes, no bruits, no lymphadenopathy.
There was a S4, there were no murmurs or rubs.
Lungs:  She had decreased breath sounds at the left lower lobe, although is moving okay air.
Abdomen:  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses, no hepatosplenomegaly, and normal bowel sounds.
Extremities: 1+ pitting edema all four extremities, multiple ecchymoses on all four extremities with faint macular rash on thighs.
She had a laceration roughly 8 cm in the left forehand.
Abdomen is soft with mild tenderness to palpation around the PEG site.
She had multiple ecchymoses.
The laceration on the left forearm was dressed and her trache site was clean, dry, and intact.
She had a chest x-ray which showed cardiomegaly, pleural thickening with volume loss in the right, patchy density in the lower up and mid right lower lobe.
She had a loculated right pleural effusion versus infiltrate.
She had left lower lung collapse, small nodular density in the left apex, healed posterior rib fractures on the left.
Bronch on the 12th had grown out Acinetobacter baumannii pansensitive.
On the 15th, she had gram-negative rods and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans, and on the 17th, she had gram-negative rods.
The patient had CT scan of the chest which showed a right hydropneumothorax at the upper lobe on the right, right lower lobe fibrosis, consolidation, small right effusion, and a left sided bullae with minimal effusion.
Pulmonary:  The patient came in with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
It was felt that the likely etiology of the respiratory was as follows:  She has extremely poor underlying lung disease with minimal lung reserve.
Given the multiple resections of her lungs and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bullous disease.
It was felt that she had copious secretions again.
On her discharge from [**Hospital6 **], lately had some mucus plugging and then had respiratory fatigue which led to the hypercapnic respiratory failure.
In addition, she had the right lower lobe consolidation and her right hydropneumothorax which predominantly played roles in her respiratory distress.
She had 100 cc of clear yellow fluid drained from an effusion on the right lower lobe, but this was not in communication with the hydropneumothorax and remainer of the fluid was not drained.
However, the patient continued to have heavy secretions and [**Hospital6 1834**] bronchoscopy which demonstrated these copious secretions, but no further acute pulmonary processes.
She was treated for the right lower lobe infiltrate with levofloxacin which is day #9 on the day of discharge with a total of 14 day course for presumed pneumonia.
The patient had also been on high dosed steroids presumably for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at the outside hospital.
The patient was seen by Thoracic Surgery, and although initially they were questioning the need to have the right hydropneumothorax drained, they mentioned this was not likely contributing significantly to her lung disease and did not need drainage.
Cardiovascular:  On admission, the patient had an accelerated junctional rhythm and had a history of postoperative atrial fibrillation.
However, the patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and multiple pauses exceeding five seconds at length at 3x during her hospital stay.
At one time, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, was treated with diltiazem, and subsequently cardioverted.
After the cardioversion, the patient became asystolic, was treated with Epinephrine and atropine, and reverted to normal sinus rhythm.
The patient was seen by the Electrophysiology service, and they determined that the patient had severe sinus node dysfunction along with A-V node dysfunction.
She had intermittent low grade fevers the last 24 hours prior to discharge at 100.3.
There were no other gastrointestinal issues.
She had a laceration on the left forearm which was seen by Plastic Surgery and they recommended wet-to-dry dressings, but no suturing.
The patient also had a faint macular rash on presentation, which faded after two days presumed secondary to probably the ciprofloxacin that she had received as an outpatient.
She had elevated blood sugars during her hospital stay presumably due to the stress and given hydrocortisone.
Psychiatric:  The day prior to discharge, the patient related feeling depressed and was started on Zoloft for her depression.
Status post right upper lobe resection for adenocarcinoma of the lung with severe underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and poor pulmonary reserve.
Sick sinus syndrome and tachy-brady.
Right lower lobe pneumonia.
Preload dependence.
Morphine sulfate 1 to 5 mg IV q4 prn pain at PEG site.
