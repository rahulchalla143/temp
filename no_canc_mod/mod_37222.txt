Consolidation in lung bases, associated with pleural effusion bilaterally.
Final Report HISTORY: 67-year-old female with severe hypoxia, history of COPD, pulmonary edema.
Rule out pulmonary embolism.
FINDINGS: There is no filling defect within the main, right, left, lobar, or segmental branches of the pulmonary artery to suggest the presence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis can be seen, more extensive compared to prior study obtained on [**2138-9-22**].
Within the posterior aspect of right upper and left upper lobes, there are patches of consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
There is diffuse interstitial thickening, likely representing pulmonary edema.
The amount of pleural effusion has also increased compared to prior study of [**2138-9-22**].
There is thinning of myocardium associated with calcification at the apex of the heart, and could be result of prior myocardium infarction.
Previously-described subcutaneous emphysema has been resolved.
Atelectasis in lower lobes associated with pleural effusion bilaterally.
STRESS MIBI:  RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA: 9.2 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Tetrofosmin Rest ([**2138-10-20**]); 30.2 mCi Tc-99m Tetrofosmin Stress ([**2138-10-20**]); HISTORY: 67 year old woman with CAD and CHF, admitted for recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema, evaluate for perfusion defects.
There are moderate fixed perfusion defect in the basal inferior wall, the apex, and the inferolateral wall.
Gated images reveal hypokinesis of the basal inferior, apex, and inferolateral wall.
No previous study to compare.
Moderate fixed perfusion defect in the basal inferior wall , the apex, and the inferolateral wall with associated hypokinesis.

The patient reported a headache during the infusion.
However, she had no chest, arm, back, or neck pain during infusion or in recovery.
The baseline t wave abnormalities did not change during exercise or recovery.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms and no significant ST segment changes from baseline.

Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo F with PMH significant for recent trach with tracheocutaneous fistula closure trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH, intubated after suspected flash pulmonary edema brought on by severe anxiety.
ENT evaluated for revision of fistula but surgical intervention was deemed unnecessary at this time.
Initial concern for new cardiac cause of flash pulmonary edema, particularly given hx of CHF, however stress MIBI showed no change from study done earlier this month at [**Hospital1 3278**] with several fixed areas of hypoperfusion (see earlier section for complete result).
Other possibilities that were considered were severe anxiety leading to increased in BP causing flash.
Patient was managed with further diuresis, nebs and eventually weaned to room air with night time CPAP which is her baseline.
CHF: Stress MIBI indicated EF 30-35% which is slightly decreased from last LVEF of 45-50% with evidence of systolic failure and moderate MR.  CHF thought to be ischemic in nature.
CAD: Stress EKG showed no ischemic changes.

Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.

We have treated your anxiety and heart failure in addition.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have recurrence of shortness of breath, chest pain or jaw pain, severe anxiety, or any new symptoms that you are concerned about.
* We have increased METOPROLOL to twice daily.
* We have given you an inhaler to be used if needed for wheezing or shortness of breath.
* We have given you ATIVAN tablets to be taken if needed for anxiety.
Please schedule a followup appointment with your psychiatrist for further management of your anxiety within one week.
