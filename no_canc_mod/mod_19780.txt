Admission Date:  [**2175-6-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-6-20**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Ceftriaxone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of HTN, afib, ?
PE, multiinfarct dementia and recurrent UTI who presents with lethargy, hypoxia, and LE erythema.
Per notes from ED and PCP coverage, the patient was being treated for recurrent UTI with a course of levofloxacin started on [**6-7**] but was otherwise doing well.
In the ED she had a fever to 101.8 with intermittent hypoxia that improved to 98% with 4LNS oxygen .
She was given Clindamycin 600mg IV x1 for LE cellulitis and a dose of Levofloxacin 500mg IV for possible UTI.
For her hypoxia, she was given 20mg IV Lasix and a combivent neb with significant improvement with CTA neg for PE and LENI neg for DVT.
She continued to have intermittent hypoxia of unclear etiology so was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring.
Patient noted to have increased Eos in blood and urine so CTX stopped and placed on levo/macrodantin.
Course complicated by persistent hypotension requiring multiple fluid boluses; this resolved after the discontinuation of the diltiazem drip.
Currently, she has a new rash over her trunk and arms bilaterally--thought to be from Ceftriaxone.
Past Medical History: CVA-with multiinfarct dementia-aphasic at baseline Afib UTI Zoster-L thorax Syncope PE Hypothyroidism DJD   Social History: Divorced, lived alone in [**Location (un) 7349**] until fall at home with hip fx then moved to NH here in [**Location (un) 86**] because son lives in [**Name (NI) 392**], had CVA at [**Name (NI) **], never smoker, no ETOH, no illicits.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: T 98 HR 93 BP 100/37 RR 24 O2Sat 99 (3LNC) Gen: chronically ill, in bed listing to left side, NAD HEENT: R nasolabial flattening, Edentulous, Dry MM, Neck: JVP to mandible Heart: regular with occasional premature beats, no MRG, no heave, not parvus et tardus Lungs: Marked kyphosis, Bilateral crackles throughout, decreased breath sounds at R base- not dull to percussion.
Skin: Large 3x4cm SK's over thorax, crusted raised lesions in T4 distribution on Left back and chest.
No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism, aortic aneurysm, or dissection.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Midthoracic vertebral body compression fracture likely chronic.
Calcified left lung granuloma and mediastinal lymph node consistent with old granulomatous disease, such as tuberculosis.
Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
[**2175-6-10**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: No evidence of DVT.
[**2175-6-10**] CT HEAD: Slightly limited study by patient motion, but no intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
[**2175-6-10**] CXR:  No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
[**2175-6-10**] ECG: Technically difficult study Sinus tachycardia Left ventricular hypertrophy Early R wave progression Lateral ST-T changes are probably due to ventricular hypertrophy  Clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing available for comparison .
No pulmonary embolism.
Right lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation with tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
[**2175-6-13**] CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions without overt CHF/pulmonary edema and no evidence for new pneumonia.
Calcified granuloma and node on left.
Osteoporosis of spine with compression fractures.
[**2175-6-13**] ECG: Sinus rhythm @ 78 with atrial premature beats.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Since the previous tracing of [**2175-6-10**] probably no significant change, although baseline artifact on both tracings makes comparison difficult.
[**2175-6-13**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Since the previous tracing  of [**2175-6-13**] atrial fibrillation and ST-T wave changes are present.
[**2175-6-14**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: hypertrophic, hyperdynamic left ventricle .
[**2175-6-16**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved, borderline interstitial edema decreased, heart size normal, but left atrium likely enlarged.
Small right pleural effusion may also have decreased.
Leftward tracheal deviation just above the thoracic inlet is due to tortuous head and neck vessels.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2175-6-12**]):    NO GROWTH.
CT Head FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures.
Ventricular prominence is unchanged, consistent with moderate cortical atrophy.
Focal hypodensities in the left parietal lobe, coronal radiata, and frontal lobe are unchanged, representing chronic infarction.
More diffuse hypodensities in the periventricular white matter are unchanged, and most consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Unchanged appearance of several left-sided chronic infarcts, and small vessel ischemic disease.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR [**6-19**]: IMPRESSION: Slight interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion, otherwise no significant interval change.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of HTN, afib, PE, multinfarct dementia admitted with UTI, left leg cellulitis, and diastolic CHF; course c/b AF with RVR.
No evidence of ACS.
Currently has minimal oxygen requirements.
#Rash: suspect secondary to ceftriaxone or aztreonam.
No evidence of recurrent infection.
Gabapentin 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day: Pleaes hold for somnolence.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay Skilled Nursing Facility  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Lower Extremity Cellulitis Urinary Tract Infection Diastolic Dysfunction/Congestive Heart Failure Atrial Fibrillation Drug Rash  Secondary Diagnoses: CVA-with multiinfarct dementia-aphasic at baseline h/o Zoster-L thorax Hypothyroidism DJD   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please come back to the emergency room should you develop any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty thinking, or any other complaints.
