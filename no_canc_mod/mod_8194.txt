The dynamic expiration series demonstrate significant decrease of the diameter of the right main bronchus, from 7.7 to less than 3 mm with right middle lobe and right lower lobe origins almost collapsed on end-inspiration as a collapsed segmental bronchi in both lower lobes and right middle lobe with subsequent significant widespread areas of air trapping, most likely attributed to this dynamic airway collapse.
The evaluation of the lung parenchima demonstrate multiple rounded opacities, in the right apex, 7:25, in right upper lobe, 7:33, 7:36, extensive areas of centrilobular ground-glass opacities and more rounded consolidations in right middle lobe and right lower lobe as well as in the left lung to a lesser extent, findings which are consistent with widespread infection/aspiration.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
Several mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet the size criteria for lymphadenopathy ranging up to 8 mm in right lower paratracheal, 10 mm in subcarinal and 5 mm in the aortopulmonic window.
Severe bronchomalacia as described, bilateral.
Narrow lumen left in left main bronchus.
Extensive areas of rounded consolidations, ground-glass opacities and centrilobular nodules are consistent with widespread infection/aspiration.
Differential diagnosis might include parenchymal hemorrhage in the appropriate clinical setup.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2196-2-20**] 1:23 PM FINDINGS: Compared to the film from earlier the same day there continues to be bilateral lower lobe volume loss with question infiltrate in the right and left lower lobes.
There is partially occlusive thrombus within a [**2-21**] cm segment of the right internal jugular vein.
There is an additional larger partially occlusive thrombus within a 2-3 cm segment of the right axillary vein.
IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive thrombi within the right internal jugular and right axillary vein.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2196-2-24**] 8:49 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
She was taken back to the surgical intensive care unit and was unable to extubate secondary to agitation.
She tolerated the procedure well and was extubated on [**2-19**] without difficulty.
On [**2-22**] she found to have right upper arm edema and a right upper extremity ultrasound was positive for a partially occlusive thrombi within the right internal jugular and right axillary vein.
On [**2-23**] she complained of bilateral breast tenderness and warmth.
Given her history of past DVTs a lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.
On [**2-24**] bilateral breast ultrasound revealed a small left-sided fluid collection which was drained for 1.5 cc of serous fluid.
