No evidence of RP bleed.
R adrenal adenoma.
SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLA; HUMERUS (AP & LAT) LEFT; ELBOW (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT FINDINGS: LEFT SHOULDER: The humeral head articulates within the glenoid without evidence of dislocation.
There is no fracture.
HUMERUS: There is no visible fracture.
There are no focal lytic or sclerotic lesions.
ELBOW: The radial head and the coronoid and olecranon processes of the proximal ulna articulate properly with the humerus.
No anterior or posterior sail sign is seen to suggest fracture.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
No gross fracture is identified, but if clinical suspicion persists, then MRI is recommended for further assessment.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT Study Date of [**2195-5-25**] 8:57 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower extremity.
If there is a clinical concern for ligamentous injury at these levels, then MRI could be obtained for further evaluation.
No PE or acute intrathoracic process.
Small bilateral effusions and pleural parenchymal scarring.
No intra-abdominal hematoma or other acute process.
Stable gallstone, right adrenal adenoma, and renal cysts.
WRIST(3 + VIEWS) LEFT PORT Study Date of [**2195-5-28**] 5:56 PM IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of an acute bony injury.
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT Study Date of [**2195-5-27**] 3:35 PM IMPRESSION: There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III Flow (see PTCA comments).
Brief Hospital Course: 77F HTN, hypertension, renal sufficiency, CAD s/p CABG, SVT, DMII, moderate AS, presenting to ED with fall and to MICU after flash pulmonary edema secondary to fluid resuscitation.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid resuscitation, atrial tachycardia, and aortic stenosis.
TTE performed showed no evidence of worsening aortic stenosis.
ENT evaluated the airway, which was notable for mild inflammation.
NSTEMI: NSTEMI from severe CAD s/p CABG (likely various grafts are down given patient is 20 years s/p CABG) worsened by demand ischemia from her atrial tachycardia.
Patient with ST depression in pre-cordial leads.
Enzymes were initially trending down until another episode of atrial tachycardia for 1.5 hours in the evening of [**5-26**].
Atrial tachycardia:  The patient would intermittently go into an asymptomatic atrial tachycardia with a rate in the 160s.
Her rhythm control was improved; while she still had brief episodes of asymptomatic atrial tachycardia, she primilarily was in normal sinus at a rate in the 60s.
Initially, ablation was considered given that it was thought she was having episodes of syncope due to the arrhythmia.
However, after further history it appeared that these episodes were mechanical falls rather than true syncopal events.
Repeat TTE this admission confirmed no change in aortic stenosis.
s/p fall: Patient with multiple falls.
CT head and torso without evidence of bleeding.
No evidence of fracture.
Patient with large ecchymoses on LLE.
With muscle breakdown given elevated CKs in the [**2185**] on admission, improved with IVFs.
Per repeat from ED, no head trauma or LOC.
On metoprolol for atrial tachycardia.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for anxiety.
Delsym 12 hour 30 mg/5 mL Suspension, Sust.Release 12 hr Sig: [**5-18**] ml PO twice a day as needed for cough.

Discharge Instructions: You had a fall at home and was admitted to the Medical Intensive care unit with a rapid heart rate.
You also were noted to have some changes on your EKG that showed there was not enought blood flow to your heart.
You had a cardiac catherization and two drug eluting stents were placed in your left circumflex artery.
You had some diarrhea that has resolved, this was not an infection.
Start Miconazole powder under breasts and in groin to treat fungal infection 8.
Weight yourself every day, please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
Please eat a low sodium diet.
