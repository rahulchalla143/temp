HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 43251**] is a 44 year old man with HIV on HAART therapy and a history of pancreatitis who initially presented with three episodes of hematemesis on the afternoon of [**2139-7-21**].
He was seen at the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department that same evening for further evaluation.
of clotted blood and fresh blood which did not clear.
The patient, at the time of presentation, denied any chest pain or new shortness of breath, abdominal pain or diarrhea.
He does have mild shortness of breath at baseline.
He has no history of previous gastrointestinal bleed.
He denies having any history of liver disease.
The patient was emergently scoped by the GI team and found to have Grade II esophagitis in the GE junction and a 10 millimeter ulcer in the posterior duodenal bulb which was cauterized and injected with epinephrine.
He displayed no evidence of further bleeding and serial hematocrits were stable.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus with recent PCP pneumonia and on HAART on admission but held currently.
Hepatitis B antibody pending.
Hepatitis C antibody:  Negative.
Abdominal ultrasound with small ascites, no portal vein thrombosis.
No evidence of free bleeding on serial hematocrits has been noted with the most recent hematocrit 37.7.
The patient's upper gastrointestinal bleed was thought to be secondary to the duodenal ulcer found on EGD; however, it is unclear as to the etiology of the ulcer since the patient denied any history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and since the patient's H. pylori antibody was negative (biopsy results still pending).
Regarding the patient's abnormalities found on his liver function tests, the cause of his liver dysfunction is unknown at this time.
His liver dysfunction as manifested by a tranaminitis, defects in coagulation and low albumin all suggests a picture consistent with cirrhosis.
His abdominal ultrasound also revealed a small amount of ascites.
for SBP prophylaxis given the ascites demonstrated on ultrasound.
Hematologic:  The patient had an elevated INR on admission that has been slow to correct with Vitamin K administration.
His anemia may be consistent with anemia of chronic disease since patient has a normal iron of 163 and a low TIBC of 176.
Renal:  The patient, on admission, had an elevated creatinine.
This suggests that his elevated creatinine is due to intrinsic renal disease rather than a prerenal cause.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to a duodenal ulcer.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus; currently not on HAART.
Renal insufficiency.
The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one to two weeks to discuss initiation of his HAART regimen.
