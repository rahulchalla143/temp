Admission Date:  [**2185-11-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-3-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**] Chief Complaint: Upper Gastrointestinal bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD (x2) s/p varices banding endotracheal intubation nasal packing biliary cholecystostomy   History of Present Illness: 70 year old male with history of heavy alcohol abuse, hypertension, and prior episodes of hematemesis in [**Country 26231**] that were self-limited without further evaluation, who is transferred from [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital for further evaluation of possible upper GI bleed.
He continued to have trouble with his nose, with repeated epistaxis and difficulty breathing through his nose, and presented again to [**Hospital1 5979**] on the day prior to this admission, at which time his nose was re-packed, and he returned home.
He says that later that afternoon he felt very nauseous and vomitted.
They were concerned for a variceal bleed and started octreotide bolus then 50 mcg/hour, gave him PRBCs, as well as FFP and vitamin K 10 mg SQ.
They could not place an NG tube secondary to his nasal trauma from earlier in the day.
GI was called and recommended OG lavage, however the ED was unable to pass the OG tube as the patient became nauseous and wouldn't tolerate passage.
In terms of his prior GI bleed history, he reports that he has had black stools in the past.
He denies abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness at rest.
He has had a 10 pound weight loss over the last 4 months, which he attributes to having cut back on many foods at the suggestion of his doctor.
3) Hypertension 4) EtOH abuse 5) Cholelithiasis   Social History: He drinks at least [**2-11**] glasses of scotch per day, up to [**4-13**] drinks per day in the last couple of weeks.
Family History: His father was an alcoholic and died of liver disease.
He has no brothers or sisters.
NECK: Flat external jugular without localizable JVP.
3/6 systolic murmer CHEST: Clear bilaterally.
No gynecomastia.
No spider angiomata.
No caput medusae.
EXTR: Trace pitting edema MENTAL STATUS: Alert and oriented.
Imaging: Admission CXR: NAD .
[**2185-11-17**]: ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%), but there is no resting outflow tract obstruction.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15)  suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No  aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and  regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Diffuse increased echogenicity within the liver parenchyma consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease including significant cirrhosis/fibrosis are not excluded on this study.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
No focal hepatic lesions.
EGD [**2185-11-17**]: Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (ligation) [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear Normal mucosa in the stomach Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: serial hematocrits [**Hospital1 **] proton pump inhibitor Keep intubated Contact liver team immediatly for recurrent bleeding for consideration of repeat EGD vs [**Last Name (un) 10045**] tube placement, vs tips  Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire procedure.
2 cords of varices were seen with bands, they were not bleeding.
[**2185-11-27**]: RUQ U/S: Slightly distended gallbladder filled with stones and sludge, and a positive son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
Moderate amount of intraabdominal ascites is too small for a non-guided paracentesis.
The above findings are consistent with acute cholecystitis.
IMPRESSION: Acute cholecystitis.
[**2185-11-27**]: CXR: No failure.
No infiltrates .
[**2185-11-28**]: Technically successful ultrasound-guided paracentesis and percutaneous cholecystostomy.
Cystic duct is open to the common bile duct .
1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS.
Enterococcus speciated.
gm stain negative Blood cx: NGTD  Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old male with history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, 2 prior episodes of hematemesis, presenting with hematemesis and hematocrit drop in the setting of recent nose trauma and epistaxis, as well as evidence of hepatic failure on labs.
1) Upper GI bleed:  On arrival to the MICU, the patient had an OG tube placed, with bright red blood return that did not clear with 500 cc lavage.
The patient was intubated and GI performed an EGD immediately, which demonstrated 3 cords of varices with bleeding which were banded.
Repeat EGD on the following day revealed intact bands and no signs of further bleeding.
The varices were thought due to alcoholic liver disease with bleeding exacerbated by the patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.
It remained at or near 25 thereafter with subsequent negative guaiacs and no hematemesis.
2) Hepatic failure:  Patient with poor synthetic function as evidenced by elevated INR and low albumin, likely secondary to heavy alcohol abuse.
Hepatology followed patient while inpatient and recommended a number of medications including vitamin K, nadolol (not given when patient NPO) and stictly no NG tubes (for risk of damaging variceal banding).
He had become somewhat encephalopathic during his stay (such as suggesting that the president of Equador had visited him).
In terms of the spironolactone, he has some peripheral edema which is improved with spironolactone but occasionally his systolic bp was below 90 so this medication was held.
3) Nasal trauma/epistaxis: Patient had nasal trauma after fall 1 week prior to admission.
He had partial hemostasis but continued to bleed intermittently despite FFP and packing by ENT.
He had no bleeding thereafter.
4) Acute cholecystitis: The patient developed right upper quadrant pain, fever, and rising WBC on [**2185-11-27**].
A RUQ ultrasound and HIDA scan were concerning for acute cholecystitis.
He was deemed not a good surgical candidate due to his liver disease so he was taken urgently to undergo a biliary cholecystostomy on [**11-28**].
He tolerated this procedure well and had rapid relief of his abdominal pain.
7) Hypotension: The patient averages systolic BP in the low 90s.
This is also related to the necessity of Spironolactone for treatment of his liver failure.

- Hypertension - Cholelithiasis   Discharge Condition: fair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a nose bleed as well as an upper GI bleed.
You then had a fever and abdominal pain.
You had inflammation of your gall bladder so we placed a biliary drain to improve your infection.
Please call your physician or return to the emergency department if you experience bloody vomitus, bloody stool, nose bleed, weakness, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
