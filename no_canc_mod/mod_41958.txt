Admission Date:  [**2130-11-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2130-12-3**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old male with past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia, who was admitted on [**2130-11-22**], to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with the chief complaint of fever and cough.
He was found on admission to be hypoxic and with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, diagnosed as heart failure versus pneumonia.
He was treated with Levofloxacin initially in the unit and improved rapidly, was called out to the floor the next day, however, transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the following day for progressive hypoxia.
At that point, his antibiotics were Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin and he was diuresed gently for question of congestive heart failure.
An echocardiogram on [**2130-11-27**], showed an ejection fraction of 30 to 35% and multiple wall motion abnormalities which were new findings.
His course in the Medical Intensive Care Unit was also complicated by acute renal failure and a mixed gap and nongap acidosis.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient is easily arousible in no acute distress.
Cardiac is regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, no gallops.
The lungs revealed diffuse expiratory wheezing.
Extremities revealed no edema.
Chest x-ray on [**2130-11-30**], showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates, improved from admission.
Echocardiogram on [**2130-11-27**], showed ejection fraction of 30 to 35%, regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities including an akinetic apex.
No valvular abnormality.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals, ST depressions in I and aVL, minimal ST elevations in V2 and V3, ST depressions in V5 and V6, no old electrocardiogram for comparison.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Assessment is that of a 65 year old male with hypertension and diabetes mellitus presenting with pneumonia and questionable congestive heart failure.
Community acquired pneumonia - The patient was treated with antibiotics, Levofloxacin initially and then switched to Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for progressive hypoxia.
Congestive heart failure - The patient had bilateral interstitial infiltrates on examination which were read as bilateral pneumonia versus congestive heart failure.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2130-11-27**], which showed an ejection fraction of 30 to 35% and multiple wall motion abnormalities including apical akinesis.
Given his low ejection fraction, he was started on afterload reduction with Isordil and Hydralazine.
After his renal failure resolved, he was transitioned to an ace inhibitor and his creatinine has been stable on low dose ace inhibitor.
Consideration of anticoagulation for apical akinesis was brought up, however, on discussion with the primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was deemed that he was not an anticoagulation candidate because of a fall risk.
Acute renal failure - Multifactorial - The patient had baseline renal insufficiency with a creatinine around 1.8.
The renal failure was multifactorial.
His CK was elevated to around 3000 with an unclear etiology with large blood on dipstick but no red blood cells on microscopy.
It was thought that he might have mild rhabdomyolysis as well.
His course was also complicated by urinary retention secondary to Haldol which was given in the unit after an episode of agitation.
Upon admission, his gap acidosis was due to his evolving peptic physiology at the time of his admission.
His nongap acidosis resolved after his renal failure resolved.
Diabetes mellitus - The patient is on Glipizide and Actos.
These were held temporarily due to renal failure and congestive heart failure but will be resumed as an outpatient.
Psychiatric issues - The patient has history of mild dementia and agitation.
He did have an episode of agitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit which was blamed on Klonopin withdrawal and the Klonopin was resumed with subsequent oversedation.
Therefore, on the floor, his Klonopin was held and he has had no withdrawal symptoms.
DISCHARGE SERVICES:  VNA for safety evaluation and medication supervision.
