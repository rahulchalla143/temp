Decrease in size of cystic lesions in the region of the proximal pancreas are likely residual pseudocysts.
Progression of lower lumbar spine degenerative changes, as above.

ERCP [**10-23**] Impression: Cannulation of suspected minor papilla superficially with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification of thin, irregular pancreatic duct.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum  Recommendations: Return to floor Continue with current antibiotic therapy for [**10-19**] day course Consider pancreatic protocol CT scan to further delineate the pancreatic/biliary anatomy as patient is unable to get MRCP due to defibrillator.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin, COPD, CHF, chronic pancreatitis s/p Puestow procedure and cholecystectomy, admitted with cholestatic LFTs and abdominal pain with hypotension on admission c/w biliary obstruction/cholangitis with sepsis.
# Sepsis d/t biliary obstruction/cholangitis: Patient presented with hypotension, fever, leukocytosis and abdominal pain consistent with sepsis.
# Biliary obstruction/Cholangitis - Pt was initially managed in the ICU and was treated aggressively with Vancomycin and Pip/Tazo.
Despite inability to complete the ERCP, his LFT's continued to downtrend, and the patient symptomatically improved, with resolution of abdominal pain.
# Urinary tract infection - Patient had a positive UA, but Ucx from [**10-21**] had no growth.
Thus, it is unlikely that it was the source of his infection or reflective of bacteremia.
# ETOH abuse: Pt denies h/o withdrawal although drinks on a fairly regular basis.
There was no evidence of withdrawl.
His blood pressure medications were initially held due to his sepsis, but these were resumed prior to discharge and were tolerated well.
His Crestor was held, and will be held on discharge until PCP follow up, considering his elevated LFT's from his biliary obstruction.
# Atrial Fibillation: Pt currently in afib, rate controlled.
Pt's metoprolol was resumed on [**10-25**], which he tolerated without difficulty.
Please see results section for recent INR's and warfarin dosing.
# COPD: pt reports being on Combivent at home, although this was not on his medication list from the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**].
He denied any respiratory symptoms.
# BPH: resumed flomax .
# Gout: continued allopurinol .
# GERD: Continued PPI .
6. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tab Sublingual as DIR as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 1110**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: # Sepsis due to cholangitis # Biliary obstruction  # Urinary tract infection # Coronary artery disease # Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with abdominal pain and low blood pressure, and you were found to have a significant infection in your bile ducts due to an obstruction.
You were treated with antibiotics, and we attempted to evaluate and treat this obstruction with a procedure called ERCP, but this was unsuccessful.
