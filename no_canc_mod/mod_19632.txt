Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, CT Head/Neck were without acute process.
The patient was extubated on [**1-29**] after improvement in his mental status.
A precipitant for his symptoms remains unclear as family indicated strict compliance with medication regimen.
No diagnostic paracentesis was performed, though only trace ascites was visualized in the abdomen.
The patient had a recent admission ([**Date range (1) 43171**]) for hepatic encephalopathy.
On ROS, he denies pain other than his baseline MSK complaints.
He denies any recent fevers/chills or other localizing symptoms.
He has no CP or palpitations.
He would like his Foley out; otherwise no urinary complaints.
Past Medical History: - HCV cirrhosis (VL [**7-/2180**] of 262,000), s/p IFN+ribavirin in [**2175**], genotype 1 - grade II non-bleeding varices - thrombocytopenia - Cervical lumbar herniated discs on chronic narcotics - Obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP - Hematuria status post recent cystoscopy - Plantar fasciitis - Meniscal tear status post repair [**2174**] - Bilateral shoulder injuries  Social History: He formerly worked for the Mass Water Resource in sewage and as a painter; currently he is not working (disability paperwork has just gone through per patient; he states this is more due to shoulder issues than his liver disease).
He drank approx one six-pack daily x 10 yrs, but has been sober since [**2158**] when he was diagnosed with hepatitis C. H/o IV drug use in high school, but has not used any illicit drugs since that time.
Family History: His mother died at 82 from pancreatic cancer.
Father died at age 78 with type 2 diabetes and colon cancer.
One brother with esophageal cancer.
Some tangential speech noted and some difficulty naming month/day.
Vocal hoarseness noted.
NECK: Supple with low JVP CARDIAC: RRR, S1 S2 clear and of good quality without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Resp were unlabored, no accessory muscle use, moving air fairly well and symmetrically.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No ascites/fluid wave by exam.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: Warm and well perfused, no clubbing or cyanosis.
DISCHARGE EXAM VS: Tc-96.5 HR 59, BP 116/64, 20 O2 sat 98% on RA GENERAL: Awake, sitting up in a chair, A+O x3, less confused .
NECK: Supple with low JVP CARDIAC: RRR, S1 S2 clear and of good quality without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No ascites/fluid wave by exam.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: Warm and well perfused, no clubbing or cyanosis.
MICROBIOLOGY URINE CULTURE (Final [**2182-1-30**]):    NO GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Sinus tachycardia.
Cannot rule out ST-T wave abnormalities but much of it may be artifact.
There are low lung volumes.
Patchy right upper lobe opacity could relate to low lung volumes and artifact, although an underlying consolidation can be present.
No additional consolidation is seen.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No overt pulmonary edema.
CT C-SPINE No acute fracture or malalignment.
CT HEAD No acute intracranial process .
Abdominal US IMPRESSION: Scant trace of ascites seen in the abdomen.
ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No clinically significant valvular disease.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 56M with HCV cirrhosis on the transplant list who was admitted with an episode of confusion/altered mental status which required intubation for airway protection.
ACTIVE ISSUES .
# Altered Mental Status: Mental status changes likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
Precipitant was initially unclear (as the patient had no evidence of active infection or new metabolic derangement).
The patient only had minimal ascites making spontaneous bacterial peritonitis unlikely.
However, on further questioning of the patient's girlfriend reported he has been having a productive cough a few days prior to presentation.
CXR did show a small area concerning for consolidation and sputum culture grew S. pneumonae and Moraxella Catarrhalis.
Patient was instructed to consider a vegetarian diet should instances of encephalopathy continue.
Original CXR concerning for possible RUL infiltrate.
Given patient was having low grade temps, cough, and a positive sputum cough he was started on levofloxacin for a 5 day course.
# Ear pain- Patient complained of R sided ear pain.
It was felt pain might be reflective of TMJ.
Pain was controlled with Tylenol.
# HCV Cirrhosis: Patient is on the transplant list.
Course has been complicated by  hepatic encephalopathy (on lactulose and rifaximin), peripheral edema and ascites (managed with diuretics and albumin infusions Q2wks) and grade varices II (on nadolol).
# Thrombocytopenia: This was felt to likely  be due to liver disease.
# Muscle Spasms: Patient has a history of muscle spasms for which he receives infusions of 50 g of IV albumin every 2 weeks.
Echo was notable only for biatrial enlargement.
# OSA: On CPAP at home .
# Back, shoulder pain: Patient has chronic pain on narcotics, gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine at home.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy Community acquired pneumonia Hepatitis C Cirrhosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We feel this was most likely caused by an infection in your lungs resulting in hepatic encephalopathy.
You were also given antibiotics for the infection in your lungs which you will need to continue for 3 more days.
