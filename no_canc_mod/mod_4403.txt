NECK: Supple with low JVP, no cervical LAD.
No carotid bruits.
Mid-peaking systolic murmur loudest at LUSB (no radiation to the carotids).
Lower-pitched holosystolic murmur at the LLSB with radiation to the apex.

CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: Warm and well perfused, no clubbing or cyanosis.
No lower extremity edema.
IMAGING: [**2196-5-18**] Bone Scan: Whole body images of the skeleton obtained in anterior and posterior projections show no abnormal focal increased or decreased tracer uptake.
The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for osseous metastatic disease.
[**2196-5-18**] CT Chest: A 9-mm left lower lobe nodule demonstrates heterogeneous attenuation and a somewhat lobular contour (4:198).
A 7-mm ground-glass nodule is seen in the superior segment of the right lower lobe (4:134).
A 4-mm left fissural nodule is well circumscribed and solid (4:119).
A 5-mm nodule abuts the left hemidiaphragm in the left lower lobe (4:210).
A 3-mm solid nodule in the left lower lobe is adjacent to the heart (4:204).
A 5-mm subpleural nodule is seen in the lingula (4:106).
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.
Right hilar lymph node (2:29) is commonly seen at the upper pole of the right hilus.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Very dense calcifications are seen in the region of the mitral annulus, and less dense calcifications are seen along the aortic valve.
Left-predominant coronary artery calcifications are mild to moderate in severity.
Aortic arch calcifications are present.
No pericardial effusion is present.
This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures, but within this limitation, no acute abnormalities are detected.
Atherosclerotic arterial calcifications are seen in the upper abdominal aorta and splenic artery.
Metallic density is seen adjacent to the right transverse process of a lower thoracic or upper lumbar vertebral body.
Just superior to this level in the right posterior subcutaneous fat, there is another metallic density and superior to this is a third metallic density posterior to a lower thoracic spinous process.
Right scapular sclerosis is noted.
9-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, chronicity difficult to determine since this lesion is located at the margin of included lung fields from prior CT abdomen ([**2194-2-14**] and [**Month (only) **] [**2188**]), but likely new.
Dense calcification in the region of the mitral annulus.
Aortic valve and coronary artery calcifications, likely hemodynamically significant.
Right scapular sclerosis.
[**2196-5-19**] EGD: 1 cords of grade I varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Friability, erythema and petechiae of the mucosa with contact bleeding were noted in the antrum.
These findings are compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Other: There was an area of antrum with active bleeding likely either from a Dieulafoy or just from portal hypertensive gastropathy.
A gold probe was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Friability, erythema and petechiae in the antrum compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy There was an area of antrum with active bleeding likely either from a Dielofay or just from portal hypertensive gastropathy.
(injection, thermal therapy) Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1356**] is a 60 year old gentleman with a PMH alcholic cirrhosis with known Grade I varices, who was admitted with acute on chronic anemia from upper GI source and dyspnea.
Acute on chronic anemia most likely caused the patient's dyspnea.
This showed an active bleed in the gastric antrum, likely a Dieulafoy lesion or from portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Bleeding lesion was treated with epinephrine and thermal therapy.
Subsequently, Hct was stable, and patient was asymptomatic (dyspnea resolved).
# Dyspnea on exertion: Symptoms present with exertion for two days prior to admission, with some chest discomfort.
History was consistent with stable coronary disease symptomatic from exercise in the setting of severe anemia.
There were no acute ischemic changes on EKG or CT scan.
Has had a recent cardiac workup which was unremarkable, however anemia was not severe at that time.
Symptoms resolved and remained absent after blood transfusions.
# Pulmonary nodule was noted incidentally on CT scan.
# HCP: wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1356**] (cell: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 33375**]) # Code: full (confirmed) # Cirrhosis: Complicated by periodic encephalopathy and varices.
No encephalopathy, jaundice, bleeding varices or ascites noted during this admission.
# Insomnia: Continue trazodone.
Secondary diagnosis: Cirrhosis Chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with worsening anemia, and were found to have a bleed in your stomach.
Your shortness of breath also improved.
