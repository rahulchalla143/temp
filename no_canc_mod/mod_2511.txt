Ventral hernia, status post repair with skin graft and mesh.
Enterocutaneous fistula  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Takedown of colostomy with partial sigmoid resection and     end-to-end colorectal anastomosis.
Takedown of enterocutaneous fistula.
VAC placement to abdomenal wall defect  History of Present Illness: Morbidly obese 56F s/p chole and oophorectomy for reportedly benign dz, complicated by postop SBO secondary to dense adhesions, presented to our ER [**3-26**] w/ a history of arthralgias, myalgias and fevers.
She later acutely decompensated w/ hypotension and abdominal pain, CT scan at that time revealed evidence of a thickened sigmoid colon with air outside the colon as well as in the portal vein, then had ([**2201-3-24**]) ex-lap, LOA, ant rsxn of rectosigmoid and SBR.
[**4-3**]- dexon mesh closure.
There is evidence (barium enema) of an enter-cutaneous fistula from the top of the rectal stump that empties in the right lower quadrant at the junction of the skin graft and normal skin.
Due to visceral edema at the time of her inital surgery surgery, the abdominal wall could not be closed primarily but the patient was treated with an open abdomen initially and subsequently skin graft.
The patient also has had an enterocutaneous fistula between the tip of the Hartmann's pouch and the skin in the right lower quadrant since the surgery.
The patient now presents for takedown of the colostomy, excision of the skin graft and the mesh at the site of the ventral hernia, and takedown of enterocutaneous fistula to be followed by abdominal wall reconstruction by plastic surgery.

She had multiple operations performed at that time, including 1.
Takedown of enterocutaneous fistula.
Component separation adn VAC closure of abdominal wall defect.
She was given fluid with albumin for oliguria likely due to third spacing.
Since she is HIT positive, she was started on fondaperniox for DVT prophylaxis.
She was transferred to the floor later that night because she was doing very well with no issues.
Her pain was controlled with a PCA.
She was on IV Lopressor for HR and BP control.
She passed flatus.On POD 4, we gave her hydralazine in addition to her Lopressor for BP control.
She recieved toradol for better pain control.
Pain control was still an issues, however her pain was tolerable.
