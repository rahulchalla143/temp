Pt states on the morning of admission at about 9 a.m. he developed R flank pain.
States he had intense pain on urination and noticed that his urine had blood in it.
States the pain has been constant since it began and was only partially relieved by IV dilaudid which he received in the ED.
on the DOA he also developed chest pain while he was sitting watching t.v.
States he also had SOB, nausea, and diaphoresis.
Took 2 SL nitro's and the pain decreased to a [**5-8**].
However, given his history of allergy to aspirin (states he gets SOB and his whole body swells) he was transferred to the CCU for asa desensitization prior to cath.
No fevers, chills, night sweats or changes in weight.
States at baseline he can only walk a short distance before getting SOB.
Sleeps on one pillow and denies any PND or orthopnea.
[**Location (un) **], it was found that the patient has had 4 admissions in the past 4 months for these exact same sx's.
Each admission makes note of a completely negative workup including negative cardiac enzymes, no ECG changes, and CT scans which show no evidence of nephrolithiasis.
His last [**Hospital1 **] admission documents malingering in which the patient was found cutting his hand and placing drops of blood in his urine and then denying this act later.
Moderate non-obstructive cornary disease.
Enlarged LV with hypokinesia of inferoseptal wall.
Trileaflet aortic valve.
Normal uptake of radioisotope without perfusion defect.
Hospitalization [**5-/2182**] @ [**Hospital1 18**] for an episode of syncope and palpitations.
Chronic back pain due to degenerative disc disease.
He is unable to exercise because of his back pain.
There is no family history of clotting disorders.
HEENT: MMM, OP clear Neck: no stiffness or limited ROM CV: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: CTAB Abd: s/nt/nd, +bs.

possible small ST depressions in V4-5 compared to prior (although on review of multiple old ECG's this appears to have been present in the past).
Stress Test ([**2185-5-19**]): This 50 yo man (s/p MI and h/o VT with ICD implantation in [**2182**]; non-obstructive CAD with LVEF ~30% on cardiac catheterization in [**2185**]) was referred for a CAD evaluation.
No neck, back, arm or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the procedure.
No significant ST segment changes were noted from baseline.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes from baseline.
No reversible perfusion defects detected.
Mild fixed inferior wall defect.
CT abdomen ([**2185-5-19**]): 1) No evidence of nephrolithiasis or secondary signs to suggest obstruction.
2) Diffuse coronary artery calcification.
3) Infrarenal IVC filter.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 50 yo M with history of HTN, CAD, CHF with EF of 30%, s/p ICD pacemaker in [**2182-1-29**] for VT, and biploar, who presents with chest pain and R lower flank pain.
This is at least the pt's 4th admission for these two symptoms in the past 4 months; all of these admissions have resulted in negative workups and all have been dominated by the pt's IV dilaudid-seeking behavior.
CAD: The pt's description of chest pain was concerning for ACS, however, since the pt had presented at least 4 times in the past 4 months with this exact same description and on this admission he had negative enzymes with no ECG changes, it was considered unlikely that this pain was cardiac.
The pt underwent a pMIBI stress test which showed no reversible perfusion defects.
His atorvastatin was increased to 80mg daily given his CAD and multiple risk factors.
Rhythm: telemetry monitoring showed no events.
Has h/o ICD/pacer.
#Pulm: has h/o PE now s/p IVC filter placement.
#R flank pain with questionable hematuria: pt gives h/o nephrolithiasis, however, has had 4 CT's in the past 4 months which have all been negative.
He underwent a CT which showed no evidence of nephrolithiasis or secondary signs to suggest obstruction.
However, the pt continued to complain of R flank pain and stated that he had been having this pain for several months and the only thing that had ever helped it was IV dilaudid.
He denied any suicidal ideations and was deemed safe for discharge.
#Pain: pt reported severe pain, but was able to move very easily.
He stated he had [**9-7**] pain in his R flank that was worse with ambulation, however, he was repeatedly seen wandering the halls in search of food in the patient kitchen.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: non-cardiac chest pain  Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Please make an appointment and find a new PCP as soon as possible.
Given the results of your tests, your chest pain is not likely cardiac in nature and so going from hospital to hospital with this complaint is more likely to put you at increased danger due to unnecessary tests.
Similarly, there is no evidence of kidney stones so pursuing more imaging tests would not likely be useful.
If you continue to have right flank pain or hematuria, please address this with your PCP and avoid having additional CT scans.
