Several mildly prominent lymph nodes are noted within the mediastinum, which can be seen in the setting of CHF and/or infection.
There is a 3.8 cm subcapsular mass within the left lobe of liver, which is not completely characterized on this study.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 73 year old man who was transferred from [**Hospital3 4107**] with an anterior STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock and VF arrest who was taken emergently to the cath lab for revascularization, course complicated by in-stent thrombosis and multiple extubations/re-intubations.
# CV: CAD - Patient was transferred from OSH with STEMI, initially loaded with plavix, acquired Vfib arrest resulting in multiple rounds of CPR at OSH and enroute to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient transferred to cath lab emergently (see results) with stent/iabp placement, ECHO showing severe systolic dysfunction in anterior septal region, LAD territory.
Heparin was held post-cath for concern for UGI due to NGT lavage with coffee grounds in ED with small drop in hct.
On HD#3, pt transferred to cath lab emergently for ST elevations in anterior leads, found to have in-stent thrombosis, thrombectomy and PTCA performed, IABP replaced, heparin initiated, plavix loaded at 300mg, began 150mg qd.
Concern thrombosis [**3-12**] to inadequate plavix loading at OSH and while in-house due to lavage and question of decreased PO absorption.
He should also be evaluated in [**5-14**] weeks for SCD stratification with an echo, or alternatively, a signal averaged EKG and cardiac MRI.
RHYTHM - Patient initially found to be in wide complex tachycardia with VF arrest with subsequent afib/aflutter and most recently with NSR with PAC.
# PULM: Patient's airway was initially preserved with intubation and ventilator assistance in the setting of his cardiac code.
Patient self-extubated himself on the third hospital day, which preceded his in-stent thrombosis and re-intubation.
Patient was extubated one additional time with consequent reintubation, most likely secondary to mucus plugging or decreased respiratory drive due to remaining sedating medications.
As per history, no intrinsic pulm disease was found to be limiting his pulmonary functionality, RSBIs remained below 70 for days.
Due to some blood tinged sputum two weeks into his hospital stay and abnormal findings on his chest  xray, a pulmonary consult was placed, with the recommendations to defer on bronchoscopy and following clinically.
On hospital day 16, patient was successfully extubated without further complication or reintubation.
Patient was also empirically covered with Meropenem which was stopped after 7 days after no gram negative organisms were identified.
Patient remained afebrile although his WBC was slow to improve and remained [**12-23**] upon discharge.
Patient may have also had a element of acute amiodarone toxicity which was contributing to his continued oxygen requirement.
The infection is likely to be resolving as patient remained afebrile without other source of leukocytosis.
# GI: On hosptial day 1, patient had coffee ground emesis on nasogastric suctioning, which prompted holding patient's heparin administration.
Throughout his stay, patient did not have any melanotic stools or overt bleeding from his uppper GI tract.
While intubated, patient was given tube feeds when appropriate, initially with increased residuals, but then with improvement on an appropriate bowel regimen.
# ID: Patient acquired a leukocytosis early in his hospital course with a concurrent low grade temperature just below 100 degrees, save some intermittent spikes to 102.
Concern for aspiration pneumonia, patient was initiated on levofloxacin and flagyl treatment.
Patient's multiple sputum cultures returned as MRSA and patient was treatment for a hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin, concurrently with cefepime.
He remained afebrile throughout his stay without another clear etiology of fevers.
# NEURO: Initially it was difficult to determine patient's neurological functioning due to sedation.
As patient was being intermittently weaned off sedation, there was question whether patient was appropriately moving his extremities and responding appropriately, which prompted an MRI, revealing watershed infarcts vs emboli in the right frontoparietal and occipital lobes.t delayed.
Continued concern for anoxic brain injury, sequelae from notable infarcts on MRI, or more favorably, lingering effects of sedating medications.
Patient continue to improve as far as short term memory and recall, with intermittent delusions which may have been due to his strokes and improving ICU psychosis.
