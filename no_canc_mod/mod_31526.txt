Admission Date:  [**2143-11-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2143-11-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2087-12-26**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Non ST elevation MI.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 98237**] is a 55-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post MI times three, last in [**2136**] that was treated with a PTCA to the right coronary and left circumflex.
She was brought in from an outside hospital where the patient had presented with left sided chest pressure.
It was associated with diaphoresis and nausea.
The patient described the pain as exactly the same as her previous MI and that took her to the ED at the outside hospital.
EKG read at the outside hospital as no acute changes and her CK at the outside hospital was negative.
However, the chest pain persisted.
The patient was started on anticoagulation and her second CK came back at 1100 with positivity for myocardial infarction.
She continued to have chest pain [**3-29**], but her EKG continued to be read as normal.
At cardiac catheterization, the patient was shown to have left anterior descending lesion 90% which was stented.
The patient then became chest pain free post catheterization for the first time and remained chest pain free and without shortness of breath for the remainder of her hospitalization.
At baseline, of note, the patient has minimal exercise capacity limited by back pain.
Coronary artery disease status post stents to the proximal left circumflex and right coronary artery in [**2135**] and three previous myocardial infarctions.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  She was a pleasant, obese woman in no acute distress.
Neck was full, but there was no jugular venous distention visualized.
Chest:  Distant breath sounds with faint wheezes.
Cardiovascular:  Chest and heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Positive erythema with a raised margin and satellite lesions in her bilateral groins.
She had 2+ distal lower extremity pulses.
LABORATORY DATA:  Labs at the outside hospital showed an ABG of 7.32, 54 and 102, no ventilator settings or oxygenation information is available.
The first set of labs available from [**Hospital3 **] were on the 15th which showed a CBC with a white blood cell count of 10.7, hematocrit 41.1, platelets 206.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated the following:  Markedly elevated left sided filling pressures and left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, anterolateral apical and distal inferior akinesis, no mitral regurgitation.
Her left anterior descending artery was 95% mid stenosed with moderate calcium.
Left circumflex showed minimal luminal irregularities and proximal stent widely patent.
Her RCA showed a mid RCA stent mildly patent, minimal luminal irregularities throughout.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was found to have a 90% occluded left anterior descending artery which was stented with good success and with subsequent relief of her chest pain.
Her pump function was noted to be roughly 25% left ventricular ejection fraction with akinesis throughout.
She remained chest pain free and free of shortness of breath and palpitations throughout her hospital course.
The patient was noted throughout hospital to have significant biventricular ectopy and was continued on her beta blocker.
ENDOCRINOLOGY:  Patient has a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
DERMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have a likely tinea infection of her bilateral groin.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  The patient was noted to have some wheezing on admission.
Status post non ST elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall with 90% left anterior descending occlusion status post stent to that lesion.
Congestive heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Tinea infection of the groin.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
shortness of breath.
