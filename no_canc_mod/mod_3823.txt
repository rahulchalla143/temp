Empiric treatment for possible seizure disorder.
Possible vertebral basilar system insufficiency.
Long-standing brittle type 1 diabetes mellitus.
He was given some juice with no change in fingerstick which remained 76 one half hour later.
The patient was emergently seen for change in mental status.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus for forty-two years with retinopathy and neuropathy.
Left calcaneal osteoarthritis.
Left chronic heel ulcer.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive.
The patient carries a diagnosis of frontal dementia.
No tobacco or alcohol.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient was in no acute distress but was aphasic.
Simple sentences or words only.
There were no saccades or nystagmus.
He notes pain in all the extremities.
An emergent CT with contrast was obtained that showed periventricular white matter changes.
There were no acute infarcts visible.
This was noted in the unit, however, also in the unit, he had episodes of "unresponsiveness" but in general that lasted fifteen minutes or less but in general, his course improved and he was transferred to the floor the following day.
The patient's course was unremarkable until the following morning and this is on Thursday morning, [**2159-12-13**], when he was noted to be less responsive by the nursing staff and he had periods of emesis while getting an electroencephalogram.
At bedside, the patient was unresponsive and he was responsive only to deep sternal rub but he did wince to pain in all extremities.
He recovered quit well being able to converse with the staff and basically the right sided hemiplegia improved dramatically over the course of a couple days.
When he came back to the floor, decision was made to hold the Dilantin as there was no clear evidence that he was having any electrographic seizures.
He was on 24 hour telemetry that failed to show any electrographic events.
It only showed mild to moderate generalized slowing consistent with mild encephalopathy.
The leading thought is that this is a manifestation of [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia which he has several features of; namely, history of visual hallucinations and some Parkinsonian features with noted rigidity at times on examination.
We also investigated on whether he had another significant feature of [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia, namely, REM C behavior disorder and wife apparently says that he does not have any gross limb movements while he is half asleep.
Given his long-standing diabetes mellitus, the possibility exists that he has poor posterior circulation that would cause a deficit in blood flow in the reticular activating system, thereby causing decrease in mental status.
In fact, at one of our conferences, it was noted that he may have some calcification of the basilar system.
Finally, the thought was also brought up that he may have a subclinical seizure disorder that would cause his focal neurological deficits and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] symptoms.
However, on 24 hour telemetry, we could not find any evidence of electrographic seizures.
However, the possibility of a seizure disorder being a clinical diagnosis cannot be excluded solely based on absence of electrographic events.
He is back at his baseline, able to converse and has metric strength and is in no acute distress.
We have had some issues with his blood sugar which we have appropriately treated with Humalog and NPH insulin with good results.
The patient is to follow-up with his primary care physician on the issues of anticoagulation and his diabetes mellitus.
