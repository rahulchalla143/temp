LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 35 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-15**], no change.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 60% ostial stenosis followed by a 95% stenosis in the proximal LAD.
There was a 50% stenosis in the ramus intermedius.
The LCx had mild disease.
The RCA had a 70% stenosis proximally.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 14 mm Hg.
There was moderate pulmonary  arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 51/25 mm Hg, associated with a mean PCWP of 22 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressure was mildly elevated at 137/83 mm Hg.
Elevated right sided filling pressures with mildly reduced cardiac output.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2140-8-12**] for further management of his myocardial infarction.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease and given the severity of his disease, he was referred for surgical revascularization.
Heparin was continued and Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained pain free.
His postoperative course was complicated only by intermittant atrial fibrillation for which he was started on Coumadin.
