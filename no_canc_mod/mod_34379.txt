She had a CT scan of her abd/pelvis that revealed enlarged and hyperemic pancreas with surrounding fat stranding and associated retroperitoneal effusion without a well-defined pseudocyst.
She was admitted to [**Hospital 28985**] [**Hospital **] Hospital and kept NPO on IVF for severe pancreatitis.
Patient was still complaining of pain this AM.
Repeat CT scan obtained and showed persistent peripancreatic stranding and fluid.
Pancreatic body has necrosis, while tail, uncinate process and head continue to enhance.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for mgmt of severe pancreatic necrosis.
Upon arrival to SICU, patient is confused and is beginning to display signs of DTs.
She is HD stable and reports persistent LUQ pain.

No pulmonary embolism.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion and atelectasis of the lower lobes.
Small ascites and peripancreatic fluid collection are compatible with the patient's known history of pancreatic necro  [**2162-8-18**] Abd CT :  1.
Pancreatitis with large peripancreatic fluid collection tracking around the liver, pericolic gutters, and mesentery.
Edematous gallbladder.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Decrease in size of bilateral basal pleural effusions.
Extensive atelectasis in the basilar segments of both lower lobes as before, but superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded.
Extensive peripancreatic fluid shows no significant change since prior CT. Areas of non-enhancement in the pancreatic body consistent with necrosis.
Preserved enhancement of parenchyma in the pancreatic head, uncinate process and tail.
Findings consistent with necrotizing pancreatitis in the body and medial tail.
The extent of inflammation surrounding the pancreas has improved but the large peripancreatic fluid collection is unchanged in size when compared to prior CT of [**2162-8-18**].
No duct dilation or mass evident.
Resolution of bilateral pleural effusions.
Continued edematous gallbladder wall without pericholecystic abnormality.
Small 17 x 8 mm fluid collection within the pelvis posterior to the uterus is likely resolving loculated fluid.
[**8-16**] - [**8-17**] - PICC line placed, TPN started, continued NPO, supportive management [**8-18**] - The patient had an episode of desaturation, CT scan performed demonstrating pancreatitis with large peripancreatic fluid collection tracking around the liver, pericolic gutters, and mesentery.
She spiked a temperature and was started empirically on vancomycin and meropenem.
She underwent a RUQ ultrasound which demonstrated gallstones, minimal fluid around the gallbladder, no evidence of cholecystitis.
[**8-20**] - continued antibiotics, TPN, supportive care in the ICU due to continued confusion and agitation  [**8-21**] - transferred to the floor for continued monitoring, continued on vancomycin, meropenem, TPN  [**8-22**] - the patient was tachypneic with O2 requirement and was transferred back to the ICU.
Following these interventions, she was extubated without difficulty.
The blood cultures were positive for enterobacter and the urine culture was positive for EColi.
[**8-25**] - LFTs slowly rising, ultrasound performed again demonstrating fluid around the gallbladder and stones, but no evidence of cholecystitis, transferred to the floor on antibiotics, NPO, TPN.
While on Meropenem she had another temperature spike to 102 prompting removal of her PICC line and blood and urine cultures were done again.
Currently the blood cultures remain negative, The PICC line tip is negativa as is a urine culture.
She has been afebrile for 48 hours and she is tolerating a regular low fat diet.
