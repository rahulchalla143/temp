Admission Date:  [**2197-9-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-9-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2135-2-23**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CT Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was referred in by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8173**], who evaluated him on the day of admission for symptoms with congestive heart failure.
He became short of breath, which became progressively worse.
He sleeps on two pillows and describes paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
He had some increased abdominal girth.
He did not have any testing at that time.
He has never had any chest pressure and denies a history of prior myocardial infarction.
He also denies dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope.
He has had hypertension and was a smoker but quit five years ago.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress.
On chest examination, there were bibasilar rales.
On cardiac examination, apical impulse was diffuse, heart sounds were normal, there was a loud summation gallop.
There was peripheral edema of the right leg to the mid-calf level.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and left bundle branch block.
Echocardiogram showed an enlarged left atrium, dilated left ventricle with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 20%.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension.
IMPRESSION ON ADMISSION:  Dr.[**Name (NI) 31768**] impression was that the patient was in congestive heart failure and she admitted him to the hospital.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Congestive heart failure.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post right femoral-popliteal bypass, status post left femoral-popliteal bypass and status post below the knee amputation in [**2196-2-17**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was seen by cardiology for his episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular bigeminy.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction by CKs, but the plan was to take him for a cardiac catheterization when he was more stable and had been diuresed significantly.
He was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8173**] with a left below the knee amputation and he was followed by cardiology and case management, as was diuresed for his congestive heart failure.
On [**2197-9-12**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization and was referred to cardiothoracic surgery for evaluation.
He was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] of cardiac surgery, who again examined, and also noted venous stasis changes of his right leg.
He also noted a thick panniculus on his obese abdomen but no hepatosplenomegaly or masses detected.
He had questions about conduit availability in the right leg and recommended that vein mapping be done.
He also noted that the left hand had an intact palmar arch on examination of the left radial artery, the patient is left handed, but there was a question of the intactness of his right palmar arch, as decisions for conduits needed to be made.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2197-9-14**]:  Left ventricular ejection fraction not calculated as no ventriculogram was done; left main had a 50% lesion, left anterior descending artery had a 90% lesion; circumflex 100% lesion and right coronary artery 100% occluded.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] recommended right leg vein mapping and getting a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate for mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction, and agreed to re-evaluate the patient when the studies were done.
He continued to have occasional premature ventricular contractions on telemetry.
Echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 15% with left ventricular dilatation, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricle with also dilated and depressed function.
Diagnosis of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy was made.
Of note, his saphenous vein grafts were obtained from the lesser saphenous area as well as distal greater saphenous, distal to the femoral-poplitea graft in the left lower extremity due to his prior peripheral vascular surgery.
The patient had received 14 units of fresh frozen plasma, ten units of packed red blood cells, one unit of cryoprecipitate and four units platelets for continuing bleeding postoperatively.
The patient remained paralyzed, with bilateral rhonchi.
He was on levofloxacin and vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.
The patient was returned to the Operating Room for postoperative bleeding on the evening of the operative day, [**2197-9-15**].
He was explored for mediastinal bleeding and returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit with his chest open.
His blood pressure was 95/65 with decreased urine output.
There was some evidence of acidosis.
On postoperative day number four, a repeat echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10% to 20% with poor wall motion.
He remained on amiodarone, Ativan, dobutamine, insulin, Levophed, morphine, Neo-Synephrine and cisatracurium for paralyzation in the Intensive Care Unit.
On [**0-0-0**], the patient remained on maximal medical and mechanical support but he continued to move downhill, with multi-organ failure.
As the patient continued to deteriorate, renal thought that dialysis would be impossible with his low cardiac index and attempted to consult the family again regarding these issues.
The patient became acidotic and his systemic vascular resistance was only 487 with a blood pressure of 90/50.
The patient's creatinine on [**2197-9-20**] was 3.1 to 4.8 with continuing acute renal failure.
His chest x-ray showed increased pleural effusion with a question of a pericardial effusion.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left and right     femoral-popliteal bypasses and status post left below the     knee amputation.
Congestive heart failure.
Cardiogenic shock.
