's daughter, she began feeling progressively orthopneic with difficulty lying flat and having to sleep sitting up the night before admission.
She'd also had a chronic, non-productive cough treated with Advair but of unknown etiology.
She did not report fevers, chills, dizziness/lightheadedness, leg swelling, chest pain or palpitations.
She received IV fluids and developed respiratory distress with hypotension, was intubated and transferred to the MICU.
Since transfer to the floor, antibiotics were stopped, for it was felt that her symptoms were more consistent with CHF flare.
This was repeated on [**8-14**] (?was decrement in setting of myocardial suppression, ?sepsis, stress).
This TTE showed EF=20% with significant dyssynchrony (with tissue doppler), multiple wma's (including a dyskinetic apex with akinesis of parts of the anterior wall), 2+ MR.  She also had her PM interrogated on [**8-13**] (found to be functioning adequately).
On presentation, she reported some SOB and general deconditioning.
She denies a history of LE edema, PND, or orthopnea.

TO of SVG-RCA, 40% tubular lesion of SVG-)M2, HK of anterior wall    Brief Hospital Course: 81F CAD, HTN, PPM admitted to MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and shock of unknown etiology, now thought to be cardiogenic in nature since an infectious work up was unrevealing.
The following issues were investigated during her hospitalization:  Cardiogenic vs. Septic Shock In the MICU, patient was quickly weaned off pressors and extubated on [**2154-8-10**].
She was being ruled out for an infectious etiology of her shock and was empirically started on Vancomycin/Levofloxacin/Flagyl.
CXR, Chest CT and abdominal CT showed no source of infection and pt.
She had leukocytosis of 12.6 upon admission to the MICU and blood cultures were significant for 1/4 bottles of gram positive cocci in clusters, Coagulase (-).
had no source of infection and was not thought to be colonized by MRSA since coagulase was negative.
She remained afebrile on the floor and had no need to be restart antibiotics.
A cardiogenic cause of shock was also pursued and an [**Date Range 113**] done in the MICU revealed an EF of 30% and focal hypo/akinesis of the apical free wall of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
Repeat TTE showed EF to be 20% with apical akinesis.
Given this new cardiomyopathy, she was taken for cardiac catheterization which revealed no new critical disease.
The most likely etiology for new cardiomyopathy is tachycardia induced (or secondary to pacing).
Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure Per MICU notes and admission radiographs, exact source of decompensation remains unclear.
There was no documented temperature above 99.8 while in the MICU and only a mild leukocytosis on admission without bands.
In the absence of an infection and with the low EF and edema on CXR, the likely cause of the hypoxia was thought to be pulmonary edema.
# TRANSAMINITIS On admission, the patient's LFTs were elevated (AST as high as 140, ALT as high as 170).
Cause of transaminitis was likely passive congestion/shock and had improved at time of discharge.
# HCT DROP: after initial drop, hematocrit remained stable.
was started on an aggressive bowel regimen to include a fleet enema which was successful at evacuating her bowels on [**8-14**].
# HTN:  regimen was changed to Coreg, losartan, aldactone with good control  # HYPERLIPIDEMIA Pt.
was maintained on her outpatient dose of Atorvastatin  # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE Resolved, suspect pre-renal azotemia from ?
