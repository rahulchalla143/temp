HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old man who has a prior history of cardiac catheterization on [**2114-2-2**] after having inferior ischemia on routine screening x-rays and exercise tolerance test.
An angiography at that time revealed a 40-50% distal left main, and no other significant coronary artery disease.
Ejection fraction was 58% with mild septal wall hypokinesis.
There was anteroapical and inferior wall ischemia.
Over the past week prior to admission he noticed new onset of chest heaviness, episodic, not related to activity, lasting up to an hour at a time, that resolved spontaneously.
His cardiac risk factors include hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and family history of coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Lipitor.
NECK:  There was no jugular venous distension appreciated, no carotid bruits.
The patient underwent catheterization on [**2115-3-20**] which showed 60-70% stenosis of the left main, advanced stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and an ejection fraction of 60%.
Electrocardiogram on admission was significant for normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 95; normal axis; no evidence of current acute ischemia.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting x 3, left internal mammary artery to ramus, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
