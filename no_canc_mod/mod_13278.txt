Admission Date:  [**2101-8-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-8-12**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Transferred from [**Hospital3 628**] for management of tachy-brady syndrome/cardiac pauses.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1)Temporary pacing wire placement 2)Permanent dual pacemakder placement  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of DVT/PE on coumadin, intermittent AF, CHF with EF 45% who presents from [**Hospital 620**] Hosp for multiple pauses in the setting of CHF exacerbation.
The patient initially presented to his PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) **] for a routine visit and was found to be tachycardic with an "abnormal ECG", per patient's niece.
CXR at the time showed bibasilar consolidations and TTE revealed a slightly depressed EF (45%) and elevated PA pressures.
He was treated for both CHF and community-acquired pneumonia.
The patient did well until [**8-2**], when he went for follow-up to the pulmonologist, where he had a CXR revealing pulmonary edema with similar symptoms of shortness of breath and hypoxia and was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for CHF exacerbation (BNP 6141, Trop 0.055).
However, on [**8-4**], he was transferred to the ICU for persistent tachycardia to the 110s thought to be AF/flutter.
On review of symptoms, he admits to DVT/PE, but he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Past Medical History: 1)DVT/PE on coumadin-In [**11-5**], the patient had several episodes of shortness of breath in the setting of left leg swelling for 4-6 weeks.
US showed clot from the left common femoral vein to the left popliteal vein.
PE CT showed non-oclusive pulmonary emboli bilaterally in the upper lobe arteries.
On ECHO, there was no evidence for right sided heart strain.
Mild AS, Trace TR.
RV enlargement with hypokinesis, mild AS, 1+ MR, 1+TR, PAP of 34mmHg.
trifascicular block-In 4/89, EKG showed 1st degree AV block and RBBB.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
II/VI systolic murmur heard loudest at the apex.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Soft bibasilar crackles improved from yesterday.
Abd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses.
2+ dorsal pedal pulses.
Skin: Bilateral lower extremity venous stasis changes.
CXR [**2101-8-6**]:  Calcified pleural plaques consistent with previous asbestos exposure.
There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angels that may be pleural thickening or pleural effusions.
CXR [**2101-8-9**]:  Confirms placement of a pacemaker with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
RV dilation with depressed RV function.
Demonstrated no acute intracranial process ushc as mass effect, infarcts, intracranial hemorrhage.
Video Swallowing Study [**2101-8-11**]-Showed mild dysphagia and aspiration on thin liquids corrected by compensatory maneurves such as chin tuck.
MICRO: [**2101-8-10**] 6:37 am STOOL CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2101-8-11**]): FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 57277**] is [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of DVT/PE on coumadin, A-Fib/aflutter, CHF with an EF of 45% who presents with a CHF exacerbation and extensive cardiac pauses during sleep.
Asystolic Pauses/Rhythm-On admission, the patient was found to be in A-fib with episodes of bradycardia and sinus pauses (lasting up to 20-30 seconds.)
This was thought to  that was thought to be possibly due to tach-brady syndrome and significant conduction system disease.
Metoprolol was used to control episodes of tachycardia to the 120's.
CHF:  Pt admitted with dyspnea and likely CHF exacerbation in the setting of a-fib and cardiac asystole.
However, on this hospitalization, the Left ventricular ejection fraction was found to be 35%, with global left ventricular hypokinesis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and Aortic stenosis.
This change in cardiac function is believed to be due to cardiomyopathy from abnormal rhythm/prolonged atrial tachycardia.
And ACE inhibitor was not started for afterload reduction because of the patient's low blood pressures, but can be considered in the future.
As an outpatient, Mr. [**Known lastname 57278**] should get an ECHO in a month or so to reassess cardiac function.
DVT/PE/Anticoagulation:  The patient was on home coumadin for treatment of his PE and a-fib.
Change in mental status-On [**2101-8-9**], the patient became somnolent and PO medications were not administered.
A head CT was obtained that showed no acute intracranial process.
The patient was scheduled for a video swallow study that was performed on [**2101-8-11**] and showed mild dysphagia for thin fluids that could be corrected with compensatory maneuvers.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: asystolic pauses atrial fibrillation congestive heart failure right upper lobe pulmonary nodule C. difficile infection   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a bad heart rhythm and congestive heart failure.
You also have C. diff infection for which we are treating you with an antibiotic.
You were also found to have an incidental pulmonary nodule on a chest x ray.
