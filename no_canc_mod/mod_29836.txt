PERRL,EOMI face symmetric, tongue midline facial ecchymosis no drift MAE's [**5-19**]  Pertinent Results: CT head [**2-7**] IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right frontal/supra-orbital scalp subgaleal hematoma, few right frontal punctate parenchymal hemorrhages, and subarachnoid hemorrhage in the quadrigeminal and left perimesencephalic cisterns.
The focal basal cisternal subarachnoid hemorrhage is in a non-aneurysmal distribution, and likely represents coup-contre-coup mechanism.
The superficial frontal punctate hemorrhagic foci lie in a linear array along the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter interface, and may represent underlying diffuse axonal ("shear") injury.
There is a minimally-displaced fracture of the right orbital floor, associated with a small "trapdoor" fragment (103b:19-22).
This is associated with layering hemorrhagic fluid within the ipsilateral maxillary sinus (2:5).
There is no evidence of significant herniation of intra-orbital contents or impalement of extra-ocular muscles; correlate with clinical evidence of "entrapment."
No other facial fracture is seen.
There is soft tissue swelling along the medial border of the distal femur.
However, no fractures or dislocations.
Mild medial degenerative changes are visualized with small osteophytes and probably similar changes patella (poorly assesss on cross table lateral image).
No radiopaque foreign bodies.
There is marked superior and anterior subluxation of humeral head and related cartilage loss and subchondral erosions.
These appearances are chronic and no acute fractures suggested.
Can't exclude incidental bursal calcifications (difficult asssessment secondary to sclerosis.
X-ray left hand [**2-7**] Extensive degenerative changes with joint space narrowing and osteophytes are visualized at the 3nd MCP joint and at the first CMC joint.
No acute fractures.
No soft tissue calcifications or radiopaque foreign bodies.
Stable subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the perimesencephalic and quadrigeminal plate cisterns.
Stable small subdural hematoma along the tentorium.
Small punctate hemorrhages at the bifrontal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white mattter junction, one of which appears new, likely reflects diffuse axonal injury.
Probable layering hemorrhage in the right maxillary sinus.
No evidence of intracranial aneurysm larger than 2 mm in diameter.
The stable small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left posterior fossa is likely post-traumatic.
Principal cervical and intracranial vessels are patent, with only scattered atherosclerotic disease but no flow-limiting stenosis.
Acute right facial traumatic injury, with minimally-displaced right orbital floor fracture.
No evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Bilateral periventricular and subcortical T2 FLAIR hyperintensities likely related to microangiophatic chronic ischemic changes.
No evidence of herniation of orbital fat or extraocular muscles.
No other acute facial fractures identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the ICu under the neurosurgery service after having a mechanical fall with subsequent findings of traumatic SAH and tentorial SDH.
She was extubated the evening of [**2-7**] without incident.
Her CT scans were stable and a CTA of the head and neck was obtained which showed no signs of vascular abnormality.
Plastic surgery was consulted on [**2-9**] for orbital fracture and they recommended a dedicated CT facial bones.
Plastic surgery final recommendation were no intervention was needed and she could follow up PRN.
On [**2-11**] she was stable without any further episodes of tachycardia.
She complained of some right shoulder pain which was noted to be bruised.
An xray was performed on [**2-7**] and was negative for fracture.
ROM was decreased and pain subsided with rest.
The echocardiogram was performed and revealed mild mitral regurgitation, otherwise no major structural abnormality.
Disp:*120 Tablet Extended Release(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 16426**] home health care  Discharge Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Tentorial Subdural Hemantoma Atrial Fibrillation vs Atrial Flutter   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
You were diagnosed with a heart arrythmia (afib/aflutter)while you were inhouse.
You were also noted to have decreased potassium levels over many days so you were started on a potassium supplement.
You do not require any surgery and it was recommended that you follow up with your PCP if any problems arise.
