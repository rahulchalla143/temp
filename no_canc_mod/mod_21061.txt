Reason for transfer is postoperative for L5-S1 epidural abscess in the setting of previous Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, status post recent total knee replacement and hip fracture in [**2162-11-25**], chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who initially presented from rehabilitation on [**2-3**] with fevers to 102 and hypoxia at 89% in the setting of oxygen saturations of 89% on room air.
During this subsequent hospital course, the patient was found to have a urinary tract infection and a questionable right lower lobe infiltrate, and blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters which subsequently grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient had five days of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from [**2-2**] to [**2-7**] at which point the patient was treated initially with Vancomycin and Gentamicin.
In the Operating Room the patient has had an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram to further evaluate the cardiomyopathy and showed no valvular vegetation, moderate mitral regurgitation, no aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45%.
Epidural abscess, status post debridement.
The patient returned to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after epidural abscess debridement.
Subsequent pathology showed acute osteomyelitis as the source.
The patient was maintained on Vancomycin dose by level and subsequent cultures from the tissue grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient was maintained on Vancomycin dose by level given her creatinine that had continued to rise.
They recommended continued coverage with Vancomycin, and Neurosurgery continued to follow the patient who recommended following the patient's mental status and neurological examination as the sedation from the ventilation was weaned off.
The patient was initially thought to require tracheostomy, however, after improvement of her respiratory status she no longer needed a tracheostomy.
Bronchoscopy prior to extubation revealed a large plug that was removed from the left lobe which subsequently improved her breathing status.
Bacteremia - The patient was dosed by level, given her creatinine with Vancomycin.
Aspiration pneumonia - The patient had a history of Pseudomonas in her sputum.
Respiratory status - The patient was intubated post surgery, likely from pulmonary edema and aspiration pneumonia.
Atrial fibrillation - The patient was in normal sinus rhythm throughout her course in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Pump - Congestive heart failure, the patient had an ejection fraction of 20% per surface echocardiogram.
Cardiac monitoring with PA pressures showed a cardiac output of 6 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, likely due to elevated filling pressures.
The patient remained total body water overloaded likely with anasarca likely due to low albumin state, and the patient was subsequently diuresed to the point where she became a little more alkalotic and she required more fluid.
On the day of discharge she still continues to have 2+ edema peripherally likely due to hyperalbuminemic state.
Renal - The patient presented with acute and chronic renal failure.
Initial concern was gentamicin toxicity or acute interstitial nephritis due to Zosyn.
The Propofol for sedation was weaned off and the patient was subsequently taken off of beta blockade from a hypotension and increasing of creatinine.
Hydrocortisone was initially given at stress doses given her chronic Prednisone which was subsequently being tapered off for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - The patient was maintained on Flovent, metered dose inhaler, inhaled, and subsequently started on steroid taper.
Delta MS - The patient had laughing mania delirium prior to transfer and on arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit she was intubated and sedated.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan was obtained which showed no acute process and she was initially started on Haldol which was subsequently discontinued given her prolonged QTC syndrome in favor of uveitis.
Gastrointestinal bleed - On [**2-25**], the patient had a hematocrit drop with some gross melena, however, given her current medical condition, gastrointestinal workup was deferred until the patient was more medically stable.
She responded with 2 units of packed red cells without any further hematocrit drop.
Access - The patient initially had a right Swan from her operation on [**2-17**] that was subsequently discontinued, given a fever spike and replaced with a triple lumen catheter.
