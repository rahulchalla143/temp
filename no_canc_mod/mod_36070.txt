* CARDIAC: A. Cor: No chest pain throughout this admission.
Pt with a h/o CHF with an EF of 20%.
On admission, digoxin level supratherapeutic and patient found to be in ARF with a Cr of 5.2 likely due to dehydration/prerenal azotemia.

IVFs were started for his prerenal ARF and patient's Cr rapidly decreased over 3 days back to his baseline Cr of [**1-1**].2.
* C. Rhythm: Paced rhythm, with widened QRS likely due to hyperkalemia/acidosis on admission.

On the floor over the weekend prior to discharge, pt had an asymptomatic 40 beat of NSVT while ambulating with PT.
* RENAL FAILURE: No apparent etiology, but likely pre-renal due to poor PO hydration and increased BUN/Cr ratio.

Pt was evaluated by PT/OT who thought due to his unsteadiness as well as his primary responsibility of caring for his wife, who is currently in rehab herself, pt would benefit from rehab stay.
