Admission Date:  [**2178-6-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-6-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-6-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**6-21**]: Left craniotomy for SDH evacuation   History of Present Illness: 56yo man p/w headache for 1 month.
Does have some dizziness with standing.
Also noted some hearing loss with headaches.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
FINDINGS: Overlying the anterior left cerebral convexity is a collection of mixed attenuation material, consistent with subdural hematoma.
Heterogeneous attenuation likely represents a combination of relatively early and late subacute bleeding.
The lower attenuation material is not CSF density, suggesting the hematoma is not chronic.
The left lateral ventricle demonstrates mass effect.
There are no other foci of intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: Mixture of early and delayed subacute subdural hematoma overlying the left anterior convexity, resulting in 6 mm of rightward subfalcine herniation and midline shift, with sulcal effacement and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
FINDINGS: There is an acute/subacute subdural hematoma seen on the left extending from frontal to the occipital region.
The maximum width of the hematoma is seen in the frontal region measuring approximately 18 mm and it is measuring approximately 14 mm in the parietal region.
Additionally, low T2 signal collection is also seen which indicates acute hemorrhage.
There is mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere with obliteration of sulci.
Mild shift of the midline is seen to the right side with deformity of the left lateral ventricle.
There is no acute infarct seen.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Few scattered foci of hyperintensity in the white matter of nonspecific nature are seen which could indicate early changes of small vessel disease.
Note is made of increased signal in the right sigmoid sinus and proximal jugular vein on FLAIR and T2-weighted images.
Although this could be secondary to artifact it is unusual to have this much hyperintensity on T1-weighted images.
Left-sided acute/subacute subdural hematoma extending from frontal to the occipital region with maximum width of 1.8 cm.
Abnormal signal in the right sigmoid sinus and proximal jugular vein suspicious for thrombosis.
Mild changes of small vessel disease.
Mild midline shift to the right.
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Evolving mixed acute and chronic left subdural hematoma displays no significant interval change in size from prior exam.
The degree of mass effect on the adjacent sulci as well as subfalcine herniation measuring approximately 6-7 mm is also stable.
No new parenchymal abnormalities are identified.
Mass effect on the left occipital and temporal horns is stable.
Mild right sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening is noted with remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appearing unremarkable.
Small mucous retention cysts are also present within the right and left maxillary sinuses.
Post contrast administration, there is no thrombosis of the venous sinuses with appropriate filling of the sigmoid sinuses bilaterally.
Anterior circulation is unremarkable with no aneurysmal dilatation noted.
A somewhat prominent left cortical vein is noted, likely appearing more prominent, related to the adjacent subdural hematoma.
There is no flow-limiting stenoses involving the origins of the vertebral arteries or internal carotid arteries.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present.
Mild-to-moderate bilateral periodontal disease is noted.
The septum is noted to be rightward deviated with mild spur formation causing mass effect on the right inferior turbinate.
No significant interval change to acute on chronic evolving left subdural hematoma with stable rightward subfalcine herniation.
The abnormality seen on MRI was likely due to flow artifact.
Head CT [**2178-6-21**]: FINDINGS: There has been interval left frontal craniotomy, with evacuation of a left subdural hematoma.
There is a postoperative changes within the left subdural space, residual left subdural collection, consisting of air, and residual blood products, measuring approximately 13 mm in maximal dimensions.
Local mass effect on adjacent sulci, with mild sulcal effacement is unchanged.
There is a rightward subfalcine herniation of approximately 4 mm, which is improved from prior study (previously 7 mm).
No additional foci of hemorrhage are identified.
The caliber of the ventricular system is stable, without evidence of new hydrocephalus.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
Status post evacuation of the left subdural hematoma, with postoperative pneumocephalus, and residual blood products within the left subdural space, measuring approximately 13 mm in maximal dimensions.
Brief Hospital Course: 56M admitted to the Neurosurgery service after complaining of a history of recurrent headache and word finding difficutly.
Radiology [**Location (un) 1131**] at [**Hospital1 18**] had a question of sinus flow-signal [**Last Name (LF) 83486**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a CTA/V of the head and neck to rule out jugular thrombosis.
Overnight the patient hit his head on the side rail.
The following day he was ambulating on his own with no difficulty.
His wound looked clean, dry, and intact.
Neurologically he had no deficits and was deemed ready for discharge.
?Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
?Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
?Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
?You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
?New onset of tremors or seizures.
?Any confusion or change in mental status.
?Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
?Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
?Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-17**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your sutures and a wound check.
?You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
