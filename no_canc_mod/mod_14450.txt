ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname 17025**] is a 55 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on [**2130-4-12**].
She was subsequently discharged to Rehab in good condition, but several days prior to her presentation on [**2130-4-28**], she noticed a slight amount of drainage from the inferior aspect of her wound.
This became progressively foul-smelling and she presented for a wound check and was found clinically to have about a 3 cm x 10 cm lower sternal wound infection.
She had otherwise denied any sense of fever or chills.
She had not noticed any sort of crepitus or cracking in her chest.
Her exam was essentially remarkable for a 4 x 15 cm area of erythema with tenderness at the inferior aspect of her sternal wound with necrotic debris emanating from the incision.
There was otherwise no evidence of sternal instability.
She had a chest x-ray which showed that her sternal wires were still intact, but CT scan to further evaluate the wound showed a defect in the anterior soft tissue with inflammatory changes with gas in the region of the mediastinum.
There was no evidence of defect in the osseous structures.
Incidentally, on CT scan, a 22 x 17 mm right thyroid nodule was noted as was a 4 mm lung nodule at the right lung base and a 26 x 28 mm adrenal nodule, all of which require follow-up imaging in the future for further characterization.
The wound was sharply debrided down to healthy tissue with a significant amount of necrotic tissue removed and was treated initially with saline wet-to-dry dressing changes.
Plastic Surgery was consulted who recommended further debridement with dressing changes with future placement of VAC.
We changed over to acetic acid dressing changes for a short course with subsequent placement of a VAC on hospital day 4 as the wound looked good.
The patient remained afebrile throughout the remainder of her hospitalization with a normal white blood cell count.
She never evidenced any sort of sternal instability and follow-up chest x-rays did not show any change in location of her sternal wires or development of any new pleural effusions.
We consulted the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Service for aid and management of her diabetes with improved control with change in her morning and evening insulin regimen.
It was felt on hospital day 11 that the patient had been afebrile and was otherwise showing no infection of infection and had a nicely healing wound with the VAC that she be discharged to Rehab in fair condition.
Her wound had grown out coag-negative staphylococcus.
One of four blood culture bottles did also grow out coag-negative staphylococcus, but this was felt to be a contaminant and follow-up surveillance blood cultures were negative.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**8-6**] days for further outpatient workup of the incidental thyroid, lung and adrenal nodules found during workup of the wound infection.
