Blood Cx: [**1-13**], [**1-13**], [**1-16**], [**1-17**]: no growth Urine: [**1-13**], [**1-13**], [**1-15**]: no growth  Images: CXR: CONCLUSION: Overall, findings are suggestive of mild CHF with superimposed infection at the left lung base.
EKG: NSR at 77 bpm, nml axis, nml intervals, new anterior q-waves suggesting prior MI, isolate ST elevation in V2, TWF laterally.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Doppler evaluation limited due to patient body habitus.
The abnormal appearance of the right renal waveform could be due to suboptimal study quality, presence of stenosis not excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59 y/o M w/ Hep C, HTN, CKD, a/w HTN emergency and Acute on Chronic Renal Failure.
# Uremia/Acute Renal Failure: The patient had been having fatigue, fever, chills, dysuria with watery stools and decreased PO intake 2 weeks PTA.
He was bed bound by his symptoms and began to improve 5 days prior and went to his PCP on Tuesday.
A CXR showed LLL infiltrate with mild to moderate congestion.
The final pathology is still pending, but preliminary review showed extensive scar and immune complex deposition.
His PPD was negative and HepB serologies conisistent with previous infection.
# Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's SBP was initially in the 200's.
On [**1-19**] the patient was found to be orthostatic with a 20 point drop in his SBP with standing.
This was most likely secondary to aggressive volume removal at HD.
# Pulmonary/Asthma/OSA: The patient inially had a 2L O2 requirement and was weaned to room air after fluid removal at HD.
# Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of Hep C and was a non-responder to therapy.
# Q-Waves on EKG: His ECG finding were consistent with prior MI.
He had 3 negative CE and no complaints of chest pain.
# Elevated CK's: This was likely [**12-26**] to recent viral syndrome.
His CK were not elevated enough to be the primary etiology for renal failure.
