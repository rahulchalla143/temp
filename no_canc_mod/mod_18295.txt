Admission Date:  [**2158-12-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2158-12-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-12-1**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Sixty-eight year old male with history of lumbar degenerative joint disease and stenosis with chronic low back pain, which has been treated with steroid injections, last one on 10/089/03 presented to an outside hospital on [**2158-12-8**] with severe right lumbar back pain radiating to the right leg, similar to his usual pain, but more intense.
He was also noted to have a low grade temperature to 100 and white blood cell count of 23.7 with a left shift.
Initial lumbar spine MRI was read as degenerative joint disease and multiple disk herniations without nerve compressions.
Patient's low back pain and right leg pain were being treated with narcotics and Toradol.
Patient's course there was complicated by a colonic ileus which was decompresses a rectal tube and a colonoscopy on [**2158-12-11**].
Given the bacteremia, endocarditis workup was pursued with a transthoracic echocardiogram which was limited, but had no valvular abnormalities.
Patient continued to have increasing back pain requiring increased doses of narcotics, and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2158-12-12**].
Degenerative joint disease with lumbar stenosis.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol, tobacco, or drug use.
In general:  Appears in severe discomfort and pain.
Positive pain to palpation of left lower teeth.
No evidence of intraoral fluctuance.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at left lower sternal border.
Back:  Positive pain to palpation of right lumbar area.
Abdomen is soft, moderately distended, normoactive bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding.
Extremities:  No edema.
Skin:  No rashes.
Bilateral lower extremity sensation intact, 2+ patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally.
Extensive degenerative disk disease.
MRI of lumbar spine without contrast on [**2158-12-8**] compared to [**2158-9-12**]:  Diffuse hyperintensity of L1-L2 disks consistent with diskitis, no bony destruction, no evidence of soft tissue mass or abscess.
Transthoracic echocardiogram:  Technically limited, ejection fraction 50%, no valvular abnormalities noted.
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, diffuse T-wave flattening, no ST changes.
Left renal cyst.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted on the night of [**2158-12-12**] and was noted to be in severe pain and his neurologic examination was limited by this.
The MRI showed a large epidural abscess at T10-L1, and patient was taking emergently to the operating room on night of [**2158-12-13**], and started on steroids as there was evidence of spinal cord compression.
While there, he had a transesophageal echocardiogram done, which was complicated by methemoglobinemia secondary to the Hurricaine spray local anesthetic.
Epidural abscess:  The patient was noted to have a large epidural abscess on contrast MRI on [**2158-12-13**] and was taken emergently to the OR that night.
The cultures from the epidural abscess grew out alpha Strep and the identification and sensitivities were pending at the time of discharge.
The patient's back pain was well controlled at the time of discharge on p.o.
Was decompressed with rectal tube and colonoscopy at the outside hospital prior to transfer, however, the patient continued to have constipation.
Strep mitis bacteremia:  The source of the Strep mitis bacteremia was thought to be from a loose/infected dental implant.
An OMFS consult was obtained and there was no evidence of abscess requiring drainage around the implant, however, the implant should be removed on an outpatient basis within the next couple of weeks.
The transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained while the patient was in the Medical ICU, which showed no evidence of any vegetations or significant valvular lesions, however, it was believed that the patient did at one time have endocarditis, and the antibiotic therapy was tailored with this assumption.
Patient remained afebrile x5 days at the time of discharge.
It was determined that the patient will need to have a Foley for the short term as patient has continued urinary retention secondary to spinal cord compression/narcotic induce.
Patient is also placed on scheduled Tylenol and Valium prn for muscle spasm.
His beta blocker was held for several doses due to bradycardia, and should be continued to be held if the heart rate is less than 55.
Spinal cord compression.
Streptococcus mitis bacteremia.
Infected dental implant.
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
History of lumbar stenosis/degenerative joint disease.
PROCEDURES:  T10-L1 laminectomy with decompression of epidural abscess.
prn for muscle spasm.
Patient should be arranged as an outpatient to have his dental implant removed within 2-3 weeks.
