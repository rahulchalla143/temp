CT scan showed evidence of bowel ischemia and known SMA occlusion and celiac axis stenosis.
She was afebrile with a normal WBC butdid have a left shift with 93 neutrophils.
General surgery was consulted and they do feel that she has signs of ischemia on exam but do not feel that she has frank peritonitis.
Ultrasound-guided puncture of the left brachial artery.
Abdominal aortogram.
However, after 5 minutes, the hand appeared to be somewhat mottled and there was no longer a pulse of the brachial artery or the radial and ulnar arteries.
The pt then underwent a thrombectomy and repair of the left brachial artery where 2-3 cm of fresh thrombus was removed from the artery proximally.
She was a bit hypotensive and received a fluid bolus and a one time does of ephedrine sulfate as well.
She was monitored closely and her pain was controlled with mulitple medications.
It was felt that there was no further surgical intervention that could be done for Ms. [**Known lastname 93440**] and that her mulitple illnesses complicated by this acute problem gave her a high mortality rate.
Later that night she was placed on an epinephrine gtt for hypotension and low cardiac index.
On [**4-27**] Ms. [**Known lastname 93440**] seemed to be in a bit more distress, having increased pain and anxiety/ aggitation.
A plan for hospice care was initiated and the pt was made comfort measures only (CMO) and placed on a regimen of oral morphine, zyprexa, and ativan for pain and anxiety control.
