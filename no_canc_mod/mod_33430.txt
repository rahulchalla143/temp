Admission Date:  [**2195-4-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-4-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine-Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal aortic aneurysm Pericardial tamponade  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm on [**2195-4-14**].
History of Present Illness: This is an 85 year old gentleman with a recently diagnosed very large abdominal aortic aneurysm.
In [**2179**], he apparently had a cardiac arrest.
A year ago, he had evidence of pericardial effusion that required a pericardiocentesis at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital.
Son [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 86148**]) is HCP and closest relative.
Family History: No family history of premature coronary disease or sudden death.
No carotid bruits.
Palpation of the heart reveals normally placed PMI, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No murmurs/rubs/or gallops.
Distant heart sounds.
No HSM or tenderness.
No pain in bilateral femoral area.
No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in MCG/ML  _________________________________________________________                              VIRIDANS STREPTOCOCCI                              | VANCOMYCIN------------   <=1 S     Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2195-4-18**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CHAINS.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
There is also inconsistent very brief right ventricular diastolic collapse.
Compared with the images of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-4-2**], the size of the pericardial effusion has increased and there are echo signs for early tamponade (however, estimated right atrial pressure is low, which indicate low circulatory volume.
Repeat echo ([**4-16**]): There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-4-16**], large pericardial effusion is no longer present.
CXR ([**4-16**]):  IMPRESSION: Interval extubation without complication.
Brief Hospital Course: Four days before AAA repair, Mr. [**Known lastname 19837**] had a thallium stress test at [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital which found no evidence of ischemia or infarct and borderline left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 50%.
He was aymptomatic at admission on [**2195-4-14**] and underwent AAA repair the same day, which was complicated by an episode of hypotension/bradycardia responsive to requiring some atropine and neosynephrine, IV fluids, and two units of PRBCs.
On [**4-16**], patient developed shortness of breath, BNP 784, diuresed with IV lasix with some improvement; required 2L O2.
Echo was obtained and showed worsening pericardial effusion from [**4-2**] with possible tamponade physiology.
Cardiac enzymes were also cycled for vomiting.
Known to have pericardial effusion preoperatively.
Echo was obtained and showed worsening pericardial effusion from [**4-2**] with possible tamponade physiology.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended percardiocentesis and deferral of further diuresis.Cardiology was consulted and recommended percardiocentesis and deferral of further diuresis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 19837**] was given gentle IVF to limit tamponade physiology and taken for pericardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement.
During the procedure, he breifly became hypotensive and bradycardic, responsive to 500 cc bolus; thought to be vagal episode at sheath insertion.
Mr. [**Known lastname 19837**] arrived at the CCU with no complaints.
No chest pain.
No PND, orthopnea.
Reports that at baseline, he can walk around his 2 acre property that is limited primary due to pain in his legs attributed to his PVD.
He also has noted some proximal weakness in his lower extremities over the past few months.
while in the CCU, psychiatry consulted and found patient to lack capacity due to poor insight/judgement.
On the floor, the pericardia fluid culture returned with Strep viridans sensitive to vancomycin.
However, he showed no signs of systemic infection (afebrile to 98.1, hemodynamically stable, low-normal WBCs, clinically looked well, and denied any pain or other complaints).

Elevate your leg above the level of your heart (use [**1-7**] pillows or a recliner) every 2-3 hours throughout the day and at night ??????
Avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting without your legs elevated It is normal to feel tired and have a decreased appetite, your appetite will return with time ??????
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing or band aid over the area that is draining, as needed ??????
Numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions ??????
Bleeding from groin puncture site  SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site or incision) ??????
