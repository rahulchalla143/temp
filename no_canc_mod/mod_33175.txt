FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is marked improvement.
The pre-existing right pleural effusion has completely resolved.
The left pleural effusion has minimally decreased in extent, leading to improved ventilation of the left basal lung.
DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4130**]  [**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT Indication: Intraoperative TEE for CABG, ?
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Severely depressed LVEF.
No LV mass/thrombus.
Focal apical hypokinesis of RV free wall.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Focal calcifications in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Conclusions: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with essentially anterior, septal, and anterolateral akinesis and moderate to severe hypokinesis of all remaining segments.
The mid anterior wall and basal inferioseptal wall are mildly dyskinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The right ventricle displays continued severe apical hypokinesis with normal basal and mid free wall systolic function.
The left ventricle shows slightly improved overall function but continued regional abnormalities as described above.
The mitral regurgitation is improved and is now mild.
In summary had coronary artery bypass graftin x3 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and  reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and the obtuse marginal artery.
Post-operative course was complicated by severe bleeding requiring mediastinal re-exploration.
Following re-exploration the patient extubated but was reintubated for respiratory distress on POD3.
The post-operative course was further complicated by delerium and failed bedside swallow evaluation requiring placement of temporary feeding tube.
He continued to make slow progress with activity.
