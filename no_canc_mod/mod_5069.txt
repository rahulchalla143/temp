She initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern for left AV fistula bleeding, which was recently redone and starting to be used last week.
Since then, it has been bleeding after hemodialysis which she first noticed at home, so came in for evaluation.
Her initial HCT was 34, and she was admitted for concern for GI bleeding.
ICU admission was requested for closer monitoring in the setting of possible GI bleeding.

She had some nausea on Monday with mucoid vomiting but no blood.
She complains of some weakness of both legs, which is equal and at her baseline.

No acute pulmonary process  Colonoscopy: Findings:  Mucosa: Localized ulceration with stigmata of recent bleeding was noted in the rectum.
These findings are compatible with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.
Excavated Lesions A few diverticula with small openings were seen in the sigmoid colon.Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity.
Impression: Ulceration in the rectum compatible with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum   Brief Hospital Course: # Hypotension, concern for GI bleed - Blood pressure appeared to be at her baseline per ED records and according to her is similar to her baseline.
The colonoscopy showed a small rectal ulcer.
# ESRD: The patient received hemodialysis on [**4-30**] with no complications via the catheter.
Renal was consulted and recommended a fistulogram, which could not be performed during hospitalization, so she should have this arranged as an outpatient and receive dialysis through the catheter until then.
# Wheezing, bicarb of 37: The patient could potentially have underlying lung disease.
This could be from pulmonary amylod or asthma, and should be followed as an outpatient.
# elevated alk phos/LFT's - her alk phos and AST were noted to be elevated on admission, with slightly elevated GGT.
She should get  # Thrombocytopenia: Her recent baseline is 80 which were constant in the hospital.
An EKG showed no changes and the patient remained at sinus.
An episode of A fib was noted during hospitalization without increased rate.
# h/o amyloidosis with CHF: her fluid status was carefully monitored.
