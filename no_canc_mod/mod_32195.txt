Admission Date:  [**2118-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-6-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-1-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21193**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 20 yo Portuguese speaking female with PMH of migraines who presented to [**Hospital 17065**] Hospital on [**2118-6-1**] with altered mentalstatus.
Started with a transient episode of distorted facial features and inability to speak.
Went to ED on [**5-25**] complaining of dizziness, headache and nausea and was treated for migraine with zofran, and apparently responded.
There were no meningeal signs on either of these visits, and she had a normal physical exam.
[**6-1**] presented with MS changes after having a period of face twitching which lasted minutes.
There was no involvement of arms or legs per cousin.
CT at that time showed a tiny focus of low attenuation in the right frontal lobe in the subcortical area.

Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 20 year old woman with encephalitis, seizure and right frontal hypodensity REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: right frontal hypodensity?
On the axial FLAIR sequence, there is increased signal noted in the cerebral sulci, diffusely, as well as in the basal cisterns with some enhancement on the post-contrast images, in addition to the enhancement of the venous structures within the sulci.
This is concerning for leptomeningeal inflammation or infection.
However, no focal intraparenchymal lesions are noted.
There are no areas of restricted diffusion in the brain parenchyma.
Diffuse increase in the FLAIR signal intensity in the cerebral sulci, and basal cisterns, with some enhancement on the post-contrast images (in addition to the enhancement of the venous structures), can represent leptomeningeal inflammation or infection.
No obvious intraparenchymal lesions or areas of restricted diffusion, noted on the present study.
EEG: [**2118-6-11**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background admixed with bursts of generalized mixed  frequency slowing.
This constellation of findings is consistent with a mild encephalopathy and suggests dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings.
There were no clearly epileptiform features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.
This pathology is partly consolidated and partly has micro and macronodular components.
The micronodular components show multiple air bronchograms and one of these micronodular lesions might show early signs of cavitation.
In the peribronchial areas, confluenting micronodules create the appearance of subtle ground-glass opacities.
The lesions reach out to the pleural surfaces, as a consequence, the major fissure is slightly thickened.
No similar lesions are seen in the remaining lung.
The remaining lung displays a slightly elevated general attenuation which might partly be due to an insufficient inspiratory effort.
There is no evidence of pleural effusions.
There are scars paraaortic lymph nodes of borderline size, no other mediastinal lymph nodes are seen, notably in paratracheal location.
There are no enlarged lymph nodes amenable to biopsy.
IMPRESSION: Micro and macronodular consolidations in the left upper lobe, with local bronchiectasis, air bronchograms and early signs of cavitation.
Overall, these findings are strongly suggestive of tuberculosis.
There is no evidence of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes in the paratracheal location that might be amenable to transtracheal biopsy.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-6-9**] 9:09 AM  FINDINGS: There is interval new, moderate ventriculomegaly, involving all the ventricles, with few areas of periventricular hypodensities, most prominent around the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] (series 3, image 9).
This appearance, given the history of tuberculous meningitis, can relate to communicating (extraventricular obstructive) hydrocephalus, the periventricular hypodensities, being due to seepage of the CSF vs. involvement of the adjacent parenchyma itself.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage or shift of midline structures.
There is mild mass effect on the anterior part of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], by the periventricular hypodensity (series 3, image 9).
No osseous lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.
Moderate ventriculomegaly, involving all the ventricles, with the given history of tuberculous meningitis, can relate to communicating or extraventricular obstructive hydrocephalus.
Small area of periventricular hypodensity, around the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], with mild mass effect on the anterior aspect of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], can relate to focal parenchymal hypodensity or the seepage of the CSF fluid.
If parenchymal abnormalities are to be excluded, MR of the head can be considered, if necessary.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-6-11**] and [**2118-6-14**] showed no interval changes when compared to the study on [**2118-6-9**].
CT HEAD- [**2118-6-22**]- In comparison with the prior study, there is evidence of mild improvement in the ventricular size, with less effacement of the sulci as described in detail above.
([**2118-6-8**]) Bronchoaveolar Lavage - Smear positive for acid fast bacilli.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1794**] is a 20 year old woman from [**Country 4194**] who was here in [**Location (un) 86**] studying English and presented with subacute onset of headache and later neck pain, transferred to the neurology service at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 15286**] following CSF profile revealed protein of 237, glucose 14, 100 nucleated cells, 1 of which was a PMN, in the setting of mental status changes.
1) TB meningitis- The pt had a positive PPD from the outside hospital and was placed on TB precautions in a negative pressure room and admitted to the neurology service.
Left upper lobe infiltrate on CXR was further evaluated by chest CT, then BAL returned AFB positive smear and positive for TB with amplified MTD test.
There were no malignant cells notable on cytology of her CSF ruling out the two other predominent mechanisms that could potentially produce her CSF profile in the clinical setting of chronic meningitis.
2) Neurologic sequelae- The patient c/o headache and was visibly somnolent during her initial hospital course.
On [**6-6**] pt was noted to have a LMN bladder with 1000cc of retained urine, leg weakness/flaccidity, and anisorcoria due to CN II involvement.
A head CT on [**2118-6-9**] [**Date Range 3780**] global ventriculomegaly with a questionable focus of hypointensity in the left temporal lobe that could represent ependymal CSF flow vs parenchymal disease; later repeat head CT revealed resolution of this abnormality.
Neurosurgery was consulted in the setting of communicating hydrocephalus and felt that the pt did not need to be shunted, but rather should undergo medical therapy Diamox and Lasix.
Due to progression of her headache and somnolence, the patient was transfered to the MICU from [**6-10**] to [**6-15**].
Routine LFTs and pancreatic enzymes showed a transient elevation of amylase and lipase to the low 100s.
During her course, she would intermittently complain of diffuse abdominal pain without peritoneal signs and did not affect her excellent appetite.
4) Bladder distention- The patient has a lower motor neuron bladder resulting from spinal arachnoiditis.
5) [**Name (NI) 78678**] Pt was seen by the opthalmology service and noted to have papilledema as previously described.
Her anisocoria is likely secondayr to arachnoiditis affecting CN III as it follows CN II.
She will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital 78679**] clinic as an outpatient for follow up in the next 2-3 weeks for repeat color vision testing, visual fields and full ophthalmologic exam while on antiTB treatment.
Spinal arachnoiditis Urinary Retention secondary to atonic lower motor neuron bladder   Discharge Condition: Left pupil 7mm-->6mm, R pupil 6mm-->5mm, Persistent lower motor neuron bladder (distention).
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for headaches and neck pain and found to TB meningitis.
Call your doctor or 911 immediately with any symptoms of nausea, vomiting, worsening abdominal pain, yellowing of your skin or eyes, or any other concerns.
These can be a sign of liver problems that can result from your TB medicine and should be addressed by a doctor immediately should they occur.
You will have weakness and bladder problems as a result of swelling of the coverings of your brain and spinal cord.
Call your doctor or 911 for any change in your wakefullness, worsening headaches, difficulty with your vision, worsening weakness, bowel incontinence, new fevers, seizures, skin rashes, vomiting, worsening abdominal pain or any other concerning symptoms.
