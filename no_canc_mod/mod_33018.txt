Overlying tubing is seen projecting over the upper mediastinum and upper lung.
Pulmonary vascularity is normal, with no pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2180-2-25**]: FINDINGS:  The thoracic aortic caliber is normal, without dissection.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 8 mm in short axis in the subcarinal region do not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
There is mild apical predominant peripheral opacity which has geographic margins in some areas and a more nodular appearance in others.
Peripheral upper lobe predominant linear density is greatest on the left and compatible with atelectasis.
There is no evidence of fibrosis or lobar consolidation.
Limited images of the upper abdominal viscera are significant for homogeneous decreased attenuation of the liver which is compatible with fatty infiltration.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are no suspiciously lesions.
Degenerative disc disease in the lower thoracic spine is mild-to-moderate.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Mild peripheral, apical predominent ground glass and linear opacity.
Differential considerations would include tobacco- related interstitial lung disease, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Pulmonary hemorrhage or an infectious process such as atypical mycoplasma or viral pneumonia would be considered less likely.
This distribution is not suggestive of pulmonary edema.

#Shortness of Breath: She was admitted to MICU and was treated for asthma exacerbation with steroid, azithromycin, and nebs.

# Hyperlipidemia:continued crestor .
# HTN:continued verapamil and benicar .
