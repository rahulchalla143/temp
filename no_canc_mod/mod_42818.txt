HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease status post three coronary artery bypass graft surgeries (the last of which was in [**2153**]) and peptic ulcer disease status post a Billroth I surgery approximately 50 years ago who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department with a gastrointestinal bleed.
He states that he was in his usual state of health until six hours prior to admission at which time he began experiencing black tarry stools that occurred a total of four times.
He states he has had intermittent chest pain, dyspnea and finger paresthesias.
At the time of transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was without complaints.
Severe coronary artery disease status post three coronary artery bypass graft surgeries the last of which was in [**2153**].
Peptic ulcer disease status post Billroth I in approximately [**2106**].
This is a pleasant man in no acute distress.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, and there are normoactive bowel sounds.
He has 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and there is no peripheral edema.
Initial chest radiograph demonstrated no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
Initial electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per minute, normal axis, increased PR interval consistent with first degree AV block, inferior Q waves, lateral Q waves and inferolateral T wave inversions.
There was no old electrocardiogram available for comparison.
Each procedure demonstrated slow oozing of blood from the prior anastomotic site of the patient's remote Billroth 2 surgical procedure.
Throughout the course of his hospitalization the patient was transfused 7 units of packed red blood cells and one unit of platelets for his falling hematocrit.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient had several episodes of chest pain throughout the beginnings of this hospitalization.
In addition, the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes on multiple occasions.
Although his Propanolol was initially held around the time of his acute gastrointestinal bleeding on admission this medication was subsequently restarted and titrated to both heart rate and blood pressure.
As noted above his antiplatelet agents including aspirin and Clopidogrel were held throughout his hospitalization due to his ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician and [**Name9 (PRE) 100396**] regarding ongoing management of his coronary artery disease.
Given that he has already received at least coronary artery bypass grafts, however, the patient is likely not a candidate for repeat cardiac intervention, but will likely be medically managed indefinitely.
He is tolerating a full diet and ambulating without assistance.
Bleeding peptic ulcer.
Acute blood loss anemia.
Native vessel coronary artery disease.
Low back pain.
Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg prn chest pain.
The patient was advised to return to the Emergency Department in the event of shortness of breath, lightheadedness, chest pain, or recurrent blood in the stool.
