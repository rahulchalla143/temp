[**11-19**] R foot XR: interval resection of the distal second and third rays when compared with [**2191-11-19**].
Soft tissue swelling about the forefoot persists.
A mass is seen in the right atrium.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or significant regurgitation seen.
However, there is an echodense linear structure that stretches across the right atrium from the inter-atrial septum to the lateral atrial wall.
There does not appear to be a vegetation associated with it but image quality is sub-optimal so a vegetation cannot be excluded.
Mildly dilated right ventricle.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Recommend two-month followup for 2.6 cm right upper lobe nodule which may represent infectious or neoplastic focus.
Recommend renal ultrasound for further evaluation of possible right hydronephrosis versus prominent extrarenal pelvis.
Diffuse edema involves the subcutaneous tissues, chest wall and muscles, more pronounced on the left may represent anasarca, however, recommend clinical correlation to exclude myositis.
Recommend thyroid ultrasound for further evaluation of a right thyroid lesion.
Moderate bilateral effusions.
[**11-22**] CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions and right upper lobe lung mass unchanged over two days.
[**11-22**] renal U/S: IMPRESSION: Severe right hydronephrosis with several freely mobile calculi noted within the renal pelvis.
Atrophic right kidney with moderate right-sided hydronephrosis secondary to chronic UPJ obstruction.
Bilateral renal calculi.
Dense atherosclerotic plaque involving the aorta and branch vessels.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Bilateral pleural effusion, generalized body wall anasarca and edematous mesentery, which can be seen in hypoalbuminemia.
Tiny punctate calcifications in the head of the pancreas, which may represent parenchymal calcification or small stones in a side branch duct.
No pancreatic ductal dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: [**11-18**]: admitted to MICU from ED, started on insulin gtt for hyperglycemia to 555, vanco/zosyn, hypovolemic ARF (Cr peak at 1.2), DKA.
She was afebrile with a white count to 32K.
Right foot film showed marked osseous destruction about the second priximal phalanx and interphalangeal joint with marked overlying soft tissue swelling.
Podiatry was consulted for her right foot osteomyelitis and too her to the OR for radical debridement of right foot with open ray amputation 2 and 3; incision and drainage plantar abscess right foot.
OSH blood cx grew out Strep agalactiae  [**11-19**]: continued abx, trending WBC (22K) and fever curve (afebrile), glucose control; Cr trended down; urine cx showed pan-sensitive e coli.
[**11-20**]: transferred to the floor; PICC line placed; TTE showed no valvular vegeations or significant regurgitation; echodense linear structure that stretches across the right atrium from the inter-atrial septum to the lateral atrial wall, likely a muscular band.
CTA showed a 2.6cm RUL nodule - recommend 2 month f/u; right hydronephrosis - recommend f/u; thyroid nodule - recomment f/u.
R renal U/S: Severe right hydronephrosis with several freely mobile calculi noted within the renal pelvis.
[**11-26**]: patient received 3U pRBC for acute blood loss anemia; bandages were redressed; Hct stabilized.
Her pain is well-controlled on oral agents, she is tolerating a regular diet.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: DKA ARF (hypovolemic) osteomyelitis Thyroid Nodule - will need follow up Lung Nodule - will need follow up Right Hydronephrosis - will need follow up   Discharge Condition: good, stable condition   Discharge Instructions: If you develop fevers, chills, foul-smelling or purulunt drainage from your wound, new spreading redness or pain from your wound, shortess of breath, chest pain, or any other disturbing symtoms, please call the vascular surgery office of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1393**] or go to the emergency room.
