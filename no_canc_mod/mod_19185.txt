Admission Date:  [**2185-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-12-20**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pulmonary artery catheter placement   History of Present Illness: 81 yo M with CAD s/p MI x3 (last '[**76**]) and PTCA w/stent x2 to RCA and LCx(@ [**Hospital1 112**], [**11-5**]), systolic heart failure EF ~20% (by cath report; 35% by echo [**10-5**]) and IDDM, p/w SOB.
Pt reports that he has been having periodic episodes of dyspnea since [**August 2185**], requiring x3 prior admits to [**Hospital1 112**].
He was last admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] [**Date range (1) 55744**], where he was treated for hyperkalemia in the setting of ARF with K 5.4 and Cr 4.1 (baseline 1.9-2.0).
He also c/o SOB at that time, but CXR showed no evidence of failure and he was d/c'ed home after his potassium had come down.
In the field, EMS found him to be hypotensive w/BP in 80s and hypoxic with O2sats 84%.
He denies any recent LE swelling, any non-compliance with med regimen, and any change in dietary habits (follows low Na diet).
-ischemic CM, as above -chronic renal insufficiency -GERD  Social History: Pt is originally from [**Country 3594**].

Dobutamine 10 mcg/kg/min was started in the catheterization laboratory with systolic augmentation of the aortic pressure.
Cardiogenic shock.
Severely elevated left and right heart filling pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M with DM2, CRI, CAD s/p MIx3, ischemic CM, EF ~20%, with x5 months SOB not relieved by cath/PTCA, whose primary complaint is waking up extremely short of breath multiple times at night for the past few days.
1) Heart Failure: Pt's hypotension (most-likely explaining his acute weakness and LH this am) and hypoxia on presentation [**1-4**] decompensated failure as evidenced by CXR and exam.
Acute myocardial infarction was ruled out by EKG and negative enzymes.
He was found to have a urinary tract infection which could possibly be the cause of the acute decompensation of his heart failure.
His carvedilol and Captopril were discontinued during hospitalization in the setting of hypotension and acute renal failure during hospitalization.
During this hospitalization he was first diuresed and improved symptomatically briefly but then began to decompensate with development of acute pre-renal failure, hypotension, and multiple episodes of awakening at night acutely short of breath.
During this time he continued to deteriorate and further diuresis was attempted with natrecor without response.
While in the CCU he was monitored closely and it was found that he was having up to 5 episodes of [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing perhour, often times with ventricular ectopy and on few occasions with desaturation,.
During this time he also had acutely worsening renal failure, elevation of liver enzymes, and demonstrated change in mental status.
A pulmonary artery catheter was place with elevated PCWP and elevated right sided pressures and a mixed venous 02 saturation of 24%.
He was started on Dobutamine and within 24 hours his mental status improved, and the [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing episodes decreased in frequency as the cardiac index increased.
2) Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia: Episodes occurred in setting of apnea and also while on Dobutamine.
3) DM2: Glyburide and Lantus discontinued during episode of ARF but restarted on return to baseline creatinine.
4) Acute Renal Failure on CRI: Per [**Hospital1 112**] records, baseline Cr around 2.0.
During worsening heart failure prior to CCU and Dobutamine initiation acute renal failure developed likely secondary to poor perfusion.
5) [**Name (NI) 12007**] pt was treated for complicated UTI with a course of Bactrim.
