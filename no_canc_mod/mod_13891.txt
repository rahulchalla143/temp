They treated her hyperkalemia with Insulin/glucose, bicarbonate, and kayexelate.
CT Head showed no bleed.
Her TLC had oozing around the sutures site and a pressure dressing was placed.
On review of systems, the patient's son reports that she has increased facial swelling and leg edema over the last several days.
+increased breathing x 1 day.
In addition, she has been having episodes of muffled speech x 1 month, increasing in frequency.
Past Medical History: *chronic kidney disease Stage IV-V, not on HD [s/p RUE fistula placement [**8-14**]; Nephrologist [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59393**] @ [**Hospital1 4494**]] *coronary artery disease *hypertension *GERD *Pulmonary fibrosis *rheumatoid arthritis: on MTX and prednisone *h/o PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 11091**] [**2127**] *hypothroidism *depression and anxiety *breast cancer s/p L mastectomy *osteoarthritis *s/p bilateral total knee replacements *chronic pain syndrome *macular degeneration   Social History: Lives at [**Hospital6 **] home.
Moaning in pain with any movement.
No masses or organomegaly.
MS:  dressing over skin tear on left forearm; winces with pain with movement of legs, arms b/l.
No focal point tenderness.
No cyanosis, no clubbing, trace pedal edema with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
PERRL, follows commands but unable to maintain focus for conversation, closes eyes while talking and starts mumbling.
CT Head: No hemorrhage.
No focal consolidation detected or evidence of pulmonary edema.
Right humeral head deformity.
Clips in left axilla suggesting nodal dissection.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

# Altered Mental Status: Multifactorial etiology, including uremia, severe metabolic acidosis, hypovolemia and UTI.
Resolved during ICU course as underlying causes were addressed: acidosis was corrected with bicarbonate infusion, volume repleted, diuretics held, UTI treated.
Head CT that was negative for bleed or hydrocephalus.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  presented at Cr 4.2, per outside nephrologist and renal team here, Cr at baseline is 2.5-3.0.
Acute worsening was most likely due to volume depletion in the setting of high doses of diuretics and UTI.
In ICU, treated acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hypovolemia as discussed, held diuretics.
Patient has AV fistula as she may require dialysis in the future, though unclear if mature yet.
Pt should have electrolytes and creatinine checked at least every three days and hold diuretics if any increase in creatinine.
# s/p fall: Most likely secondary to volume depletion/orthostasis but also possible that worsening mental status contributed.
Pt had drop in Hct shortly after admission, received rbc transfusion, no source of bleeding found, stool guaiac negative.
# HTN: continued antihypertensives but held diuretics until [**3-17**]; see above  # Rheumatoid Arthritis: continued home meds, including low dose prednisone  # Depression and Anxiety: continued paxil, trazodone, clonazepam PRN  # Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine, TSH WNL  # GERD: continued PPI  # FEN: renal, cardiac diet  # PPx: heparin SubQ  # FULL CODE but would not want sustained intubation  # Communication: regularly with son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 30207**] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 59394**]  # Physical therapy: Physical therapists saw patient  required max assist to get out of bed to chair.

Discharge Instructions: You were originally admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with altered mental status attributed to acute renal failure, severe acidosis, dehydration, and urinary tract infection.
In addition, you had traumatic ulcerations of your left arm and right leg after you fell in your nursing home.
Your mental status and renal function returned to baseline, and you were maintained on antibiotics for your urinary tract infection.
