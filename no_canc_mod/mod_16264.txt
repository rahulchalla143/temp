History of Present Illness: 72 year old male that started to experience chest pain with mild activity which usually resolved with 1 SL NTG.
More recently he has been woken up with chest pain at night, which resolves with position changes.
He denies any shortness of breath, but does complain of occasional lightheadnedness.
He had an abnormal stress test on [**2184-9-28**] and presented for cardiac catherization which revealed coronary artery disease and intra aortic balloon pump was placed.

H/O cardiac surgery.
Mitral valve disease.
Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor native endocardial border definition.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate (2+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to position.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion appear normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) aortic regurgitation is suggested.
On post contrast images, an eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is suggested but not confirmed due to poor image quality.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
During catheterization, he had intractable anginal pain, so he underwent placement of Intra-aortic Balloon Pump placement with resolution of chest pain.
On [**10-4**] he was brought to the operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery x4: Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and saphenous vein sequential grafting to obtuse marginal and the left posterior descending artery, and saphenous vein graft to diagonal artery.
In the first twenty four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated without complications.
