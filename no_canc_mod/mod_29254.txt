Admission Date:  [**2126-6-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-6-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-7-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Known firstname 2534**] Chief Complaint: s/p 2nd story fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 26 yo male s/p fall from 2nd story after consuming alcohol and taking a a drug that was purchased from the internet.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ongoing trauma care.
FINDINGS: High-density material is seen tracking along the anterior and posterior falx, and along the right tentorium consistent with subdural hematoma.
There is also evidence of high-density material within the sulci in the frontal region, and particularly in the interhemispheric fissure, consistent with subarachnoid blood.
There is increased density in and about the inferior frontal lobes, likely indicating contusion as well as extraaxial blood.
An 8- mm rounded focus of hyperintensity is also seen in the right frontal lobe, which represents a contusion.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Scalp hematoma is noted in the left occipital region.
IMPRESSION: Subdural hematoma along the falx.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the frontal region.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 5-mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain and bone window on the workstation.
Again demonstrated is the relatively thin, but extensive, subdural blood layering along both the anterior and posterior [**Last Name (un) 44708**] and over the right tentorium cerebelli, with slight mass effect on the subjacent convexity with minimal, if any, shift of the midline structures.
There is patchy hemorrhage with adjacent edema involving the bifrontal gyri recti, which may be in continuity with hemorrhage in the region of the interhemispheric fissure, some of which may lie in the subarachnoid space.
The parenchymal component of this process appears more evident, with a larger surrounding zone of edema in both paramedian frontal poles, with the process now measuring roughly 2.6 cm in diameter; however, no distinct new hemorrhage is identified.
There is no evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and other than slight compression of the right lateral ventricular frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], unchanged, no change in ventricular size or configuration to suggest development of obstructive hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of uncal or downward transtentorial herniation.
Again demonstrated is a left parietal vertex scalp hematoma with associated metallic densities, some of which may represent clips.
Again noted is a left maxillary fluid level with pansinus, moderate mucosal thickening suggesting underlying inflammatory sinus disease (see separate report of CT sinus/maxillofacial bones).
Stable subdural hematoma tracking along the anterior and posterior [**Last Name (un) 44708**] and above the right tentorium, with minimal mass effect and no significant shift of the midline structures.
Further evolution of extensive bifrontal contusions with subarachnoid hemorrhage, particularly in the interhemispheric fissure.
No new parenchymal or ventricular hemorrhage, and no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.
MR CERVICAL SPINE  [**2126-6-6**] 12:42 AM  MR CERVICAL SPINE  Reason: s/p trauma (fall) now with upper extrem parasthesias - need  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 26 year old man with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: s/p trauma (fall) now with upper extrem parasthesias - need this TONIGHT please INDICATION: 26-year-old with fall and upper extremity paresthesia.
FINDINGS: The images are slightly degraded from phase-encode artifact which precludes complete assessment of the cord.
Normal vertebral body and disc signal intensity is seen.
At the C3-4 level, there is mild disc protrusion with mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.
At the C4-5 level, there is a minor disc osteophyte complex with resultant mild narrowing of the right and left neural foramina.
At C5-6, there is a more prominent disc osteophyte complex on the right resulting in moderate spinal stenosis and moderate narrowing of the right neural foramen.
No increased STIR or T2 signal intensity is seen in the cord.
Prevertebral soft tissue signal intensity is normal.
There may be a tiny thyroid nodule seen within the right lobe of the thyroid.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes seen in the cervical spine as described above.
Findings are most prominent at C5-6 where there is a moderate right-sided disc osteophyte complex resulting in moderate spinal stenosis and moderate narrowing of the right neural foramen.
No cord compression.
TECHNIQUE: Helical 1.25 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained through the paranasal sinuses and facial bones, coronal reformations were prepared, and all images are viewed in bone and soft tissue window on the workstation.
As on that examination, there is moderate mucosal thickening involving all paranasal sinuses, with probable small mucous retention cyst in the floor of the left maxillary antrum, connoting chronic inflammatory disease.
This may explain the left maxillary fluid level, with no significant high density material to specifically suggest acute hemorrhage.
The sinus, particularly left maxillary, walls are intact, with no acute fracture.
The middle ear cavities and largely completely included mastoid air cells are clear.
No evidence of acute fracture.
Pansinus chronic inflammatory changes with small left maxillary fluid level suggestive of an acute component.
Neurosurgery was consulted because of his subdural bleed and spine fractures; his treatment was non operative.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: [**12-17**]  PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Return to the emergency room if you develop fever/chills; severe headaches, abdominal pain/discomfort; nausea, vomiting and/or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
Inform the office that you were seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**], Neurosurgery and that you will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
