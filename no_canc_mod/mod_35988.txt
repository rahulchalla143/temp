Failed cardioversion x 2 on last admission and Amiodarone loaded at time of discharge.
Pt reports that she was in slow afib for 17days after discharge and self-converted on Friday [**9-4**].
2 days later, she started to feel like she had "pneumonia without fever or cough" a/w DOE, [**Location (un) **], wt gain.
She has been on oral [**Location (un) 621**] for pna vs sinus infection (rx'd by pcp) since Wed [**9-9**].
Low grade temps 99-100.0 over past week.
Pt came to ED w worsening SOB that she attributes to the amiodarone.
Chest xray: minimal interstitial prominence/edema suggesting fluid overload.
Pt admitted for CHF exacerbation and tune up prior to ablation.
Denies any CP or palpitations.
She believes that these symptoms are related to the amiodarone and did not take it this AM.
She also reports symptoms consistent with URI: dry cough, low grade fever, nasal congestion w green mucus, HA, and 1 week loose stool.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, or syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Liver transplant [**2095**], [**1-21**] primary biliary cirrhosis (vs. atresia-- records contradict) Paroxysmal Afib Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, normal EF Ascending aortic aneurysm, 4.2 x 4.3 cm in [**3-28**] Hypertension Thyroid colloid cyst Stable Lung nodules Rosacea Retroperitoneal adenopathy Skin cancer Raynaud's syndrome Cellulitis of thumb and left lower extremity Keratosis on Left LE which has tract Hernia repair Portal shunt C-section   Social History: distant smoker; denies ETOH and IVDU; married with two sons; elementary school social worker   Family History: non-contributory   Physical Exam: VS: 97.5  124/56  56  21  99/RA GENERAL: WDWN caucasian female appears anxious and tearful.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
bibasilar crackles at lateral bases ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND.
No HSM or tenderness.
+BS all quadrants EXTREMITIES: No c/c.
pitting edema to mid calves.
SKIN: +Chronic venous stasis changes.
No ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is a prominent greater saphenous vein, which compresses normally.
There is edema within the ankle.
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left lower extremity.
Mild blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles persists, consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild diffuse prominence of the interstitial markings suggests minimal interstitial edema.
No new focal consolidation is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions and minimal interstitial prominence/edema suggesting fluid overload.
Stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
CTA Chest FINDINGS: There is adequate opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree, with no filling defects identified to the subsegmental level to suggest pulmonary embolus.
The main pulmonary artery is prominent, measuring 3.1 cm, which may reflect mild pulmonary hypertension.
There is prominence of the right atrium, with reflux of contrast into the IVC, hepatic and azygous veins.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are small bilateral simple pleural effusions, with associated atelectasis.
There is minimal septal thickening.
There is a subcentimeter per-carinal lymph node.
There is a small sliding-type hiatal hernia.
The lung parenchyma is clear, without focal consolidation.
There is no pneumothorax.
There are no pulmonary nodules or masses.
There is no acute abnormality identified in the visualized portion of the upper abdomen.
The bones demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome.
Findings compatible with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 yoF s/p liver transplant with refractory AFib/RVR s/p self-conversion on amiodarone presenting w DOE, orthopnea, [**Location (un) **], and PND.
# Dyspnea: Likely acute on chronic diastoic heart failure secondary to HTN induced LVH and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, exacerbated by recent 17day run of atrial fibrillation.
Chest xray and CTA suggestive of volume overload.
PNA unlikely given lack of findings on chest xray, afebrile, no sputum/cough.
URI symptoms likely unrelated to dyspnea - likely viral infection vs sinus infection.
Her symptoms of DOE were relieved and LE swelling noticeably reduced.
Sinus infection: low grade temps at home and symptoms of URI.
Afebrile during admission.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with RVR: s/p 2 failed cardioversions at prior hospitalization and amiodarone loaded - now on 200mg daily.
Pt reporting malaise and attributing respiratory symptoms to antiarrhythmic.
Noted prolonged QTc on admission EKG but since attributed to amiodarone did not feel concerned for risk torsades given diffuse distribution QT prolongation per EP.
# Anticoagulation: Patient's INR supertherpaeutic at 3.4 at time of admission.
Likely increased [**1-21**] amiodarone therapy.
PROPHYLAXIS: -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic on coumadin -Pain management with prn tylenol (LIMIT 2g s/p transplant) -Bowel regimen with docusate .
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute diastolic CHF Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath, leg swelling, and your chest xray showed mild fluid overload of your lungs as well.
We attribute your symptoms to acute heart failure of unknown reason although it is most likely that you were going in and out of afib in the last week which caused the excess fluid to build up in your body.
You were also continued on the oral antibiotic regimen started by your PCP as an outpatient for a sinus infection.
