Pertinent Results: [**2152-4-14**] 11:40PM   GLUCOSE-125* UREA N-13 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-3.8 CHLORIDE-105 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-16 [**2152-4-14**] 11:40PM   WBC-10.0 RBC-3.92* HGB-11.7* HCT-35.7* MCV-91 MCH-29.9 MCHC-32.8 RDW-14.2 [**2152-4-14**] 11:40PM   NEUTS-70 BANDS-0 LYMPHS-19 MONOS-7 EOS-0 BASOS-0 ATYPS-4* METAS-0 MYELOS-0 [**2152-4-14**] 11:40PM   PLT COUNT-207 [**2152-4-14**] 11:40PM   PT-13.4 PTT-124.2* INR(PT)-1.2*  Outside hospital eval: 1)CT chest with contrast ([**4-14**]): Multiple filling defects are seen, starting with large linear defects involving the main pulmonary artery which extends into the main left and right pulmonary arteries.
Filling defects are seen involving second order branches to both the upper and lower lobes bilaterally, and findings are consistent with extensive pulmonary embolism.
Small left pleural effusion is seen, with atelectatic changes noted at the lung bases.
View of the upper abdomen show a 1.8cm low density mass within the liver.
2)RLE U/S ([**4-14**]): Deep venous thrombosis involving the popliteal vein.
[**2152-4-17**]: IVC filter placement - IVC-gram demonstrating a single patent IVC with no thrombosis.
There are bibasilar atelectasis.
If any, there is a small left pleural effusion.
There are low lung volumes and no pneumothorax.
---- TTE: [**2152-4-15**] at 10:55:01 AM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: PA bifurcation thrombus c/w known pulmonary embolism.
At least mild pulmonary hypertension.
No definite echo signs of RV strain.
--------------- BLE USD: [**2152-4-16**] 3:03 PM IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus involving the right popliteal vein extending into the mid-superficial femoral vein, with no evidence of more central clot.
-------------- INTERUP IVC  [**2152-4-17**] 10:39 AM IMPRESSION: IVC-gram demonstrating a single patent IVC with no thrombosis.
----------- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2152-4-16**] 7:39 AM Compared to the prior study there is increased opacification of the left lower lobe with increased amount of left pleural effusion, findings which might be consistent with developing pneumonia.
There is no appreciable right pleural effusion and the rest of the lungs are unremarkable.
---------- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2152-4-17**] 10:11 AM As compared to the prior study, there is no change in the left pleural effusion and left retrocardiac atelectasis, although worsening of the right lung base opacity most likely due to atelectasis is demonstrated accompanied by small amount of right pleural effusion.
The upper lungs are unremarkable and there is no evidence of failure.
Prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2152-4-15**] no diagnostic interim change.
Consider inferior myocardial infarction.
T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 67 year old woman with history of prior DVT, hypertension, and depression who presented with fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain who was found to have a large saddle pulmonary embolism and right lower extremity DVT.
1) Saddle Pulmonary Embolism and deep venous thrombosis: Patient found to have extensive pulmonary emboli on CT chest from OSH.
No history of immbolization or surgery.
IVC filter placed in-house given residual clot burden in RLE and substantial embolus already visualized.
However if there are signs of clot organization which suggests low risk for further embolus, the patient should call our IR clinics to have the filter removed.
Once INR therapeutic patient anxious to leave so was covered with lovenox with therapeutic inr for initial 48 hours of therapeutic coumadin.
3)Depression: Continued Celexa.
4)Hypertension: Continued Lotrel.
Outpatient Lab Work Please draw PT/INR, Phone: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 77618**], Fax: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 78421**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Saddle Pulmonary Embolus Deep Venous Thrombosis Anemia of Chronic Disease   Discharge Condition: Stable, no Oxygen requirement.
This clot had travelled to your lungs and caused a pulmonary embolus.
For this clot and embolus it is very important that you take anticoagulation for the remainder of your life.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience any new chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, worsening leg swelling or leg pain or any other symptom concerning to you.
Please have call Interventional Radiology at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8243**] to schedule an appointment to have your IVC filter removed in the next 1-2 weeks.
