Admission Date:  [**2154-8-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2154-8-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2133-8-12**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Trauma  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 20 year old male, status post high speed motor vehicle accident, unrestrained driver, who hit a pole, resulting in car fire, extraction time approximately 30 minutes, but the patient suffered no burns in the fire.
The patient arrived intubated, sedated and paralyzed, hypotensive and tachycardiac.
The patient had an open right femur fracture.
The patient was fully evaluated in the trauma bay, with a CT scan of the head showing a small subdural hematoma and frontoparietal hemorrhage.
A CT scan of the abdomen showed a grade IV liver laceration with blood around the liver and in the pelvis.
A CT scan of the abdomen saw a left lower lobe infiltrate versus aspiration.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils 2 mm, equal and reactive, mid-face stable, endotracheal tube in place, left upper lip laceration, no head or scalp lacerations.
Extremities:  Right lower extremity with open femur fracture and exposed bone, right foot mottled.
CT scan of the head showed a small right subdural hematoma.
CT of the abdomen showed left lower lobe developing infiltrate, questionable aspiration, liver laceration grade IV with blood around the liver and pelvis, right back hematoma.
CT of the neck could not rule out C1-2 atlantoaxial injury initially; further evaluated to be negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Prior to going to the Operating Room, the patient received an additional liter of intravenous fluids, four units of unmatched packed red blood cells and a left femoral trauma line.
The patient went for a CT scan to rule out intra-abdominal injury, at which point it was felt there was no injury and the patient could go to the Operating Room for fixation of the right femur.
The patient went to the Operating Room by the orthopedic surgeons for an open reduction and internal fixation of the right femur and then the patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for continued evaluation.
At this point, considering the dirty nature of the right femur fracture and fever spike, the patient was brought back to the Operating Room for a cleanout of the right leg.
This was performed without complication.
The patient was seen by the psychiatry service due to the patient's depression and polysubstance abuse.
He had no other complaints at this time, with stable vital signs.
His short term memory was certainly impaired, with no recollection of previous visits by the team.
The patient was seen by the neurology rehabilitation service on [**2154-8-8**] who felt that his behavior was consistent with a left frontal contusion.
It was at this point that the patient was referred to an acute head injury program for rehabilitation.
The patient remained stable from the standpoint of his liver laceration and femur fracture.
By hospital day eight, his mental status had markedly improved, with behavior resolution.
The patient was started on physical therapy, bedside and with ambulation, without difficulty.
On hospital day nine, the patient remained on a full diet and had no complaints.
At the time of discharge, the patient is partial weightbearing with his right leg and ambulating with a walker per physical therapy.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Subdural hematoma, left frontal occipital parenchymal hemorrhage, grade IV.
