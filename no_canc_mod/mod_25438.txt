Admission Date:  [**2161-10-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-10-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-1-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsiveness   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R craniectomy for evacuation of clot [**2161-10-17**] EVD placement [**2161-10-17**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 30 year old right handed woman with history of HTN not currently on medication who suddenly became unresponsive while at a tailgate party with her husband.
She soon became unresponsive and 911 was called.
Per 911, she was unresponsive and possibly foaming at the mouth.
She was found to have dilated R pupil and she was emergently transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
She underwent emergent imaging including CT of head and CTA of head and neck which showed large R cortical/subcortical hemorrhage with extensions into all ventricles and some midline shift.
HTN - not on any meds currently 2.
Some spontaneous movements of legs no purposeful movements.
No obvious facial asymmetry.
Partial right intraparenchymal hematoma evacuation.
There is residual hematoma posteriorly within the site of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
New left frontal approach shunt catheter.
Status post right frontotemporal craniectomy with unchanged appearance of blood products in the surgical bed, right basal ganglia hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Unchanged leftward shift of the normally midline structures and mass effect compared to study performed earlier the same day.
Unchanged large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage with new foci of acute embolic infarctions scattered bilaterally including the brainstem, cerebellum in bilateral frontoparietal hemispheres.
Unchanged subfalcine and mild uncal herniation.
Unchanged foci of hemorrhage within the brainstem, in the setting of slight downward transtentorial herniation, raising the possibility of duret hemorrhage  ECHO [**2161-10-20**] Mild to moderate spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium, left atrial appendage, right atrium, or right atrial.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is moderate LVH.No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve or the tricuspid valve.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: There is mild to moderate spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrial appendage (and low emptying velocity) without intracardiac thrombus seen (?
There is no evidence of vegetations or abscesses.
There is no ASD or PFO.
There is no evidence of aortic atheroma.
There is moderate left ventricular hypertrophy and the overall left ventricular systolic function is borderline.
[**2161-10-19**]: LE doppler  No evidence of DVT seen in either lower extremity.
[**2161-10-19**] Renal US No gross hydronephrosis.
Stable to decreased hemorrhagic products within the right cerebral hemisphere and ventricular system, with no new hemorrhage.
Multifocal evolving left cerebral and brainstem infarcts.
Again demonstrated is the small hemorrhagic focus in the paramedian ventral aspect of the upper pons; given this pattern, in the setting of persistent downward transtentorial herniation, this likely represents a Duret hemorrhage, associated with a poor prognosis.
CXR [**2161-10-21**] Now mild pulmonary edema has markedly improved.
Bibasilar opacity left greater than right are likely atelectasis.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2161-10-23**] 2:00 AM Final Report FINDINGS: Compared to the earlier examination, there is little change in the appearance of a right frontoparietal craniectomy with herniation of the brain to the calvarial defect.
There are extensive hemorrhagic products within the right cerebral hemisphere, tracking into the lateral ventricles, the distribution of which appears similar to the prior study.
There are multifocal low-attenuation lesions within the left cerebral hemisphere compatible with evolving infarcts.
Little overall change in appearance of extensive right cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
Limited evaluation by streak artifact, but the appearance of the posterior fossa with brainstem hemorrhage, ambient cistern effacement and downward transtentorial herniation is unchanged.
CXR [**2161-10-23**]: IMPRESSION: Progression of left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity indicating left lower lobe consolidation, possible additional right lower lobe consolidation.
Pulmonary vascular engorgement and moderate cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 30 y/o F with PMHx significant for HTN presents unresponsive after a tailgate party.
She was taken to the OR emergently and had a R sided craniectomy and EVD placement.
She was transfused 3 units of blood and hypothermia was initiated.
On [**10-19**], patient's exam did not improve, MRI head was done which revealed punctate infarcts in b/l frontal, parietal, occipital and brainstem.
Echocardiogram showed no vegetation/emboli.
Mannitol was ordered but was held at times for NA/OSM elevations.
A stat head ct obtained showed no change from her previous exam.
[**2161-10-26**] The patient's time of death was declared at 0315 due to respiratory distress and large previously known intraparenchymal hemorhage.
