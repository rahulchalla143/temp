Admission Date:  [**2135-5-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-6-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-8-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**] Chief Complaint: epigastric pain, incidental AAA identified, transfered from OSH for assessment of surgical intervention upon AAA  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yom presented to OSH with epigastric pain, shortness of breath, cough and chills, s/p fall on his right chest with ecchymosis, diagnosed OSH with possible NSTEMI (BNP of 1100, TropT of 0.09, 0.13, 0.13), PNA, CHF with EF of 25%, and AAA (6.7x6.5 cm).
At OSH ED, he was noted to have ecchymosis on the right chest, unable to lie flat and was hypotensive.
CT scan showed a 6.7x6.5 infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with no suggestion of acute leakage or bleed and bibasilar atelectasis vs airway disease.
ECG showed ST depression in V2 & V3 and prominent T-waves diffusely, RBBB, 1st degree AV block.
At the OSH ([**Hospital6 33**]), patient was treated for pneumonia with Zosyn and levaquin.
He was evaluated by cardiology due to his extensive coronary artery disease.
On the OSH echo, he was noted to have a depressed EF of 20-25% which was noted to be worse than prior reports (at [**Hospital6 10353**]).
Patient did have several episodes of acute pulmonary edema that was with increased BB, diuresis, ACEI, and BiPAP.
He was evaluated by surgery for the newly discovered abdominal aortic aneurysm, which he was recommened to have endovascular repair.
On review of systems, he has a persistent non-productive cough.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, abdominal pain, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea (sleeps with 1 pillow at night), ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - Congestive Heart Failure of uncertain type - Moderate aortic regurgitation (Diagnosed [**2134-8-15**]) - Previous admission to [**Hospital6 10353**] for a possible acute cardiac situation of unclear description - CABG: emergency procedure at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2123**]) - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: None - PACING/ICD: None 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Obstructive Sleep Apnea not on CPAP - Asthma - Asbestosis - Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy   Social History: The patient lives with his wife, per wife patient is full code (per report on d/c summary).
no pallor or cyanosis  NECK: Supple, no JVD  CHEST: bruise over right lower anterior chest,  midline sternotomy scar with 2 corresponding sub-centimetre horizontal scars inferiorly.
Irregular rhythm with impression of extrasystolic beats, heart sounds distant.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: diffuse expiratory > inspiratory wheezing and ronchi, bibasilar crackles, prolonged expiratory phase.
ABDOMEN: Umbilical herniation, Soft, NTND, no peritoneal signs.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: Old saphenous vein harvest scar on right medial aspect of leg.
No femoral bruits.
No peripheral gangrene or amputations.
Fungal intertriginous eruption with some skin breakage in perineal are and groins, Dystrophic nail changes/onychomycosis noted on toes.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid-distal anterior wall, apex, and distal anterior septum (LVEF 35-40%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate focal left ventricular dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild dilatation of the aortic root.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are stable.
There are bilateral extensive pleural plaques.
There is mild vascular congestion, minimally increased.
Bibasilar opacities are consistent with atelectasis.
There areno new lung abnormalities or evident pneumothorax.
Stable appearance of 6.9 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm with no evidence of contained or impending rupture.
Additionally, there is a right internal iliac aneurysm.
2.0 x0.8 cm cystic lesion within the tail of the pancreas, with a second in the pancreatic head which should be further evaluated with MRI on a non-emergent basis, which will also evaluate the renal lesions.
Left ventricular systolic function was normal and there were no obvious wall motion abnormalities.
There was moderate aortic insufficiency and mild mitral regurgitation.
There was no pulmonary hypertension.
Persantine Myoview stress test [**2134-5-17**]: The test was negative for symptoms and EKG changes.
The Myoview perfusion scan showed a moderate sized perfusion defect in the inferior and infra-apical walls.
This was a fixed defect but no reversible defects were seen.
Cardiac catheterization [**2134-5-18**]: There was severe coronary artery disease with obstruction of the left main coronary artery.
There was a  total obstruction of the left anterior descending, circumflex and right coronary arteries.
The LAD artery beyond the graft filled poorly from the graft because of severe distal disease.
The proximal second marginal artery had a significant proximal stenosis after the graft insertion, and could be treated percutaneously if symptoms occurred.
A calcified aneurysm of the LAD was repaired at that time.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yom who presented to OSH with epigastric pain, shortness of breath, cough and chills, s/p fall on his right chest with ecchymosis, at OSH found to have elevated trop and BNP, fever, leukocytosis, CHF with EF of 25%, and AAA (6.7x6.5 cm), was treated with broad spectrum abx and diureses and transfered here for consideration of surgical intervention for AAA.
Upon admission to the CCU was found to be in respiratory distress with acute on chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
His hospital course included treatment for an acute COPD exacerbation, pneumonia treatment and treatment of acute pulmonary edema.
# COPD exacerbation: admitted in repiratory distress with acute on chronic hypercarbia + hypoxia- the main pulmonary process per physical findings and radiology is likely exacerbation of his chronic respiratory disease (a combination of restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease given h/o asbestosis, sleep apnea, and asthma) perhaps with some contribution from heart failure and resulting pulmonary congestions given pleural effusions and congestion on xray.
Per fever and leukocytosis at OSH though he was also covered with Abx for pneumonia, got Ceftriaxone, azythro, Vanco then transitioned to levofloxacin.
His CHADS2 score of 3 but does not appear to be candidate for anticagulation given his poor functional status and evidence of falls (bruise on chest), Family understood this.
# CAD: Patient has significant history of CAD with question of MI.
Had modest trop levels to 0.13 in the setting of CHF exacerbation , echo here showed focal LV wall hypokinesis consistent with CAD , these findings are unchanged from those on MIBI in [**2134**] which showed akinesia and severe perfusion defects in LAD territory.
Positive trop are likely [**2-16**] to leak in the setting of CHF exacerbation +/- sepsis.
# CHF:  echo here: mild symmetric LVH, LV is top normal/borderline dilated,  mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid-distal anterior wall, apex, and distal anterior septum (LVEF 35-40%).
?left ventricular dysfunction c/w CAD, Mild aortic root dilatation (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
trivial mitral regurgitation, mild PHTN.
# HTN: Blood pressures currently holding well - Continued lisinopril as above - restarted home carvedilol on half home dose 6.25 On DISCHAREG:- Hold anti-hypertensives if SBP <100 .
# HLD: - Continued Simvastatin 80mg daily for now .
# Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia - Continued Proscar - Foley ON DISCHARGE: Trial of Void in 2 days.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: #Pancreas Lesions - on CTA [**5-29**] -  2.0 x 0.8 cm cystic lesion within the tail of the pancreas, with a second in the pancreatic head which should be further evaluated with MRI on a non-emergent basis, which will also evaluate the renal lesions.
