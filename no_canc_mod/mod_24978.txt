Admission Date:  [**2111-3-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-4-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2025-2-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**] Chief Complaint: syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left carotid stent [**4-3**] Off Pump CABGx4 (LIMA>LAD,SVG to Diag/OM, SVG>RCA) [**4-8**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 88783**] is an 86 year old male with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hypertrophy that presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] on [**2111-3-29**] after a pre-syncopal episode in church.
Per outside hospital records, he "passed out" while trying to stand up from a sitting position, and was noted to have diaphoresis at the time.
He [**Date Range **] palpatitations, chest pain or SOB during these episodes.
He also underwent a renal ultrasound unrevealing for signs of hydronepthrosis or obstruction but did reveal mild cortical atrophy.
He had a cardiac catheterization whcih revealed coronary artery disease and was referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization evaluation.
Past Medical History: coronary artery disease carotid stenosis hyptertension diabetes   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname 88783**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] ever smoking and dose not drink alcohol.
Family History: He has no family history of early myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION on Admission: VS: 98.0 155/74 81 20 99RA GENERAL: Alert, interactive, appropriate, no acute distress.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
There is a possible suprarenal mass.
Limited resting hemodynamic revealed severe systemic arterial  hypertension of 214/84mmHg.
There was moderately elevated left sided filling pressurs of 29mmHg.
On the right side, peak systolic velocities are 223 cm/sec, 103 cm/sec and 120 cm/sec in the internal, common, and external carotid arteries respectively.
On the left side, peak systolic velocities are 572 cm/sec, 52 cm/sec, and 261 cm/sec in the internal, common and external carotid arteries respectively.
There is significant heterogeneous plaque within the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Most significant area of stenosis on the right side situates approximately 2.8 cm from the carotid bifurcation and the most significant area of stenosis on the left side is situated approximately 2 cm from the carotid bifurcation.
IMPRESSION: There is 70-79% stenosis within the right internal carotid artery.
There is 80-99% stenosis within the left internal carotid artery.
No solid masses, stones or hydronephrosis can be visualized.
Peak velocity on the right at the hilum is 98 cm/sec, as compared to 68 cm/sec on the left.
CONCLUSION: Normal-sized kidneys with two small simple cysts, one on each side and relatively normal Doppler studies with slight parvus tardus waveform on the left main renal artery and mildly elevated RIs bilaterally.
Please note no suprarenal mass could be identified on either side, but ultrasound is not the optimal form of imaging for identifying adrenal lesions.
CXR [**2111-4-1**]: FINDINGS: No previous images.
Heart is normal in size and lungs are clear without evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
There is also a suggestion of calcifications in the right upper quadrant, which could conceivably lie within the kidney or gallbladder.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2111-4-1**] at 11:15:50 AM      FINAL  Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is isolated apical left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The LV apex appears mildly hypertrophied.
No pathologic valvular abnormalities.
There is vague hypodensity within the left corona radiata, subcortical right frontal white matter, right external capsule and the periventricular white matter about the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent commensurate with a generalized pattern of mild atrophy.
No large territorial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, mass, mass effect or shift of midline structures is identified.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells where included on the exam are clear.
CTA HEAD: Calcified atheromatous plaque is identified along the cavernous segments of the internal carotid arteries without flow-limiting stenosis.
The intracranial internal carotid arteries are otherwise normal in caliber and post-contrast enhancement.
No evidence of aneurysm, stenosis or occlusion is identified.
CTA NECK: The aortic arch and three-vessel cervical artery origins demonstrate scattered calcified and non calcified atheromatous plaque without significant flow-limiting stenosis.
Calcified atheromatous plaque is present along the superior wall of the subclavian artery at the origin of the right vertebral artery, resulting in a moderate stenosis of the right vertebral artery.
Scattered atheromatous plaque involving the left subclavian artery is also present.
A stenosis of the origin of the left vertebral artery may be present although possibly artifactual.
The proximal bilateral internal carotid arteries demonstrate both calcified and noncalcified plaque with varying degrees of stenosis, most severe involving the left proximal internal carotid artery where there is an interupted string of contrast due to a large calcified atheromatous plaque measuring approximately 8 mm in greatest length.
Although continuity of this segment of extreme stenosis can not be confirmed antegrade flow is felt likely as the ICA immediately distal to this segment shows robust postcontrast opacification suggesting antegrade rather than retrograde flow.
The right proximal internal carotid artery also demonstrates a string of contrast passing beyond a calcified atheromatous plaque 4 mm in length.
Slightly distal to this severe stenosis, there is an additional focal approximate 80% stenosis 6 mm in length due to calcified atheromatous plaque.
The internal carotid arteries distal to these proximal severe stenoses demonstrate normal post-contrast enhancement and caliber.
No evidence of infarction, hemorrhage or mass is identified on the non-contrast CT portion of the exam.
There are scattered foci of white matter hypodensity which may represent chronic small vessel ischemic disease, if there is sufficient clinical concern for infarction, MRI is more sensitive in a patient with no contraindications to MRI.
CTA of the head demonstrates scattered calcified atheromatous plaque without flow-limiting stenosis.
No aneurysm, occlusion or arteriovenous malformation is identified.
CTA of the neck demonstrates severe (string sign) stenoses of the proximal bilateral internal carotid arteries, left more severe than right, described above with a string of contrast passing beyond calcified atheromatous plaque.
There are also moderate stenoses of the origins of the right vertebral artery and right subclavian artery.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2111-4-4**] 9:11 PM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.
Small foci of hypodensity in the left corona radiata (2:20), bilateral subinsular white matter (2:[**11-25**]), and bilateral periventricular white matter are unchanged, likely representing chronic microvascular infarcts.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent due to mild-to-moderate age-related involutional changes.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No CT evidence of an acute major vascular territorial infarction.
MRI would be more sensitive for an acute infarction, if clinically indicated.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 88783**] was admitted for syncope and was found to have coronary artery disease.
His pre-op work-up carotid ultrasound showed 70% stenosis on the L and 80-90% stenosis on the R. A left carotid stent was placed on [**4-3**].
Post-operatively he had an episode of acute mental status change, dysarthrea and left sided clumsiness which spontaneously resolved.
A CT of his head was negative for an acute process.He was also found to have possible suprarenal mass when renal vessels selectively engaged on cath.
He did develop a small apical pneumothorax and air leak.
