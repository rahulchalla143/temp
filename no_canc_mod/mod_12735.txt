Admission Date:  [**2189-6-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-9-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: amiodarone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: seizure-like activity; hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 77 year old man with IPF on 6L home O2, A fib on Coumadin s/p ablation, systolic CHF s/p PPM w/ [**Hospital 26418**] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] hospital following a witnessed seizure at home.
Pt states this morning he awoke at 4:30am with some lightheadedness and air hunger.
He had urinary incontinence, per the daughter they could not feel a pulse but didnt do CPR.
After about 3-4mins he regained conciousness and was initially disorientated for a few seconds.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 16673**], per ED report he had a CT Head which showed no acute intracranial bld, labs were significant for an INR 6.
He was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for his seizures and elevated INR.
He was given Vit K 10mg x 1 for his elevated INR.
Neurology were also consulted to determine whether this was a seizure, their conclusion is seizure vs convulsions s/p syncope.
They also repeated his CT head scan which showed no evidence of an acute bld.
In the ED he was noted to have some episodes of hypoxia to the high 70s with minimal activity which appears to be his baseline on review of his last pulmonary note.
It is unclear as to why the pt was given [**Name (NI) 39915**] 1gm, likely given the hypoxia and CXR which appears to be close to baseline.
On review of the last pulmonary note it appears Mr. [**Known lastname 10132**] [**Last Name (Titles) 39916**]y status had a remarkable decline from 2L of O2 in [**Month (only) 958**] to 6L with very little reserve for activity in [**Month (only) 116**].
The decline was thought to be either due to accelerated IPF vs amiodarone lung toxicity and a component of CHF.
The pt also underwent a cardiac catheterization given this question of biventricular failure and chest pain.
Cath showed severe native three vessel coronary artery disease, LMCA showed mild luminal irregularities, LAD was totally occluded in the mid vessel, LCx was occluded proximally, RCA was also totally occluded.
He had a widely patent LIMA->LAD w/ large/long intercostal branch off of the mid LIMA and may represent steal from the LIMA to the LAD.
Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, with a mean PCWP of 18mmHg.
Moderate pul HTN with a PASP of 51mmHg.
Follow-up CT head ([**12-12**]) showed resolution of mild intrahemispheric and tentorial subdural hematoma -Osteoarthritis -Seasonal allergies, Asthma since childhood -Hx Herpes zoster [**8-/2188**] -Acute subdural hematoma [**10/2188**]- Coumadin stopped -Appendectomy -Tonsillectomy  Social History: Retired, got second jub as courier and was able to maintain a very active life style until [**12-12**].

IMAGING: [**2189-6-16**] CT Head w/o con: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or major vascular territorial infarction.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Cavum septum pellucidum et vergae is noted.
There is no fracture.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
[**2189-6-16**] PA/LAT CXR: S/p sternotomy indicative of previous bypass surgery.
A permanent pacer is seen in left anterior axillary position with intracavitary electrodes terminating in right atrial appendage position and apical portion of right ventricle correspondingly.
A third electrode is located in the coronary sinus and terminates in a superolateral coronary vein for left ventricular myocardial stimulation.
The lung tissue again demonstrates changes indicative of advanced pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, most marked on the lung bases.
Now superimposed on this pattern is a diffuse parenchymal haze most likely representing beginning pulmonary edema.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with free wall hypokinesis.The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with moderate global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, cannot exclude multivessel CAD).
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic vein, a superficial vein.
Slow flow in the left internal jugular vein, but is compressible.
No left upper extremity DVT seen.
Patent bilateral subclavian veins, but slower flow in the left subclavian with less variability as compared to the right, therefore, a more proximal thrombosis/occlusion can not be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old man with IPF on 6L home O2, Afib on Coumadin s/p ablation, systolic CHF s/p PPM/AICD who presented after a syncopal episode with seizure-like activity and found to have hypoxia.
# Seizure-like activity: Pt cannot remember specific event of falling, though it appears that his syncoal episode may have been preceded by hypoxia given the lightheadedness, also could prove to be vagal given his history.
Pt has no history of prior seizures, no electrolyte abnormalities, and CT head negative for acute process.
EEG negative for epileptic activity.
# Hypoxia: The patient has a very poor baseline lung function with a recent DLCO of 27%.
Over a period of [**2-5**] months his O2 requirement increased from 2L to 6L.
CXR c/w his known IPF + pulmonary edema.
Sputum culture with commensal respiratory flora.
Viral screen/culture negative.
Although no definite evidence for pneumonia, we empirically treated with levofloxacin ([**Date range (1) 39920**]).
# A fib with RVR: Pt underwent ablation and has remained well rate controlled since then.
# Systolic CHF s/p AICD/pacer: EF 35% on recent echo.
CXR c/w pulmonary edema so we diuresed with IV lasix as discussed above.
It is unclear why he is not on an [**Name (NI) **] or spironolactone.
An ultrasound revealed an occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic vein, which is a superficial vein.
