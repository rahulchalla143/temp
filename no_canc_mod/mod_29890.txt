# Right and Middle lobe PNA: Patient with chronic trach, placed on pressure support ventilation on admission.
CXR showed absence of right heart border and diaphragmatic border with interstitial opacity concerning for pneumonia versus collapsed lung.
Given pt lives at home with no recent hospitalizations he was covered for CAP however due to history of MRSA PNA, as well ESBL UTI empirically covered with vancomycin and meropenem.
Pleural effusion: Evidence of loculation on chest-x-ray and CT scan.
Labs were consistent with exudative effusion with pH of 6.85 and elevated LDH of 1228.
# UTI: Pt has remote history of ESBL in urine and currently has chronic indwelling foley catheter.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient had a chronic trach at home although did not require ventilation.
Upon presentation he required mechanical ventilation for respiratory support.
With treatment of infection, aggressive chest PT with insuflator/exsuflator we were able to wean to trach collar during day with mechanical ventilation overnight at pressure support [**6-11**], FiO2 40%.
He did develop acute hypoxemia which was secondary to mucous plug.
# Hypotension: Initially related to hypovolemia.
The patient had intermittent hypotension which was thought to be secondary to decreased salt intake and autonomic dysregulation.
The patient remained asymptomatic even during periods of relative hypotension.
# L hip pain and displaced femoral neck fracture: Ortho following.
Hip fx old from 4-5 years ago but pt having increased pain concerning for acute process such as displacement or infection.
Ortho evaluated and recommended pain management without further imaging at this time.
# Anemia: Patient has normocytic anemia.
Likely anemia of chronic disease.
# S/P C5-C7 spinal cord injury: continued neurontin, bisacodyl suppositories, colace, senakot, lactulose, will add enemas prn constipation, ditropan.
