She is now transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] on the 16th with increasing white count and question of requiring a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
Her previous history is also significant for exploratory laparotomy with hysterectomy, depression, gastroenteritis, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, hypertension, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic back pain, morbid obesity, suicidal attempts on several occasions, interstitial cystitis, chronic UTIs, basal cell carcinoma status post excision, hypertension.
There is no known history of coronary artery disease or diabetes and no history of known thyroid disease.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm without evidence of jugular venous distention nor was there evidence of systolic murmur.
Lungs revealed poor inspiration and decreased breath sounds at the bases with some diffuse rhonchi.
Abdomen was extremely obese with a well healed, infraumbilical, midline incision without evidence of hernia.
She had left lower quadrant focal rigidity and tenderness without rebound upon presentation.
She had some mild left sided costovertebral angle tenderness.
Rectal revealed no masses and a posterior anal fissure, no evidence of hemorrhoids, no stool was felt on digital inspection within the lower rectal vault.
There were no carotid bruits.
There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.
Urinalysis sent off after placement of Foley catheter was extremely positive, essentially draining pus which was positive for nitrites and white cells.
The patient was initially diagnosed with the suspicion of pyelonephritis and given wide spectrum antibiotics.
However, there was no way to rule out diverticulitis and the decision was made to conduct a CT scan that evening.
CAT scan demonstrated that she had significant sigmoid diverticulitis which appeared uncomplicated and without an abscess.
There was no evidence of extensive free air.
During the course of the next 12 hours and the following morning, it was noted that her abdominal exam had worsened and she now had diffuse peritonitis and rebound in all four quadrants of the abdomen.
Her pain was controlled once she was extubated and able to take clears and p.o.
However, on [**6-24**] she suffered acute respiratory distress and required reintubation.
At this point we used propofol for sedation and comfort as well as morphine and Ativan.
medications for pain control.
Her neurologic status at this point reveals that she is confused, but she is coherent and able to communicate with us.
From a cardiovascular point of view, throughout all incidents the patient remained hemodynamically stable without evidence of loss of blood pressure throughout her hospital stay.
We continued her on a beta blocker and she did not have any ischemic changes or episodes that we could tell.
On [**6-24**] she suffered an episode of hypertension and tachycardia which were unexplained and presumed due to PE until workup could be conducted.
From a respiratory point of view, the patient remained morbidly obese and incentive spirometry and out of bed were vigorously encouraged and helped with the patient.
A CT scan was performed emergently on [**6-24**] revealing no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There was no evidence of pneumonia.
However, sputum did reveal MRSA as well as a line culture which grew out staph epi from the [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital which was MRSA as well.
We then eventually were able to obtain a swallow study which demonstrated that she was cleared for bedside food as long as it was pureed and thickened honey nectar food.
She was too large for us to conduct a video pharyngeal radiological swallow, but she had been cleared by the speech and swallow department here for pureed and honey thickened foods.
Her ostomy is functioning, slightly retracted, but viable with gas inside of it.
for GI prophylaxis.
On the 18th the patient received gallbladder percutaneous catheter placement for a positive HIDA which concerned us for cholecystitis.
She was diuresed gently with Lasix as needed and we are now holding her diuresis at this time on discharge for volume contraction with bicarb of 30.
However, upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **], a lower GI bleed from the Hartmann pouch was noted.
Heparin was stopped and her bleeding resolved.
No evidence of bleeding at this time.
The patient has had an extremely complicated infectious disease course.
Initially she was given a combination of several medications, however, postoperatively after the first hospital day starting in the immediate postoperative period, she was placed on Levaquin, amp, Flagyl.
Fluconazole was started on the morning of the 16th for a persistently elevated white count and the A line grew out yeast as did one of her urine samples at [**Hospital1 **].
