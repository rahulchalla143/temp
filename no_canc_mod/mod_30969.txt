Admission Date:  [**2171-7-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-7-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-9-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Gantrisin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Found unresponsive at home  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation [**2171-7-1**] Central venous line placement [**2171-7-1**]   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 yo female with a history of DM type 1 X 35 years complicated by neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy with prior admissions for DKA and hypoglycemia, who was found unresponsive at home.
DM type 1 x 35 years.
Previous admissions for DKA and hypoglycemic episodes.
Hypertension 3.
No documented CAD.
Social History: She lives at home with her son, who is mentally retarded.
Sister with DM and breast cancer.
No murmur, or rub.
GI: Soft, no grimacing.
RESP: Early fine bibasilar crackles, no bronchial breathing.
No murmur or rub.
Abdomen soft and non-tender.
The lungs themselves are clear; a nodular density over the right mid/lower lung field is probably a nipple shadow.
[**2171-7-1**] CT HEAD: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, minor or major vascular territorial infarct.
There are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the carotid arteries.
Note is made of a left phthsis bulbi.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology, including no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2171-7-1**] V/Q scan: Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
Matched asymmetry as described likely due to differences in airflow with decrease on the right relative to the left.
It may be secondary to mucous plugging versus effects from mechanical ventilation.
/nkg  ******** Micro: Blood cultures X 4 NGTD Urine cultures X 2 negative  Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo female with long-standing DM type 1 with triopathy, admitted with DKA of unclear precipitant and profound metabolic dissaray.
She has little recollection of the events that pre-dated her admission, but remembers feeling slightly unwell 3 days PTA with some dizziness.
No clear dietary indiscretions or medication non-compliance.
She did have an elevated WBC on admission without left shift, and an infectious work-up was negative, including U/A, urine culture, blood cultures, and CXR.
She did have a mild troponin leak, but with flat MB, and this was not felt to be an acute coronary syndrome.
It was ultimately felt that a viral syndrome may have been the precipitant.
2) Hypotension: As noted above, her blood pressure dropped in the ED following intubation, and she was started on Levophed for hemodynamic support.
As noted, she had a mild troponin leak on admission, not felt to be an acute coronary syndrome.
3) CAD: EKG on admission showed lateral ST depressions in the setting of tachycardia.
Cardiac enzymes also revealed a mild troponin leak with peak troponin 0.19 but flat MB, in the setting of acute renal failure and tachycardia.
Diovan was reintroduced last given her renal insufficiency.
No other acute issues in the hospital.
ABG was initially concerning for an A-a gradient, and a V/Q scan was obtained and returned as low probability for PE.
Urine lytes were sent on [**7-3**], and were suggestive of superimposed ATN with FeNa 5.2%.
7) Elevated amylase: Her amylase peaked at 1730, with only mildly elevated lipase with peak at 92.
8) Hypernatremia: Patient with corrected sodium >150 in the setting of DKA and volume depletion.
However, she developed a new fever in the hospital on hospital day #3 to 101.2.
A repeat infectious work-up was performed, with negative CXR, U/A with few WBC but + epithelial cells (foley removed), and cultures all negative to date.
She did have diarrhea on [**7-5**] after drinking a coffee with cream despite her known lactose intolerance.
She had no recurrence of fever in the hospital without antibiotics.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Diabetic ketoacidosis Probable viral syndrome Diabetes mellitus type 1  Secondary diagnoses: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Patient discharged home in stable condition.
