Admission Date:  [**2146-2-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2146-3-3**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 84-year-old woman, who is admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2145-2-22**] with 9/10 substernal chest pain and shortness of breath at rest while at [**Hospital 38**] Rehab Facility.
At [**Hospital1 1474**], the patient was found to be in congestive heart failure with elevated troponin of 4.1.
Her initial EKG was normal sinus rhythm without any ST-T wave changes.
An echocardiogram the day after admission there revealed an ejection fraction of 20% and severe hypokinesis as well as critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.6 cm squared.
Two days after admission to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, the patient developed 10/10 chest pain with diaphoresis and ST elevations on EKG in leads V2 through V6 with ST depressions in the inferior leads.
Upon arrival here, the patient states that she is chest pain free, although complains of intermittent shortness of breath with minimal exertion.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.
Critical aortic stenosis.
Coronary artery disease status post multiple MIs.
No history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Patient is afebrile with a blood pressure of 131/53, pulse 93, respiratory rate of 16, and 100% oxygen saturation on 3 liters by nasal cannula.
She has no jugular venous distention up to 10 cm.
Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1, S2 with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border with a loud S2 and a displaced PMI.
There is also a [**1-14**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.
Extremities showed 2+ pedal edema up to the knees.
Skin shows no rashes.
Coags show an elevated INR of 1.4.
Chest x-ray showed mild CHF and patchy left lower lobe opacity.
EKG showed ectopic atrial rhythm at 106 beats per minute with ST depressions in the inferior leads and ST elevations in V3 to V6 and I in aVL.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient was found to have ST elevation MI on admission.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient was found to be in mild congestive heart failure on admission.
Aortic stenosis:  The patient had critical aortic stenosis on admission, however, she declined any surgery or any intervention.
Rhythm:  Patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation, however, EKG was more consistent with a wandering atrial pacemaker as she was rate controlled on digoxin and beta-blockade.
This was titrated up slightly, however, consideration was given to the fact that the patient was not eating too much and likely would continue to have a decreased appetite after returning home as she became more ill.  6.
It was also agreed as there would be no intervention for her cardiac disease per her wishes, that she would be most comfortable by going home with hospice care at home.
She is afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and not experiencing any chest pain.
ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Aortic stenosis.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Atrial fibrillation  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Ativan elixir as needed for anxiety.
Levsin tablet as needed for secretions.
Guaifenesin syrup as needed for cough.
