SMA and celiac axis arteriograms.
Selective coiling of pseudo aneurysm from inferior pancreatic-duodenal SMA branches.
PROCEDURE DETAILS:  Informed consent was obtained from the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy after explaining the risks, benefits, and potential complications of the procedure.
A DSA celiac trunk run demonstrated normal anatomy of the splenic and hepatic artery as well as the GDA, specifically without evidence of active extravasation.
A small caliber of the celiac trunk arteries was seen and was consistent with the patient's hypotension.
The latter demonstrated pseudoaneurysm and active extravasation from what appeared to be an inferior pancreatic branch of the SMA.
Subsequent selective runs demonstrated no residual hemorrhage.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
IMPRESSION:  Active extravasation and pseudo aneurysm from what appeared to be an inferior pancreatic branch of the SMA, which was successfully treated by placement of multiple coils.
Following treatment, there was no evidence of collateral flow to the hemorrhagic focus.
The source of the bleeding appeared to be retroperitoneal on CT. Ms. [**Known lastname 88135**] was taken to IR, where active extravasation and pseudoaneurysm were seen from what appeared to be an inferior pancreatic branch of the SMA, which was successfully treated by placement of multiple coils.
Following treatment, there was no evidence of collateral flow to the hemorrhagic focus.
She received albumin 25% for borderline low urine output overnight after the procedure.
Her vital signs were closely monitored for signs of tachycardia or hypotension, and these remained within normal limits.
Her creatinine bumped to 2.0, thought to be acute renal failure secondary to the contrast load from the CTA and angiogram.
PT/OT were consulted to assess home safety after her recent fall and to determine a need for rehabilitation after discharge.
The patient had diarrhea and a cdiff was ordered.
