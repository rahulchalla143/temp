EGD demonstrated a large superficial ulceration in the distal esophagus adjacent to the squamocolumnar junction with a central adherent clot and visible vessels.
The ulceration site was managed with endoscopic clip placement and epinephrine injection.
Repeat EGD was performed 2days later without active bleeding.
Her ulcerations were attributed to 4 pills of advil TID, fosamax, and recent initiation of full dose aspirin for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
She also developed acute onset shortness of breath.
No chest pain or palpitations.
She was taken by ambulance to [**Hospital3 18201**], where workup notable for systolic blood pressures in the 80s-90s with tachycardia to the 130s.
CTA demonstrated large bilateral pulmonary embolus.
Was transferred here for IR evaluation of thrombectomy given recent GI bleed and concern for initiation of systemic anticoagulation.
Patient was given an additional 2L NS with stabilization of tachycardia and blood pressures.
ECG demonstrated RBBB morphology with T wave inversions in precordial leads with ST depressions in V4-V6.
Cardiology service initially consulted, believed ECG changes and troponin leak due to RV strain and demand ischemia.
Upon reaching the floor, patient reports that her breathing is now back to normal and is without acute complaints.
Past Medical History: - history of bleeding esophageal ulceration [**1-/2175**] - paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; previously managed with asa 325mg PO daily prior to her GI bleed - hyperlipidemia - hypothyroidism - suspected coronary artery disease; no prior cath or stress tests - chronic back pain - osteopenia - osteoarthritis - asthma - cataracts   Social History: Patient lives alone, her son lives nearby.
No other illcit drugs.

Brief Hospital Course: ISSUES REQUIRING PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: -When and if to restart aspirin -On [**Hospital1 **] PPI for 8 weeks, then needs to decrease dose to daily -Urine Cx results pending -HR and BP after starting metoprolol -Whether to restart [**Hospital1 11573**] 86 year old female with PMH significant for CAD (no prior stents or MI), hypothyroidism, recent history of esophageal ulceration s/p endoclips on [**2175-2-6**] transferred from OSH for management of bilateral pulmonary emboli in the setting of recent GI bleed.
# Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli: Patient presented to [**Hospital **] [**2175-2-13**] with dyspnea and was found to be hypotensive, and tachycardic.
She was started on heparin drip and transferred to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for management of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism, in the setting of recent upper GI bleed.
The day after transfer, patient had a drop in her hematocrit and was found to have recurrent GI bleed.
She had transient hypotension after intubation that was responsive to IVF and did not recur after extubation on [**2-15**].
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed moderately dilated RV with moderate global free wall hypokinesis, moderate PA systolic hypertension.
# Upper gastrointestinal bleed: At the time of presentation to [**Location (un) **], patient had been out of the hospital for <24 hours after ICU admission for upper GI bleed from an esophageal erosion.
She was transfused 2 units, she was tachypenic and was electively intubated for an EGD which showed oozing from esophageal ulcer.
She continued to have melena and was transfused another three units.
She underwent EGD on [**2-14**] for HCT drop and was found to have large ulcer in mid-esophagus with oozing and adherent clot.
**  Repeat EGD [**2-16**] revealed ulcer with no further bleeding.
# Hypotension/Hypertension: Hypotensive at OSH, but had stable SBPs in the 120s after IVF resuscitation.
Hypotension related to intubation and sedation as well as blood loss also responded to IVF and transfusion.
After transfusion and fluid renunciation, she remained hemodynamically stable for the remainder of her hospital stay.
Towards the end of her stay, she actually had elevated BPs.
Given her elevated BPs and high-normal heart rate, she was started on Metoprolol (to be titrated per PCP).
# Incontinence and urge/freq: Pt began complaining of urge/freq and incontinence on day of discharge, but denied dysuria.
UA sent, which revealed large leukocyte esterase and few bacteria, but not an elevated WBC or +nitrite.
On follow-up phone discussion with patient her urinary urgency and frequency persisted, and so she was prescribed Cipro 500mg PO BID for three days.
# Pre-renal acute renal failure: baseline creatinine 0.7, it was elevated at 1.3 on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
# History of atrial fibrillation: Aspirin was held in the setting of upper GI bleed.
# Asthma: No active issues while in hospital she was treated with nebulizers as needed and resumed outpatient regimen on discharge.
