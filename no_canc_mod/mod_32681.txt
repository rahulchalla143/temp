This twin pregnancy was a monochorionic, diamniotic gestation.
Mom was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with premature rupture of membranes for delivery at [**Hospital1 346**].
There is some small, clear, nasal secretions noted around the nasal cannula.
Respiratory exam is consistent for coarse breath sounds bilaterally with good aeration.
Cardiovascular: Physical examination is consistent with normal S1 and S2 with no appreciable murmur.
No palpable masses are found.
The genitourinary exam is consistent with a circumcised penis and testes palpable bilaterally.
Hip exam reveals no clicks or clunks.
The infant did experience a left-sided pneumothorax requiring a left chest tube.
The patient then was placed on nasal cannula for the remainder of the hospital course (therefore developed chronic lung disease over the course of this hospitalization).
[**Known lastname 28221**] had apnea of prematurity and was placed on caffeine early in the hospital course.
The patient has been observed for greater than 10 days with no apnea event.
Cardiovascular:  This patient had no appreciable murmur in the first week of life.
The echocardiogram performed on [**1-24**] revealed no patent ductus arteriosus.
The echocardiogram performed on [**2-7**] demonstrated a 1.5 to 2 mm patent ductus arteriosus.
Follow-up echocardiograms on [**2-10**] and [**3-6**] revealed no significant patent ductus arteriosus.
This patient received no pressors for hypotension during this admission.
This patient does have anemia of prematurity and receives iron at discharge for supplementation.
Infectious disease:  This patient initially was placed on ampicillin and gentamycin for concern of sepsis related to Mom's premature rupture of membranes.
Gastrointestinal:  There were no concerns for necrotizing enterocolitis during this hospitalization.
The infant required intermittent phototherpay for indirect hyperbilirubinemia during the first few weeks of life.
Neurology:  This patient had several head ultrasounds during this admission to evaluate for intraventricular bleeding associated with prematurity.
This patient had a grade I intraventricular hemorrhage on the right, noted on [**2154-1-28**].
Ophthalmology:  This patient was evaluated multiple times for retinopathy of prematurity during his hospitalization.
On [**4-30**], this patient had immature retina in zone II in the left eye and immature retina in zone III in the right eye.
Feedings at discharge:  This patient will be sent home     with breast milk fortified with Enfamil powder to equal     24 k-cals per ounce or Enfamil 24 k-cals per ounce.
This     patient should take this ad lib and be followed closely     with the pediatrician for weight checks.
Immunizations recommended:    Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **]    through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following    four criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born    between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with two of the following:    Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household,    neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age    siblings; (3) chronic lung disease or (4) hemodynamically    significant congenital heart disease.
Before    this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life,    immunization against influenza is recommended for household    contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
