Brief Hospital Course: 80yoM with h/o DES to RCA and LCx in [**2110**] and recent ?
GI performed an EGD on initial presentation which showed a non-bleeding ulcer in the antrum.
Diverticulosis seen on prior colonoscopy in [**2115**]; and initially was felt current GIB may be diverticular bleed exacerbated by daily ASA/Plavix.
Plavix was held but ASA was continued after discussion with outpatient cardiologist, given high risk of in-stent thrombosis.
Patient had additional 1 unit pRBCs transfused in the MICU to goal Hct 28-30, given recent in-stent thrombosis and CAD.
Colonoscopy on [**2118-5-23**] showed mild diverticulosis but was otherwise unremarkable, with no evidence of old or recent bleeding.
Patient did not have any further bleeding in the MICU, Hct stabilized, and he remained hemodynamically stable.
Study showed duodenal and jejunal lymphangietasias with a prominent venous pattern at the jejunum, but no active bleeding seen on this study.
CE's neg x3 during current hospitalization without any acute ischemic changes on EKG.
Home antihypertensives were held in setting of acute GIB, though restarted on discharge day as patient remained hemodynamically stable.
RLE pain/Gout:  Patient with erythema and exquisite tenderness of right medial malleolus, no effusion appreciable and no pain with flexing the ankle, but exquisite tenderness to light touch.

Patient afebrile, without any localizing signs or symptoms of infection.
CXR on admission showed no gross e/o PNA.
[**Last Name (un) **] was felt to be pre-renal in setting of acute blood loss, and resolved with IVF and blood product administration.
