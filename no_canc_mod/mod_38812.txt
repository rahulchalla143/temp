Her history started two weeks ago approximately when she developed her third pneumonia of the year and she was hospitalized at [**Hospital **] Hospital for the same, treated with IV antibiotics and discharged to rehab.
During her short rehab stint, she developed an episode of "shakiness", high blood pressures to the 200s systolic, and visual disturbances characterized as flashes of light in the peripheral visual fields, odd shadows/contours around objects in her field as well as patchy areas of blindness.
They improved her blood pressure and 12 hours after the onset of symptoms her visual disturbance improved.
She received CT imaging (which "ruled out" stroke), as well as carotid US imaging which showed the presence of a right sided 70% stenosis of the carotid artery.
Over the past two days prior to her ED presentation this time, she was noted to be once again shaky, confused, lethargic and displaying urinary incontinence.

These epileptic discharges, at times, occur in a generalized distribution and occasionally become briefly periodic.
These findings are indicative of independent areas of cortical irritability in the posterior quadrants that are potentially epileptogenic as well as generalized cortical irritability.
In addition, the background is diffusely slow, indicative of a mild diffuse encephalopathy of non-specific etiology.
Note is made of sinus bradycardia through most of the recording.
NCHCT [**2159-1-17**]: Severely limited evaluation due to streak artifact from EEG cables, within those limitations, no large, obvious acute intracranial process.
No acute intracranial process.
Mixed hard and soft plaques at the carotid artery bifurcations; moderate narrowing of the right proximal internal carotid artery due to the plaque.
Right-sided thyroid nodule.
Recommend thyroid ultrasound on a  non-emergent basis for further characterization.
Biapical pleural scarring, if clinically indicated, would be better evaluated with a dedicated chest CT.   Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 26812**] is a 66yo W with a history of longstanding tobacco abuse, EtOH Abuse (3 drinks/night per family), lower back pain s/p placement of thecal morphine pump, recent history of recurrent pneumonia/bronchitis, HTN, HLD, GERD, anemia who was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for complaints of altered mental status and urinary incontinence.
Her history started two weeks ago approximately when she developed her third pneumonia of the year and she was hospitalized at [**Hospital **] Hospital for the same, treated with IV antibiotics and discharged to rehab.
During her short rehab stint, she developed an episode of "shakiness", high blood pressures to the 200s systolic, and visual disturbances characterized as flashes of light in the peripheral visual fields, odd shadows/contours around objects in her field as well as patchy areas of blindness.
They improved her blood pressure and 12 hours after the onset of symptoms her visual disturbance improved.
She received CT imaging (which "ruled out" stroke), as well as carotid US imaging which showed the presence of a right sided 70% stenosis of the carotid artery.
Over the past two days prior to her ED presentation this time, she was noted to be once again shaky, confused, lethargic and displaying urinary incontinence.
In the ED, her examination was significant for inattention, inability to follow commands, diffuse paratonia and a possible right lower extremity drift.
On her statnet EEG, she was noted to have multifocal epileptiform discharges (L>R) and loaded with keppra.
EKG was reviewed, sinus with no block, rapid repolarization but no significant ST changes and no TWI.
Overnight, there were no acute events.
On exam, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with BPs overnight between 90-100 SBP, and satting 93-95% on 2L/nC.
There were no remarkable abnormalities on her general physical examination.
Her neurologic examination was significant for a transcortical motor aphasia with preserved repetition, comprehension, [**Location (un) 1131**] but not writing.
She also displayed bilateral asterixis with brisk reflexes and downgoing toes.
Formal strength testing was symmetric and full and there was no drift.
To evaluate the cause for her expressive aphasia, she received a NCHCT and CTA head/neck which showed no evidence of an acute stroke, hemorrhage or mass, but did reveal atherosclerotic disease in both carotid arteries (R>L).
On the floor, her exam slowly improved with increased attentiveness but still some decreased fluency of speech.
To further evaluate the cause of seizures, she received a contrast-enhanced Head CT on [**2159-1-20**] which did not reveal any abnormal enhancement.
Overnight, she had a cluster of short seizures around 0215 with motor manifestations which resolved with lorazepam 1 mg. Around 0630 on [**2159-1-21**], she start to have clinical seizure activity again with left head turn, left eye deviation, and left arm myoclonic jerks which lessened but was followed by left foot myoclonic jerks.
She was given another LZP x 2mg without resolution.
She was transferred out of the ICU in stable condition and gradually improved with regards to her mental status.
She was continued on Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and Vimpat 150mg [**Hospital1 **] with no further seizure activity.
She remained somewhat inattentive and perseverative, and was oriented to place but not date.
She continued to have difficulty swallowing as well, and failed several subsequent swallow evaluations.
TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Patient will need to remain on Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and Vimpat 150mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure control.
Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB, wheeze.
2. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or T > 99.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
11. senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted for altered mental status and were found to have seizure activity on your EEG.
You do have stenosis of your right internal carotid artery which means you should control your high blood pressure and cholesterol well and follow closely with your primary care physician.
A feeding tube was placed in your stomach in order to give you nutrition as you are still having difficulty swallowing.
