Admission Date:  [**2160-1-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-1-23**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year old man with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with worsening shortness of breath.
The patient was in his usual state of health until a few days prior to admission when he began to experience worsening shortness of breath, more than his baseline.
He had experienced paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for some time but more frequently and progressively worse.
At 4:00 a.m. the morning of admission, he awoke with extreme shortness of breath which improved when he sat up.
He also reported dyspnea on exertion and occasional chest discomfort with exertion over the six months prior to admission, much worse over the week prior to admission.
He reports that his chest pain improved with rest.
The patient denied diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting.
He reported that he could only walk down a [**Doctor Last Name **] until he experienced shortness of breath and needed to rest.
Coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the D1 and right coronary artery.
End stage renal disease secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
The patient has been on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for two and one half years and has had two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.
Chronic leukocytosis.
History of pulmonary embolus.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure.
History of adenomatous polyps.
Cardiovascular - The patient had distant heart sounds with a regular S1 and S2 and faint S3.
Pulmonary - He had faint bibasilar crackles.
Abdomen was obese, distended to percussion and nontender to palpation.
Extremities showed no edema, palpable posterior tibial pulses and no femoral bruit.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and initially was believed to rule in for myocardial infarction with a troponin of 5.0.
The patient was subsequently taken for cardiac catheterization where coronary angiography of the right dominant circulation revealed branch vessel coronary artery disease.
The left anterior descending had mild luminal irregularities.
D1 totally occluded distally at the site of prior stenting.
Left circumflex had mild luminal irregularities.
Resting hemodynamics were measured at baseline and revealed a markedly impaired cardiac output of 3.6 liters per minute and a moderately elevated left ventricular filling pressures with a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 25 mmHg.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he was weaned off the balloon pump and Dopamine without difficulty.
The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath improved markedly after the biventricular pacer placement.
The patient's persistent leukocytosis was not felt to be a change, however, a sample of a diasolate was sent for culture with no growth by the time of discharge.
Per the renal team, the patient was instructed to continue his outpatient antihypertensive regimen with further fine tuning of his blood pressure through dialysis.
Status post biventricular pacer.
Congestive heart failure.
