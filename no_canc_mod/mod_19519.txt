The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Ascending thoracic aorta slightly enlarged, maximal transverse diameter 41mm.
Inhomogenous attenuation in both lungs and small bilateral pleural effusions, may be consistent with mild fluid overload.
Small volume mediastinal lymphadenopathy which is a nonspecific finding, and may be related to chronic pulmonary edema.
[**2166-7-14**] Carotid Ultrasound: There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
Right ICA stenosis 60-69%.
Left ICA stenosis 40-59%.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mitral regurgitation remains mild to moderate.
Evaluate for pleural effusions.
There is now status post sternotomy and the presence of multiple surgical clips in the anterior left mediastinum are compatible with the recent bypass surgery.
The heart shadow has increased, but the pulmonary vasculature does not demonstrate an increased congestive pattern.
No progression of the previously described bilateral basal plate atelectasis, but some pleural densities remain on the left base continuing also along the left lateral chest wall into the left axillary area, but the posterior pleural sinuses are rather free on the lateral view.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Enlarged heart silhouette most likely related to post-operative pericardial thickening.
No evidence of increased pulmonary vascular congestion.
Some left-sided pleural thickening remains, but no evidence of any major atelectasis.
Echocardiogram also notable a slightly dilated ascending aorta for which a CT scan was obtained.
Prior to surgery, carotid ultrasound also revealed mild to moderate carotid disease.
He otherwise remained pain free on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery.
