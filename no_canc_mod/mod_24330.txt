Pertinent Results: [**2143-10-8**] 09:52PM   HCT-26.8* [**2143-10-8**] 02:26PM   CK(CPK)-21* [**2143-10-8**] 02:26PM   CK-MB-2 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2143-10-8**] 02:26PM   HCT-29.7*  [**Month/Day/Year **] REPORT [**2143-10-8**]: The ampulla was located, and a small amount of fresh ooze was seen at the site of the previous sphincterotomy.
No filling defects were identified.
(stent placement, thermal therapy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old gentleman with coronary artery disease s/p mechanical aortic valve replacement (St Jude's valve), DM, previous prostate CA who is s/p [**Known lastname **] ([**2143-10-3**]) resulting in sphincterotomy, who was admitted to the ICU for melena and lightheadedness.
He underwent EGD/[**Month/Year (2) **] on [**2143-10-8**] and the source of bleeding was identified at his sphincterotomy site from [**10-3**].
His anticoagulation was held for the procedure but given his extensive cardiac history and mechanical valve, cardiology was consulted regarding this issue.
On [**10-11**], pt had an episode of explosive gassy bowel movement with dark melena of unclear volume.
It remained unclear if this represented a new episode of bleeding, or if this was melena that remained from his prior bleed (this was the first time moving bowels since procedure).
Serial H/H revealed a decreased Hct to 24 and pt was transfused an additional unit of PRBC.
* Syncope - Due to his history of near syncopal episode (and cardiac history), he was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
He was ruled out with negative cardiac enzymes and it was felt that his near syncope was secondary to his GI bleed and hypoperfusion.
* CAD s/p CABG - His outpatient medications were continued.
Lisinopril was decreased to 20mg daily  * HTN - Norvasc was held through out much of his hospitalization, but was restarted on the day before discharge.
* Hyperlipidemia - Statin continued  * DM II - Metformin was discontinued in the setting of his Cr.
