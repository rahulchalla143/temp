[**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale on ED arrival was 15, but required intubation for respiratory distress.
EXT: + pedal pulses.
Pertinent Results: [**2194-9-26**] Echocardiogram  There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis by 2D (doppler interrogation of the aortic valve was not obtained due to poor image quality).
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No retrobulbar hematoma or evidence of traumatic globe injury.
No acute intracranial process.
Mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells, likely related to intubation, though no air-fluid levels within the sinuses to suggest occult fracture.
[**2194-9-26**] CT C-spine  -Non-displaced fracture of the left pedicle of C7 -Possible non-displaced fracture of the anterior tubercle of the left transverse process of C7.
-Vertebral artery on the left at the C7 level (seen on CTA chest) appears normal without signs of traumatic injury - though more cephalad vertebral artery not imaged.
Extensive bilateral atelectasis, but no contusion or hemothorax.
Severe mediastinal lipomatosis, though no mediastinal hematoma.
No evidence of traumatic injury to the thoracic aorta.
Fracture of the pedicle of C7 on the left with possible fracture of the anterior tubercle of the transverse process on the left, better characterized on cervical spine CT. Contrast-enhanced vertebral artery at the C7 level appears normal without evidence of traumatic injury.
Numerous bilateral rib fractures as detailed above.
No pneumothorax.
Nondisplaced fractures of the left transverse process of the L1 through L3 vertebral bodies.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2194-9-29**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.

[**2194-9-30**] Left hand film  Three views of the left hand have no comparisons.
There is a transverse intra-articular fracture at the base of the distal phalanx of the ring finger.
The fracture line extends to both the volar and distal aspects of the phalanx with fracture fragments present along the volar aspect of the joint.
Mild soft tissue swelling.
Moderate-sized left pneumothorax without evidence of tension.
Subtotal atelectasis of bilateral lower lobes is slightly increased since prior.
Ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes, left greater than right, are nonspecific, but compatible with aspiration or infection in the correct clinical setting.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
New small perihepatic ascites and pelvic fluid.
Numerous osseous injuries, similar to prior, including slightly displaced fracture of the inferior angle of the left scapula, bilateral rib fractures with segmental fractures of the left third through fifth ribs, L1-L3 left transverse process fractures.
Comminuted, intra-articular fracture of the base of the distal phalanx of the left ring finger.
Joint is mild hyperextended.
No evidence for acute fracture of the capitate.
Widening of the scapholunate interval suggestive for scapholunate ligament injury / disruption.
MR examination of the left wrist would provide further imaging evaluation if clinically warranted.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility (the apical half of the RV free wall appears severely hypokinetic.
There is no pericardial effusion.
C5-6 interspinous ligamentous edema, consistent with acute injury; however, no evidence of ALL or PLL complex or spinal cord injury.
Left C7 pedicle and articular pillar fracture, extending into superior articulating facet, without evidence of joint capsular disruption or alignment abnormality.
Moderate C3-4 right neural foraminal narrowing.
[**2194-10-10**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Though there has been interval resolution of a left pneumothorax from [**9-30**], there is little change in segmental atelectasis at the bilateral lower lobes.
There is no pulmonary embolus.
[**2194-10-11**] HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) FINDINGS:  Again seen is an oblique intra-articular fracture at the base of the fourth distal phalanx with multiple small fracture fragments.
There continues to be angulation of the distal fourth digit at the fracture site with associated soft tissue swelling.
No callus formation is visualized.
He was initially awake and following commands, but was intubated in the trauma bay for increasing respiratory distress with possible aspiration.
The patient was subsequently pan-scanned revealing bifrontal hematomas and rib fractures.
His ICU course as follows by systems:  Neuro:  GCS 15 and moving all extremities in the trauma bay, the patient was intubated for progressive respiratory distress and was kept intubated and sedated on fentanyl and versed until HD 9.
A hard collar was in place at all times per spine recommendations for C7 fracture.
On [**10-9**] he sustained a fall and began to complain of thoracic spine tenderness.
Resp:  On arrival to the ED, the patient was having difficulty maintaining his O2 saturation and became tachypneic, likely secondary to extensive rib fractures.
On his initial CT, there were large dependant fluid collections which were read as likely atelectasis, but were somewhat concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
He was bronched on arrival to the TSICU for persistent hypoxia which improved with suctioning.
He was placed in ARDS ventilatory settings but had an increasing PEEP requirement for adequate oxygenation complicated by a large left pneumothorax on [**9-27**] requiring urgent chest tube decompression with immediate improvement.
Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed for persistent RLL collapse on [**9-27**] and culture was positive for acid-fast bacilli.
Infectious disease consultation was obtained for presumed aspiration pneumonia with acid-fast bacilli, and initial empiric vancomycin and Zosyn were de escalated to Zosyn on [**9-30**].
On [**9-30**], a repeat CXR revealed increase in a left subpulmonic pneumothorax and a second, posterior chest tube was placed with satisfactory resolution.
Repeat bronchoscopy was performed on [**10-1**] for RLL collapse on chest CT, with purulent sputum aspirated and sent for culture.
Tube feeds were started on HD2 and advanced to goal, which he tolerated without difficulty.
He did have a bronch on [**9-27**] which showed non-anthracis bacillus.
MSK: Found to have 4th metacarpal and distal phalanx fractures, splinted by Hand surgery and referred for outpatient follow up.
His pain was well controlled with oral medications.
On HD 16 his Foley catheter was discontinued and he was voiding large amounts of urine without difficulty.
His vitals remained stable and he remained afebrile up to the day of discharge.

Your spine injuries in your neck and mid back did not require any operations- instead you were fitted for a hard cervical collar and a corset type brace for your mid back fracture.
It is importnat that someone be with you when showering to make sure that you have minimal movements.
*  You have rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs ( crepitus ).
