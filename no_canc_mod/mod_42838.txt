[**Month/Day/Year 706**] Chest pa/lateral Final Report HISTORY: Hypoxia and chest pain.
There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion at this time.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Low probability of pulmonary embolism.
Increased perfusion to the upper lung zones consistent with pulmonary vascular redistribution seen in heart failure.
Video swallow IMPRESSION: Aspiration and penetration with all administered preparations.
CT head negative and no focal findings to suggest a CNS etiology.
ACS low probability given no ekg changes.
Hypoxia on admission likely related to somnolence and OSA now resolved.
Given hx of non-renally dosed gabapentin (increased recent dose) and opiate use likely contributed to somnolence.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Likely pre-renal in setting of recent diarrhea and increase in home lasix dose.
# UTI: noted with significant pyuria on UA.
Has had multiple UTIs in the past that have grown a multitude of bacteria with variable sensitivites.
CXR without evidence of PNA.
Patient has known dCHF with increasing weight noted over the course of the month and increasing lasix dosages, however patient does not appear volume overloaded.
ABG close to baseline and past PFTs suggest both a restrictive and obstructive picture.
Speech and swallow consulted during ICU stay and patient did not have difficulty with aspiration.
It is possible that aspiration event caused initial MS then resulting hypoxia from somnolence and underlying OSA.
# Failed swallow eval/Dysphagia: Per daughter, pt has been c/o dysphagia to solids and liquids for the past 4-6 weeks at home but symptoms were mild.
She endorsed difficulty swallow wo odynophagia during her wards stay and swallow eval including video swallow confirmed dysfunction and aspiration.
