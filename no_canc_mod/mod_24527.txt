HISTORY: Status post aortic stent.
FINDINGS: The study is mildly compromised secondary to positioning.
The left internal jugular approach vascular sheath has been removed.
Left-sided pleural drains have also been removed in the interval.
A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter remains stable in course and position with the distal tip just distal to the cavoatrial junction.
There has developed left lower lobe collapse.
There are bilateral pleural effusions more notable on the right with significant posteriorly layering component.
The perihilar haze previously noted has mildly improved with no significant superimposed edema at this time.
There is a rounded nodular opacity now projecting within the left lower lobe.
No pneumothorax is evident.
The exaggerated descending thoracic aortic contour is stable and consistent with known preexisting aortic pathology.
IMPRESSION: Relative clearing of edema with persisting bilateral pleural effusions, right worse than left.
There has been interval development of left lower lobe collapse with a rounded opacity near the left lung base, which likely represents loculated fluid within fissure, "pseudotumor."
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Results were personally  Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
With aortic cross-clamping, the aortic regurgitation worsened slightly.
There were no other significant changes.

EXAMINATION: CTA of the chest with and without contrast dated [**2200-6-30**].
INDICATION: 63-year-old male status post type B dissection repair with diminished right leg pulses.
Since the prior examination, there has been placement of graft material in the proximal descending thoracic aorta, the aortic lumen opacifies normally.
Periaortic high density material is demonstrated consistent with hematoma.
High density is demonstrated on the non-contrast images within the left pleural space consistent with moderate to large hemothorax.
There is total collapse of the left lower lobe and partial collapse of the left upper lobe.
There is partial collapse of the right lower lobe.
There is a small right pleural effusion which is low in density.
Patchy airspace opacities are demonstrated within the left upper lobe and right upper lobe along the fissure, which may represent atelectasis,infection or aspiration.
There are coronary artery calcifications.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Approximately 5 mm below the graft, there is redemonstration of an aortic dissection.
The celiac axis, SMA, right renal artery, and accessory right renal artery are all off of the true lumen.
There is no evidence of bowel wall thickening.
Multiple low- density lesions are demonstrated within the liver, unchanged.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is a Foley balloon catheter inflated within the bladder and the bladder is decompressed.
There is no lymphadenopathy, bowel wall thickening, or free intraperitoneal gas.
BONE WINDOWS: There are degenerative changes of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine.
There is evidence of median sternotomy.
There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Beyond the surgically placed graft, there is evidence of dissection continuing into the abdominal aorta with equal opacification of the true and false lumens.
As described above, the celiac axis, SMA, right renal artery, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are off of the true lumen which is significantly smaller in size since the prior examination and the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta with atrophy of the left kidney and delayed opacification of the left kidney.
Postsurgical changes within the thorax status post descending thoracic aortic dissection repair.
Left hemothorax consistent with postsurgical changes.
Complete left lower lobe collapse, partial left upper lobe collapse, and partial right lower lobe collapse.
Small right pleural effusion.
Markedly narrowed left renal artery as described above.Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] covering for vascular surgery at 8 a.m. on [**2200-6-30**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

HISTORY: 63-year-old man with right seminal vesicle abscess for drainage.
Samples were sent for culture.
Patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no immediate post-procedure complications.
Moderate sedation consisting of divided doses of Versed and fentanyl was provided by the patient's nursing staff.
Samples were sent for culture.
Results follow:  ORAL PHASE: The oral phase was noted for mild deficits with regards to prolonged oral transit time with solids, prolonged mastication and mild oral residue on the tongue with solids due to dry mouth.
There was mildly reduced hyolaryngeal excursion as well as decreased laryngeal valve/airway closure.
Additionally, there was mild residue in the valleculae of solids and nectar thick liquids, but this cleared sips of thin liquids and repeat swallows.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Trace penetration occurred during the swallow with thin liquids, while using a chin tuck maneuver, due to reduced laryngeal valve/airway closure.
Mild aspiration occurred during the swallow with the initial teaspoon of nectar liquid and with a cup sip of thin liquid due to reduced laryngeal valve/airway closure.
SUMMARY: Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] presents with a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia currently with mild oral residue, prolonged oral transit and also decreased airway closure which contributed to trace aspiration of thin liquid.
As such, a po diet of thin liquids and regular solids is recommended, with aspiration precautions/strategies as noted below.

He was transferred on [**2200-6-8**] from an outside hospital with recurrent chest pain and an enlarging type B dissection.
At the outside hospital he was found to have MRSA in his blood and urine.
Urology was consulted for a seminal vessicle abscess and they placed an IR drain in his seminal vessicle.
The infectious disease service was allso consulted for management of his abscess.
On the [**6-26**] he was brought to the operating room and underwent a descending thoracic aortic replacement, primary repair of his left common femoral artery, and pleural flap between his lung and graft.
A swallow consult was obatained and a video swallow was performed which showed a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia currently with mild oral residue, prolonged oral transit and also decreased airway closure which contributed to trace aspiration of thin liquid.
As such, a po diet of thin liquids and regular solids is recommended, with aspiration precautions/strategies as noted below.
Given these findings, Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] was taken back to the OR on [**2200-7-2**] where he underwent an open fenestration of the aortic dissection (membranectomy) and placement of a left renall stent.
He was extubated on [**2200-7-3**] without complication.
The renal service continued to follow him for his elevated creatinine which stabilized at 2.1.
