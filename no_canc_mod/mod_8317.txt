The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
She was doing well until the evening of [**3-19**] when she vomited large amount of bilious emesis and became hypotensive to a systolic blood pressure of 70 and tachycardic to 140 and 150s, tachypneic and hypoxic with O2 sat in the 70s.
Electrocardiogram was with inferolateral ST depressions.
Chest x-ray was with a new large right large right lower lobe consolidation.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit she was aggressively hydrated for blood pressure and low urine output.
The patient's respiratory decompensation was thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia secondary to emesis.
The patient then developed bilateral aspiration pneumonias likely secondary to continuing emesis.
Her emesis was thought to be secondary to pneumonia as well as to fecal compaction although there is no obstruction per KUB and her liver function tests on [**3-19**] were within normal limits.
Urine output decline was thought to be secondary to dehydration.
Anemia workup was consistent with anemia of chronic disease plus minus iron deficiency.
