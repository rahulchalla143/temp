Admission Date:  [**2123-3-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2123-3-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-4-28**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Coronary Care Unit  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 58-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction [**2113-4-28**] with stent to the right coronary artery, angioplasty to the obtuse marginal in [**Month (only) 359**] of '[**14**], stent to the right coronary artery in [**2114-11-28**], angioplasty to the posterolateral branch of the right coronary artery in [**2116-6-28**], who presented with unstable angina x3 weeks to an outside hospital.
Patient states that he has been chest pain free for approximately seven years prior to approximately three weeks ago when his chest pain recurred.
Patient reports that the chest pain was his typical angina, but mild compared to previous experiences and resolved with 1-2 nitroglycerin.
these symptoms sometimes occurred at rest over the past three weeks.
His episodes have increased in frequency over the past three weeks.
Patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting.
On the evening of admission, the patient awoke from sleep with 9/10 chest pain and diaphoresis, and took six sublingual nitroglycerin as well as aspirin without resolution of chest pain, so he called ambulance.
Patient was brought to an outside hospital, where ECG changes showed inferior ST elevations and anterior ST depressions.
Patient received Heparin drip, Morphine, and nitroglycerin at the outside hospital and became chest pain free.
In the ambulance upon transfer, patient had recurrent chest pain and received a second dose of Retavase.
The patient's inferior ST changes had resolved by the time he arrived at the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 **] and he was originally pain free.
However, his pain recurred, and a repeat electrocardiogram showed ST elevations approximately 1 mm in the inferior leads, st depression in V1 and V2 and 1 & avl with t wave inversion in avl.The patient was therefore brought from the Emergency Room to the Coronary Cath Laboratory.
At catheterization, the patient was found to have 80% mid left circ stenosis as well as 90% lesion in the RCA between two previous stents.
Upon arrival at the Coronary Care Unit, the patient denied any symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath.
Review of systems was notable for skin lesions that the patient states has been diagnosed as shingles.
Coronary artery disease.
Cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use, which per the patient has resolved.
FAMILY HISTORY:  [**Name (NI) **] mother passed away from a myocardial infarction in her 70s, and patient's father passed away from a myocardial infarction in his 50s.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Middle-aged gentleman lying in bed in no apparent distress with normal S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or extra heart sounds.
Remainder of the exam was within normal limits including good pulses throughout, stable groin site, as well as clear lungs and no jugular venous distention.
Patient did have a ventral hernia in his abdomen, which was reducible.
DIAGNOSTICS ON ADMISSION:  Patient's ECG with normal sinus rhythm with resolution of inferior-right precordial and lateral ST changes upon arrival to the CCU.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 58-year-old man with coronary artery disease status post multiple catheterizations in the mid 90s, but without any symptoms and medically stable for about seven years.
Patient presented to outside hospital with acute chest pain and found to have inferior-right precordial and lateral ST changes.
Patient is status post thrombolytics at the outside hospital, but with recurrence of symptoms and underwent catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**].
Status post repeat cardiac catheterization with stent placement and resolution of symptoms:  Patient's ECG changes normalized after coronary catheterization and the patient remained asymptomatic throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.
Pump:  Patient had not an echocardiogram or left ventriculogram for many years, and he therefore underwent a repeat echocardiogram on [**3-26**], which revealed an ejection fraction of 55-60% with normal wall motion and no visualized valvular defects.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient was maintained on a cardiac diet and his electrolytes especially potassium and magnesium were repleted as needed.
Prophylaxis:  Patient was on a Heparin drip throughout his hospital stay and was eating well without history of gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer disease.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute inferoposterior and lateral non- transmural myocardial infarction.
Pravastatin was discontinued at discharge because of the severe episode of leg weakness on Lipitor.
