Admission Date:  [**2150-4-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-5-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-10-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Hydrocodone / Imipenem/Cilastatin Sodium / Zosyn  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: Transferred for management of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS  History of Present Illness: 64 yo female w PMH of bilat pulm emboli in [**2147**] and in [**1-3**], chronic bronchitis, transfer from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] to [**Hospital1 18**] with VATS confirmed cryptogentic organizing pneun on [**4-23**], with increased FI02 requirments, increased PEEP and concern of developing ARDS.
She initailly presented to OSH on [**4-11**] with c/o SOB/ DOE and treated presumptively for pneumonia.
Repeat x-rays showed increased bilateral infiltrates.
Despite antibiotics and inhalers, she continued to have worsening shortness ofbreath.
The patient continued to do worse with saturations dropping as low as 86% on two liters nasal cannula.
A repeatchest CT scan was done showing interval development of interstitial consolidation and ground glass bilaterally as well as bilateral effusions.
There was no evidence of new pulmonary emboli.
Later that night, she developed hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.
In addition, human immunodeficiency virus and quantitative IgG were checked to rule out immunocompromisedstated.
A bronchoscopy was done, cultures from which remain negative including acid fast bacilli and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
A few days later, steroids wereabruptly discontinued because of concerns of intraabdominal process.
However, over the course of several days, she continued to have bilateral infiltrates and was not responding to antibiotics.
Ultimately, on [**2150-4-22**], the patient underwent VATS: notable for an nflammatory process and negative for an infectious process.
Currently, she is requiringincreasing amounts and PEEP and chest x-rays show bilateral infiltrates onsistent with bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia,interstitial process, or adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Today, it was noted that she developed a rash to Imipenum dose at 1:00am and at 6:00am.

MODERATE GROWTH.
There are diffuse bilateral patchy alveolar opacities.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
There is no pleural effusion.
Degenerative changes with scoliotic curvature of the spine are noted.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities with an appearance consistent with ARDS.
A nonspecific bowel gas pattern is noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with a history of pulmonary embolus, who was transfered from an OSH after VATS confirmed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP).
Initially, her respiratory failure was thought to be related to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP).
However, it was likely multifactorial due to a component of pneumonia and CHF as well.
She was eventually found to have a MRSA pneumonia and empyema for which antibiotics and chest tube placed for treatment.
She was continued on assist control mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
Eventually, it was clear that she would not be able to wean from the ventilator due to her deompensated respiratory status.
