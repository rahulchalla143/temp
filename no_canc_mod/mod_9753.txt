Admission Date:  [**2181-7-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-8-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-1-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization with Drug Eluting Stent placement to distal RCA.
History of Present Illness: 53yoM with h/o CAD (s/p DES to D1 after anterior MI in '[**72**]), HTN, [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with inferior STEMI - now s/p DES to distal RCA.
The patient reports that he was in his USOH until the last 6-7 days when he began having CP - at first was fleeting and over last 2-3 days only relieved by SL nitro.
He took ~ 20 SL nitro without relief and then called 911.
At [**Hospital3 7569**], EKG showed large STE inferiorly - BP on arrival was 146/98.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient went straight to the cath lab, which revealed no flow-limiting disease in LMCA, LAD with diffuse disease, previous diagonal stent with 50-60% ISR, OM1/OM2 with 60-70% stenosis, and total occlusion in the distal RCA.
He denies recent illness.
Exam significant for multiple circular excoriated lesions on his arms and legs, CV exam with RR, no murmurs, good distal pulses.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Major depression Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Asthma (not on meds) PUD Obesity   Social History: Works in computer repair.
Never married, no children.
MaGpa had MI in 60s.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was without significant disease.
The LAD had diffuse non-obstructive disease with distal 50-60% instent restenosis of the diagonal stent.
The LCx had 70% stenosis of the origin of OM1 and 70% stenosis of the mid OM2.
The RCA had a distal total occlusion.
There is moderate systemic arterial hypertension with central aortic pressure 161/100 with a mean of 99 mmHg.
Three vessel CAD with culprit distal RCA total occlusion 2.
R 6Fr femoral artery Angioseal closure device deployed without complications .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral and distal anterior hypokinesis (multivessel CAD).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, most c/w multivessel CAD.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old male with CAD (s/p DES to D1 after anterior MI in '[**72**]), HTN, [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with inferior STEMI - s/p DES to distal RCA.
EKG there showed inferior STE.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath, which showed distal RCA occlusion as well as 3VD.
He was counseled about the importance of aspirin after he voiced concern about GI side effects.
Ranitidine was started to prevent GI upset.
His depression and anxiety has caused severe isolation, inability to work and care for himself.
No abnormal rhythm on telemetry.
8. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
10. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis - Acute Myocardial Infarction secondary to instent thrombosis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain and were found to have a heart attack.
You underwent a cardiac catheeterization that revealed a clot and a stent was placed.
