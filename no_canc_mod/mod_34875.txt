# Syncope: New onset sinus bradycardia.
Likely related to increased vagal tone from recent SDH + sinus bradycardia related to Dilantin.
No structural heart disease (had TTE w/ EF of >55%, no LV dysfunction or aortic stenosis, no septal defects or vegetations), no ischemia (EKG w/o any evidence of this, all cardiac enzymes were negative), ingestions of medications, (pts serum Benzo positive).
Less likely seizure given no incontinence/post-ictal period/therapeutic dilantin levels.
Patient has no carotid bruits on exam.
TIA and seizure were considered less likely on the differential, so Carotid doppler U/S and EEG were deferred and can be done on an outpatient basis.
Due to continued bradycardia w/ symptomaticity (hypotension), and a rpt Head CT on 7.25 showing increased midline shift, he was taken to the OR on 7.25 for SDH evacuation and given a pacer.
Pts bradycardia subsequently improved and temporary pacer was removed [**2170-8-13**].
He had no more symptomatic bradycardic events before discharge.
# Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia w/o evidence of AVB; likely due to increased vagal tone in setting of SDH.
Dilantin level was therapeutic at time of admission and albumin was WNL, but this medication can still cause sinus bradycardia even when not at toxic levels.
Hypothyroidism was unlikely given his TSH was normal.
The patient was sent to the floor, and proceeded to have bradycardia to the 20s while he slept, responsive to atropine.
Following this, he was found to be bradycardic and symptomatic (hypotensive) requiring a dopamine gtt to increase heart rate.
# MS changes: Unclear if this patient truly has any MS changes; per notes, there was a question of a personality change; however exam unrevealing.
# SDH/HA: His SDH from [**2170-8-1**] fall was stable in size from previous admission, with a minimal midline shift only slightly increased from admission per Head CT. Pts phenytoin level 14.9 on admisison.
Neurosurgery evaluated pt in ED and felt SDH stable and its undergoing chronification process that can cause minimal increased in mass effect but currently w/o symptoms except for headache.
Dilantin was changed to Keppra (see above), and patient was given Tylenol and Codeine (low dose and as needed to prevent increased bradycardia) for chronic headache likely related to SDH.
# Leukocytosis: Predominant lymphocytosis (WBC 13) more c/w viral etiology/stress response.
He was afebrile during his hospital course.
No source of infection at this time.
His CXR showed no evidence of PNA, and urine analysis was negative.
He remained afebrile on the floor.
#[**Name (NI) **] Pt was mildly hypertensive in the ED, and received Hydralazine.
he was subsequently hypotensive and orthostatic.
HA did not change in character, and was classified as dull, L sided, constant, nonphotophobic and without N/V and neurological symptoms.
# Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no ASA or heparin SC given recent SDH).
No PPI or bowel reg necessary.
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sinus Bradycardia Subdural Hematoma   Discharge Condition: good, normal vital signs   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] with the diagnosis of bradycardia (low heart rate.)
This is likely related to the initiation of the anti-seizure drug Dilantin, which can sometimes cause low heart rates, and your nervous sytem reaction to the recent subdural hematoma (head bleed).
Your head bleed is stable on imaging, but was causing some increased brain swelling and continued low heart rate, so you underwent an drainage of the bleed.
The Dilantin was changed over to another medication called Keppra which does not have the same heart slowing effects.
Please return to the nearest ED or contact your primary care physician if you experience another fall where you injure your head or another part of your body, dizziness, loss of consciousness/blackouts, palpitations, chest pain, or any other symptoms not listed here that are concerning to you.
You should have your PCP contact the [**Hospital1 18**] microbiology laboratory at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 20850**] to follow up on the results of the tests for Lyme disease that were still pending at the time of your discharge.
Please follow up with the neurosurgeons who treated you for your subdural hematoma.
