Admission Date:  [**2100-7-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2100-7-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-7-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] GI bleeding.
History of Present Illness: 45 year old man with UC, status post total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis with persistent diarrhea who presented to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital with 4 days of loose stools, fatigue, lightheadedness with stools turning to bloody 2 days prior to admission ([**2100-7-26**]).
On [**7-27**] he had an EGD which showed normal esophagus, stomach and duodenum and then underwent a Pouchoscopy/enetorscopy which showed large amount of fresh bright blood with blold clots, including J pouch and throughout the entire small bowel examined (~ 70cm).
On the floor, he is without of lightheadedness, but has no other symptoms.
He denies recent changes in BM frequency or character until presentation.
No abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, cramping or tenesmus.
No fevers, chills, malaise or weight loss.
Denies recent CP, but reports shortness of breath for 1 year, which comes and goes, currently reporting mild sx intensity.
No infectious symptoms, no arthralgias or myalgias.
No rashes or skin changes.
He has been off all medications for ~ 2 years, as "nothing has worked" for his loose stools.
Of note, ~ 1 month ago, had severe constipation and required an endocsopic treatment to relieve this.
Has not had bloody stools or melanotic stools since that time.
Past Medical History: Ulcerative colitis - [**7-/2094**] - Ileoanal pouch w/ ileostomy - [**10/2094**] - Laparotomy, resection of small bowel including ileostomy, reanastomosis and dilatation of the anorectal stricture - Aortic valve stenosis, mild per outside hospital records, no documentation at [**Hospital1 18**].
Family History: - Prostate and stomach cancer - brother - Breast cancer - sister - Ulcerative colitis - brother.
- No bleeding diseases - Brother with coronary artery disease died in 60s - Uncle died of myocardial infarction at 45 - No h/o sudden cardiac deaths or arryhthmia  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97F BP: 135/57 P:90s R: 22 O2: 95%RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera pale, dMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, flat JVP Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally CV: RR, normal S1 + S2, [**3-27**] syst.
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, dry, 2+ pulses, no edema NEURO: A/Ox3, DOWb intact, frontal function intact.
No CT evidence of active extravasation of contrast.
Most of small bowel is collapsed, without obstruction.
No evidence of surgical complication at the anastomosis.
No free fluid or air.
[**2100-7-28**] : Transthoracic Echo: IMPRESSION: hyperdynamic left ventricle with severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet; no vegetations seen .
No evidence of acute gastrointestinal bleed in this study.
The degree of rightward displacement of the mid and lower trachea and length of trachea displaced that lies above the aortic arch is more than I would expect from the aortic arch alone.
This raises the possibility of mass effect from adjacent goiter or adenopathy, less likely from an esophageal lesion.
There is no appreciable pleural abnormality or indication of pneumothorax.
[**2100-7-29**] CXR: Tracheal contour has returned to baseline with no evidence of mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: 45 year old man with UC, status post total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis with persistent diarrhea who presented to outside hospital with loose bloody stools, was found to have hemorrhage in the small bowel with a normal EGD, status post 7 units pRBCs and with out improvement in HCTs.
Etiology unclear: may be secondary to an arteriovenous malformation, or to a mechanical injury from previous endoscopy (although no intermittant bleeding) or from a leaky anastamosis.
?t expect involvement of the small bowel, although there is a question of underlying crohns.
Patient reports recent NSAID use, however not significant amount ingested, but a bleeding ulcer was not completely ruled out.
?A on admission demonstrated no active bleeding.
On HD2 the patient began actively bleeding with several episodes of [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] bloody diarrhea ~200 ccs per episode.
On HD3 after another episode of [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] GI bleed, a repeat CT-A demonstrated again no active bleed - 2 more units of pRBC were transfused after a Hct drop below 30.
An upper and lower endoscopy on HD 2 revealed mild duodenitis, old blood, some mild ulcerations of small bowel and mild proctitis.
No source of bleeding was identified.
The upper GI tract was visualized to the middle of the ileum and all appeared normal with no sign of active or prior bleed.
The patient was scheduled for an outpatient swallow endoscopy with GI, and observed for 24 more hours for active bleeding and Hct drops below 30.
# Moderate Resting Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction: The patient presented with a systolic murmor thought to be a high flow murmur.
An echo from an outside hosptial in [**12/2099**] reported a normal LV systolic function with high velocity flow consistent with mild aortic stenosis or high cardiac output and mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
A transthoracic echo on HD 3--requested to investigate the patient's dyspnea on exertion and possible endocarditis with emboli to bowel--reported severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet; no vegetations seen.
Recommendations for future management, given the patient's symptoms at baseline and the physical nature of his work, included the addition of a betablocker or verapamil when stable from a bleeding perspective.
ESR of 3 and CRP of 3.1 not concerning for active UC flare.
# Anxiety.
Wellbutrin was held secondary to patient's unstable Hct on hematocrit.
No signs of active bleeding, benign abdominal examination.
Cardiac exam notable for III/VI holosystolic murmur loudest at 2 LICS and lightheadedness with ambulation.
Your bleeding from stool has stopped but you are still at a very high risk of bleeding.
It was felt that your bleeding may have been due to a small injured blood vessel or an ulcer that had healed (you were on ibuprofen which increases risk of bleeding).
You were discharged home with instructions to return to the hospital if you have bloody stools again.
In addition, you were found to have a heart murmur and outflow obstruction from your ventricle.
This was felt to be due to an abnormal valve in  your heart.
[**Name2 (NI) **] will need to be on a medication for your heart, once your bleeding problem has resolved.
Should you develop any of the symptoms listed below, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
