The patient had multiple sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief of pain and presented to outside hospital three days prior to admission, was placed on heparin and Integrilin, Nitroglycerin drip, aspirin, beta blocker, with relief of pain.
The patient also had relief of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for elective coronary artery bypass graft.
On hospital day number two, he developed abdominal pain and was given Maalox with minimal relief.
He had the onset of mild chest pain.
An ECG done at that time showed precordial Q waves with poor R wave progression suggestive of old anterior infarction with ST elevations in V1 through V3, minimally changed compared to previous electrocardiograms, but with flipped T's in I and AVL.
The patient was taken emergently to Cardiac catheterization which revealed a left dominant system with a calcified left main coronary artery, left anterior descending occluded to left main, left circumflex with diffuse disease, with 70% lesions at the obtuse marginal to patent ductus arteriosus and right coronary artery occluded.
Of note, the patient is a Jehovah's Witness who strongly refuses blood products.
Currently, at the time of admission, the patient was experiencing mild abdominal pain, three out of ten, and minimal chest pain, one out of ten, with no radiation.
Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease as documented above.
Previous history of transient ischemic attacks for which the patient is on Coumadin.
ALLERGIES:   The patient is allergic to penicillin and statins.
SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient's social history is remarkable for, as mentioned above, the patient is a Jehovah's Witness with strong belief that prevents him from receiving blood products.
He lives with his mother and has no smoking.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history is positive for both father and mother with coronary artery disease in their seventies.
Generally, the patient was alert and oriented, comfortable, in no apparent distress.
The patient had no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had a regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs were appreciated.
Abdomen was obese, soft, with mild diffuse tenderness and normoactive bowel sounds.
He had Doppler-able dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
The site of his balloon pump was without ecchymosis or oozing.
EKG post-catheterization showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90, normal QRS axis, and question of left atrial enlargement, Q waves in V1 through V3.
ST segment elevations V1 through V3 with T wave inversions in I and AVL.
In short, this is a 52 gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors and known three-vessel disease presenting with breakthrough pain while on nitrates and heparin drip awaiting elective coronary artery bypass graft.
Cardiovascular:  Coronary artery disease - The patient was maintained on aspirin.
Plavix held secondary to increased risk of bleeding with potential for surgery in the near future.
The patient had recurrent chest pain requiring intra-aortic balloon pump and Nitroglycerin drip.
Initially, it was felt that the patient would go to coronary artery bypass graft within the next few days following admission, but due to the patient's falling hematocrit and strong desire not to receive blood products, CT Surgery declined to intervene on him surgically at this time.
Thus, the patient was maintained on a balloon pump and nitrates until such time as he could be taken to Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, where he underwent successful percutaneous intervention with rotational atherectomy to his l eft anterior descending and stents times two to his left anterior descending with no residual stenosis.
Following catheterization intervention, the patient was able to be weaned from the balloon pump and nitrates and was pain free at the time of discharge on a long-acting nitrate.
Shortly prior to acticipated discharge, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated.
Pump:  The patient had poor ejection fraction secondary to ongoing ischemia.
Rhythm:  The patient had no acute rhythmic issues during the course of his stay on Telemetry prior to his arrest.
Hematology:  The patient had a baseline anemia on admission of unclear etiology.
He refused transfusion secondary to religious beliefs.
Endocrine:  The patient was a known diabetic and was maintained on Regular insulin sliding scale during the course of his admission.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had multiple episodes of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, associated with eating, occurring about 30 minutes after eating.
The pain was colicky in nature.
No source of infection was localized, nevertheless, it was decided to treat the patient with Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
Coronary artery disease with unstable angina.
Diabetes mellitus.
