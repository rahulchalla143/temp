The patient was found to have a C2 fracture and transferred to [**Hospital6 256**].
There is no related history of neurodeficit prior to transfer.
After transfer, the patient remained hemodynamically stable with no neurologic deficits, also continuing to complain of neck pain.
The patient straight caths three times daily for ineffective bladder movement.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Trachea midline.
Rectal - slightly decreased tone.
No gross blood.
Back nontender, no stepoffs, no injuries.
No extremity deformities.
No focal deficits.
RADIOLOGY:  A chest x-ray showed a widened mediastinum with a blurring of the aortic knob.
No pneumothorax.
Pelvis - no fractures.
Head CT showed no fracture, no bleed.
The chest CTA was negative for great vessel injury, or other mediastinal abnormalities.
The C-spine CT showed a type 3 C2 or dens fracture that was unstable.
The TLS x-ray showed no fracture.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, we attempted to place a Foley and had difficulty placing the Foley due to what was considered to be urethral strictures most likely attributed to the patient having a neobladder and self-cathing three times a day.
A urology consult was obtained for this problem, and the results of the urology consult were that no acute dilation needed to be done, but the patient would follow-up with his normal urologist for any further recommendations for management.
First, they recommended obtaining a four-vessel angiography to rule out any paravertebral vessel injury.
This study was obtained on hospital day #1 and was normal with no signs of any vessel injury.
The MRI of the C-spine demonstrated increased signal intensity within the C1-2 facet joints possibly secondary to traumatic injury, some neural foraminal injury at C3-C4, but no signs of injury to the spinal cord.
There were also no acute disk or ligament changes within the C-spine.
There were no complications throughout placement of the halo.
