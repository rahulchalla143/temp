Admission Date:  [**2162-3-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2162-3-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2162-3-17**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Neonatology  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 34 and 2/7 weeks, 12 day old female, delivered preterm, secondary to bleeding in the setting of placenta previa.
She was admitted with pallor and mild respiratory distress.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Premature female, who was pale with mild increased work of breathing.
There is mild to moderate intercostal and substernal retractions.
Skin is pale with slow capillary refill.
Initial impression is that of a 34+ week, appropriate for gestational age female, delivered prematurely, secondary to placental indications (previa with bleeding).
She now has tachycardia, pallor, poor perfusion and mild respiratory distress.
Her cardiovascular symptoms are likely secondary to blood loss at the time of delivery or shunting of blood flow from the skin to vital organs.
Her mild respiratory symptoms are likely due to transitional physiology; however, surfactant deficiency or sepsis pneumonia (though no perinatal risk factors for sepsis) cannot be ruled out.
She is at risk for other complications of prematurity, including apnea of prematurity, suck swallow discoordination, hyperbilirubinemia and hypothermia.
If her respiratory symptoms persist or worsen, we will obtain chest x-ray, arterial blood gas and support as indicated.
The infant had transient tachypnea of a newborn with a CPAP requirement for approximately nine hours.
On day of life #5, she demonstrated desaturations with her car seat test and subsequently had desaturations at rest, leading to the diagnosis of an immature breathing pattern.
Gastrointestinal:  She had physiologic jaundice with a peak bilirubin of 12.1 total, 0.3 direct.
She has required no transfusions.
She completed a 48 hour rule out sepsis on Ampicillin and Gentamycin.
There are no issues.
With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Sepsis ruled out.
