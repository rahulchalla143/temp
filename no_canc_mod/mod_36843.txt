Pain episodes would eventually resolve without intervention.
Repeat EKGs showed no change from admission, and no new ischemia/infarction.
The pain was reproducible on physical exam at the lower edge of xiphoid and epigastric region and responded to Maalox and it was felt that these complaints were large GI related vs. cardiac.
