HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old African-American male with a history of hypertension who was in his usual state of health until about 10:25 a.m. on the morning of admission.
He had gone to use the restroom and a few minutes later his family found him slumped onto the floor, apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his right arm and leg.
The patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms.
He has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac symptoms.
The patient was unable to talk for examination and no family members were present at the bedside and were not at home (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
HEENT:  The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.
There was no evidence of neglect.
Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.
There were T wave inversions in I, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.
CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55 by 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to the right.
NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed secondary to presumed hypertension.
Considerations for a CTA and angiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but the patient's renal function and health status did not allow such studies to be done at the current time.
Repeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in the bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral edema with some pressure onto the brain stem.
However, he began to not move any extremities and not respond to any noxious stimuli in the four extremities.
By 4:00 p.m. on [**2149-11-13**], his neurological condition deteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and nonreactive.
Calorics were done at this time which revealed no response.
However, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54029**] at the [**Hospital3 **] Stroke Service said that the patient would not be accepted at the [**Hospital3 **] given that there would be no other intervention that would be done differently at [**Hospital3 **].
Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and found to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a myocardial infarction.
He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia on the chest x-ray.
He was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.
Vancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization due to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.
The patient did have one or two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials and increased secretion in his nostrils.
RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.
A renal ultrasound was done which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration pneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and Flagyl were started on the day of admission.
He had some high residuals so the tube feeds were stopped.
It was felt that this was due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was then fluid restricted.
Although he has acute renal failure secondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that he needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall hyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.
