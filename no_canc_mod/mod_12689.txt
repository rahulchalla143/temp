HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55-year-old gentleman with a history of hyperlipidemia who was transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] for evaluation of chest pain with electrocardiogram changes.
The patient was in his usual state of health until in the morning of [**2170-3-11**] when he awoke with severe substernal chest pain across his chest bilaterally with radiation to both arms.
He also complained of severe diaphoresis; however, he denied shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting.
He took aspirin and Mylanta which resolved the pain in approximately one hour.
This pain recurred again the next night while sleeping.
He went to his primary care physician's office where an electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in the inferior leads.
The patient currently denies any complaints with no recurrence of the chest pain or shortness of breath.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of coronary artery disease.
Neck revealed he had no jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.
He had a small umbilical hernia.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
He had no focal neurologic findings.
He had poor R wave progression with Q waves in leads V3 and aVF.
He had 1-mm ST elevations in II, III, and aVF with slight ST elevations in V4 through V3.
He had T wave inversions in leads II, III, and F, along with V3 through V6.
He had no ST elevations in leads V4R.
His left circumflex had mild-to-moderate disease.
His post catheterization course was complicated by cardiogenic shock.
He was transferred back to the Coronary Care Unit post catheterization requiring dopamine and dobutamine drips as well as a intra-aortic balloon pump; all for cardiogenic shock.
An echocardiogram was obtained which revealed that his left atrium was mildly dilated.
He had mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There were regional resting wall motion abnormalities including intraseptal and inferior akinesis with diffuse hypokinesis with a basal, inferior aneurysm, and apical dyskinesis.
The right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal, and there was moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation, and no evidence of pericardial effusion.
Because the patient had multiple runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia coupled with an extremely low ejection fraction, the electrophysiology team was consulted for a possible implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
In the Electrophysiology Laboratory, the patient was positive for inducible ventricular tachycardia.
Due to a question of urinary tract infection, he was started on levofloxacin, and his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was successfully implanted the next day.
A chest x-ray the next day confirmed proper lead positioning, and the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was also interrogated with no signs of any malfunction.
for chest pain.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:   Return to the Emergency Room if you develop any worsening shortness of breath or return of any chest pain.
Coronary artery disease, status post large anterior myocardial infarction with stent placement to left anterior descending artery.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, status post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
