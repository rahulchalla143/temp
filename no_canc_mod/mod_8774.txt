Admission Date:  [**2190-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-10-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-7-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Paxil / Benadryl / Buspar / Levaquin / Adhesive Tape  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion s/p SVT ablation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: electrophysiology study with incomplete ablation   History of Present Illness: 66-year-old lady with history of breast and bladder cancers was admitted for elective EPS with ablation for SVT.
She first noted palpitations approximately 16 years ago in the setting of high emotional distress when her son was killed while in the service.
Since then, she has had palpitations in the setting of chemotherapy, and over the past years has had no more than [**3-2**] episodes per year.
The tracings of the tachycardia were reviewed by her Electrophysiologist, Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], and thought be a narrow complex tachycardia at 150 beats/minute with an RP interval of 100-120 msec.
However, immediately post adenosine, there was evidence of sinus rhythm with a fully pre-excited QRS complex consistent with a left lateral bypass tract.
During the procedure she developed hypotension to SBP of 77 mm HG.
Focal views of TTE showed noncircumferential pericardial effusion with mild RA collapse without RV collapse.
PA catheterization showed preserved CO, no equalization of filling pressures, and preserved Y descent on RA tracing.
On arrival patient complained of stable pleuritic chest pain which she had since the cath lab.
She denied any shortness of breath.
No other complaints.

Family History: Unremarkable for any cardiac disease .
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
CTAB in anterior lung fields, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis.
ECG:  [**2190-10-8**] at 7:23 AM NSR, rate in 70s, nl axis, early R wave transition in precordial leads, no acute ST-T changes compared to .
No acute ST-T wave changes.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion primarily around the right atrium and right ventricle with minimal around the apex and inferolateral wall.
There is mild right ventricular diastolic collapse.
IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate loculated anterior pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence for increased pericardial pressure.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Difficulty crossing AV.
Ablation procedure was incomplete given hypotension as above.
No retroperitoneal bleed.
Mild to moderate sized pericardial effusion with indeterminate density measurements suggesting proteinaceous fluid or blood.
No obvious right atrial compression.
No large hematoma at right femoral entry site.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 y/o lady with history of SVT now with pericardial effusion s/p attempted EP ablation.
# Pericardial Effusion/PUMP: Patient was found to have a 1.4 cm anterior pericardial effusion after she became hypotensive during SVT ablation procedure on [**2190-10-8**].
TTE also showed mild RA collapse without any RV collapse.
Emergently, patient received a right heart cath that was consistent with a non-hemodynamically signicant effusion w/o tamponade physiology, so pericardiocentesis was not felt to be indicated.
(Cardiac output was preserved and there was no equalization of filling pressures.)
Swan-ganz was initially left in place to monitor for development of tamponade physiology.
Her blood pressure remained stable over the next 24 hours, and a repeat TTE on [**10-9**] did not show worsening of the pericardial effusion.
Chest pain secondary to the pericardial effusion was well-controlled with Toradol and patient was discharged on ibuprofen prn for pain.
# RHYTHM:  Prior to admission, SVT was thought be a narrow complex tachycardia at 150 beats/minute with an RP interval of 100-120 msec.
However, immediately post adenosine, there was evidence of sinus rhythm with a fully pre-excited QRS complex consistent with a left lateral bypass tract.
The ablation procedure was incomplete given hypotension as above.
# CORONARIES:  Patient has no known CAD.
Chest pain while inpatient was pleuritic in nature and attributed to hemopericardium.
# Extensive groin manipulation:  Due to extensive groin manipulation during cardiac procedures on [**2190-10-8**], patient was monitored closely for evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
In the cath lab, heparin was reversed with protamine, post cath checks were unremarkable, and a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was negative for a retroperitoneal bleed.
#  H/o breast CA and papillary bladder CA:  Stable.
PROPHYLAXIS:  SCD's were used for DVT prophylaxis.
