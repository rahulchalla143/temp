Admission Date:  [**2157-7-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2157-7-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-12-11**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CORONARY CRITICAL CARE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45-year-old man who reports that he had had progressive shortness of breath and occasional chest pain for the past several years, especially with exertion.
The patient was admitted in [**Month (only) 404**] of last year, ruled out for myocardial infarction but was diagnosed with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy after transesophageal echocardiogram showed dynamic outflow obstruction with a peak gradient of 32.
The initial septal artery was noted to be absent and the second septal artery which had two branches, both of which were injected with ethanol and that resulted in the complete resolution of the gradient even with dobutamine stress in the lab.
The patient was brought to the Coronary Critical Care Unit with 6/10 chest pain, however he had no shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting when he arrived on the unit.
GENERAL:  He is alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress, obese middle aged man.
NECK:  He had no jugular venous distention, elevation while lying flat.
The patient had no thyromegaly.
The patient had no lymphadenopathy.
EXTREMITIES:  He had 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
No thrill, hematoma or bruit over either catheter site.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  A.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient had no known coronary artery disease, however he demonstrated increased LDL on the fasting lipid profile and has a history of hyperlipidemia.
Pump:  The patient's outflow gradient seemed to be decreased based on an echocardiogram done in the catheter lab, but it was not clear if the patient will have clinical improvement.
Serial electrocardiograms showed evidence of a right bundle branch block that was consistent with his prior electrocardiogram, but no other evidence of AV conduction block.
C. Rhythm:  The patient was placed on a prophylactic transvenous pacer due to the high risk of complete heart block with septal ablation.
The patient had no evidence of heart block throughout the hospitalization.
RENAL:  Serial chem-7 showed no adverse effect from the large dye load the patient received in the catheter lab.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION/GASTROINTESTINAL:  No issues.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient spiked a temperature to 104??????
The patient was thought to have spiked a fever as the result of possibly atelectasis or potentially as a symptom of alcohol withdrawal for which he was given Ativan x1, however the patient had no other symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, as he is a binge drinker reporting 12 drinks per week all on the same occasion.
The patient was monitored per the CIWA protocol and the only evidence of withdrawal was the fever.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, status post septal ablation 2.
Hyperlipidemia 3.
