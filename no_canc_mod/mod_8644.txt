Admission Date:  [**2124-11-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-12-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-10-22**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old male with a history of aortic valve replacement for infected endocarditis on [**2124-2-4**], thought to be secondary to lower extremity osteomyelitis, likely Streptococcus organism.
During the stay on Podiatry Service he developed moderate to severe cardiovalvular leak/dehiscence.
The patient also has diabetes whose course is complicated by end stage renal disease on hemodialysis and has been followed by the Renal Service here at [**Hospital6 256**] since [**2124-11-22**], getting dialysis Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Renal notes have noted a I/VI systolic murmur and clear lungs over the hospital course, however, bibasilar crackles have developed and a systolic murmur was noted to have increase on [**11-28**] and a S3 was heard as well on that date.
An echocardiogram was recommended, this echocardiogram on [**2124-11-30**] which was a transthoracic echocardiogram and showed left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 55% with moderate dilated aortic root, question of a partial dehiscence with 3 to 4+ aortic insufficiency ?
abscess, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
This showed partial dehiscence and echolucent cavity 2.4 times 3 cm.
which is felt to be very suspicious for an abscess or an intravalvular fibrosing hematoma.
He has also had swabs that were done from his left foot wound, one swab grew rare coagulase positive Staphylococcus, rare coagulase negative Staphylococcus and rare diphtheroids.
Another one from [**11-21**] grew rare Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus, again out of the left foot.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] Cardiac Care Unit Service on the evening of [**12-1**] secondary to his worsening echocardiogram and worsening lung and cardiac examination.
The patient denied shortness of breath or any chest pain, feeling rundown fatigued or any fevers, chills or rigors.
He also has had the osteomyelitis complicated by left transmetatarsal amputation.
He also has chronic venous stasis.
He has a family history of coronary artery disease.
Jugulovenous distension slightly increased to 9 cm, roughly 4 to 5 cm above the angle of Luie.
Skin shows evidence of a lower extremity venous stasis changes.
There is an early systolic II/VI murmur and a diastolic rumble II/VI.
There are no bruits bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram on [**2124-11-22**], sinus at 89, leftward axis at roughly 50 degrees, PR 16, QTC 478, QRS 156, right bundle branch block with left anterior fascicular block with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
On [**11-21**], wound Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus rare, left foot.
The patient is a 60 year old male with osteomyelitis, status post debridement and left transmetatarsal amputation who has a history of endocarditis, chronic aortic valve replacement, bioprosthetic valve on [**2124-2-2**], also he has diabetes complicated by hemodialysis for end stage renal disease, now has a perivalvular leak, presence of abscess on a transesophageal echocardiogram, left with the assumption that this is endocarditis likely coming from the foot wound in terms of possible source that has lead to the vascular infection.
The patient is already end stage renal disease and anuric, the Gentamicin is modified in terms of renal toxicity.
We are ultimately going to continue Levo and Flagyl for broad coverage, however, at the current time it is obvious that that is the source, most concerning is for Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Transfer the patient to the TCU here for monitoring and attempts to transfer him to [**Hospital1 2177**] electively for evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement.
Aortic insufficiency with valve dehiscence 2.
Diabetes mellitus complicated by end stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Chronic venous stasis.
