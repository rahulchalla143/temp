She states that in [**Month (only) 404**] she had similar epigastric pain and an episode of BRBPR and was hospitalized in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].
She reports having a CT scan which showed diverticulitis vs. proctitis and she was given a course of antibiotics.
She did not have any further episode until 6 days ago when she developed a "contraction"-like pain in her epigastric area which lasted for several hours and then resolved.
She also had an episode of "significant" blood in the toilet bowel and on the outside of her stool.
This resolved that day and she was fine until 3 days ago when she had a similar pain and more BRBPR.
She had nausea and vomiting x 2 days without hematemesis, coffee-ground or bilious emesis.
ROS is positive for lightheadedness, diarrhea x 3 days, and subjective fevers and chills 5 days ago.
Prior to [**Month (only) 404**] she has not had this pain before.
No recent travel except to [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] in [**Month (only) 404**].
She had 1 episode of BRBPR at 7pm.
On the floor, she complains of [**6-4**] epigastric pain associated with shortness of breath.
Family History: Has uncle with [**Name2 (NI) **], grandfather with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and esophageal cancer, aunt with breast cancer.
Father had MI at age 58 and died from massive MI at age 65.
Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly (per ED note, GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Pertinent Results: EGD ([**2108-5-11**]): .
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The efficiency of a colonoscopy in detecting lesions was discussed with the patient and it was pointed out that a small percentage of polyps and other lesions can be missed with the test.
The patient was administered moderate sedation.
There were no complications.
Findings: Protruding Lesions Small internal hemorrhoids with skin tags were noted.
Recommendations: No cause of symptoms found.
BRBPR: Differential initially included lower GI source including IBD, hemorrhoids, AVM vs. upper GI source given epigastric pain, including duodenal ulcer.
Negative NG lavage and lack of melena makes upper GI source less likely.
Unfortunately endoscopy and colonoscopy were unrevealing, save a small patch of gastritis and a few hemorrhoids.
The plan going forward is to continue on a PPI and follow-up with GI for a small bowel capsule study.
Epigastric Pain: likely gastritis and likely unrelated to BRBPR or UGIB.
Phenergan 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for nausea for 3 days.
Percocet 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 3 days.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after an episode of GI bleeding.
You underwent endoscopy and colonoscopy which revealed hemorrhoids, gastritis, possibly something called "barrett's esophagus" which is a change in esophagus from acid in the stomach.
It was not clear that this could have caused all of your bleeding and as such the gastroenterologists would like you to follow-up with them for a "capsule" study.
The following changes were made to your medications: You were started on 40mg of omeprazole twice per day Please take phenergan as needed for nausea You will be given three day supply of percocet for pain control  Followup Instructions: Department: DIV.
