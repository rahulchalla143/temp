The patient has suffered with seizures for many years.
He has been tried on numerous medications, which have significantly reduced the incidence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but his complex partial seizures continue to be bothersome.
At that time, it was unclear if there was a unilateral focus and we discussed extensively whether or not to proceed with invasive monitoring or simply to approach the right temporal cavernous malformation, which was discovered on his MRI.

Family History: No family history of seizures or other neurological disorders.
There is no upper extremity drift.
Evaluation of residual cavernoma is limited due to postoperative changes in that area in the right temporal lobe.
Suggest repeat study in four weeks to rule out any residual tumor after postoperative changes have resolved.
No evidence of acute infarction or extensive hemorrhage   Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted through the same day surgery department for elective removal of his right temporal cavernoma.
