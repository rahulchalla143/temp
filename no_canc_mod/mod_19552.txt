Admission Date:  [**2201-6-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2201-6-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-1-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**] Chief Complaint: Elective Admission for Spinal Surgery   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: elective spinal fusion of T11-S1 with L3 osteotomy   History of Present Illness: 70 y/o female with a h/o HTN, Raynaud's, and scoliosis s/p multiple surgeries, who is transferred to medicine following elective spinal fusion of T11-S1 with L3 osteotomy, complicated by pulmonary embolism with hypotension and flash pulmonary edema.
Postoperatively, the patient initially developed hypotension requiring transient pressor support and peri-operative blood loss requiring a total of 6 units of PRBCs.
However, on [**6-22**], she again triggered for hypotension to 70/40.
She was also noted to have elevated creatinine to 2.6 from a recent baseline of 1.5, but a prior baseline of 0.9-1.1.
She was also bolused several liters for low UOP with no improvement in her blood pressure.
The patient underwent EKG that showed S1Q3T3 pattern with right heart strain.
She underwent echo that showed a dilated globally hypokinetic right ventricle, new moderate pulmonary hypertension, and moderate TR.
With persistent hypotension the patient then underwent V/Q scan that showed pulmonary embolism.
She currently complains of some wheezing and lower extremity edema.
She is otherwise without pain and states that she shooting pain down her legs, with which she first presented, has resolved.

IMAGING: CXR ([**6-21**]) - Small left pleural effusion and new left infrahilar consolidation are most readily explained by atelectasis, but there is no way to exclude pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
Bibasal atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged.
No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
ECHO [**6-22**] There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis and apical sparing (+ Mconnells sign for acute pulmonary embolism).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ECHO [**6-23**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-6-22**], the appearance of mitral regurgitation is increased, but may be so due to technical factors.
The left ventricular ejection fraction is reduced, most likely as a result of ventricular interaction with a pressure and volume overloaded right ventricle.
V/Q SCAN [**2201-6-23**]: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate subsegmental defects in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show several subsegmental defects in the right lower lobe  and left lower lobe which match, along with several subsegmental defects in the right and left upper lobes which do not match.
Chest x-ray shows small left pleural effusion and left infrahilar consolidation .
The above findings are consistent with a moderate likelihood of pulmonary embolism.
Large right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions have decreased.
There is mild vascular congestion.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old woman with history of HTN, Raynaud's, and scoliosis s/p multiple surgeries, initially admitted for elective spinal fusion of T11-S1 with L3 osteotomy, admitted to the MICU with hypotension, found to have a PE, complicated by right heart strain and flash pulmonary edema; now improved.
#Spinal fusion of T11-S1 with L3 osteotomy:  Patient admitted for spinal fusion with osteotomy for symptomatic scoliosis with sicatica.
Surgical site remained C/D/I and patient without evidence of hematoma.
The patient was maintained on oxycontin, oxycodone, gabapentin, and cyclobenzaprine for pain control.
#Pulmonary embolism -  Patient with large pulmonary embolism, provoked by spinal surgery.
At onset, pulmonary embolism caused hypotension with right heart strain as seen on EKG and ECHO.
Lovenox contraindicated in this patient given history of spinal surgery.
The patient should undergo transthoracic echo in 6 weeks to follow up cardiac function with resolution of pulmonary embolism.
#Flash pulmonary edema/acute right heart failure -  Due to large volume of fluids and blood administered for hypotension in the setting of massive PE.
LVEF 55% on most recent TTE, however now with right heart strain.
The patient was diuresed with IV lasix following episode of flash pulmonary edema, and volume status improved.
Patient continues to have lower extremity edema and JVD to 1 cm below jaw, requiring further diuresis on discharge.
#[**Last Name (un) **] - During admission, creatinine peaked at 2.7 in the setting of right heart failure.
[**Last Name (un) **] prerenal due to poor forward flow based on urine lytes.
Likely also a componenet of ATN given episodes of hypotension.
Creatinine returned to baseline with diuresis from lasix, and possibly post-ATN autodiuresis.
#Hyponatremia - Sodium decreased from 135 to 126 in the setting of volume overload, consistent with hypervolemic hyponatremia.
#HTN - Home antihypertensives held in the setting of hypotension from PE.
# Multiple blood cultures pending at discharge  Medications on Admission: Home Medications: Gabapentin 300mg QHS Flexeril 5mg prn (takes ~weekly) Metoprolol 25mg daily Diovan HCTZ Oral 160 mg-12.5 mg daily Allopurinol 100 daily folic acid 800mcg daily zyrtec 10mg daily Calcium, Vit D, fish oil, glucosamine, flaxseed daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
