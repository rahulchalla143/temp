Fetal decelerations were noted in an office visit on day of delivery, prompting admission and eventual c-section delivery.
No sepsis risk factors were identified at the time of delivery, although meconium-stained amniotic fluid was noted; infant emerged vigorous with Apgars [**9-5**].
Of note, placental pathology later revealed a very small placenta with changes suggestive of chronic utero-placental insufficiency.
GI:  Positive bowel sounds, abdomen soft and round.
A small reducible umbilical hernia.
No click or clunk of exam.
There were no episodes of apnea or bradycardia.
No murmurs audible.
Intermittent hypoglycemia with occasional Dstiks in the 30s and 40s persisted, however, despite advancement of calories and addition of polycose to enteral feeds, to maximum of enfamil 28 calories/oz.
Total oral intake remained adequate, and throughout, infant remained largely asymptomatic.
Although overall gradual improvement in blood sugars was noted, with the majority of values being well in the normal range, the persistence of occasional hypoglycemia eventually prompted consultation with the endocrinology and then the metabolism services.
Extensive laboratory evaluations were performed during hypoglycemic periods, with the results largely normal as follows:  - Blood gas normal x 2:  7.40/37, 7.39/32; - Initial lytes normal on [**12-26**]: 139/4.2/106/22, repeat on [**1-8**] with mild metabolic acidosis: 137/4.6/108/15 (not repeated); - Cortisol normal (9); - Growth hormone normal; - Insulin level appropriately low x3 (all values <2 uiu/mL); - Lactate mildly elevated x3:  3.6, 3.9, 4.4 mmol/L, last specimen arterial on [**1-8**]; - Pyruvate normal (0.36); - Ammonia normal (44 mmol/L); - Urine ketones negative x2; - Urine organic acids normal except for elevated 3-hydroxypropionic acid, thought to be insignificant; - Serum amino acid profile with several low values but overall thought to be normal; - Plasma acylcarnitine profile, normal; - Thyroid function tests, normal (TSH 3.8); - Newborn screen metabolic panel, normal x 2.
With an otherwise unremarkable metabolic evaluation, the metabolism service (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3646**]) did not find the mildly elevated lactate levels to be suggestive of a primary metabolic diagnosis or etiology to the hypoglycemia; this finding will be followed as an outpatient.
With the relatively unremarkable endocrinology evaluation, the hypoglycemia was initially thought to be due to persistent difficulties with reduced stores and high metabolic needs due to the growth-restricted condition of the infant.
Increased irritability and discomfort with feeds was also noted during this time, and was thought to be due to reflux.
With persistent hypoglycemia, the diagnosis of hyperinsulinism was reconsidered despite the repeated low insulin levels.
The diagnosis of hyperinsulinism was thought to be unlikely, although it was thought that repeating the tests, including insulin level, glucagon challenge, and free fatty acids, might be valuable should hypoglycemia persist.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The infant did develop moderate indirect hyperbilirubinemia, requiring several days of phototherapy with improvement.
LFTs were measured on several occasions, and were within normal limits; last were on [**1-8**], with ALT 18, AST 47, and Alk Phos mildly elevated at 506.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  CBC and blood cultures were screened on admission to the NICU due to hypoglycemia and hypothermia.
Urine for CMV was sent on day of life 2 and this was negative.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends      initial vaccination of preterm infants at or following      discharge from the hospital if they are clinically      stable and at least 6 weeks and fewer than 12 weeks of      age.
Presumed diagnosis is hypoglycemia due to growth restriction, and at this time, infant appears stable on Enfamil AR 24 cals/oz (with 2 cals/oz corn oil), being fed every three hours.
A glucagon emergency kit has also been provided.
Family knows to call pediatrician and/or endocrinology fellow on-call (CH, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 53567**]) with low blood sugars.
Sepsis ruled out.
