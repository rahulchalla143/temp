Syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
Status post dilatation and evacuation of an intrauterine pregnancy at approximately six weeks gestation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 28 year old Peruvian woman who was sent to the Emergency Room from the gynecology clinic after presenting there with persistent and worsening abdominal pain since [**2187-11-14**].
She was taken to the Operating Room that day for a diagnostic laparoscopy because of the concern for an ectopic pregnancy given that no intrauterine pregnancy was seen on ultrasound on that day.
The laparoscopy showed a left corpus luteal cyst, right posterior pelvic endometriosis, no ectopic pregnancy, and a normal appendix.
At the time of her gynecology visit, the patient was noted to have continued and more severe abdominal pain and, thus, was sent to the Emergency Room that evening for further evaluation.
The patient also reported, at that time, about ten days of nausea with minimal oral intake.
The patient described her pain as being predominantly in the lower abdomen and lower back with occasional radiation of the pain to her bilateral thighs.
She also complained of constipation and lightheadedness.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Extraocular movements intact, right pupil 7 mm contracting down to 3 mm to light, left pupil contracting down to 2 mm, no lymphadenopathy.
Abdomen:  Normal active bowel sounds, left lower quadrant tenderness and a 4 x 3 cm area of ecchymosis in the infraumbilical region consistent with the site of recent laparoscopy, no peritoneal signs, suprapubic and umbilical port incision sites clean, dry and intact with no drainage.
Pelvic:  No blood in vault, no odor, no cervical motion tenderness, no definitive adnexal tenderness, cervical os closed.
Neurologic:  Tenderness to palpation in lower lumbosacral region, deep tendon reflexes 2+ in bilateral upper and bilateral lower extremities, sensation to light touch symmetric, motor strength symmetric ([**5-12**]).
Skin:  No rashes or skin lesions identified.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management and workup of her syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
Given her laboratory findings, the patient was felt to have hypotonic hyponatremia.
Her tachycardia suggested a hypovolemic picture, however, given the severity of the patient's pain, pain contributing to her syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone could not be ruled out.
As she was stable throughout this time, without focal neurologic symptoms, the patient was felt to be stable enough for transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the regular medicine floor.
The etiology of her hyponatremia was explored and felt to be related to possible porphyria with pain.
Because of our suspicion for acute porphyria, a 24 hour urine collection for PBG and ALA was started on hospital day number six.
A sample sent for a PBG spot test returned presumptively positive and a hematology/oncology consult was obtained.
Serial 24 hour urine collections were obtained and sent for ALA and PBG.
While awaiting laboratory results, the patient's presumptive diagnosis of acute porphyria was managed with a high carbohydrate diet (four grams daily).
On hospital day number eight, the patient began complaining of increased low back pain and pain/tingling in her thighs.
Given these new complaints, a neurologic examination revealed decreased deep tendon reflexes bilaterally and Hematin was ordered from [**Company 36178**] in [**Location (un) **], [**State 18250**] as a precaution in case her porphyria acutely worsened.
Her beta hCG appeared to rise appropriately for the first four days after her diagnostic laparoscopy, however, subsequent beta hCG levels failed to demonstrate the appropriate doubling despite the presence of an intrauterine gestational sac.
Because of the patient's new neurologic findings were concerning for progressive porphyria as well as her unimproved abdominal examination, her inappropriately rising beta hCG and her desire, since prior to admission, to terminate the pregnancy, the decision was made in conjunction with the Ob/Gyn service (who had been following the patient in house) to proceed with offering early pregnancy termination.
After the risks and benefits of an early dilatation and evacuation were explained to the patient, she wished to proceed.
Postoperatively, her pain was well controlled with a fentanyl patch and Percocet.
Multiple abdominal, pelvic, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasounds revealed only a small (less than 4 cm) infraumbilical hematoma at the umbilical port site.
No free fluid was detected on any of the ultrasounds.
To better evaluate for a possible intra-abdominal bleed, the patient underwent an abdominal pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scan which again revealed only a small subcutaneous hematoma that had been previously described by ultrasound, and no intra-abdominal fluid collection.
Because the patient was asymptomatic with this heart rate and because of the concern that her porphyria was progressing, the decision was made to hold off administering blood products which may potentially further stress her system for the time being.
