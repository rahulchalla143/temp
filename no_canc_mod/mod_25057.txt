Lobulated, enhancing lesion extending along both the sides of the anterior falx, exerting mass effect on the adjacent anterior frontal lobes and resulting in extensive edema.
In conjunction with outside hospital imaging from [**2183-12-30**], there is no evidence of invasion into the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses.
Moderate paranasal sinus disease involving the frontal and ethmoid air cells.
Slightly enlarged ventricles with a congenital appearance  CT Head [**1-2**]: IMPRESSION:  1.
Surgical bony defect involves the posterior walls of the frontal sinuses bilaterally.
Additional blood is seen in the fourth ventricle, and tracking inferiorly about the brainstem at the level of the foramen magnum.
Close interval imaging followup is recommended to evaluate for developing hydrocephalus, particularly given the presence of blood within the subarachnoid space and fourth ventricle.
Bifrontal vasogenic edema, as on prior studies, compatible with known bifrontal mass lesion.
CT Head [**1-3**]: IMPRESSION: Interval placement of EVD via right frontal approach with tip at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].
Otherwise similar examination with postoperative hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space, along the basal cisterns and within the fourth ventricle.
Bifrontal vasogenic edema and configuration of the ventricles appear unchanged.
The tumor mass extends laterally towards the extreme posterior aspect of the lamina papyracea on each side.
There is extensive residual bifrontal lobe edema.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Interval removal of the right frontal approach external ventricular drain with gliosis and acute hemorrhage along the tract.
