Patient was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2122-12-29**], at the time she had presented with AMS, was found to be hypercarbic and requiring intubation, she was noted to have fluid overload and was diuresed with lasix, she did not have evidence of pneumonia, LENIs were negative, and echocardiogram showed a preserved biventricular systolic function without pulmonary hypertension.
Therefore, it was felt that her hypercarbia was due to not wearing night time BIPAP for successive days leading to slow increase in her PCO2 +/- central apnea.
Per her daughter at baseline prior to previous hospitalization was wheelchair bound most of the day but could make a few independent steps to the bathroom.
Demented with occasional visual + auditory halucination.
At rehad continued to complain of weakness but did PT, walk around some with a walker.
No recent fevers or illness recorded.
Denied HA, blurry vision, CP, SOB, abdominal pain, dysuria, or increased LE edema.
Past Medical History: -type 2 diabetes mellitus -hypertension -atypical peripheral neuropathy with cutaneous sensations ("dust  on her skin", seen by [**Hospital 878**], on gabapentin + olanzapine)  - tactile hallucinosis per PCP [**Name Initial (NameIs) 15372**]: appears to be adult onset asthma.
-macular edema s/p surgery -neovascular glaucoma secondary to her proliferative diabetic retinopathy  - blind left eye > right eye -OSA (prescribed BiPAP, not currently using) -osteoarthritis -dementia .
Social History: Patient is wheelchair bound due to old osteoarthritis and vision  loss.
Family History: Father with diabetes mellitus, died at age 69.

Imaging: [**1-8**] CT head w/o con: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
[**1-8**] CXRay: IMPRESSION: Right perihilar and left infrahilar opacities, worrisome for aspiration in the setting of suspected seizure, although not entirely specific.
Mild pulmonary plethora may be present.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Unchanged prominent perivascular space versus lacunar infarct on the left basal ganglia.
Minimal asymmetry of the temporal ventricular horns, this finding is nonspecific and no frank evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis is identified.
There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement or diffusion abnormalities.
Polypoid formation noted on the left maxillary sinus, likely consistent with a mucus-retention cyst.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old male w/ DM, no known sz d/o, p/w seizures in the context of non ketotic hyperosmolar state, intubated for airway protection, loaded with Dilantin, stabilized, extubated, and without recurrence on floor.

# Acute on chronic kidney disease: pre renal in the setting of NKHOS and now improved back to baseline after fluid resuscitation.
# Aspiration: CXR demonstrated opacities consistent with aspiration which likely happened during seizures.
