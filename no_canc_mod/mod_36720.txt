She denies auditory or visual hallucinations but rather reports a hyperawareness of her senses.
Denies depressive symtpoms including anhedonia, sleep or appetite changes.
No abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or constipation.
Also reports urinary incontinence and gait instability.
Denies weakness or sensory deficits but rather says she just sometimes falls without understanding why.
Work up for weight loss and dysphagia thus far have included recent EGD which demonstrated gastritis and Barrett's esophagus, CT abdomen which demonstrated an isolated pulmonary nodule, gastric varices and a renal cyst.
CT chest also performed and confirmed isolated pulmonary nodule.
Because of the patient's recent gait instability, MR head to assess for mass or multiple sclerosis performed a few days ago demonstrated likely chronic vascular occlusions.
Recent labs remarkable for leukopenia and thrombocytopenia(chronic), recent hypernatremia now resolved, hypokalemia and albumin of 4. .
New medications over this period appear to be citalopram, reglan, prilosec and urecholine, but would need to confirm with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient unsure.

Depression 7.
Nonhealing decubitus ulcer 9.
Hyperlipidemia 10.

Chronic Low Back Pain 13.
Dysphagia  Social History: Heavy smoking, alcohol history.
Worked for commission for blind long ago.
general: frustrated with me examining her, continually wiping her eyes to remove specks, difficulty with history, cachectic and frail, non-toxic HEENT: PERLLA, EOMI, anicteric, no sinus tenderness, MMdry, op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules lungs: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout heart: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated abdomen: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly extremities: trace ankle edema skin/nails: no rashes/no jaundice/, some excoriation over bilateral calf area back: stage 2 sacral decub.
No overt masses in the neck, causing luminal narrowing of the [**Last Name (un) **]-, oro-, or hypopharynx, to explain the patient's symptoms.
Bone scan: Nonspecific focus of increased activity at the costovertebral junction of the left 10th rib.
Video swallow: Delayed pharyngeal swallow initiation, and slow oral bolus transit time.
Trace penetration with thin liquids only.
No aspiration.
MR C spine: Mild changes of cervical spondylosis from C4-5 to C6-7.
No evidence of spinal stenosis.
Mild foraminal narrowing at C5-6 level.
No evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
pCXR: Allowing for rotation, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in appearance with prominence of the right cardiac border without change from older studies.
Slight upper zone vascular redistribution and vascular indistinctness suggest early fluid overload, and there is a questionable small right pleural effusion.
Evidence of cirrhosis with portal hypertension, varices, and ascites.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Moderately distended rectum containing stool and retained contrast from earlier studies, with mild wall thickening, which may be inflammatory or due to venous congestion.
Head CT: Normal study, including no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 1)Weight Loss:  Extensive work up thus far has included MRI head, CT chest/abdomen, EGD, barium swallow within past six months, labs including cbc, chem-10, b12, rpr, tsh, free t4, spep/upep, hepatitis panel.
To summarize, patient has Barrett's esophagus, gastritis, gastric varices, isolated pulmonary nodule, treated hypothyroidism and diabetes, hepatitis C. --[**Last Name (un) **]/[**Last Name (un) 3907**] as outpatient --follow up with outpatient psychiatrist as dysphagi may have functional component as patient seems severely limited by her numeroud delusions.
2)Hypersensitivity to senses: No clinical evidence of seizures.
3) UTI with possible sepsis: Had brief episode of hypotension and was discovered to have a UTI with MSSA.
3)Neuro: Incontinence/gait instability/neuropathy history: No clear evidence of actual incontinence, this appears to be a delusion to some degree.
although she does retain urine as demonstarted after a voiding trial with a PVR of 500 cc.
She was seen by neurology who recommended a C spine MRI which showed no spinal stenosis or cord impingement.
6)Hypothyroidism: recent free t4 wnl although TSH elevated --continue levoxyl 50 for now .
Psychaitry was asked if patient might benefit from psyche inpatient admission, given her numerous delusions, but they felt she did not meet criteria for psychiatric admission at this time.
DVT prophylaxis:hold subcu heparin given thrombocytopenia .
propanolol 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril 5mg recently discontinued given hypotension with weight loss   Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Urinary Tract Infection Sepsis Urinary Retention Dysphagia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Continue medications as listed.
You will need a f/u CT 1 year for pulmonary nodule.
You are also due for a mammogram.
