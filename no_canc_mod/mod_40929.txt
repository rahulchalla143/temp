Admission Date:  [**2184-1-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-2-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-8-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim DS / Lipitor / Atenolol / Beta-Blockers (Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agts)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**] Chief Complaint: Neurogenic claudication  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L4/L5 decompressive laminectomies with instrumented fusion   History of Present Illness: In brief, patient is a 70 yo M w PMH of CAD(CABG ((LIMA-obtuse marginal branch, SVG-LAD and known occluded SVG-RCA)in [**2170**], PCI in [**2181**]), PVD, unprovoked PE, negative LENIs in [**2183-4-4**], who was admitted to the ortho spine service for laminectomy.
He also had fevers on [**2184-1-21**] and [**2184-1-22**].
Given concern for possible recurrent PE, STAT echo was done at bedside this morning and did not show right ventricular dysfunction or strain.
Chest x-ray showed multifocal pneumonia, so he was started on antibiotics for HCAP coverage.
He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2183-1-22**] which showed occlusion of the severely diseased LMCA that supplied a diffusely diseased OM1 that measured previously 0.5 mm and a small (0.75 mm) diagonal system.
Patient reported some palpitations, but no new chest pain.
He also desaturated to the high 80s and oxygen requirement increased.
He was administered 5mg IV metoprolol with improvement of heart rate to the 110s, but also a drop in SBP to the 80s.
He previously had one episode of atrial fibrillation following his CABG.
On arrival in the CCU he denies any chest pain, palpitations subjective dyspnea except for an inability to take deep breaths, no cough.
Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ pitting edema at the ankles, No femoral bruits.
PULSES: Right: DP 1+ PT 2+ Left: DP 1+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: TTE [**2184-1-22**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid- and distal septal hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Fills via SVG graft and has mild disease.
Distal Cx and OM2 vessel fills via the LIMA and has minimal disease.
Assessment & Recommendations 1.Secondary prevention CAD 2.Infarction appears to be occlusion of the severely diseased LMCA that supplied a diffusely diseased OM1 that measured previously 0.5 mm and a small (0.75 mm) diagonal system.
4.No need to continue heparin and would not manage with clopidogrel given recent spine surgery.
ETT: [**2184-1-7**] INTERPRETATION: 69 yo man s/p CABG in [**2154**] and stent to LAD in [**2170**] was referred to evaluate an atypical chest discomfort.
No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported.
No significant ST segment changes were noted.
The rhythm was sinus with rare isolated APDs and VPDs noted.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the SVG-LAD anastomosis stenosis and distal 50% stenosis with a 2.25x20mm Taxus Atom stent that was postdilated to 2.5mm in the mid and proximal portion.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
Successful deployment of angioseal vascular closure device.
CXR [**2184-1-22**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of a newly appeared parenchymal opacity at both the right lung base and in the left lung, notably in the perihilar areas in the retrocardiac space.
The distribution suggests pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema, notably given the absence of pleural effusions and the absence of other findings indicative of fluid overload.
No hilar or mediastinal changes.
Mild calcification of the coronary arteries is stable.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The aorta unremarkable without aneurysm or dissection.
The pulmonary arteries are patent to the subsegmental level without evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is no axillary, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present, including an intrafissural component of effusion on the left.
Small homogeneous symmetric consolidations are present in the dependent regions, which is most consistent with atelectasis.
Evaluation of the lung parenchyma is somewhat limited due to extensive respiratory motion.
Despite these limitations, there are nonspecific scattered ground-glass opacities which likely represent atelectasis and a small component of mild pulmonary edema.
There is no definite pneumonia.
There are degenerative changes of the spine without concerning lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.
No pulmonary embolism.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Bilateral atelectasis.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo M with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG and PCI, PVD and h/o [**Hospital **] transferred to CCU on POD#3 [**2184-1-22**] s/p L4-L5 laminectomy, with [**Month/Day/Year 7792**].
Refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition.
Pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA.
Cardiac cath at that time showed infarction appeared to be occlusion of the severely diseased LMCA that supplied a diffusely diseased OM1 that measured previously 0.5 mm and a small (0.75 mm) diagonal system.
CP resolved until [**1-28**] when pt had midnight episode of chest tightness - he described this as similar to previous episodes at home relieved with nitro although those episodes on exertion and this time lying in bed.
K had just been repleted (was at 3.8) ECG showed NSR at 100 (had been in 80s earlier in the night - on tele sped up slowly, in sinus) new 1mm depression in lead I, avF with 2mm dep in lead II.
Within 10 minutes pain improved, stated tightness was gone prior to recieving any medications.
Repeat ECG showed resolution of changes mentioned above but pt now with inverted T waves V1 V2 V3, NSR at rate 80.
Pt had a similar episode the following night prompted by urinating in a urinal by lying down.
Again pronounced ECG depressions in same leads (anterolateral and inferior) which resolved within 10 minutes, this time pt was administered IV metoprolol with po for longer-lasting effect.
These anginal episodes recurred the following 2 nights as well with rapid resolution of ECG changes.
Pt endorsed significant component of anxiety during and prior to both events.
Although in sinus tach each time, his HR had  been creeping up from 70s up to 100 at which point he experienced the chest pain.
Most likely [**2-5**] demand ischemia in territory of diseased RCA supplied by collateral circulation.
Cardiac catheterization images revisited and it was felt that pt did not have any visible occlusions to intervene on, in which case CABG was also not an option.
- recurrent episodes of nocturnal stable angina managed by uptitration of antianginals: nitro patch and Ranolazine.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Patient has one prior documented history of AFib shortly after CABG, none since.
Apart from [**Name (NI) 7792**], pt also had fevers, leukocytosis, and CXR findings concerning for ?pneumonia on transfer to the CCU.
It was felt that infection and tachycardia with demand was likely triggering aFib.
Initially rate was controlled with dilt drip and pt was anticoagulated with heparin gtt (no bolus - this was approved by orthopedics in post-op setting) and was initiated in setting of [**Last Name (Titles) 7792**].
s/p Echo which showed no new wall motion abnormalities, EF 45% at baseline, s/p cardiac catheterisation which showed OM1 lesion.
- optimize medical management for CAD: ASA 325mg, initiation of bblocker, statin - if renal function stabilzes, please consider initiation of ACEI  #fevers/leukocytosis: On transfer to CCU pt had fevers, leukocytosis>16, CXR findings suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.
Blood and sputum cx showed no growth.
There was also c/f PE; pt with history of unprovoked PE in [**Month (only) 547**] [**2183**], no hypercoagulability workup done at the time.
Fever/leukocytosis and tachycardia along with recent immobility s/p spinal surgery, high risk for PE.
CXR changes however thought to be more consistent with pneumonia.
Pt did not have overt bleeding/swelling or pain.
- recommend outpatient colonoscopy in [**Month (only) 956**]  # CHF: Patient has no known history of CHF.
# Hypotension: Concern for cardiogenic shock vs. PE with hemodynamic instability vs. septic shock from multifocal pneumonia (as below).
Pt had no evidence of right ventricular strain on echo, so massive PE with hemodynamic instability felt unlikely.
HCAP coverage was continued to cover possible septic state from multifocal pna.
Most likely hypotension was [**2-5**] cardiogenic shock as pt with recent [**Month/Day (2) 7792**] now with increased mitral valve regurgitation.
Pt also developed Afib which exacerbated hypotension.
BP improved with control of Afib and aggressive diuresis.
#hyperkalemia - central venous line was placed to deliver larger quantities of potassium.
Hyperkalemia resolved with aggressive diuresis.
#abdominal distension - pt was noted to lack bowel sounds and was with distended abdomen after laminectomy.
KUB showed ileus but no evidence of obstruction and exam was otherwise benign.
#Emesis - pt developed several episodes of watery, nonbloody nonbilious emesis.
This was felt to represent a vasovagal episode and these episodes self-terminated.
#singultus - pt was given thorazine for hiccups and became extremely somnolent with difficulty finding words.
#anxiety - pt had considerable component of anxiety and this was felt to precipitate his episodes of chest pain somewhat.
Also on ASA, bblocker and statin - continue anticoagulation with coumadin for paroxysmal afib - consider initiation of ACEI given significant CHF once renal function has stabilized - f/u with [**Last Name (un) **] as needed for laminectomy   Medications on Admission: ALBUTEROL SULFATE [PROAIR HFA] - 90 mcg HFA Aerosol Inhaler - 1  puff tid prn HYDROCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN - 5 mg-500 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by  mouth [**Hospital1 **] prn NITROGLYCERIN - 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual - Place one tablet under tongue for chest pain, repeat every 5 minutes times 2 prn  Lipitor TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE - 0.1 % Cream - apply topically to legs  once every 1-2 weeks as needed Lovenox OMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM [PRILOSEC OTC] - (OTC) - 20 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
