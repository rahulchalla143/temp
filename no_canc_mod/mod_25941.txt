Opacification in right lower lung may represent pneumonia versus loculated pleural effusion versus pleural or parenchymal-based mass.
Right-sided pleural effusion.
Stable opacification in the right lower lobe likely represents loculated pleural effusion, but pneumonia or mass cannot be excluded.
[**2126-12-9**] UENI: Nonocclusive thrombus expanding the basilic vein of the right upper extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo male history of old anterior wall infarct, multiple cardiac arrests s/p ICD, ischemic cardiomyopathy last EF 22% on warfarin, hyperthyroidism [**2-5**] amio toxicity, stage 3 CKD and two prior VT ablations admitted after three ICD shocks on [**Holiday 1451**], now s/p VT ablation and thyroidectomy, back on amiodarone.
#Hyperthyroidism:  This is most likely secondary to amiodarone toxicity, but not known if it is destructive thyroiditis or autonomy.
He underwent thyroidectomy without complication.
Synthroid was started at a 50mcg dose given recurrent VT.  Oxycodone was given for pain control.
#Right pleural effusion and mass: Noted on multiple chest xrays during admission.
His PCP was notified of the persistent finding, and a repeat CT scan was suggested for comparison.
#CORONARIES: He has a history of large anterior wall infarct complicated by ischemic cardiomyopathy.
He did not have chest pain or shortness of breath during admission.

Ventricular tachycardias status post ablation 2.
Hyperthyroidism status post thyroidectomy 3.
Patient is chest pain free.
He is having ventricular tachycardia once per day but is paced out of it by his pacemaker.
You were admitted for ventricular tachycardia refractory to pacing.
You went for a ablation of a scar in your heart that was causing this abnormal rhythm.
You are still experiencing ventricular tachycardia from other scars, however, the pacemaker is able to stop this rhythm.
Your prednisone dose was decreased and you were started on levothyroxine for thyroid supplementation.
