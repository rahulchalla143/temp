HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63 year old primarily Spanish speaking male with a history of end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus on dialysis.
The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recurrent Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus/VRE dialysis catheter infection and status post Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidural abscess of L2 to 3, status post incision and drainage in [**2144-7-15**].
Per the hemodialysis center notes the patient had a temperature the previous night at home, however, he was afebrile at the beginning of his hemodialysis session.
The patient was given Tylenol for his back pain which did not help.
The patient also complained of increased back pain.
His pain was mostly between the shoulders.
Initially, the patient was only minimally responsive and could only open his eyes, however, he quickly perked up and after the antibiotics, he was alert and oriented times three.
He complained of mild headache, mostly bifrontal and mild neck pain as well as the thoracic back pain.
The patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure.
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus L2 to 3 epidural abscess with incision and drainage in [**2144-7-15**].
Recurrent line infections with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, VRE and Klebsiella.
Thrombosis in right internal jugular, right subclavian and right brachiocephalic veins in 10/[**2144**].
Peptic ulcer disease.
Neck supple; no lymphadenopathy.
Generalized plethora and edema of neck.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Chest:  Left sided Quinton dialysis catheter without any surrounding erythema or exudate, nontender.
Back with no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Minimal paraspinal thoracic tenderness to palpation.
Extremities:  Cachectic; no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Left sided AV fistula with positive thrill.
No hepatosplenomegaly, masses or bruits.
No focal signs.
Chest x-ray with poor inspiration, diffuse haziness but no focal infiltrates.
Head CT scan with no evidence of bleeding or masses.
T wave inversions in I and AVL, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions with T wave inversions in V4 through V6.
Biphasic T waves in V2 to V3.
No old electrocardiograms accessible for comparison.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 63 year old Spanish speaking male with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post left circumflex stent, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of recurrent dialysis catheter infections with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and VRE, and history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidural abscess, who now presents with fever, lethargy, back pain and headache.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient did not have any further high spikes after being admitted.
He had only low spikes for a couple of days and then was afebrile afterwards.
The patient was kept on a regimen of Vancomycin and Gentamicin for broad coverage.
His Quinton dialysis line was pulled after dialysis was started with his left AV fistula.
The Quinton tip also grew Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was unable to have a right sided PICC line placed because of the extensive network of clots in his right internal jugular, subclavian and brachiocephalic veins.
Because the patient was also having back pain, and given his history of an epidural abscess, there was a concern that he might have seeded his vertebrae, thus causing osteomyelitis.
This was negative for an epidural abscess, but did show increased signal and paravertebral swelling anterior to C3 through 5, suspicious for osteomyelitis.
This showed low normal left ventricular ejection fraction, small ASD, but only mild mitral regurgitation and no change in his valves.
ACCESS:  As already noted, the patient came in with a left sided Quinton catheter.
He also had an AV fistula with a positive thrill that had been placed in [**2145-7-15**], but had not been used yet.
The Quinton catheter was taken out after the AV fistula was tested and found to be usable.
The patient initially had an AV fistula ultrasound and then an AV fistulogram.
This revealed the stenosis between the arterial and venous components.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient's initial presentation had some concerning T wave and ST changes on his EKG even though an old EKG was not accessible.
The patient was ruled out by serial cardiac enzymes.
He had no episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath.
HEMATOLOGIC:  The patient has a history of right sided clots in his internal jugular, subclavian, brachiocephalic veins; for this reason, he is on anticoagulation.
There were no further complications during hemodialysis including fever, hypotension, or volume overload.
The patient will follow-up with his renal doctors.

Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease, status post left circumflex stent.
