Pt noted painful contractions at 2AM on day of admission with decrease fetal movement.
Pt did not call in till about 11:28AM when she noted some small amount of vaginal bleeding.
On arrival, evaluation showed that she had a very tender uterus with poor relaxation and non-reassuring fetal heart tracing.
Intraop concern was for DIC and her INR returned at 1.4; she was given 1 unit of cryo.
After the procedure,in recovery room, her Hct dropped from 26.8 to 17.7 and she developed coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.
No ECG changes noted.
Past Medical History: - Asthma - Depression - Hypothyroid - h/o PNA which required chest tube placement  Social History: SH: Lives with brother and her 2 children.
Family History: Sibling with prolong QT on EKG  Physical Exam: PE on Admission: T 98.7 BP 145/92 HR 95 RR 16 O2sats 96% RA Gen: uncomfortable female HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, mmm, anicteric Neck: Supple, no LAD Lungs: CTAB Heart: RRR, +S1/S2, [**2-21**] high pitched systolic ejection murmur heard throughout pre-cordium (new) Abd: with significant tenderness to palpation, soft, mildly distended + BS Ext: 2+ UE and LE edema(non-pitting), no cyanosis Neuro: A&O times 3, non-focal  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: .
[**4-17**]: CTU: IMPRESSION: No evidence for hydronephrosis or retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal fluid.
[**4-18**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Appearance of slightly diminished flow in the kidneys is likely due to technical limitations as described above.
3.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
[**4-22**]: CT ABD/PELVIS: IMPRESSION: no retroperitoneal hematoma, uterine cavity with material c/w post c/s.
Bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis at the lung bases, apparent engorgement of the pulmonary vessels, and subcutaneous edema c/w aggressive volume resuscitation.
In the ICU, the pt was diuresed with several courses of high-dose lasix and diuril, but due to respiratory compromise from her fluid overload status, she was hemodialysed x 2 via R femoral catheter while in the ICU.
She began autodiuresising on POD#7 and did not require further diuretics or dialysis.
Per renal, etiology for pt's renal failure was likely ATN (ddx includes cortical necrosis or prerenal shock).
Resp: Pt volume overloaded after net +7L secondary to anuria/renal failure.
She was on nitroglycerin drip for pulm edema comfort for 1 day prior to intubation.
Anemia/thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy: Likely DIC secondary to abruptio placentae.
HTN, r/o preeclampsia - 1+ proteinuria but LFTs overall wnl, with no sx of H/A or vision changes.
Pt did initially c/o RUQ pain.
Due to her RUQ pain, she underwent non-contrast CT on POD#6 which showed no evidence of liver hematoma or pericapsular bleed.
Her RUQ pain eased by POD#7.
She had isolated elevated lipases, which increased to max 289, possibly secondary to propofol administration; LFT's WNL.
EF was normal >55%, mild mitral regurg was seen on initial echo, but improved on repeat echo to "trivial" MR.
Moderate pulmonary edema was seen on both cardiac echo's, and per medicine consult, the pt should have follow-up echo as an outpatient to monitor pulmonary edema.
The pt reportedly did not have milk letdown prior to discharge, and her breasts were soft.
Pt to be monitored, given high blood loss w/ abruption and risk of [**Doctor Last Name 30762**] syndrome.
Psych: due to the baby requiring NICU admission, pt was noted to have worsening depression and anxiety.
Pain control: pt required PCA for the first few days postop until intubation; post extubation, her pain was controlled on PO meds.
Oral HSV: pt found to have HSV cold sore on upper lip, for which she received topical and PO acyclovir.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: placental abruption disseminated intravascular coagulopathy acute renal failure  Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: No heavy lifting greater than 10 lbs for 6 weeks or heavy exercise.
