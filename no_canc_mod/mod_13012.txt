Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 41 yo man with a history of CHF, EtOH abuse, suspected EtOH/NASH induced cirrhosis, obesity, and lyphedema who presented after having a suspeced EtOH withdrawl seizure.
Seizures:  These were thought to be secondary to EtOH withdrawl.
He was evaluated by neurology while he was in the ICU and was briefly placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
However, this was not continued and he did not have any seizure activity while hospitalized.
EtOH withdrawl:  Due to his heavy benzodiazepine requirement he was electively intubated in the ICU for airway protection.
He was also followed by social work and was given multiple resources to pursue as an outpatient, including [**Company 191**] social work, [**Location (un) 15953**] Community Care, AA meetings in [**Location (un) **], and ALANON meetings for his wife.
An ultrasound during this admission showed no ascites.
CHF: This is of unclear etiology but is thought to be due to right sided failure from his obesity and OSA.
He has had an evaluation for CPAP but he has not been using it due to discomfort.
Lymphedema: This is thought to be due to chronic right sided failure.
Hematuria: He was noted to have hematuria on three separate urinalyses.
He did not have any urinary symptoms and his U/As and cultures were otherwise unremarkable.
On the day of discharge, he had a low grade fever (100.3) and again had a negative infectious workup.
