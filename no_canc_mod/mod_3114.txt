Admission Date:  [**2197-11-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-11-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status, hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation x 2, central line insertion, tracheostomy [**11-23**], PEG placement [**11-23**]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 yo female with PMH of Alzheimer's disease, depression, hypernatremia, paroxysmal afib who presents from her NH.
In the ED, she was noted to have altered mental status.
Subsequent ABG showed worsening hypercarbia at 66, so she was intubated.
She was noted to have pyuria and was givne vanc and zosyn.
Past Medical History: Alzheimer's Depression Hypernatremia Paroxymal Afib h/o Urinary tract infections Cholelithiasis h/o Influenza A/b   Social History: Permanent resident of [**Hospital3 **] Manor.
Radiographic studies: .
CXR [**11-12**]: Interstitial edema increased.
Left retrocardiac atelectasis also worsened.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, more marked on the left are unchanged.
Calcifications of the aortic arch and old right rib fractures are stable.
There has been an interval worsening of the bilateral perihilar opacities and probable slight increase in the layering bilateral large pleural effusions.
This could reflect developing pulmonary edema although multifocal infection cannot be entirely excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Micro Data: [**11-9**]: UCx w/proteus, sputum w/MRSA [**11-18**]: sputum w/stenotrophomonas BCx [**11-12**] negative BCx [**11-18**], [**11-19**], [**11-20**], [**11-21**] pending R IJ tip [**11-22**] culture negative UCx x2 [**11-19**] negative 3x CDiff negative ([**11-12**], [**11-13**], [**11-14**])   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 89 yo with PMH of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive hypernatremia .
Source was likely urine given pyuria, though may have pneumonia as well given MRSA in sputum.
UCx grew out pan sensitive proteus mirabilis, initial sputum grew MRSA.
Patient had short additional time in MICU when required pressors for approx 48 hours.
UCx during this time were negative and sputum grew out Stenotrophomonas sensitive to Bactrim.
- completed 15d of vanco, was treated for 14d total for UTI starting w/cipro/unasyn and switching to gent/zosyn (to double cover for VAP) - IV Bactrim 250mg Q8h for 14 days, starting [**11-24**] and finishing on [**12-8**].
#2 Respiratory failure: Hypoxia and hypercarbia with spontaneous breathing trials.
[**Month (only) 116**] now be volume overloaded due to fluid resuscitation.
Patient failed SBTs due to RSBIs >130 and increasing acidosis.
Patient with slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention without acidosis on admission.
No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus far.
NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space ventilation (70% on PSV).
Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix of decreased respiratory muscle strength combined with underlying intrinsic [**Known lastname **] disease.
?s age and does not explain hypotension or bradycardia.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Adrenal insufficiency also a possibility but AM cortisol was normal.
She has been both very hypervolemic and exterienced flash pulmonary edema during her stay, and fluid balance has been difficult.
Initially EP commented that her rhythm could be a variation of normal or tied to her underlying illness and recommended treating her sepsis and re-evaluating once she has recovered or becomes unstable.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) Puff Inhalation PRN (as needed) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: proteus mirabilis urosepsis bradycardia stenotrophomonas pneumonia .
Secondary: Alzheimer's Depression Hypernatremia Paroxymal Afib h/o Urinary tract infections Cholelithiasis h/o Influenza A/b   Discharge Condition: good, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis for which she finished a course of vanc, gent, zosyn.
She has been both very hypervolemic and exterienced flash pulmonary edema during her stay, and fluid balance has been difficult.
She has not been anticoagulated for her PAF in the past.
