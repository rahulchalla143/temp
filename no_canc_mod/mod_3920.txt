HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 12585**] is a 49 year old gentleman with a 22 year history of diabetes mellitus.
He has a history of peripheral neuropathy, kidney transplantation in [**2128**] secondary to diabetic nephropathy, as well as throat cancer in [**2129**] treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation.
Mr.  [**Known lastname 12585**] also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy; a cervical MRI scan showed very impressive disc herniations at C5-C6, less so at C4-C5, with clear cut cord compression, particularly on the right side C5-C6.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees; blood pressure 145/80; pulse 60; respiratory rate 10; 100% on a non-rebreather.
He was awake, alert, uncomfortable secondary to incisional tenderness at neck site as well as right iliac graft site.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the PACU, Anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his SAO2 dropped to 89%.
The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume.
No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia, although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction.
He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume.
The patient became agitated with both tent and Bi-PAP machine, although continued to saturate well.
On the day of transfer, the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] sensorium; thus, a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants.
His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued; those included Temocillin, Nortriptyline, Haldol, Lorazepam, Venlafaxine, Bupropion, and Gabapentin.
Mass effect was considered, although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium, it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality.
A head and neck CT scan, non-contrast, were ordered though to evaluate for such processes.
No acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted, although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C2.
The patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma, no loss of consciousness.
There were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium.
Liver function tests were checked, only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6.
RPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked.
An EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus, although again this did not seem to be a likely cause.
On the evening of the 22nd, the patient became acutely agitated, threatening to leave, and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving.
The restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on [**6-12**].
Later in the morning on [**6-12**], the patient was more oriented and alert, and asked to have the restraints removed.
for emergency use should he become acutely agitated.
The likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy.
His immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4; he has a baseline renal insufficiency.
As for his diabetes mellitus, the [**Last Name (un) **] Team provided updated recommendations each day, adjusting for the changing p.o.
The only other complaints from Mr. [**Known lastname 12585**] during his stay were:  Soreness at his operative sites, for which he was given p.r.n.
In addition, he also complained of difficulty with swallowing, necessitating only soft and liquid diet.
This was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed [**2136-6-8**].
C4-C5, C5-C6, anterior microdiscectomy and fusion with right iliac bone graft.
End-stage renal disease secondary to type 1 diabetes mellitus; status post renal transplant in [**2128**].
History of multiple urinary tract infections.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus with triopathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral resection of the prostate; self catheterization.
Throat cancer status post right neck dissection and XRT in [**2129**].
