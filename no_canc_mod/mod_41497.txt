No mass effect or hydrocephalus.
Left frontoparietal subdural collection, unchanged, with no subjacent gyral effacement or mass effect.
Small right frontal subdural collection, also unchanged.
No evidence of new hemorrhage or territorial infarction.
No new abnormality to explain increased somnolence.
Mild soft tissue stranding overlying the left gluteus muscles, with slight prominence of the musculature, but no large hematoma detected.
Tiny avulsion fracture of the left greater trochanter, of unknown chronicity.
A second focus of calcification overlying this region may represent an embedded foreign body.
No acute intrathoracic, intrapelvic, or intra-abdominal process.
Cirrhotic liver, with multiple focal hypodense lesions, warranting further evaluation with MRI, if not already performed at an outside institution.
Splenic varices and large umbillical vein are the sequela of chronic portal hypertension.
Coarse nodular liver with multiple hyper and hypoechoic lesions.
At least 3 dominant hyperechoic lesions are seen that are concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Evidence of portal hypertension including persistent splenomegaly measuring 15 cm and a recanalized umbilical vein.
Multiple sub-cm peripheral arterially enhancing foci within the liver, which likely represent perfusion anomalies, though a follow up MRI in [**3-18**] months is recommended to assess for stability.

# MSSA Septicemia [**2-15**] abscess/cellulitis - Toward the end of hospital course, patient was noted to be with worsened confusion after his confusion had initially improved greatly.
He was then noted to be febrile to 103 and with a relative leukocytosis.
Skin exam revealed a quarter-sized abscess with surrounding erythema that spread proximally.
Blood cultures grew methicillin-sensitive staph aureus.
TTE revealed no vegetation.
He will need to have a repeat CBC and Chem 7 on [**2181-9-3**]  # Acute metabolic encephalopathy - After extubation, patient was persistently agitated and delirious with occasional episodes of somnolence.
After symptoms failed to improved over a couple of days, the CIWA protocol was discontinued, as it was felt that he may have developed benzo toxicity in the setting of his cirrhosis.
ABG revealed a mild respiratory alkalosis.
CT Head showed new subdural hematomas bilaterally.
However, these were not felt to contribute to his changes in mental status.
THe patient eventually began to clear, but again became acutely agitated and febrile.
He was found to have bacteremia [**2-15**] to LUE abscess/cellulitis.
# Head laceration - The patient suffered a head laceration secondary to trauma.
During the hospital stay, there were several episodes of bleeding from the site.
Surgery was consulted but felt no operative management was necessary.
The head laceration ultimtely scabbed over and the staples were removed.
The laceration continues to heal with no bleeding or drainage.
# Bilateral subdural hematoma - These were identified on CT scan on [**7-30**].
Repeat scans demonstrated no expansion.
# Presumed EtOH Cirrhosis: Extent of disease unclear.
He was maintained on lactulose for most of his hospital stay with concerns for hepatic encephalopathy.
Cirrhosis was newly diagnosed by incidental finding on CT which showed cirrhotic appearing liver with multiple focal hypodensities.
RUQ US showed patent vessels and nodular appearance c/w cirrhosis and masses concerning for HCC.
MRI was performed which showed evidence of cirrhosis and portal HTN.
Additionally Multiple sub-cm peripheral arterially enhancing foci within the liver, were seen and thought to represent peerfusion anomalies.
A follow up  MRI in [**3-18**] months is recommended to assess for stability.
No suspicious lesions for HCC were identified.
He should follow up with a GI specialist close to his home for further evaluation of these liver masses and will need to be immunized for Hep B. .
This was likely [**2-15**] to bonemarrow suppression vs hypersplenism in setting of chronic etoh abuse/cirrhosis.
# Avulsion fx of L Hip: This was likely a result of initial trauma suffered during Nonoperable per ortho.
Patient denying pain with palpation.
TRANSITIONAL: # Repeat CBC w/diff, chem 7, AST, ALT, Alk phos, T. Bili # Neuro follow-up with [**Doctor Last Name 739**] for bilateral subdural hematomas.
# Liver follow-up to further characterize extent of liver disease.
# Needs Hepatitis vaccination  Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Medications: 1.
Thiamine 100 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Bacteremia, Cellulitis with abscess, Alcohol Withdrawal, Altered Mental Status Secondary: Head laceration, Transient Hypotension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were transferred hear from [**Hospital1 1562**] after you suffered a head injury which required intubation.
Unfortunately, you became confused again.
This time, we believe that it was because of an abscess on your left arm that led to an infection in your blood.
We treated you with IV antibiotics, and your infection as well as your mental status improved.
