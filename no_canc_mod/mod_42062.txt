Mucosa: Localized erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the gastroesophageal junction.
These findings are compatible with Mild esophagitis.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Localized erythema and congestion of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the cardia.
Localised erythema in antrum complatible with mild-moderate gastritis.
An adherent clot suggested recent bleeding.
Two endoclips were successfully applied to the Duodenal bulb ulcer for the purpose of hemostasis.
Impression: Mild esophagitis Small hiatal hernia possible MW tear  Mild-moderare gastritis Ulcer in the duodenal bulb (endoclip) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Recommendations: The findings account for the symptoms.
The duodenal ulcer is likely NSAID induced.

Your low blood pressure and dark stool are due to bleeding from an ulcer in your small intestine (duodenum).
This is to check if you have an infection that caused the ulcer.
