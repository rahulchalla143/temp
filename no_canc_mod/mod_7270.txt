Admission Date:  [**2133-1-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2133-2-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2076-1-2**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with end-stage renal disease (status post renal transplant in 200), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, gout, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and 2+ mitral regurgitation who presented to an outside hospital on [**1-28**] after he developed rapid atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, and congestive heart failure.
The patient did not respond well to diuresis with an elevated creatinine.
End-stage renal disease; status post renal transplant in [**2128**].
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.
History of atrial fibrillation with atrial flutter.
He is a Jehovah Witness and would not accept blood product transfusions.
In general, the patient was mildly tachypneic; otherwise, in no acute distress.
The lungs revealed bilateral crackles halfway up.
There was a [**1-31**] holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border best heard at the apex.
Mildly obese.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed asymmetric pulmonary edema.
A renal ultrasound of the transplanted kidney showed no evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection, resistive indices were between 0.51 and 0.67.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's baseline creatinine was approximately 2.
This was in the setting of congestive heart failure and rapid atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, it was felt that the renal failure was likely multifactorial with decreased renal perfusion secondary to congestive heart failure and decreased cardiac output.
Over the course of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, his renal function improved daily once his tachycardia and congestive heart failure were under control.
RENAL TRANSPLANT ISSUES:  The patient had a renal transplant in [**2128**] for renal failure secondary to hypertension and diabetes.
The patient was to have a tacrolimus level checked within one week of discharge and have these results called to the [**Hospital 10701**] Clinic.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient has severe mitral regurgitation with a normal ejection fraction and was thought to have flash pulmonary edema with his rapid atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with heart rates in the 130s to 140s.
During this hospitalization, the patient had thyroid function tests checked which revealed a mildly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone of 5.2.
In addition, it was recommended that the patient have baseline pulmonary function tests within the next three to four weeks after discharge.
The patient was to follow up with his cardiologist within three to four weeks of discharge to address the issue of his severe mitral regurgitation and the potential need for mitral valve replacement.
On [**1-31**], the patient had flash pulmonary edema and evaluated acute respiratory distress.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND ATRIAL FLUTTER ISSUES:  On the day of discharge, the patient had a normal sinus rhythm with his rate well controlled in the 70s.
He has a history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and has not been on Coumadin for anticoagulation.
However, the patient is a Jehovah Witness and will not accept blood product transfusions.
Therefore, a colonoscopy and possible endoscopy were recommended if there is concern over possible gastrointestinal bleeding with the initiation of anticoagulation therapy.
However, his ACE inhibitor was held secondary to his acute renal failure.
With his severe mitral regurgitation, the patient requires afterload reduction.
DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was previously on Actos; however, it was thought that with his level of renal failure and lower extremity edema that a glutinoid is not the best choice for him at this time.
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA ISSUES:  During the patient's hospitalization, it was noted that the patient had slightly asymmetric lower extremities.
A lower extremity noninvasive Doppler study was performed on his right lower extremity to rule out deep venous thrombosis.
There was no evidence of deep venous thrombosis was noted.
GOUT ISSUES:  During this admission, the patient had a right first metatarsophalangeal gout flare.
The patient also had an elevated uric acid level of 14.7.
If the patient's gout flare returns, a short steroid burst of three to five days of increased prednisone should be considered.
The patient was instructed to discuss the issue of starting Coumadin for anticoagulation to decrease his risk of stroke with his atrial fibrillation.
The patient was instructed to schedule a follow-up appointment with his cardiologist within three to four weeks; or, if he chose to do so, he was advised to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5003**]); a cardiologist at [**Hospital1 1444**], to schedule followup within three to four weeks to discuss the need for a possible mitral valve replacement.
Systolic congestive heart failure.
Respiratory distress (requiring intubation).
Acute renal failure; status post renal transplant.
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.
Atrial flutter.
Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.
