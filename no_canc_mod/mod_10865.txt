Prenatal course significant for normal prenatal ultrasound on [**2102-11-8**], limited survey due to maternal obesity.
Maternal pregnancy-induced hypertension with elevated blood pressure and proteinuria noted at approximately 28 weeks gestation.
Preterm labor at 31 1/2 weeks, received betamethasone times two doses on [**2-12**] and [**2-13**], received magnesium sulfate, remained in the hospital and on day of delivery was noted to have labile elevated blood pressure prompting induction.
Past maternal history - Asthma, anxiety (Prozac and prn Ativan).
Infant delivered by cesarean section on [**2-24**] due to failed induction, increased fetal heartrate, baseline 160 to 170s and variables to 90 to 100.
Infant emerged with apnea and decreased tone, received positive pressure ventilation for one to two minutes.
Respiratory effort noted approximately one minute of age, by two minutes positive pressure ventilation stopped, blow-by oxygen for cyanosis and then room air during transport to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
No apnea or bradycardia.
A soft intermittent murmur was noted on day of life #34.
The infant tolerated feeding without difficulty.
At 39 weeks corrected gestation, (day of life #38) the infant continued to receive gavage feeding and to have difficulty with oral feeding.
They then recommended a swallow study which was done at [**Hospital3 18242**] on [**4-11**] which was within normal limits, revealing no aspiration.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] recommended a bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy which was done at [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**3-19**] which revealed mild laryngomalacia.
This does not appear to have functional significance and requires only clinical observation.
Infectious disease - A complete blood count, differential and blood culture were drawn on the day of delivery which showed a white blood cell count of 13.5, hematocrit 56%, platelets 241,000, 29 polys, 0 bands.
Neurology - Head ultrasound on day of life #38 ([**2103-4-3**]), revealed bilateral Grade 1 terminal matrix hemorrhages.
Due to poor oral feeding, Neurology was also consulted at 39 weeks corrected gestation.
Genetics - Due to poor oral feeding and mild dysmorphic features, genetics was consulted (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40698**].
Their examination revealed mild frontal bossing and borderline lowset ears, otherwise the examination was unremarkable, no further workup was recommended at that time.
With chronic lung disease.
Status post rule out sepsis 3.
Status post hyperbilirubinemia 4.
Mild laryngomalacia   Reviewed By:  [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 36094**], M.D.
