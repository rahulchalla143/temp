Low precordial lead voltage.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2139-1-8**] no diagnostic interim change.
Opacification over the left costophrenic angle and inferior lateral left hemithorax may relate to overlying soft tissue and external artifact.
The cardiac silhouette is top normal  [**2139-3-29**]: Chest x-ray:  New interstitial abnormality at the lung bases and probable right pleural effusion are explained by cardiac decompensation.
Nevertheless, there is greater opacification in the right lower lung, which makes it difficult to exclude pneumonia.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and probable bilateral pleural effusions are again seen.
It is difficult to definitely exclude pneumonia in the absence of a lateral view.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Sub-optimal study but [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function appear to be normal with no evidence of valvular pathology.
[**2139-4-1**]: Chest x-ray:  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and moderate right pleural effusion have increased since [**3-31**].
Left lower lobe remains collapsed, and the larger left pleural effusion may have increased as well.
Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured, but may have increased in size.
There is no pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
There is no interval increase in pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema but mild degree of vascular engorgement is still present, although improved since the prior radiograph.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.

Post operatively  on day 2, he started developing a decline in mental status and worsening respiratory status/hypoxia.
He was given lasix and diuresed ~800 with some improvement in mental status but still had persistent desaturations with copious secretions.
He was transfered to the SICU for management of secretions, pulmonary toilet and diuresis.
At baseline patient with altered mental status.
He has a history of CHF and was given lasix 20mg for diuresis.
He was found to have pseudomonas in sputum cx and started cipro for additional coverage.
A dobhoff feeding tube was placed for tube feedings because there was a concern for aspiration.
During this time, he did have periods of confusion and somulence and his anti-psychotics and narcotics were discontinued.
His foley catheter was discontinued on POD # 8 and he has been voiding without difficulty.
His vital signs are stable and he is afebrile  He continues on his ciprofloxacin for pneumonia and required encouragement to cough.
