Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with coronary artery disease (CAD) status post stent to proximal LAD in [**2182**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was found down on side of road in ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest s/p resuscitation and intubation.
His course was complicated by rib fractures and resultant right pneumothorax requiring chest tube and ventilator-associated psuedomonas pneumonia.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Primary Vfib arrest: Although he had a history of CAD and is s/p drug eluding stent (DES) to proximal left anterior descending (LAD) in [**2182**], he had been doing well prior to this incident.
He was found down after riding a bike home, requiring multiple shocks for ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest in the field and endotracheal intubation for respiratory failure.
Monitored on EEG for seizure activity while on NM block, no seizures seen.
After rewarming, he remained became mildly hypertensive so he was restarted on home antihypertensives, which included metoprolol and lisinopril (takes captopril at home).
After additional management of his pneumothorax and pneumonia (see below) he was successfully extubated on [**5-18**] without complication.
There were many discussions about whether his vifb was secondary to acute MI or not, and ultimately it was felt that there was not evidence to confirm either way.
Since he may have had a primary vfib arrest (due to previous MI in [**2182**] and structural heart disease), he was a candidate for ICD placement during this admission.
# Pneumothorax: Patient developed crepitus on exam the morning of hospital day 4 while still intubated.
CXR revealed right apical pneumothorax and trauma surgery placed a pigtail catheter on [**2187-5-8**].
Initially, this tube drained air and serosanguinous fluid and repeat CXR showed improvement in the pneumothorax.
Because the differential included pulmonary embolus and he was not clinically improving, a CTA chest was performed on [**2187-5-9**].
This showed a large persistent right pneumothorax which was layered anteriorly and thus not visible on portable CXRs and the apical pigtail catheter was inadequately placed to drain.
He also had basal pneumonia.
Trauma surgery returned and placed a right chest tube on [**2187-5-9**] with repeat CT chest the following day showing resolution of pneumothorax.
He ventilator dependence and mild hypotension improved following chest tube placement.
# Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP): Upon rewarming from the arctic sun protocol, the patient was noted to be persistently febrile.
When he became hypoxic with increasing vent requirements, he was started on empiric coverage for VAP in addition to treatment of pneumothorax as above.
He remained febrile and sputum culture grew pseudomonas so ciprofloxacin was added to the regimen while awaiting sensitivities.
Flagyl was added to his regimen on [**5-15**] for anaerobic coverage given fevers and concern for aspiration.
Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin were subsequently weaned off and he completed a 8 day course of cefepime and metronidazole from [**5-16**], which was the last day of positive sputum cultures.
Patient had EEG performed early in his stay which showed mild/moderate diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm, however was notable for background frequencies with the appearance of an anterior-posterior gradient of frequencies, clear reactivity, and improvement in the alpha rhythm frequency which was thought to be associated with good neurologic outcome.
During daily attempts to wean off propofol, he was often noted to be agitated and somewhat delirious appearing.
To improve his sleep/wake cycle in the setting of sundowning, he was started on seroquel 25mg po qhs prn for insomnia and delirium.
# Trauma: Patient was admitted s/p fall from bike which may have resulted from or caused cardiac arrest.
CT imaging showed no acute intracranial process but did show multiple rib fractures from CPR.
Chest tube placed on hospital day 4 as above for new onset pneumothorax.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: On insulin at home, complicated by peripheral neuropathy and proteinuria (baseline creatinine 0.9 in [**2183**]).
# Weakness:  With weaning of sedation, it was noted patient was not moving extremities.
Head CT showed no acute process, and there was concern for critical illness neuropathy vs. myopathy.
EMG/NCS was ordered which was concerning for upper motor nerve lesion in the cervical spine.
Repeat MRI's showed poorly defined subacute to chronic lesion in C1 to C2.
# swallow discoordination: Also, he had significant weakness of his pharyngeal muscles which cause quiet voice and swallowing difficulties.
He had a video swallow and speech/swallow team evaluation which cleared him for a diet of pureed solids and honey-thick liquids.
# Hypertension (HTN)/ hypotension: Initially normotensive on admission to ED and CCU s/p cardiac arrest and resuscitation.
His pressures decreased with SBP's in th 90's in the setting of new pneumothorax.
# Hyperlipidemia (HLD): He was taking simvastatin at home but was transitioned to high dose atorvastatin given his acute MI.
# Transaminitis: Admission LFTs very elevated with AST/ALT 1100/1600, Tbili 2.0, and normal alkaline phosphatase.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have LFT elevation at baseline due to fatty liver disease.
# Erectile dysfunction (ED): on discharge, instruct pt to avoid ED meds.
-Follow-up needed for Liver lesion seen on Ultrasound- recommended a nonemergent MRI to further characterize - recheck CK and AST/ALT after stabilized as an outpatient to ensure no toxicity from high dose atorvastatin - To improve his sleep/wake cycle in the setting of sundowning, he was started on seroquel 25mg po qhs prn for insomnia and delirium.
Heparin 5000 UNIT SC TID   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSES ventricular fibrillation coronary artery disease pneumothorax ventilator-associated pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital because you were found unresponsive, without a pulse and not breathing outside the hospital.
Your lab work and EKG showed that you had a large heart attack.
You had a tube inserted in your lungs and you were ventilated by a machine in the ICU.
You had several rib fractures from the CPR and developed a pneumothorax.
This is when free air enters the chest and pushes the lungs out of the way, collapsing the lungs.
While you were on the ventilator, you aspirated some of your saliva and vomit, resulting in a pneumonia.
This results in significant weakness and fatigue which can last for several months but which will get better as your work with physical therapy.
