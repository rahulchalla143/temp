Pt states that her symptoms began acutely on Sunday evening when she was lying supine.
She states that her shortness of breath is worse at night when she lays down and is relieved with sitting up.
This AM, she was noted at her PCP's office to be in afib with RVR (140s) and also had TWI in lateral leads that were new.
Patient also had SOB and chest pressure in the ED and responded to nitro.
However, her BNP was later found to be significantly elevated to 7600. .
muffled heart sounds and possible concern for pericardial ffusion)-->showed EF 15% that was new and no evidence of effusion.
Patient denies having any recent colds, but admits to allergies associated with rhinorrhea and watery eyes.
Denies fever or chills.
No diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No melena or BRBPR.
Past Medical History: PMH: - Type 2 diabetes - History of cerebrovascular accident - Depression - Remote history of necrotizing fasciitis  Social History: Social Hx: Lives with nieces and nephew.
Family History: Family Hx: Father died of MI at age 50.
Positive for lung and throat cancer in siblings who smoked.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.9, 113, 127/75, 85, 25, 97%RA General: Alert and oriented x 3, NAD HEENT: ATNC, EOMI, no aniscoria Neck: supple, 12 cm JVD.
No carotid bruits Pulmonary: CTAB, no wheezes or rhonchi.
Cardiac: irreg irreg, distant HS, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly Extremities: 1+ LE edema, 2+ PT/DP pulses b/l Lymphatics: No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy noted Skin: no echymoses.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =15-20 %).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global biventricular systolic dysfunction.
Elevated filling pressures.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: 60 year old female with a hx of DM2, HTN, and CVA who presents with dyspnea x3 days, AFib, and new dilated CM with EF 15-20%.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Patient presented in a. fib with RVR and was managed in the ED with IV and po diltiazem, though she required high doses of each.
On the floor, she again became tachycardic with afib with RVR and was given IV and po lopressor.
A bedside ECHO was performed for concern of pericaditis, as the patient had low voltage on her EKG and there was some concern that she may have had a pericardial effusion.
The study revealed acute, decomponsated CHF, with a dilated cardiomyopathy and an EF of 15%, compared to a baseline EF of 56% on [**5-14**].
She also became hypotensive with SBPs in the 80s and was transferred to the CCU.
TEE was done which did not reveal any [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] or echo contrast.
On exam, patient's lungs were CTAB, 12 cm JVD, cool extremities, c/w cardiogenic shock.
Sx of hf and pressor requirement resolved completely.
Of note, the patient's ECHO did not show evidence of amyloid and her iron studies and TSH were all normal, with the exception of an elevated ferritin.
Pt was thought to be prerenal from poor systolic function and Cr decreased to 1.4 by the time of discharge.
# UTI: Positive UA.
# Transaminitis: Pt had elevated LFTs on admission with ALT and AST that peaked at 1100 and 1900.
Given new diagnosis of heart failure pt was swiched to glyburide 5mg po bid (actos, metformin were dc'd given CHF).
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Atrial fibrillation Acute dilated cardiomyopathy Acute congestive Systolic Heart Failure .
Secondary: Type 2 diabetes Cerebrovascular accident Depression History of necrotizing fasciitis   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of shortness of breath.
We diagnosed you with a heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation.
You had congestive heart failure which means that your heart is weak.
You will need to start warfarin (coumadin) to prevent blood clots and strokes.
Both the atrial fibrillation and weak heart function put you more at risk for a stroke or clot.
Warfarin: to prevent blood clots and strokes.
Furosemide: a diuretic to prevent fluid accumulation 3.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain, shortness of breath or anything else of concern.
