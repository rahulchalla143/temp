Patient reports he was sleeping the night prior to admission when the pain awoke him from sleep, described as a chest heaviness as if an animal was sitting on his chest accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
He had no shortness of breath, no diaphoresis.
Left sided catheterization showed LAD with mild segmental disease, left circumflex nondominant, no critical lesions, RCA which is dominant showed distal 99 percent occlusion which was stented.
There was no reflow following stenting.
However, there was persistence of ST elevation in the inferior leads and the patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit for monitoring.
No history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with hypertension, father with possible history of coronary artery disease per patient.
General:  somewhat somnolent in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular examination: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, II/VI systolic ejection left upper sternal border.
Extremities warm, no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis, posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
Electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in 2,3 and AVF with ST depression in V1 through V3, bradycardia in the 40s.
IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 60 year-old male with past medical history of smoking who presents with acute inferior wall myocardial infarction likely due to critical RCA lesion, status post catheterization now with no reflow immediately after intervention with TIMI 3 flow after nitroglycerin and diltiazem.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  1) Cardiovascular:  Post catheterization patient was started on Plavix, aspirin, Lopressor, Captopril and had no further chest heaviness or shortness of breath.
He was started on Captopril for afterload reduction.
Patient was also noted to have some chest soreness on [**2181-11-10**] accompanied by a friction rub consistent with acute pericarditis.
He was given Motrin for one day with relief of his pain and resolution of the pericardial friction rub by the following day.
Echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion, EF 50-55% with inferior-posterior akinesis.
Signal Averaged ECG was performed and was positive, however the patient's risk of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias was felt to be fairly low given his minimally depressed LV systolic function.
2) Heme:  He was initially started on Reopro which was continued for 18 hours post catheterization with no significant bleeding.
There was noted to be a small right groin hematoma at the catheterization site.
However, there was no bruit and distal pulses were intact.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
Acute pericarditis.
Patient is feeling back to his usual state of health, no longer having any chest heaviness or soreness and has plans to follow up with his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as an outpatient within the next week.
