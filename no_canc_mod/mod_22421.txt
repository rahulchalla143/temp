PRENATAL COURSE:  Notable for donor egg IVF with subsequent twinning of one embryo, resulting in quadruplet pregnancy.
Mother was admitted at 24 weeks gestational age for cervical shortening and treated with Betamethasone.
The decision was made to deliver because of progressive pre-eclampsia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial physical examination was notable for a preterm infant, in moderate respiratory distress; pink color; soft anterior fontanel; normal facies; intact palate; moderate retractions; fair air entry; no murmur present; femoral pulses; flat, soft, nontender abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly.
Respiratory: [**Known lastname 24344**] initially received 3 doses of Surfactant for respiratory distress syndrome and was extubated to C-Pap on day of life #3.
He was actually weaned to room air by day of life #7 but was returned to C-Pap on day of life #10 for increased apneic and bradycardiac spells.
He has been treated with caffeine for apnea of prematurity and typically has from three to ten apneic or bradycardiac episodes daily.
In the latter part of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**Known lastname 24344**] had significantly increased nasal and tracheal secretions, associated with an increase of apnea and bradycardia episodes, up to 12 to 17 per day.
[**Known lastname 24344**] has not required reintubation for these spells, which appear to be improving at the time of this dictation.
Cardiovascular:  [**Known lastname 24344**] was initially diagnosed clinically in the first three days of life with patent ductus arteriosus and received a single course of Indomethacin with resolution of murmur and widened pulse pressures.
He had been on 150 cc per kilo per day but was decreased to 130 on day of life #24 for some mild dependent edema.
He has continued to gain weight on the lower volumes with weight at the time of this dictation of 1,365 grams.
Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname 24344**] was treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia from day of life #2 until day of life #14 with peak bilirubin on day of life #3 of 6.6 and most recent bilirubin of 2.2 on [**10-8**].
[**Known lastname 24344**] has had some mild problems with [**Name2 (NI) 53581**], not requiring Reglan or Zantac.
During the time when [**Known lastname 24344**] had increased apnea and bradycardia episodes, a hematocrit was checked on [**10-11**] and he was transfused with 20 cc per kilo of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 31 and reticulocyte count of 3.6%.
He has not had a more recent hematocrit.
He had another sepsis evaluation performed on [**10-11**] for increased apnea and bradycardia episodes.
Nasopharynx aspirates were sent for viral IFA and cultures and were negative.
He has no other infectious disease issues.
He is due for his first ophthalmologic examination within the next few days.
Routine health care maintenance:  His initial state newborn screen on [**9-25**] has a low thyroxin level.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome, treated with Surfactant.
Apnea of prematurity.
