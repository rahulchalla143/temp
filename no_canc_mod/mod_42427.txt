HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 38-year-old female with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, type 1 diabetes, hypertension, severe peripheral vascular disease, multiple digit amputations, who initially presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] with a right thalamus/basal ganglia intracranial bleed status post VP shunt with subsequent apneic/hypoxic respiratory failure with PEG and trach placement who continues to have intermittent fevers, has diffuse lymphadenopathy, chronically elevated alkaline phosphatase and persistent right atrial thrombus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Fever:  The patient has had persistent intermittent fevers to greater than 100 approximately q.
She has had an extensive infectious workup and is being treated currently with vancomycin dose by level greater than 15 for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus line tip infection in the setting of a known right atrial thrombus.
She has no signs of respiratory infection.
She does have multiple other potential sites including an irritated J-tube site which was noted for positive Klebsiella which was thought not to be a pathogen.
She recently had a lymph node biopsy which was negative for infection showing granulomatous disease with central necrosis which was negative for special stains for organisms.
for possible Klebsiella versus Brucella infection.
For her intermittent fevers she should be continued on antibiotics, vancomycin by level and doxycycline and report if her temperature spikes greater than 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
Respiratory failure:  The patient was initially trached for her apneic/hypoxic respiratory failure during her Intensive Care Unit stay for her intracranial bleed.
She has no evidence of pneumonia or other signs of infection.
End-stage renal disease:  The patient has end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
She is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 805**] of the Renal Service.
Of note, the patient has a tendency to become hypotensive following dialysis treatments which respond effectively to intravenous fluid boluses.
Increased alkaline phosphatase:  The patient has a chronically elevated alkaline phosphatase in the range of 5- 700 without associated increase in her transaminases.
She had multiple abdominal ultrasounds and CT scans which have shown normal liver echogenicity without mass or stones.
She has no ductal dilatation.
She was unable to tolerate an MRCP due to her inability to hold her breath and to sit still for this study.
Additionally, liver biopsy was postponed due to the risk of infection associated with biopsy in the setting of VP shunt.
The differential diagnosis for this diffuse adenopathy is tuberculosis, Brucella, Coxiella, lymphoma and sarcoidosis, to name a few.
She has been ruled out for lymphoma by biopsy.
She will continued to be followed by serial CT scans to monitor the extent of her adenopathy as an outpatient.
Hypercalcemia:  The patient has known hypercalcemia in the setting of a relatively normal PTH with normal vitamin B25 levels with vitamin B125 levels pending.
Outpatient ________ will be followed on send-out labs to determine a cause for her hypercalcemia.
Right atrial thrombus:  The patient has a known right atrial thrombus.
The patient will need to be followed with serial echocardiograms to monitor clot progression.
The patient at this point has not been anticoagulated secondary to recent history of intracranial bleed as discussed in prior discharge summaries.
Additionally, the length of the antibiotic treatment associated with intermittent fevers in terms of the vancomycin therapy is due to a presumed endovascular infection in the setting of a positive MRSA line tip with a known right atrial thrombus.
Diabetes type 1:  The patient has very labile blood sugars depending upon her nutritional intake.
Hypertension:  The patient came in with a significant hypertension emergency complicated by intracranial bleed.
At the present time her blood pressures are well controlled with hemodialysis and fluid removal.
Sacral decubitus ulcer:  The patient has a known sacral decubitus ulcer.
She is receiving vitamin C and zinc for nutritional supplementation.
She will need to have continued wound care of her sacral decubitus ulcer.
The patient has a poor appetite and associated nausea and vomiting with a known history of diabetic gastroparesis.
in the setting of reduced creatinine clearance.
Nutrition recommended the following:  Diabetic and renal diet.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has significant risk factors for coronary artery disease.
Beta blocker and ACE inhibitor have been held secondary to hypotension.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Right thalamic/basal ganglia intracranial bleed.
Hypertensive emergency.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus line tip infection.
Clostridium difficile colitis.
Right atrial thrombus.
q. day as needed for constipation.
