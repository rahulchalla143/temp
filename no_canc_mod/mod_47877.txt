Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]                       Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 16955**]  Admission Date:  [**2125-10-26**]     Discharge Date: [**2125-11-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-7-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  ADDENDUM:  HOSPITAL COURSE:  Starting at [**2125-11-5**]: The patient had a negative transthoracic echocardiogram and initially refused a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out bacterial endocarditis.
The patient got a temporal hemodialysis catheter for hemodialysis planning for permanent tunnel catheter within the next few days.
It was decided to wait for five additional days from the day of the catheter tip was positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus until placement of the permanent tunneled catheter.
The patient got a permacath placed on [**2125-11-8**], and underwent hemodialysis through that, however, his course was complicated by bleeding from permacath site.
The patient continued exhibiting a lot of behavioral issues such as ripping out an intravenous while blood products were running and having blood spill all over the floor, smoking in his room, being absent from the hospital for hours at a time, all of which were appropriately addressed with the patient.
SWAT team were called to aid with behavioral issues and to help in management of this patient.
The cultures came back positive with VRE necessitating removal of the tunneled catheter placement.
The patient also had a transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2125-11-19**], which was read as cannot exclude vegetations on aortic and mitral valves and therefore consistent with endocarditis necessitating six weeks therapy with Linezolid.
End stage renal disease - Hemodialysis - The patient had multiple hemodialysis lines and tunneled catheters as above.
The patient did not exhibit any symptoms of uremia or severe fluid overload.
The patient had permanent hemodialysis catheter placed and then discontinued due to development of VRE infection.
The patient did not have any more episodes of bleeding per rectum and it is recommended to repeat a flexible sigmoidoscopy within the next four to eight weeks.
HIV/AIDS - The patient continued on Atovaquone prophylaxis for toxo and PCP .
Lower extremity pain - The patient complained of bilateral feet tenderness.
Due to end stage renal disease, higher doses of Colchicine could not be given to the patient.
The patient experienced some relief, however, pain still persisted.
Since the patient also started complaining of bilateral wrist pain, it is unlikely that this is gout.
