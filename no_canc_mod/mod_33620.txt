Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: repair of right subclavian artery aa and hematoma evacuation with right clavicular wedge resection [**2108-6-9**]   History of Present Illness: 81M LVEF 25%, mult CABG, MVR, DM, AF on coumadin, [**Hospital 78816**] transferred from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital6 5016**] with R.SC artery pseudoaneurysm after attempted R.SC CVL.
An attempt to enter R subclavian vein for central line placement resulted in R subclavian artery puncture.
He is s/p R sublclav exploration, arteriotomy closure, clavicle rsxn, & hematoma evac on [**6-9**].
He has been continued on vancomycin, flagyl and cipro from [**6-9**] to [**6-12**] for sepsis of unclear source of infection.
No leukocytosis and afebrile here.
He is being transferred to the medicine service due to persistent O2 requirement, thought to be secondary to congestive heart failure.
Past Medical History: PMH: - CAD s/p CABG [**2088**], re-do CABG [**2101**] with MV bioprosthetic replacement [**2-25**] bacterial endocarditis - Dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 30% - Chronic AFib with permenent pacemaker (VVI type).
- HTN - DMII (insulin dependent, uncontrolled) - CKD Stage 3-4 (no L kidney) - Anemia - Arthritis .
shoulder and arm pain [**11-2**] Skin: ecchmosis of rt.
neck anterior chest, back rt side and arm and hand with 3-4 + swelling HEENT: pin point pupuls, sluggish but reactive, no JVD, no carotid bruits Lungs: crackles @ left base Heart: RRR, no mumur, gallop ,rub ABD; protuberant, nontender, nodistended BS active EXT: RUE larger than left.rt.
supraclavicular area full but soft.
( later on rexamination unable to move arm or feel his hand) Neuro: orient to time,place ,person, mild disoriention secondary to narcotic effect and pain, not able to participate in full neuro exam.
R.UE U/S: [**6-8**] IMPRESSION: 2 cm pseudoaneurysm off of the right subclavian artery, within the large hematoma in this region.
[**2108-6-8**]: EKG Regular ventricular pacing with ventricular ectopy.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CXR [**2108-6-12**]: IMPRESSION: Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions with stable severe cardiomegaly.
No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions.
Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests increased pulmonary venous pressure.
ECHO [**2108-6-14**]:The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial (intravalvar) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Small amount of ascites and right-sided pleural effusion.
Moderate splenomegaly.
EKG [**6-17**]:Regular ventricular pacing with underlying atrial fibrillation.
Single right kidney, with renal cortical thinning but normal echogenicity.
CXR [**2108-6-24**]:FINDINGS: Cardiomegaly and bilateral effusions are again noted.
Accounting for some positioning differences, I see no significant interval change.
Pt initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for R subclavian pseudoaneurysm repair, transferred to the MICU for hypotension, somnolence, and increasing oxygen requirement.
1)Hypoxia: likely secondary to CHF exacerbation in the setting of chronic co2 retention.
Torsemide was restarted at low doses, but became dehydrated so was held as of [**6-25**].
Diamox was added along with torsemide for high bicarb, but studies have shown that this does not add any benefit in heart failure patients so it was stopped.
He was found to be [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing at night, so we have maintained him on BiPAP 12/8 with moderate benefit.
He does continue to have continued O2 requirement however, possibly due to atelectasis vs continued volume overload and hypercapnea.
He was ruled out for aspiration by speech and swallow on [**6-25**], and although he has improved from initial MICU transfer, respiratory status will still need to be addressed.
No evidence of sepsis, thought to be secondary to diuresis.
3)Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient has stage 3 CKD at baseline.
4)Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Likely exacerbated by significant amount of fluids he received during peri-operative period.
Repeat ECHO with global systolic hypokinesis with LVEF 30-40%.
5)Right upper extremity weakness: Likely brachial plexus injury in the setting of recent R subclavian pseudoaneurysm repair.
In addition, pt has a volar split that should remain in place during the night and for 2 hours/off/on during the daytime hours.
If weakness persists, pt should have further evaluation by neurology with perhaps and EMG.
Patient is already on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
# Pseudoaneurysm: Iatrogenic R axillary artery PSA and hematoma from OSH in setting of central line placement.
With e/o cholelithiasis, no abdominal pain.
Pt underwent RUQ u/s for further evaluation which found no cause.
In addition, wife states pt tends to be sleepy during the day and this is not new.
9)FEN: dysphagia diet, speech and swallow cleared.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lasix 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO daily PRN: PRN for weight gain or leg swelling.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Major: right subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm - iatrogenic right axillary hematoma - iatrogenic right axillary-brachial plexus injury - iatrogenic history of ischemic heart disease acute on chronic systolic heart failure upper extremity, catheter-related deep vein thrombosis delirium .
