A Duplex was done of graft which showed a patent graft femoral dorsalis pedis on the right.
The patient underwent an arteriogram on [**2136-12-31**] which demonstrated a patent aorta and bilateral common external and internal iliac arteries.
There was a patent popliteal with mild (less than 50%) stenosis of the above-knee popliteal just above the joint.
There were extremely calcified tibial vessels.
The patient had a patent anterior tibial and a patent tibial peroneal trunk.
There was a focal occlusion at the origin of the peroneal which reconstructed.
There was an occlusion at the origin of the posterior tibialis with a diseased vessel distally.
The anterior tibial and posterior tibialis were occluded.
The peroneal was with multiple areas of mild stenosis.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (a cardiologist) evaluated the patient for perioperative risk assessment.
The patient underwent a Persantine MIBI which demonstrated the patient's stress portion of the Persantine MIBI was negative for electrocardiogram or anginal symptoms.
Both stress and resting images showed no definite perfusion defects.
There was severe global hypokinesis.
The patient was assessed as a class III for surgery; at an increased risk, but there was no obvious ischemia on the Persantine MIBI, and the patient was considered safe to proceed with surgery but to continue all of his current medications.
Postoperatively, there were no significant electrocardiogram changes.
An echocardiogram was done which revealed no significant effusions or evidence of tamponade; although there was diminished left ventricular function, but this was unchanged from a preoperative echocardiogram, and the right ventricle did not appear dilated and was normal.
The patient suffered a transient ischemic attack.
Epinephrine was given and continued resuscitation with return of a bounding pulse with good normalization of his end-tidal carbon dioxide.
