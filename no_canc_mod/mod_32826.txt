Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old right handed man with atrial fibrillation previously on coumadin (and ASA).
According to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 81916**] note (because the patient is currently intubated and ventilated), he had a history of multiple falls, and he presented to [**Hospital3 25148**] Center on [**2187-12-19**] with left hip and leg pain.

Contact[**Name (NI) **] family: health care proxy confirmed he is Full code  This 79 yo man was admitted with bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage to the ICU intubated.
His ICU course was complicated by PNA and UTI that were treated with full courses of antibiotics.
His ICU course was also complicated by persistent HTN and tachycardia.
Efforts to elucidate secondary causes of HTN were unrevealing.
Once transferred to the general floor, he remained afebrile and his BP and HR remained well controlled.
His lipid panel was elevated and so his dose of home pravastatin was increased.
Per discussion with both his family and PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] history of multiple falls recently precludes him from re-starting his coumadin despite his AF.
His neurological exam on discharge was notable for ongoing disorientation, mild right NLF flattening, moving all ext antigravity, though probably with some weakness R > L, upgoing toes bilaterally, and able to transfer from bed to chair with max assist, but unable to functionally ambulate.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: intraventricular hemorrhage sleep apnea   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You have had a bleed into your brain ventricles, and your coumadin was stopped.
Because of your history of recurrent falls, it will not be restarted.
Please return to the ER if you experience any sudden weakness, change in sensation, vision, or language, any severe headaches, vertigo, or anything else that concerns you seriously.
