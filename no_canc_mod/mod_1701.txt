Patient was admitted [**Date range (1) 12728**] with sepsis due to Klebsiella bacteremia.
Source of Klebsiella infection was not known, but was thought to be from pneumonia seen as retrocardiac opacity on CXR.
He was intubated during that admission for airway protection and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
In the ED patient found to have ARF with creat 7.3, [K+] 5.1.
CT showed right UVJ stone, right perinephric stranding, left ureteral stone, and hydronephrosis.
He was also found to have UTI and was started empirically on Vanc/Levo/Ceftriaxone.
Despite nephrostomy tube placement, patient continued to have ongoing oliguric renal failure, which renal felt was due to persistant obstruction vs ATN.
On [**2123-6-17**]- Pt also complained of right wrist pain/swelling and subsequently was found to have septic wrist.
Past Medical History: CVA - [**2117**] with residual right-sided weakness post-concussive syndrome OSA - on 2L NC during day and night; refused home CPAP CAD - s/p MI in 3 yrs ago CHF - diastolic dysfunction Anemia - [**8-24**] EGD with gastritis, colonoscopy with diverticulosis Depression s/p right shoulder surgery s/p knee replacement s/p bilateral nephrostomy tube placement  Social History: He lives with his wife; daughter lives downstairs.

Left lower lobe atelectasis is slightly improved.
Moderate left effusion is unchanged  [**2123-6-16**] echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricle may be mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Status post left nephrostomy.
New 1.2-cm oval-shaped focal density, which may be related to recent nephrostomy.
Persistent left ureteral stone and right obstructing UVJ stone, measuring 3 mm with hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
No obstructing right renal stones.
WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):    No significant growth.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
[**6-11**] bld Cx positive for coag + staph  [**6-12**] urine Cx positive for coag + staph  [**6-12**] positive MRSA screen   Brief Hospital Course: MICU course: Pt was admitted to the MICU after he underwent R ureteral stent placement, but became difficult to wean from the vent post-operatively, and also was found to have MRSA bacteremia.
He also grew out MRSA from his urine as well, and also from his R wrist.
Plastic surgery was consulted for his R septic wrist, and he went to the OR for washout of this joint.
He had a TTE, which was negative for vegetation.
Renal service was consulted, and pt was believed to have ARF secondary to both recent obstructions as well as ATN.
He became hypertensive to 150's-160's during the end of his MICU course, and his metoprolol was uptitrated.
Pt was maintained nutritionally by tube feeds while intubated, but began to have thickened liquids after extubation.
Pt had minor R leg pain prior to leaving the ICU, but this pain resolved spontaneously.
RLE u/s was negative for DVT.
Acute renal failure- The pt has a baseline creatinine of 1.7-1.9.
On CT scan, pt found to have obstructing R UVJ stone and left ureteral stone.
He was also found to have MRSA UTI and is being treated with vancomycin.
Despite nephrostomy tube placement and stent, pt continued to have renal failure.
This was thought to be due to persistent obstruction and ATN.
Septic wrist- S/P surgical irrigation and debridement.
Wound not erythematous or indurated.
Last wound Cx on [**6-17**] showed coag neg staph.
CAD S/P MI 3 years ago and CVA in [**2117**] with residual R sided weakness.
No active issues currently.
Pt has resolving left pleural effusion.
No JVD, crackles or LE edema on exam.
CXR showed mod left effusion is unchanged from previous studies today.
[**Name (NI) 3674**] Pt has history of iron deficiency anemia.
