Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The interatrial septum is markedly thickened around the fossa ovale secondary to lipomatous hypertrophy.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-5-17**], the interatrial septum and right atrium are better visualized, and the mass in the right atrium is now seen clearly to be secondary to lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.
Right popliteal DVT extending to the calf veins.
Partially occlusive DVT in the left popliteal [**Last Name (LF) 5703**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be subacute, with extension to the calf veins.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2162-5-22**]): No evidence for acute hemorrhage or acute transcortical infarction.
Diffusely fatty liver markedly limits evaluation for focal liver lesion although no large liver lesion is identified.
No evidence of ascites.
LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2162-5-31**]): Partially occlusive DVT in the left popliteal [**Month/Day/Year 5703**], which has not significantly changed from [**2162-5-16**].
PLAIN FILMS LEFT HIP AND FEMUR ([**2162-6-1**]): There is severe degenerative change of the lower lumbar spine.
There are mild degenerative changes of the hip joints.
No fracture is identified.
Incidental note is made of a sclerotic lesion in the distal femur of unclear etiology.
Does the patient have a history of primary malignancy or metastatic disease?
18.7 cm hematoma in left vastus lateralis muscle.
Bilateral femoral head avascular necrosis.
Sclerotic femur diaphysis lesion atypical for metastasis though should be followed radiographically.

-Blood and urine cultures: NEGATIVE on [**4-13**], [**5-21**], [**5-22**], [**5-25**], [**5-28**]  Brief Hospital Course: A 67 yo man with history of NSCLC s/p resection, EtOH, h/o DVTs on coumadin until one month PTA, recent GIB, now transferred from OSH with respiratory distress and multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli.
At the time of admission, he was in respiratory distress with evidence of right-heart strain on echo.
Given lower extremity clot burden, IVC filter was placed.
On [**5-17**], TPA was administered for suspected right atrial clot (later found to be lipomatous hypertrophy of interatrial septum).
Although he was tachycardic, he was not diaphoretic or agitated and his tachycardia was felt to be due to PE as above, rather than alcohol withdrawal.
He did not require benzodiazepines or CIWA scale monitoring.
# Ventilator associated pneumonia: He began spiking fevers on [**5-19**] with sputum growing GNR and staph (found to be pansensitive Citrobacter freundii, sparse Aeromonas and sparse coag+ staph).
# Clostridium dificile colitis: This was found on stool studies from [**5-18**].
# Recent GIB: Anticoagulation had been stopped one month PTA for GIB.
He was restarted on anticoagulation during this admission for DVT and PE.
Of note, he was found to be guiaic positive during this admission, with brown stools (non-melanotic, non-bloody).
Also, of note, he underwent abdominal ultrasound to evaluate extent of liver disease, also to evaluate for portal hypertension and assess risk for varices.
The ultrasound showed no ascites, a diffusely fatter liver, and mild splenomegaly.
# Anemia: This is a macrocytic anemia with stabilization of hematocrit in the mid to high 20s.
His anemia is likely a combination of marrow suppression from acute illness and iron deficiency from recent GIB and poor nutrition.
Due to persistent oozing from the left nostril, ENT was consulted.
We felt that this was likely secondary to infection and acute inflammatory response.
Platelet levels can be followed up as outpatient after his infection has been treated.
# Left leg pain and hematoma: He worked with physical therapy and complained of leg pain over the lateral aspect of his left thigh.
On exam there was tenderness over the left lateral quadriceps muscle, with small amount of swelling/induration on left compared to right; there was no clear hematoma or skin discoloration.
There was concern of extension of DVT versus fracture, given that he said he had fallen on his left leg prior to admission.
Plain films of the left hip and femur showed sclerotic lesion in the distal femur so MRI was done for further evaluation.
This showed an 18 cm hematoma in the left lateralis muscle.
The femoral sclerotic lesion was felt to be atypical for metastases, but radiology has recommended follow-up imaging in four months.
In addition, vascular was curbsided and felt that the hematoma could be followed clinically.
We have switched anticoagulation to heparin drip to allow for ease of stopping anticoagulation if the hematoma grows in size.
Meanwhile, we have outlined the area of induration with marker (measuring 22cm in length and 8cm in width on our exam) and recommended that patient have follow-up imaging with ultrasound in 2 to 3 days to assess for interval change.
Daily CBC monitoring as well will be important to assess for progression.
# FEN: He was progressed to normal diet, with ground solids and nectar prethickend liquids.

You were found to have extensive blood clots in the arteries in the lungs on both sides.
You were intubated and treated with medicines to thin the blood and prevent new blood clots from forming.
The hospital course was complicated by development of pneumonia (treated with antibiotics) and bacterial infection in the gut (also treated with antibiotics).
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or distention, or any other new concerning symptoms.
