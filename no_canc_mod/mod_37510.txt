The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2174-5-24**] with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (while on Sotalol, beta blocker, and ICD) associated with syncope while sitting in his chair at home.
The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, orthopnea, LE edema or any further episodes of syncope.
In the cath lab, found to have inferoposterior and posterolateral scars, however he is presenting with hypotension.
During the procedure two different ventricular tachycardias were induced which degenerated into ventricular fibrilliation and shocked, and both foci were radio frequency ablated.
The patient has poor lower extremity pulses at baseline and continues to do so post ablation.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.

likely fluid overload.
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
The pacemaker defibrillator leads terminate in right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricular epicardial vein.
There is bilateral hilar prominence with some minimal perihilar opacities, findings that might be consistent with mild volume overload.
In addition, there are bibasal interstitial opacities that although might represent part of vascular engorgement, may also be attributed to chronic interstitial changes and should be reevaluated after diuresis.
Small amount of bilateral left more than right pleural effusion is present.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

A   potential cause could have been general anesthesia he tolerated the procedure underlying poor baseline systolic function secondary to systolic congestive heart failure.
# Ventricular tachycardia- Patient with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, now with ICD in place.
# Respiratory Acidosis - Patient did not look short of breath on presentation.
In fact, the ABG sample which indicates respiratory acidosis was done intra operatively under anesthesia .
The patient never felt short of breath in CCU and his O2 saturation  on room air was [**Last Name (un) 8585**] 96&.
#Left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass/PVD- Had poor lower extremity pulses which is consistent with baseline (1+ Left DP and 1+ Right DP) .
We Considered vascular consult if patient has cold extremities or any other signs of very poor perfusion.
#Ventricular fibrillation - has [**2168**] and [**2170**] Biventricular ICD-[**Company 1543**] .
#CHF-Continued home medications, but held Eplerenone,Torsemide, and Isosorbide,   for now because patient is hypotensive .
