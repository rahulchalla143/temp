Was in USOH when at 8PM tonight noted anginal equivalent only increased in intensity (SSCP radiating to L arm).
Taken to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where found to have Wide-complex tachycardia.
Rhythm appeared to convert to sinus when he was loaded on stretcher for EMS and symptoms resolved.
Since then has had no further episodes of AF and no further CP or SOB.
On cardiac review of symptoms, in addition to above, patient notes stable 2 pillow orthopnea, no PND or claudication.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -> CAD: NSTEMI [**2172**] PCI- DES of the r-PLV and LCx/OM, [**10-29**] PCI- BMS to LAD; [**2174**]- PCI ([**Hospital1 3278**]) [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for possible ISR -> Aortic Stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.07, mean Grad 21 mmHg), EF 50% on ETT [**2172**] -> Atrial Fibrillation 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: [**2172**]- CVA with residual speech difficulties Anemia GIB Anxiety Appendectomy Right Inguinal hernia  Social History: Married with 1 adult son.
Family History: Father died of a myocardial infarction in his early 70's.
His brother died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 39.
Physical Exam: Gen: Pleasant, in NAD, able to follow commands HEENT: No conjunctival pallor.
II/VI systolic murmur best at USB.
Grossly intact, no focal deficits.
Discharge exam: 97.3  111/61   72   96% RA HEENT: No conjunctival pallor.
II/VI systolic murmur best at USB.
Grossly intact, no focal deficits.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to akinesis of the basal septum and hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
There is considerable beat-tobeat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed diffuse calcified coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had mild disease.
The LAD had widely patent stents, and total occlusion of a moderate sized diagonal seen on prior catheterization from [**2173-11-11**].
The distal 70% stenosis of the LAD was unchanged versus prior.
The LCX had a widely patent stent, and mild luminal irregularities.
The RCA was a large vessel, with moderate calcification and serial 40-50% stenoses.
There was a large RPL that had a 60% stenosis in the mid-vessel, which was unchanged compared with prior.
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with mean gradient of 18 mmHg and estimated aortic valve area of 1.0 cm2.
There were elevated left and right-sided filling pressures with mean RA pressure of 15, mean PCWP of 35 mmHg, and LVEDP of 29 mmHg.
Cardiac output was mildly depressed at 4.0 L/min.
Bilateral renal cysts.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
PT     PTT  INR(PT) 14.4* 28.6   1.2*  Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old gentleman with coronary artery disease with PCI in [**2174**], hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, presented with rest angina in the setting of rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia.
# CORONARIES:  Presenting chest pain was concerning for unstable angina.
Diagnostic left heart cath showed patent coronaries with prior stents in place, no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
# RHYTHM:  Episodes of wide complex tachycardia concerning for ventricular tachycardia, orginating from left ventricular or right ventricular outflow tract.
Electrophysiology study/intervention deferred in setting of highly calcific aorta and moderate aortic stenosis.
Patient then remained in persistent atrial fibrillation.
# PUMP:  Known moderate/severe aortic stenosis in our system and currently on exam.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual as directed as needed for chest pain.
Disp:*6 vils* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular Tachycardia Non ST elevation Myocardial Infarction   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: You had a dangerous heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia and was started on sotolol, a medicine to prevent this rhythm.
You will be on antibiotics to prevent an infection at the ICD site for 3 days.
You also had a cardiac catheterization that showed extensive blockages in your coronary artery.
Sotolol: to prevent ventricular tachycardia 2.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if your ICD fires, if you have any redness, swelling, tenderness or bleeding at the ICD site, if you have any chest pain, fevers, chills or trouble breathing.
