HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year-old male with a history of bronchiectasis in his usual state of health until five days prior to admission and he noticed onset of increased shortness of breath with increased sputum production.
However, his symptoms progressed and he was increasingly short of breath to the point where he fell with no loss of consciousness and did not hit anything, however, the patient's wife called EMS.
In the Emergency Department the patient was found to be in respiratory distress with a respiratory rate in the 40s, tachypneic, lethargic, mildly confused, weak and using accessory muscles for inspiration.
Chest x-ray revealed a question of right lower lobe and left lower lobe infiltrates.
This also showed bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and was started on Levaquin 500 mg intravenous for pneumonia.
After intubation the patient became hypotensive 80s/40s and was given 2 liters of boluses without an effect.
He was started on Neo-synephrine for hypotension and a right eye IJ line central line placement in the Emergency Room.
Prior to these interventions the patient was denying chest pain or abdominal pain.
Chronic bronchitis.
Bronchiectasis intubated seven years ago for a pneumonia.
See Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] pulmonary function tests in [**2109-9-15**], which showed decreased FVC, decreased FEV1, 58% predicted, consisted with a restrictive pattern.
Large hiatal hernia.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral resection of the prostate.
Pulmonary left lower lobe rhonchi anteriorly.
Scattered expiratory wheezes.
Urinalysis negative.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120s.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Therefore the patient was admitted with chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis with likely pneumonia and sepsis.
In terms of his cardiac function his CK was elevated, but the thought that there was increased demand on the heart, so we cycled the CKs with a low suspicion of heart disease.
However, he was tachycardic and in atrial fibrillation, question of new onset.
In terms of his bilateral pleural effusions that were seen on chest x-ray, it was felt that there may be secondary to an element of congestive heart failure, although there is no history of heart failure.
The patient was hypotensive and intravascularly volume depleted secondary to infection and given the septic condition required aggressive hydration with boluses.
He was hyperkalemic and hypophosphatemic, which was consistent with a hyperparathyroid picture and we continued to fluid replete and follow his electrolytes for this.
We had to change his vent settings quite a bit due to the increased oxygen need.
On hospital day number three EP was asked to see the patient due to atrial fibrillation that had now slowed down to a rate of 52.
On hospital day number three Xigris was started for septic shock.
An echocardiogram was obtained, which showed an EF of 55% with mild aortic regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Zol pads were placed on the patient for bradycardia, but we did not need them at the time and per cardiologies recommendation we discontinued the Levophed and changed him to Dobutamine.
On hospital day number four Atropine was given due to bradycardia in the 30s with good effect and the patient's urine output remained poor under 30 cc an hour, but responded to 500 cc boluses at a time.
On hospital day number eight the decision was made to start the patient on heparin for anticoagulation given new onset of atrial fibrillation.
His white count was steadily increasing from 3.3 up to 8, however, it was still considered to be in significant central [**Doctor Last Name **] was changed over the wire due to a question of increasing white blood cells.
A chest CT was obtained and it showed bibasilar dense opacities consistent with aspiration, small bilateral pleural effusions.
The thought was that his persistent elevated temperatures may have been due to drug fever, so the antibiotic choice was changed to Levofloxacin.
Four days after starting the heparin we noted that the patient had hematuria with clots in the Foley so the heparin was discontinued.
On hospital day number eleven the patient had a temperature spike again up to 101.6 and was cultured, but was continued on Levaquin.
However, the concern was for gram negative rods growing in the sputum culture, so the concern was for Pseudomonas and Zosyn was started.
After no further bleeding was noted the decision was made to restart the heparin.
This was consistently a problem though with hematuria restarting on the following day and clots found in his Foley and the heparin had to be discontinued again.
A bronchoscopy was performed on hospital day number fourteen and showed moderate secretions in the left bronchus that were cleared.
The patient was given Diltiazem intravenous for persistent atrial fibrillation that he was now becoming tachycardic.
The patient denied any further complaints of shortness of breath and also denied chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
The patient gradually improved throughout the rest of his hospital course and remaining afebrile and his physical examination markedly improving with only a few scattered crackles on his chest examination.
We then started him on Coumadin for anticoagulation due to the new development of atrial fibrillation that was now rate controlled.
He was afebrile and vital signs were stable with a pulse of 95 and had heart rate that was irregular.
The consensus was that he had the episode of acute respiratory distress while on the floor likely secondary to a mucous plug that was suctioned and since then has remained well.
We continued the patient on his current medications, which included Coumadin for anticoagulation, Metoprolol for rate control and we obtained a neurological consult due to decline in mental status and possible development of dementia.
They thought that this was most likely due to the pneumonia and the hypoxia and as that was treated the patient should respond well to that.
Their final diagnosis was toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of Intensive Care Unit.
A head CT was performed that was consistent with prior microvascular disease and no further studies were necessary.
He remained afebrile throughout this time.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Return if shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and any difficulty breathing at all.
The patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], with endocrinology due to his hyperparathyroidism and should also follow up with his cardiologist who plans to cardiovert once he is stable as an outpatient.
