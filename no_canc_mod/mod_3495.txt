History of Present Illness: This 80 year old man with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica on chronic steroids and aortic stenosis that has been followed by serial echocardiograms for many years.
Dyspnea with limited amounts of activity and several episodes of exertional lightheadedness with no syncope.
Past Medical History: Severe Aortic stenosis Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Polymyalgia rheumatica on chronic steroids Recent nose bleeds requiring cauterization (aspirin since d/c'd) Thrombocytopenia GERD Right sided sciatica Gout Hard of hearing (right sided hearing aid) Carpal tunnel syndrome bilaterally (wearing splints at night) Arthritis Right shoulder surgery for a "separation"   Social History: lives with his wife and is retied.
nonfocal exam Pulm: CTA-bilat CV: RRR, no murmur.
2+ pedal edema bilat  Pertinent Results: [**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT BP (mm Hg): 129/69  Wgt (lb): 207 HR (bpm): 56  BSA (m2): 2.10 m2 Indication: Aortic valve disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Left ventricular function.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
No resting or Valsalva inducible LVOT gradient.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and excellent global biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-2-6**], the aortic valve gradient is slightly higher.

Central pulmonary vascular congestion has significantly improved.
He had some post-operative bleeding and was transfused with several units of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and received Protamine with resolution of bleeding.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued per cardiac surgery guidelines without complication.
By the time of discharge on post-operative day 6 the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
