Name:  [**Known lastname 9114**], [**Known firstname 4465**]                      Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 9115**]  Admission Date:  [**2105-4-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2105-4-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2047-10-19**]     Sex:  F  Service:  SUMMARY OF CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS:  The patient was taken to catheterization and was found to have significant diffuse coronary artery disease.
Two lesions were stented, however, this patient does have unresolved coronary artery disease in multiple coronary arteries.
From the calf films at this time, she is not clearly a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting, yet none of the remaining lesions were of significant hemodynamic compromise to warrant stenting.
The question of stress testing for secondary prevention in the near future as well as repeat echocardiography is left to the following cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9116**].
