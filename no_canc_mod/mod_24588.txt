Patiet reports last evening while watching television, he developed a left temporo-parietal headache [**2177-7-8**] in severity.
He reports upon arriving to work, he had difficulty concentrating and occasional difficulty getting words out.
He stated he could understand what people were saying to him, and generally could speak fluently, but occasionally would have word-finding difficulties, and felt generally "confused."
Upon arrival he reports persistent headache.
No neck pain, diplopia, visual changes, weakness, numbness, paresthesias, bowel or bladder changes.

HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
Occasional word finding difficulties and paraphasic errors.
Difficulty [**Location (un) 1131**], unable to read right half of sentences and makes paraphasic errors on left side of text.
+ R inferior quadrantsonopsia.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
Graphasthesia intact.
-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally, but misses target, appears to be secondary to visual difficulties.
Stable appearance of a left parietotemporal hemorrhage with expected minimal increase in surrounding vasogenic edema, causing effacement of sulci.
There is no midline shift or herniation.
There is no new area of hemorrhage.
Unremarkable intracranial vasculature without evidence of AVM.
If underlying etiology for hemorrhage remains unclarified, followup is recommended to further elucidate cause.
Mild paranasal sinus disease  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST: Left temporal hematoma with surrounding edema.
Minimal peripheral enhancement is compatible with reaction to the bleeding itself.
The possibility of underlying neoplasm or vascular malformation cannot be excluded.
No evidence of new large intracranial hemorrhage after surgery.
Left temporoparietal hemorrhage is not larger, and demonstrates decreasing density, consistent with evolving blood products.
Surrounding vasogenic edema which causes diffuse effacement of the cerebral sulci is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50-year-old right-handed male with history of hypertension, presenting with onset of headache last evening, followed by word-finding difficulties and "confusion" while at work on day of admission.
His examination was  notable for occasional word-finding difficulties, paraphasic errors, difficulty with repetition, finger agnosia, acalculia, R/L discrimination difficulties, and R inferior quadrantsonopsia.
He was found to have a 3.0 x 2.7 cm left parietotemporal intraparehchymal hemorrhage on CT head.
He was admitted to the neurology service he continued to have halting but fluent speech and severe anomia.
Head CT and brain MRI was significant for left parietotemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
The angiogram showed an AVM in the left parietotemporal area.
Given the fact that the patient had a previous hemorrhage from this AVM, he was recommended to have a craniotomy to remove the AVM which occurred on [**2-7**] without complications.
A follow up angiogram on [**2-10**] showed no residual avm.
Outpatient Occupational Therapy Please eval and treat has agnosia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, possible poor insight.
Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) Seconday: 1. hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Mild transcortical motor aphasia (impaired naming and fluency with retained comprehension and repetition).
Brain imaging showed that you had bleeding in the left side of your brain called a left parietotemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
You will need either CT scan of the brain or an MRI of the brain and this will be scheduled along with your appt.
