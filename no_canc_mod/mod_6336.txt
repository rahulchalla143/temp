Periventricular white matter small vessel ischemic changes.
Vascular calcifications along aortic arch, carotid bulbs and intracranial carotid arteries bilaterally.
No evidence of high grade stenosis, obstruction of flow or aneurysm seen.
Centrilobular emphysema with several left lung nodules, largest measuring 5-mm.
Debris in upper intrathoracic esophagus.
CXR ([**12-17**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Slight increase in size of acute left thalamic parenchymal hemorrhage, with edema, as well as the amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
Though the apparent slightly increased prominence of the ventricular system may relate to differences in slice selection and angulation, in this setting, finding raises concern for early hydrocephalus; attention should be paid to this on subsequent studies.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 74 year old woman with a history of CAD, hypertension, and type II diabetes mellitus who presented with acute onset right sided weakness and dysarthria, and was found to have a 22x15 mm left thalamic acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
The cause of her hemorrhage was thought to be most likely hypertensive hemorrhage.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Left thalamic acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage, likely hypertensive hemorrhage Hypertension Diabetes Mellitus  SECONDARY: Hypothyroidism Depression   Discharge Condition: Speech fluent, intermittently following commands, does not squeeze right hand, some internal rotation of right leg to noxious, reflexes brisker on the left, flattening of right NLF.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with right arm weakness and slurred speech, and were found to have a left thalamic hemorrhage that is likely due to hypertension.
If you develop confusion, weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, decreased vision or blurry vision, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP or return to the ED.
