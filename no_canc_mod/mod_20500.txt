Admission Date:  [**2119-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-8-9**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dicloxacillin / Cleocin Hcl / Penicillins / Tape / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**] Chief Complaint: unsteady gait, recent fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bilateral subdural burr hole for hemorrhage evacuation  History of Present Illness: This is an 83 y/o gentleman w/ history of a significant fall with head trauma dating back to [**8-29**].
He states he doesn't feel steady on his feet while he walks, not because of weakness but because he feels his balance is "off."
A CT scan at the [**Location (un) 86**] VA showed chronic bilateral large (1.6 cm at greatest thickness) subdural hematomas, no midline shift.
His hospital course has been complicated by decompensated heart failure, delerium, hypoxia/hypercarbia resp distress requiring a transient MICU stay (not intubated).
He has been noted be more confused and somnolent over the past 1-2 days, and has had some loose stools.
Past Medical History: 1) T8-9 three column fracture with pseudarthrosis secondary to ankylosing spondylitis.
2) AS 3) CHF 4) CAD 5) DM 6) CRI 7) Pulm HTN 8) ^chol 9) BPH 10) s/p TCC bladder surgery, requires leg bag 11) [**Last Name (un) 865**] esophagus, h/o duodenal ulcer 12) Asbestosis, restrictive lung disease 13) Follicular thyroid cancer   Social History: lives alone, independent.
No masses or LAD.
No thyromegaly.
No carotid bruits.
No rebound or guarding.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
This finding may be reactive, but correlation with patient's history of malignancy is recommended.
Increased diameter of the main pulmonary artery, suggesting underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure pattern.
Moderate-sized left pleural effusion with associated atelectatic changes [**2119-8-4**] CXR - Persistent right-sided pleural and parenchymal opacities, which could potentially be due to chronic scarring, although an acute process is not excluded without more remote radiographs for comparison.
No significant change since earliest chest x-ray at this institution performed 5 days earlier.
[**2119-8-3**] CXR - Interval increase in pulmonary interstitial edema reflecting likely worsening CHF.
Left lower lobe consolidation, which could be atelectasis or developing pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
[**2119-8-3**] CT Head - Slight increase in size of extraaxial fluid collection since prior study.
There has been some reduction in the degree of pneumocephalus.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No other evidence for failure.
[**2119-7-28**] CT Head - Large bilateral subdural hematomas, causing significant local mass effect on the brain parenchyma.
Old studies are not available to assess for interval change, and there does not appear to be an appreciable hyperdense component to suggest an acute re-hemorrhage.
Cultures: [**2119-7-31**] Urine - No growth [**2119-8-3**] Urine - yeast [**2119-7-31**] Blood - No growth [**2119-8-3**] Blood - pending [**2119-7-31**] Stool - negative for c.diff [**2119-8-1**] Stool - negative for c.diff [**2119-8-2**] Stool - negative for c.diff   Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old male admitted on [**2119-7-28**] for evacuation of chronic subdural hematomas, transferred to the MICU on [**2119-8-3**] ago for respiratory distress found to have pulmonary edema and presumptively treating for aspiration PNA.
Subdural Hematomas: Pt was admitted to Neurosurgery on [**2119-7-28**] for evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas.
Repeat CT after hematoma evacuation showed slight increase in size of extraaxial fluid collection and some reduction in the degree of pneumocephalus.
Hypoxia: On POD#3, pt had an increasing oxygen requirement, increasing from 2L to 4L to BiPAP.
Pt was then transferred to the MICU for hypercarbia resp failure and hypoxia.
He was thought to have an aspiration pneumonia vs CHF.
A CTA of chest was negative for PE and showed on ground glass consistent with CHF.
CTA of chest also showed mildy enlarged pretracheal, paratracheal, prevascular, precarinal, and subcarinal lymph nodes are identified, the largest of these measuring 1.6 cm in diameter.
This finding may be reactive, but correlation with patient's history of malignancy is recommended.
A swallow study showed no evidence of aspiration on video swallow.
Regarding mediastinal lymphadenopathy, please compare it to his previous CT of chest and eval for any further workup.
Diastolic Dysfxn:  As above, pt was noted to be volume overloaded on CTA that was contributing to his hypoxia.
Acute on chronic renal Failure: Pt's baseline creatinine is 1.5 and he was admitted with a cr of 1.7.
As above, he was thought to have an aspiration PNA based on possible opacities on CXR and he was started on levo/flagyl and then switched to ceftriaxone/flagyl.
Somnolence:  Pt was noted to be somnolent post-operatively likely secondary to hypercarbia and infection.
Of note, he is confused at baseline.
Glucose was elevated but controlled with humalog sliding scale.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 25750**]  Discharge Diagnosis: bilateral subdural hematomas s/p evacuation Aspiration pneumonia Congestive heart failure-diastolic dysfunction Acute on chronic renal failure.
Acute renal insufficiency - resolved.
Discharge Condition: stable on 1L nasal cannula (92% on RA), BP well controlled, baseline confused   Discharge Instructions: 1) Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 9034**] office or return to the ED if you have a change in mental status, fevers or drainage from your incisions.
