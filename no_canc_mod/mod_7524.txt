The symptoms recurred and with an ejection fraction of 49%.
The recovery was somewhat complicated by an episode of confusion and short-term memory loss, so a carotid doppler study was done on the patient which showed a 40% stenosis on the left carotid and right carotid was patent.
The patient was complaining about right lower extremity calf pain, so a doppler study was done to rule out deep venous thrombosis.
The study was negative for deep venous thrombosis.
