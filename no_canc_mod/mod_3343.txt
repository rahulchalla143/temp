Admission Date:  [**2174-3-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2174-3-26**]   Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 19013**] is an 80 year old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypothyroidism, and metastatic breast cancer who presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**3-11**], with complaint of transient ischemic attack type symptoms, slurred speech, facial droop, lower extremity tingling and numbness times one to two weeks.
She was admitted for work-up of her neurological symptoms.
During her hospitalization there, she was noted to be in rhabdomyolysis with a CK in the six thousands.
Her initial examination there was only significant for right calf tenderness.
On admission here, she was found to have bilateral compartment syndrome and subsequently underwent bilateral fasciotomy on [**3-17**].
The etiology of her rhabdomyolysis was presumed secondary to either her Mevacor or her hypothyroidism, which was under-treated secondary to non-compliance with her thyroid replacement.
Her postoperative course was complicated by intubation for respiratory distress from fluid overload.
She subsequently had an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of a super-therapeutic PTT while on heparin for presumed deep vein thrombosis.
This resulted in hypotension requiring temporary pressors as well as acute renal failure secondary to ATN.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Transient ischemic attack versus cerebrovascular accident.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Hypothyroidism status post thyroidectomy for goiter in remote past.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Biopsy in [**2171-4-16**], revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma ER and PR positive, HER-2 negative.
No smoking, occasional alcohol.
In general, in no apparent distress, no respiratory distress.
HEENT:  Pupils slightly asymmetric but reactive.
Lungs: Bilateral crackles two-thirds of the way up, diffusely decreased breath sounds.
Cardiac:  Distant heart sounds due to body habitus.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Abdomen:  Difficult examination secondary to obesity.
Soft, nontender, no organomegaly or masses appreciated.
Extremities:  Bilateral lower extremities with medial and lateral fasciotomies, tense edema, erythema and warmth.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   An 80 year old female who presented with rhabdomyolysis to an outside hospital and transferred here with bilateral compartment syndrome, status post bilateral fasciotomies.
Hospital course was complicated by fluid overload, upper gastrointestinal bleed and acute renal failure.
The presence of deep vein thrombosis was unable to be ruled out given lower extremity Dopplers which were difficult to interpret due to her body habitus and edema.
She underwent fasciotomies on [**3-17**], with medial and lateral fasciotomies bilaterally.
Pulmonary:  The patient's postoperative course was complicated by fluid overload and respiratory distress, necessitating intubation.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of super-therapeutic PTT while on heparin.
She does not have known gastrointestinal pathology.
Her gastrointestinal bleed resulted in hypotension requiring pressors temporarily.
Renal:  The patient developed acute renal failure secondary to ATN blamed on her hypotensive episodes status post her upper gastrointestinal bleed.
At the time of dictation, she has undergone three hemodialysis sessions with removal of four kilograms of fluid each time.
She has chronic renal insufficiency at baseline.
Cardiovascular:  The patient with history of hypertension.
After her episode of hypotension requiring pressors had resolved, she was restarted on her anti-hypertensive regimen, which included Lopressor, Isordil and Diltiazem.
Access:  Right internal jugular Quinton for hemodialysis access.
Bilateral compartment syndrome, status post bilateral fasciotomies.
Acute renal failure secondary to ATN secondary to hypotension secondary to gastrointestinal bleed.
Status post intubation for fluid overload postoperatively.
