He complained of severe facial pain and had multiple facial lacerations.
CT scan sinus/head/spine revealed multiple communited nasal and maxillofacial fractures; no spine fx or acute intracranial event.
He transiently desaturated to 88% on 100% NRB with concern for possible aspiration event.
Plastic surgery was consulted and repaired lacerations, reduced fractures.
He also received levofloxacin 500mg x 1 for possible aspiration pneumonia   Past Medical History: - Developmental delay / Mental Retardation - Seizure Disorder - Mood disorder (?
type) - Hypertension - Chronic Hyponatremia - Left ventricular hypertrophy - History of pulmonary edema and ascites - Dyslipidemia - Obstructive sleep apnea, unable to tolerate CPAP   Social History: Unable to live independently, non-smoker.

Within this limitation, there is no definite abnormal cord signal identified.
Specifically, there is no evidence of cord contusion or extra-axial fluid collection to suggest epidural hematoma.
There is no abnormal STIR signal identified on sagittal imaging to suggest ligamentous injury or acute fracture.
Small amount of increased fluid signal anterior to the vertebral bodies likely represents fluid within the nasal and oropharynx due to recent intubation rather than prevertebral or retropharyngeal edema.
This exam was not tailored for degenerative changes, although there is no significant canal stenosis identified at any level.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of ligamentous injury or cord injury identified  CT maxillofacial/ mandible/ sinus: B/L Nasal bone fractures with postero-medial displacement of right sided distal fracture fragment.
Comminuted fracture of the nasal septum with right sided displacement of fracture fragments.
Significant sinus disease.
CT spine: No cervical spine fractures.
B/L lung  consolidations consistent with aspiration  CT head w/o contrast: No hemorrhage, large territorial infarct, or mass effect.
IMPRESSION: Adequate position of the ET and NG tubes   Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo man with h/o epilepsy, psychogenic polydipsia, mental retardation with multiple nasal fractures s/p fall who was electively intubated in the ED due to agitation  Nasal and maxillofacial fractures: Presented with communited fractures of nasal septum that were reduced by plastic surgery in the emergency department.
nothing by straw, avoidance of nose blowing, sneezing with open mouth, throughout hospitalization.
status post mechanical fall: Presented following a mechanical fall with multiple lacerations and nasal fractures (see above).
Patient was placed in a cervical collar until c-spine was cleared by CT spine and MRI (performed due to inability to clinically clear given underlying mental retardation and sedating medication side effects).
Intubated in emergency department due to agitation for laceration repair and reduction of fractures.
Trauma team followed patient with secondary and tertiary survey and determined no further evidence of injury.
status post intubation: As above, patient intubated in emergency department mostly due to agitation.
Reportedly had episode of hypoxia to 88%  on 100% NRB in the ED in the setting of agitation.
Although there was initial concern that this may have represented aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, no clear infiltrate was seen CXR and vent settings were able to be weaned quickly.
Patient was extubated without difficulty and had no further oxygen requirements.
Mood disorder: per ED, agitated and violent, requiring multiple sedatives and eventual intubation.
Following extubation, patient required no further doses of ativan or halidol.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Communited nasal fractures   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital following a mechanical fall with a broken nose and several cuts that needed to be sutured.
Prior to seeing the plastic surgeons make sure that you keep your wounds clean and dry, apply bacitracin ointment to your wounds and do NOT drink through a straw or blow your nose.
