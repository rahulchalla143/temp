Angiography images reveal widely patent bilateral carotid, Circle of [**Location (un) 431**], and vertebrobasilar systems.
The region of hemorrhage does not appear to have an underlying aneurysm.
Source images reveal a filling defect within the left internal jugular vein, seen from the level of the foramen magnum, extending to the left jugular foramen, obliterating the lumen at that point.
Large filling defect in left internal jugular vein and left transverse sinus; the lumen of the left internal jugular vein is obliterated at the level of the foramen magnum.
Large temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild mass effect.
Widely patent arterial structures, without underlying aneurysm seen.
Given the findings above, this hemorrhage may be secondary to a venous infarction; MRI/MR angiography would be helpful in excluding underlying mass lesion as a cause of hemorrhage.
----- MRI head with and without contrast/MRA [**2191-4-19**]: There is a large amount of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, as described on previous imaging.
Edema is seen surrounding this region, causing minor shift of midline structures to the right, and upward displacement of the left parietal lobe.
T1 pre- and post-contrast images show no evidence of underlying mass lesion.
However, there is some abnormal signal intensity in the left transverse sinus,sigmoid sinus and jugular, suggesting slowed flow and/or clot.
Previously identified large left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with edema, causing slight mass effect; no underlying mass lesion identified.
No identified arterial abnormality.
Findings suggest left sided venous occlusive disease, as noted above, which could be the etiology for a large hemorrhagic venous infarction.
----- CT head without contrast [**2191-4-21**]: Again, there is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage occupying much of the left temporal and parietal lobe, causing mass effect and left to right midline shift, which appears slightly increased.
IMPRESSION: Grossly stable amount of large left temporal/parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There appears to be slightly more left to right midline shift, and edema around the hemorrhage.
----- CT head without contrast [**2191-4-22**]: : Again seen is the large left temporal lobe hypodensity with hemorrhagic conversion, which is stable in size.
Also seen is a small amount of subarachnoid blood outlining the ipsilateral sylvian fissure, which is unchanged.
There is no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or new infarct seen.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of left temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage/venous infarction.
----- CT head without contrast [**2191-4-27**]: Hyperdensity in the left temporal lobe has decreased in amount.
There has also been slight interval decrease in edema and mass effect.
Hypodensity in this region indicates developing infarct.
No new regions of intra or extraaxial hemorrhage, new major vascular territorial infarct, or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation is seen.
IMPRESSION: Resolving hemorrhagic infarction of the left temporal lobe.
No new regions of intracranial hemorrhage seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the NeuroICU for evaluation of her left temporoparietal bleed.
Neurology: CT angiogram demonstrated a large filling defect in left internal jugular vein and left transverse sinus; the lumen of the left internal jugular vein was obliterated at the level of the foramen magnum along with a large temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild mass effect.
The arterial structures were widely patent, without underlying aneurysm seen.
Given the findings above, this hemorrhage was felt to be secondary to a venous infarction.
Therefore, she was started on anticoagulation with heparin with a goal PTT of 40-60 to prevent clot proliferation.
Due to her history of generalized tonic clonic seizure prior to admission, she was started on Dilantin.
Cardiology: Patient ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Telemetry monitoring demonstrated no evidence of arrhythmia.
Given nature of venous clot and infarction, anticoagulation was initiated with heparin goal of PTT 40-60 and coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**].
Also demonstrated evidence of dyslexia, dyscalculia, and agraphestesia.
On cranial nerve exam, she has a right visual field defect; she can pick up motion in right field but cannot identify objects or colors when presented to right field.
On motor exam, she has a very mild right hemiparesis but has been cleared by physical therapy.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): To be continued indefinitely for seizure prophylaxis.
Left internal jugular/transverse sinus clot with left temporoparietal venous infarction followed by hemorrhagic transformation.
Hypertension 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
History of ovarian cysts and painful menses 5.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your primary care physician or visit [**Name Initial (PRE) **] local emergency room if you experience worsening headaches, visual changes, focal numbness or weakness, incoordination, seizure activity, or any other worrisome symptoms.
