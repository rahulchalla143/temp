Prenatal course was significant for gross a few weeks behind expected period, initial concern for clubbed feet but follow-up ultrasounds within normal limits.
Four days prior to delivery, an ultrasound showed oligohydramnios and concern for agenesis of the corpus callosum, microcephaly.
GBS positive, maternal antibiotics less than four hours prior to delivery, no maternal fever, no fetal tachycardia, ruptured membranes approximately four hours prior to delivery.
Infant delivery by cesarean section due to nonreassuring fetal heart tracing.
Contractures of both arms and legs (legs more significant than arms) cannot extend legs completely (some increased jitteriness, no clonus).
On day of life number one, the infant required nasal cannula 100 cc, approximately 30% for a mild respiratory distress.
The infant has not had any apnea or bradycardia this hospitalization.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The infant was noted to have a soft murmur on admission.
The infant has been tolerating feedings without difficulty and glucoses have been 60-87.
Due to prenatal history of oligohydramnios a renal ultrasound on day of life number one showed normal kidneys, no abnormalities.
The infant has been voiding without difficulty.
The CBC and differential on admission showed a white blood cell count of 21, hematocrit 45.4%, platelets 314,000, 60 neutrophils, 2 bands.
NEUROLOGY:  An MRI on [**2157-4-13**] revealed simplified gyral pattern with small anterior portion of corpus callosum present (sometimes called microlissencephaly).
