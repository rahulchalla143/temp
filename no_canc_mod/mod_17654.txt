The infant was on CPAP at 6 in room air until [**2119-6-10**] at which time she was reintubated secondary to multiple apneic bradycardiac spells.
However, due to increasing desaturation, slight hypercarbia and decreased volumes on chest x-ray, her settings were slowly increased over the following 1 1/2 weeks to a peak of 25/7 and a rate of 22.
She received one dose of Lasix on [**6-19**] and then received Lasix on [**6-27**] and [**6-29**] due to evidence of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray.
