The patient was in her USOH until 3 weeks PTA when she began experiencing SOB at rest and with exertion, fatigue.
She experiences these symptoms primarily first thing in the morning when she wakes up.
ROS otherwise notable for lower extremity edema over past few months, occasional palpitations for past couple years.
She denies any chest pain or pressure, nausea, diaphoresis, claudication, orthopnea, PND, lightheadedness, any other symptoms.
Therefore, sent for elective cath.
She became brady and hypotensive.
Neo was started then she underwent DCCV x2 again with no effect.
Currently, she complains of bilateral leg pain.
-Hypertension -Hypercholesterolemia -Breast cancer s/p right mastectomy 50 years ago -descending thoracic aortic aneurysm -> 4cm on last CT scan in fall, [**2137**] -infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm -> 3cm -appendectomy -hysterectomy -arthritis -pectus excavatum .
Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia, Hypertension   Social History: Married, social EtOH, no tobacco, no drug use.
Family History: There is no known family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
reg rate rhythm, nl s1s2 no MGR chest: pectus excavatum.
no wheeze, normal effort abd: soft, midline scar, ntnd no masses.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
ETT performed on [**6-11**] date demonstrated: abnormal perfusion c/w infarct involving the basal to mid lateral wall with mild degree of peri-infarct ischemia.
Low noraml left ventricular systolic function with EF 56% and hypokinesis of the lateral to mid-lateral wall.
Nuclear imaging was significant for a basal to mid lateral wall infarct with a mild degree of peri-infarct ischemia.
EF 56% with basal and mid lateral wall hypokinesis.
CARDIAC CATH: LMCA: mild plaques LAD: 99% heavy calcified prox stenosis with 70% mid LAD stenosis, D2 70% stenosis LCX: TO prox with collaterals RCA: 80% ostial stenosis s/p BM stent to LAD stenosis .
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis and inferior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is an 88 year old woman with no prior known CAD, history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, descending thoracic aortic aneurysm, who presents for elective cardiac cath.
Cath showed 3VD and successful stenting of the LAD with a bare metal stent.
She became transiently hypotensive and brady which was c/w vagal episode.
#) CAD: no prior disease despite many risk factors.
#) Rhythm: Had both atrial fibrillation with RVR and evidence for AVNRT during admission.
Her tachycardias were not associated with hypotension on the floor.
#) Pump: Mildly overloaded on exam postcath.
Post cath echo: moderate regional left ventricular dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis and inferior hypokinesis.
She will follow up with EP here for her supraventricular tachycardias.
Outpatient Lab Work INR check [**2-16**] x weekly until INR therapeutic and stable   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: watch [**Doctor Last Name **] care and rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: 3 Vessel Coronary Artery Disease .
atrial fibrillation Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Breast cancer s/p right mastectomy 50 years ago descending thoracic aortic aneurysm -> 4cm on last CT scan in fall, [**2137**] infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm -> 3cm arthritis    Discharge Condition: Ambulatory with assist, needs rehab.
The catheterization showed 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
It was felt that stenting the Left Main would help provide some relief of your shortness of breath.
During the procedure a cardiac arrhythmia was diagnosed, Atrial Fibrillation, which will require the use of a blood thinning medication, Coumadin.
IF you develop further chest pain, shortness of breath, or any signs of bleeding problems, please contact your health care proivders right away.
