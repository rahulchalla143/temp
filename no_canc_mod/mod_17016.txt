Pregnancy was notable for 2 vessel cord noted on ultrasound with otherwise normal ultrasound findings and a normal quadruple screen.
Pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia treated with magnesium, as well as a course of betamethasone which was complete on [**2190-4-23**].
On the evening of delivery, mother experienced worsening blood pressures and then was noted to have a nonreassuring fetal heart tracing.
Rupture of membranes was at delivery and there was no maternal fever or intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis given.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Notable for mother having fetal alcohol syndrome, and currently living with her adoptive mother.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  By systems: Respiratory: On admission, the infant was noted to have moderate respiratory distress due to hyalin membrane disease.
Since weaning from CPAP, he has required intermittent periods of nasal cannula support for spells or work of breathing.
He was treated with caffeine for apnea of prematurity and this was discontinued on day of life 29.
The infant was also noted to have nasal congestion and he was treated with several days of nose drops including phenylephrine, dexamethasone and prednisolone from day of life 14 through day of life 18 with improvement.
A murmur was noted on day of life [**3-21**]; echocardiogram on day of life 4 revealed normal anatomy with a moderate patent ductus arteriosus with continuous left to right flow.
A patent foramen ovale with left to right flow was noted as well.
No further evidence of a PDA has been noted and no further imaging studies have been performed.
Caloric density was gradually increased to a maximum of 150 cc/kg/day of 28 calorie breast milk with additional beta protein.
The infant was noted to have hypoglycemia on admission to the NICU but this resolved with initiation of IV fluid and blood sugars have been normal since that time.
Our plan was to check a set of electrolytes along with nutritional laboratory studies of calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase on day of life 34.
GI: The infant did develop hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy.
Of note, initial CBC at the time of delivery revealed a white count of 4.0, with 20% polys, consistent with mild neutropenia.
The infant did receive 48 hours of oxacillin and gentamicin from day of life 17 to 19 for some mild umbilical erythema for concerns of possible omphalitis.
Blood cx was negative and symptoms resolved, and course was not thought consistent with omphalitis.
The infant is receiving full volume feedings of 150 cc/kg/day of breast milk supplemented to 28 calories per ounce with additional beta proteins given PG with occasional breast feeding.
Chest is clear to auscultation without grunting, flaring or retractions.
Abdomen is soft with active bowel sounds without hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities are warm and well perfused without lesions.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Sepsis evaluation.
Apnea of prematurity.
