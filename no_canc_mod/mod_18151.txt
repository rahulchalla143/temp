Per her daughter who brought her to the clinic, she has been increasing sleepy over the previous 3 days with a decrease in her activity level throughout the day.
She did not hear of any other complaints including no complaints of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness-of-breath.
She presented for her routine follow-up today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10924**] and was found to have a blood pressure in the 80s with confusion and dyspnea was sent emergently to the emergency department.
She was last seen by [**Doctor Last Name **] on [**2166-12-17**] where she had dyspnea but did complain of increased pruritus, weight gain, and difficulty with thoughts.
Chest xray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process and a RUQ US showed only cholelithiasis, no signs of cholecystitis.
She became increasing dyspneic and agitated and was intubated in the emergency room.

There is blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus consistent with a small effusion.
ECHO [**2167-2-6**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2; gradients are higher than usually seen in mild AS because of high stroke volume/cardiac output).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
CT head [**2167-2-5**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
RUQ ultrasound [**2167-2-5**]: IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
Unchanged mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation in the left lobe.
Sinus rhythm.
Diffuse modest ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2167-2-7**] most likely there is no significant diagnostic change.
Compared to tracing #1 there is no significant diagnostic change except for sinus bradycardia.
[**2167-2-5**]: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2167-2-10**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2167-2-10**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
She became hypotensive and required a levophed drip for blood pressure maintanence.
She continued to remain intubated without sedation and neurologically was not responsive.
A liver ultrasound did not have signs of cholecystitis.
With her continued need for vasopressor support without objective culture data demonstrating sepsis and TTE was performed on [**2167-2-6**] which showed hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, mild aortic stenosis and mild pulmonary hypertension.
She further underwent a cardiac cath following her elevation in cardiac enzymes which showed circumflex 80% mid vessel tubular stenosis.
She received a video swallow study which did not show aspiration risk, therefore her diet was advanced.
She was seen by dermatology who determined she has both cutaneous candidasis and psoriasis and recommended a combination of antifungal creams and topical steroids.
She was not treated with systemic anti-fungals due to risk of hepatotoxicity.

6. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1)  Inhalation once a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
