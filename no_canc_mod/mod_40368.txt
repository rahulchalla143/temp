An 80% ostial circumflex lesion was noted at that time but not treated due to proximity to the left main.
He had done well with medical management but has gradually developed worsening exertional angina.
He came in for a cardiac catheterization on [**2142-7-12**] which was significant for a three vessel disease in the right dominant system with a moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
He now presented to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service for elective coronary artery bypass.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for  insulin dependent diabetes, coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty times two and hypertension.
He also has arthritis of the knees and seasonal allergy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
He was started on insulin drip for glycemic control.
He had chest tubes that were placed intraoperatively, however, these had no air leak at that time.
On postoperative day #2 the patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs.
Later on postoperative day #2 the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation which was initially controlled by rate controlling Beta blocker.
On postoperative day #3 the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, however, subsequently his heartrate which was in the 70s in sinus converted to rapid atrial fibrillation.
If the patient continues to go in and out of atrial fibrillation he will need anticoagulation which would be addressed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] on an outpatient basis.
