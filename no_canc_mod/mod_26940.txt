She had hemoptysis but was guiac negative.
CT showed large bilateral PEs.
She received ASA 325mg PO x1, heparin IV, 1LNS, and albuterol and ativan for respiratory distress.
She remained very anxious about her narcotic regimen, so oxycontin 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] was added.
Her husband asked for narcotics for himself, and the house officer refused.

Relevant studies: [**2197-2-12**] Echo - Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis c/w pulmonary embolism.
There are non-diagnostic Q waves in the inferior leads.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Emboli are seen in vessels supplying the right upper, middle and lower lobes, and the lingula, with extension of embolic material into multiple peripheral vessels supplying both lungs.
There are prominent subsegmental PE in vessels supplying the posterior left lower lobe.
Enlarged right ventricle and straightened intraventricular septum consistent with right heart strain.
No pulmonary infarct at this time.
Heterogeneous peribronchovascular nodules in the left upper lobe, could reflect hemorrhage or infectious etiology.
The current study demonstrates known opacities in the left perihilar area consistent with known infection.
There is no interval development of appreciable pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old woman found unresponsive found to have large bilateral PEs and a LUL PNA.
# Pulmonary Emboli/Left thigh hematoma: The patient had extensive bilateral PEs with hypoxia intially requiring 5L NC.
Underlying contributing factors include obesity, smoking, history of PEs, and malignancy.
She may also have a hereditary coagulopathy.
LENIs were negative for DVT.
Echo showed evidence of right heart strain and RV hypokinesis.
Oxygen requirement improved to 3L NC prior to call-out to the medical service.
On the medicine floor, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] remained stable and she no longer had an oxygen requirement by the week before discharge.
Around [**2-20**] the patient developed a large left groin/thigh hematoma.
On ultrasound on  [**2197-2-21**] thigh u/s showed the hematoma to be 8 x 5 x 8 cm.
Because of the hemaocrit drop and increasing size of hematoma, her lovenox was stopped.
Upper extremity ultrasound showed DVT in the distal left brachial veins.
CT angiogram of the thigh showed no active extravasation of blood.
Her hct was stable over these 3 days, so on [**2197-2-27**] she was started on a heparin drip, intially with low goal PTT of 50-70, her hct was stable, and goal was increased to 80.
Given her bleeding earlier in the hospital course, her goal INR is 2-2.5, and she was instructed to return to the hospital with any bleeding, lightheadedness, new hematoma formation.
# Pneumonia: The patient had evidence of a LUL PNA on outside hospital CXR, positive sputum.
She was afebrile with no leukocytosis.
On Monday, [**2197-2-20**], Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had a fever of 101 degrees.
# COPD flare: The patient was started on prednisone 60mg daily burst and this was stopped after five days without consequence.
As an outpatient she will likely need PFTs when she recovers from her acute illness.
She was on a CIWA scale with lorazepam and did not demonstrate any signs of withdrawal.
She later demonstrated symptoms of withdrawal, and this was uptitrated to her total home dose of long- and short-acting opiates.
# Breast Ca: history of breast CA, seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**], thought to be without recurrence.
# Depression:  Patient demonstrated considerable emotional lability.
# HTN: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] received her home dose of metoprolol during her stay.
Lasix was held given inital concern for hemodynamics.
