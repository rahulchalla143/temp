Noted with bilateral lower extremity deformities and decreased pulses.
he was initially taken to an area hospital and was later transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ongoing trauma care.
Given these limitations, however, there is evidence for a slightly displaced right occipital condyle fracture.
The dens is also mildly offset within the C1 body with 1.5 mm distance on the right versus 3 mm on the left.
A displaced fracture is also present extending from the C4 spinous process through the right lamina.
Degenerative changes are also noted throughout the spine.
Evaluation of the soft tissues of the spinal canal is limited by CT, but there is no evidence for acute cord disruption.
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited scan secondary to patient motion, but right occipital condyle and C4 right laminar/spinous process fracture identified.
The possibility of other fracture is not identified given patient motion, repeat imaging is recommended.
Within the limits of this examination, no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, large extra-axial or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or large major vascular territorial infarct is identified.
No displaced skull fractures are seen.
Minor mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Within the limits of this motion-marred study, no large intraparenchymal hemorrhage, large extra-axial hemorrhage, or displaced skull fracture identified.
CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS  Reason: assess for vertebral art injury Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 40 year old man s/p mva w/ C$ fx REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for vertebral art injury CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
Fracture of right lateral mass.
Non-displaced sternal fracture.
CT ANGIO NECK: Both common carotid arteries are normal in appearance, without significant atherosclerotic narrowing or evidence of dissection.
Both vertebral arteries are patent, without evidence of dissection.
No pericardial effusion.
9-mm left soft tissue density just deep to the clavicle, probably representing a lymph node.
Scattered opacification of ethmoid air cells.
Calcified granuloma in right lung apex.
Right occipital condyle fracture.
C4 spinous process fracture and C7 spinous process fracture.
Right C7 lateral mass fracture.
No evidence of vertebral artery dissection.
No evidence of carotid artery dissection.
Calcified granuloma in right upper lobe apex.
MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: r/o cord injury  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 40 year old man with cervical spine fractures REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o cord injury MRI CERVICAL SPINE  CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with cervical spine fracture, rule out cord injury.
FINDINGS: From skull base to T3 level, the spinal cord demonstrates normal intrinsic signal without extrinsic compression or intraspinal hematoma.
There is increased signal seen on the inversion recovery images within the right occipital condyle at the site of fracture seen on the CT.
There is no evidence of disruption of the anterior or posterior longitudinal ligaments or ligamentum flavum.
There is increased signal seen in the interspinous region of C2-C4 indicating trauma in this region.
There is also prevertebral soft tissue edema seen identified from C1-C4.
There is fluid seen within the right C6-7 facet joint, which could be related to the lamina fracture seen on CT.
There is minimal anterolisthesis of C6 over C7 identified.
There is increased signal seen in the T3 vertebral body in its upper portion indicating trauma and probable nondisplaced fracture.
No significant compression or retropulsion is seen.
There is fluid seen within the nasopharynx which appears to be secondary to intubation.
A 1.5-cm cystic area is identified projected over the upper thoracic posterior subcutaneous region which could be due to an incidental sebaceous cyst.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen in this visualized sphenoid sinus.
Marrow edema in the right occipital condyle indicating fracture.
Fluid in the right C6-7 facet joint could be related to the lamina fracture seen on CT.
No obvious ligamentous disruption is identified.
Mild prevertebral soft tissue edema from C1-C4.
No evidence of spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: fracture evaluation  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 40 year old man with cervical spine fractures REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: fracture evaluation MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE.
There is evidence of disruption of the anterior spinous and posterior spinal ligaments at this level.
There is mild retrolisthesis of L2 over L3.
There is also increased signal seen within the intraspinous region of L2 and L3 indicative of trauma to the intraspinous ligaments.
There is no evidence of high-grade spinal stenosis seen or evidence of intraspinal hematoma identified.
Extensive increased signal is seen in the posterior muscular structures in the upper lumbar region indicating trauma.
The fracture extends through the posterior elements as seen on the CT of [**2183-11-14**].
No intraspinal hematoma is seen.
No evidence of high-grade thecal sac compression is noted.
ECG: [**2183-11-17**] Sinus tachycardia Early precordial QRS transition - is nonspecific Diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2183-11-16**], sinus tachycardia rate faster and further ST-T wave changes present   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 116 102 90 302/371 74 47 130     Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to the Trauma service.
Orthopedic spine and Orthopedics were immediately consulted because of his injuries.
He was also fitted for a TLSO brace which must be worn at all times when out of bed.
Psychiatry was also consulted given his history of schizophrenia.
There were no behavioral issues throughout his hospital stay.
