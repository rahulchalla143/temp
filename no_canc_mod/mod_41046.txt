Admission Date:  [**2173-1-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-2-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2149-10-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Cephalosporins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**] Chief Complaint: 23M s/p MVC  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 23 yo male without PMH s/p MVA vs. tree.
In the ED patient was noted to have bilateral sluggish pupils, with eventual fixed and dilated left pupil.
Patient also noted to have left femoral shaft fracture, right tibial and fibular diaphyseal fractures.
INJURIES: Left occipital and parietal subgaleal hematomas, multiple parenchymal contusions at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction.
Concern for diffuse axonal injury Right subdural and possible left subdural hematomas, and multiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Possible slight subluxations at C1-C2 Comminuted left femoral diaphyseal and right tibial and fibular diaphyseal fractures   Past Medical History: ALLERGIES: NKDA PMH: None PSH: None   Social History: + ETOH Rest unkown  Family History: no contributory  Physical Exam: VS: HR: 40 BP: 160/ O(2)Sat: 100% Normal  Gen: intubated and sedated HEENT: left posterior scalp laceration  Neck: Cervical collar in place Extrem: left thigh deformity, right lower leg deformity.
Neuro: Unresponsive Pupils:  Right 3mm nonreactive, Left fully dilated irregular and nonreactive Negative Corneal reflex Bilaterally  Motor: extends left upper extremity to noxious No movement on right UE Lower extremities have deformities bilaterally and patient appears to have movement in the left leg, likely to pain due to femur fx.
Pertinent Results: [**2173-1-31**]: CT head: Extensive evidence of traumata with left occipital and parietal subgaleal hematomas, multiple parenchymal contusions at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction raising concern for hemorrhage foci of diffuse axonal injury, evidence of right subdural and possible left subdural hematomas, and multiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No evidence of fracture.
Dysmorphic C1 including bilateral hypoplasia on the lamina.
Although the appearance is probably within physiological range, the possibility of ligamentous injury is difficult to completely exclude by this study.
If there is concern regarding any potential for ligamentous injury based on clinical grounds and especially if it is difficult to clear the cervical spine clinically, then MR may be of potential use in further evaluation.
CT torso:No definite fractures are visualized but there is mild cortical irregularity of the left inferior pubic ramus which may be suggestive of a subtle non-displaced fracture.
Comminuted left femoral diaphyseal and right tibial and fibular diaphyseal fractures.
Multiple foci of air visualized in the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower extremity suggestive of penetrating injury and open fracture.
There is attenuation of the right anterior tibial artery adjacent to the comminuted right tibial fracture, suggestive of injury to this vessel although there is distal reconstitution.
Short segment of relative [**Name (NI) 66438**] along the mid left posterior tibial artery of uncertain significance, noting no evidence for soft tissue injury or fracture in the region.
Increase in size and number of multiple traumatic hemorrhagic parenchymal contusions and subarachnoid hemorrhages.
Effacement of the sulci and new narrowing of the third ventricle and perimesencephalic cistern suggests worsening cerebral edema.
R tib/fib splinted.
On repeat CT head increase in size and number of multiple traumatic hemorrhagic contusions.
[**2-3**]: Hypernatremia overnight, hypertonic saline decreased to 20cc/hr.
Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Politrauma Traumatic brain injury with diffuse axonal injury Left femoral fracture Right tibia and fibula fracture   Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: none  Followup Instructions: none   Completed by:[**2173-2-5**
