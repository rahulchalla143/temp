Patient was diagnosed with a Dieulafoy's lesion in [**Male First Name (un) 36290**].
EGD here on [**2107-1-23**] revealed a short segment of Barrett's esophagus, erythema, and friability of the body of stomach and duodenum and angiectasia of the body of the stomach treated with thermal therapy in addition to the second part of the duodenum, which was also treated with thermal therapy.
On presentation patient was vomiting blood and nearly passed out.
He is unsure if he has had black stools in the past.
He denies history of peptic ulcer disease or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use, positive increased stress secondary to losing his wife less than a year ago.
Gastritis with history of one episode of melena a few years ago not worked up followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] of [**Location (un) **].
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosed five years ago.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosed two years ago.
Left wrist fracture following a motor vehicle accident three weeks ago.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Positive history of withdrawal seizures in the hospital.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention.
Pulmonary:  Diffuse inspiratory wheeze; no rhonchi or rales.
Cardiovascular:  Irregular irregular; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds; soft but appears distended; nontender; no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema except the left fingers appear cyanotic distal to the left wrist cast but are warm to touch.
Blood cultures no growth.
EKG:  Atrial fibrillation at a rate of 77 beats per minute; no ST elevation or T-wave inversion.
Chest x-ray:  Stable cardiomegaly; no failure or infiltrate.
Urinalysis:  Negative nitrate, leukocyte esterase, 3 to 5 white blood cells, 0 white blood cells, no bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 78-year-old male with history of gastritis with gastrointestinal bleed in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] status post a total of five units packed red blood cells with EGD here showing two angiectasias treated with thermal therapy, also with stomach and duodenal erosion.
His hematocrit remained stable on the floor; however, he continued to have black bowel movements, and this was followed for an additional 24 hours.
Cardiovascular:  Patient noted to have troponin leak in the context of a significant gastrointestinal bleed.
This was likely thought to be secondary to demand ischemia in the context of a decreased hematocrit requiring increased cardiac output.
No ischemic changes were noted on EKG, and patient ruled out by serial cardiac enzymes.
No indication for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.
Patient instructed to seek outpatient follow up for lipid panel and further management of his cardiac health.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Patient unaware of diagnosis.
History of alcohol abuse:  Patient maintained on the CIWI Scale; however, no evidence of tremulousness, anxiety, diaphoresis, or palpitations.
Repeated reinforcement was given for absence of alcohol in the context of a gastrointestinal bleed as this will increase his risk for occurrence.
Urine and serum osmolality in addition to urine sodium consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone possibly secondary to pulmonary disease versus stress.
Patient's risk factors for atrial fibrillation include COPD and alcohol use.
Persistent low-grade fever with bandemia:  Concern for pneumonia considering patient developed an oxygen requirement.
Likely, his fevers are secondary to atelectasis.
Patient was discharged without instructions or prescription for antibiotics.
Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], within one week to check his blood count and sodium and for further management of COPD and aid with quitting alcohol and tobacco in addition to restarting his Coumadin.
