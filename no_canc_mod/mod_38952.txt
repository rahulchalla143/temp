The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated, as before.
A right internal jugular sheath has been inserted and terminates at the thoracic inlet.
There is no other definite change.
Aortogram demonstrates normal caliber of the aorta with no aneurysms or significant atherosclerotic disease.
There are bilateral two single renal arteries of normal caliber without evidence of stenosis or atherosclerosis.
The superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries arise in their expected location and demonstrate normal branching pattern.
Superior mesenteric angiogram demonstrates normal-appearing ileocolic, right colic and middle colic arteries with no evidence of extravasation or AVMs or areas of ischemia.
The jejunal branches also appear normal and well perfused without evidence of any AV malformations or extravasations.
Mild jejunal bowel dilatation is noted.
There is abnormal blush noted at the splenic flexure coming from one of the branches of the left colic artery.
Selective left colic arterial angiogram demonstrating the abnormal branch with brisk extravasation proximal to the splenic colonic flexure.
The patient withstood the procedure well and no immediate complication and was extubated on the table and was shifted to the ICU in stable condition.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated mesenteric angiogram demonstrating abnormal extravasation from one of the distal branches of left colic artery,at the splenic flexure, which was selectively catheterized and embolized using coils.
No immediate complications.
Colonoscopy [**2112-4-27**]: Impression: Diverticulosis of the whole colon including cecum Abnormal mucosa in the colon The colon wsa redundant, long and tortuous, making this procedure difficult.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 90032**] is a 59 yo M with a history of DM2, Parkinson's disease, and T8 MSSA osteomyelitis who presented with ongoing BRBPR.
# Acute blood loss anemia due to large volume lower GI bleed: Massive transfusion protocol was activated and patient received 9 units PRBCs, 3 units FFP, and 1 unit of platelets for his GIB.
Following GI prep he underwent colonoscopy which showed significant diverticulosis and evidence of prior bleeding at the site of one divertila, but no active bleeding.
To avoid future episodes, he should try to avoid constipation with oral hydration, fiber, and appropriate bowel regimen.
# MSSA Osteomyelitis of T8: His ICU and medical floor team kept in close contact with his outpatient ID physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
His antibiotics were changed to IV formulation during his GI bleed and back to oral formulation on discharge.
Surveillance blood culture and inflammatory markers were drawn given episodes of sweating in association with exacerbation of Parkinson's symptoms.
Patient never had any fevers or other signs or symptoms of infection.
# Hypertension: Antihypertensives held in the setting of massive GIB.
# Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Metformin was held in the setting of acute blood loss and he was placed on an insulin sliding scale.
# Parkinson's disease: Patient was continue on Stalevo and ropinirole per home dosing.
He had several episodes of not feeling well and exacerbation of his Parkinson's symptoms that were attributed to his acute illness.
# Chronic pain: Continued lidocaine patch and oxycodone PRN.
# Access: Left midline was removed on discharge given that IV antibiotics are no longer necessary.
# Communication: Patient.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the intensive care unit for a very large bleed from your colon.
You had multiple blood transfusions and a coil embolization by interventional radiology to stop the bleeding.
When your blood counts stabilized you were transfered to the medical floor and you had a colonoscopy that showed diverticulosis but no polyps.
The bleeding occured in one of the diverticula of the colon.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Because of your low blood pressure, we stopped hydrochlorothiazide.
