The technologist notes the patient was unable to stay still for the lateral.
There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggesting bilateral effusions.
Pulmonary vascular indistinctness is evident.
There is mild prominence of the intralobular septate.
No definite focal consolidation is seen.
The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged consistent with cardiomegaly.
The visualized osseous structures reveal mild multilevel degenerative disease throughout the thoracic spine and marked degenerative changes noted at bilateral acromioclavicular joints.
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema, likely cardiogenic in etiology given underlying cardiomegaly.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
ECHO:  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-12-20**], the degree of AR and pulmonary hypertension detected has decreased   Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old woman with history of MVR on coumadin, dCHF (EF 55%), and COPD on 3L NC who presents to the ED from pulmonology clinic with significant hypoxia with exertion (73% on 3L NC).
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The likely cause of her hypoxia and respiratory distress given edema on exam and CXR, lack of infectious symptoms, or wheeze.
No antibiotics or steroids were given.
There was no evidence of acute ischemia or PE.
Echo was performed which showed well positioned mitral valve and a small decrease in her pulmonary hypertension.
Systolic fraction at 55%, suggesting her sx are still from diastolic dysfunction with perhaps some right sided heart failure as well.
# Acute renal failure:  Improved with diuresis.
creatinine 1.2 on discharge  # MVR/Supratherapeutic INR: Patient s/p MVR [**Hospital3 9642**] [**2182**] for severe MR. INR 9.5 on presentation.
No evidence of active bleeding.
# HTN:  Her blood pressures were markedly elevated when she arrived, and this was likely secondary to her volume overload.
# CAD: Patient with known CAD s/p multiple PCIs with stenting.
Most recent cardiac catheterization [**2186-12-19**] with no evidence of flow limiting lesions and patent RCA stents.
No evidence of active ACS on EKG.
# Physical deconditioning:  patient without any focal findings of weakness on exam, but per physical therapy she is markedly deconditioned.
# Diabetes Mellitus:  A1c of 8.
# Sleep d/o:  Patient with very interrupted sleep.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath and a decrease in your oxygen level.
This was due to your congestive heart failure - a condition that leads you to build up fluid in your legs and lungs that impair your breathing.
With the use of lasix, we removed the excess fluid and your breathing improved.
Given that you have a mechanical heart valve, having a stable coumadin level is critical.
