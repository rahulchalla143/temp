No pulmonary embolism.
There are linear areas of opacity along the mediastinum, suggesting atelectasis or scarring.
There are also scattered geographic areas of ground- glass opacity, predominantly within the right upper lobes, and also some in the lower lobes are noted.
These ill- defined areas may reflect an inflammatory process, or less likely an atypical infectious etiology.
There is additionally, prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  53 yo female with bipolar disorder tobacco abuse presents with respiratory distress [**1-10**] atypical viral respiratory infection + CHF + COPD.
# VIRAL RESPIRATORY INFECTION:  She had been coughing the day prior to presentation and the ground glass opacities on CTA would be consistent with an atypical viral infection.
She does not have lobar pneumonia on imaging and had been afebrile.
She was initially 87% on room air in the ED and was sent to the MICU for respiratory distress.
# COPD: She has no documented history of COPD and has never had pulmonary function tests.
She was initially put on high dose IV steroids for a supposed COPD flare but she improved quickly and was put on a quick prednisone taper.
She remained afebrile although she had an initial leukocytosis on presentation.
# BIPOLAR DISORDER: Pt is only on Risperdal 50mg IM every other week on Fridays.
