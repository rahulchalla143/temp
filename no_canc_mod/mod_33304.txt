No extinction to DSS  Reflexes: 2 and symmetric in the arms, patellar jerks barely present, no Achilles jerks, left toe up going.
Gait: not assessed due to clinical severity of the patient's condition.
Pertinent Results: CT CNS: Large left cerebellar hemisphere hypodensity consistent with evolving infarction.
There is obscuration of the cerebellar folia concerning for upward transtentorial herniation.
There is mild prominence of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles concerning for mild hydrocephalus.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage or rightward or leftward shift of midline structures.
There is no evidence of acute fracture.
There is stable appearance to heterogeneous hypodensity involving a large territory of the caudal left cerebellar hemisphere.
There is effacement of bilateral ambient and the quadrigeminal plate cisterns, representing upward transtentorial herniation which also appears unchanged.
There is effacement of the fourth ventricle with enlargement of the third ventricle suggestive of possible obstructive hydrocephalus, which appears similar to study performed approximately 12 hours earlier.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
LVEF >55.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2140-7-22**] 4:16 AM Finding consistent with postsurgical decompression of the posterior fossa and right frontal ventriculostomy catheter placement.
No significant overall change seen in the size and configuration of the ventricles.
Unchanged size of lateral ventricular system and mass effect within the posterior fossa.
A follow CT/ CTA showed no vessel obstruction.
There is stable appearance to heterogeneous hypodensity involving a large territory of the caudal left cerebellar hemisphere.
There is effacement of bilateral ambient and the quadrigeminal plate cisterns, representing upward transtentorial herniation which also appears unchanged.
