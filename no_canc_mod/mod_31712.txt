No fall occurred.
There was no bowel/stool incontinence, tongue biting, jerking movement.
Patient was not thought to have confusion like post-ictal state.
She cannot recall if she has any numbness/tingling or focal weakness.
Currently she has generalized weakness and some chest discomfort but not pain/tightness.
Had an admission [**7-/2154**] for syncope/fall, including an episode concerning for possible seizure with post-ictal state.
MRI brain was negative for infarct or hemorrhage.
EEG showed no seizure.
Patient was sent to rehab for about 3 weeks given the left humerus fracture.
Received 10mg IV diltiazem which dropped pressures to 80s systolic for presumed afib with RVR.

Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with a history of systemic amyloidosis (Kidney, autonomic, ?
heart), aortic stenosis, CHF, T2DM on insulin, and frequent falls [**12-20**] autonomic dysfunction presenting to ED with fall and admitted to MICU for tachycardia.
Initially thought to be regular, but on further review of the EKGs from the ED, it seems that patient has been having irregular borderline narrow complex tachycardia, which is more consistent with atrial fibrillation.
Patient does have underlying structural heart disease and suspected amyloidosis of the heart, which can make her more prone to having conductive abnormalities, such as the 1st/2nd/3rd degree block, intraventricular conduction delay, AF, A flutter, and even ventricular tachycardia.
TSH was only mildly elevated in [**Month (only) **], making hyperthyroidism less likely the cause of the AF.
Clinical exam and CXR do not suggest significant volume overload or infectious etiology.
ED had concern about PE and started heparin gtt empirically pending VQ scan (unable to get CTA chest given CKD), although clinical suspicion of PE is low based on her [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] criteria is low prob.
Syncope: Symptoms were primarily concerning for underlying arrhythmia given tachycardia on admission, but orthostatic hypotension was also high in the differential given patient is on midodrine due to underlying autonomic dysfunction.
An acute coronary syndrome was considered as was high sensitivity to volume status due to underlying cardiac amyloidosis.
Elevated troponin.
Patient had elevated troponins that were likely due to demand in the setting of tachycardia and CKD.
Could also be secondary to amyloidosis.
A renal biopsy in [**3-/2154**] was positive for amyloidosis.
The acute elevation was most likely due to progression of amyloid vs. prerenal azotemia, possibly in the setting of low perfusion (low BP) and poor forward flow (AF).
Per renal, c/w cardiorenal syndrome + poor forward flow (sodium avid per urine).
5. dCHF, no evidence of acute exacerbation.
Given likelihood of amyloid cardiomyopathy and the potential sensitivity to fluid shift, fluid status was monitored closely.
Autonomic dysfunction.
Systemic amyloidosis.
Patient is not complaining of urinary symptoms.
