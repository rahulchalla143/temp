Admission Date:  [**2104-1-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-2-8**]   Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82 year-old male patient with a one year history of presyncope with recent increase in symptoms three to four weeks prior to admission.
This has also been accompanied by chest discomfort for approximately two weeks prior to admission.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization at an outside hospital on [**2104-1-3**], which revealed left main coronary artery disease as well significant three vessel disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation, hypertension, congestive heart failure, status post right above the knee amputation, status post repair of an incarcerated umbilical hernia.
Also, peripheral vascular disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Digoxin 0.25 po q.d., Neurontin 300 mg q.d., Ziac 1.25 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg po q.d., nitroglycerin patch and the patient is also on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Physical examination in general, the patient was in no acute distress.
He did have bilateral expiratory wheezes.
His coronary examination was S1 and S2 with a grade 1/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Left leg had a weak peripheral pulse.
Intraoperatively, the patient was noted to have a significant calcified aorta.
Initially postoperatively, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.
Over the course of the next 48 hours or so the patient had somewhat of a metabolic acidosis.
He remained in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate in the 90s.
The patient had lactate acidosis with a serum lactate in the 4 to 7 range.
However, later that day the patient exhibited significant respiratory distress evidenced by hypoxia and tachypnea and was transferred back into the Intensive Care Unit at that time.
Every time sedation was attempted to be decreased the patient got profoundly tachypneic as well as tachycardic.
He had difficulty ventilating and significant problems oxygenating as well.
For this reason it was felt appropriate to proceed with a tracheostomy as well as a PEG feeding tube.
The sputum initially grew out gram negative rods, which turned out to be Moraxella, which was resistant to Ampicillin Penicillin.
Postoperative day five the patient underwent echocardiogram, which revealed significant left ventricular hypokinesis as well as tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation.
Tube feedings were initiated via the PEG and the patient still required full ventilatory support due to marginal oxygenation status.
The patient also had intermittent episodes of hypoxia requiring PEEP increased FIO2 on the ventilator.
The patient's chest x-ray over the next couple of days was consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome, which would correlate with this increased oxygen requirement as well as the need for increased PEEP.
On the [**1-13**] the patient was restarted on intravenous Dobutamine due to his periods of hypotension and known left ventricular dysfunction.
Over the course of the next few days the patient began to have increased gastrostomy tube output necessitating CAT scan of his abdomen and chest for his distended abdominal examination, increased white count without clear explanation and in ability to tolerate his tube feeds.
General surgery consult was obtained on the [**1-13**] due to continued fever spikes, decreasing level of responsiveness and inability to tolerate tube feeds.
It was the feeling of the General Surgery Service that his was all a result of his pneumonia process and there was no obvious intra-abdominal pathology to explain these symptoms and concerns.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy on the [**2104-1-14**], which revealed clear watery secretions and no purulent drainage.
He remained in atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular rate, but continued to spike fevers over the course of the next few days.
The patient had some problems with hyperventilation he was intermittently placed on pressure support, however, became hypoxic and placed back on assist control ventilation mode.
On the [**1-17**] he again required higher FIO2 and higher PEEP due to significant hypoxia with a PO2 in the 60s on full ventilator support.
The patient has been placed on Vancomycin due to staph not yet speciated at that time and was on Ciprofloxacin at that time as well for gram negative rods in his sputum.
On postoperative day 16 into 17 he began to have issues with hypernatremia for which he received free water.
He remained ventilator dependent with ARDS and pneumonia.
Over the course of the next few days to the next week or so the patient was placed on Dopamine drip due to hypotension.
The patient continued to have intermittent fevers over the next two weeks or so and was maintained on hyperalimentation for nutritional support.
He continued to have trouble with abdominal distention, although not a specific reason for him not tolerating tube feeds, nor his abdominal distention.
He had intermittent periods of hypoxia over the next couple of days.
He remained on Dilaudid and Ativan drips for sedation and Fentanyl patch for pain control.
He was continuing to be treated with Levofloxacin and Vancomycin for MRSA in his sputum as well as gram negative for the sputum, which was previously identified at Moraxella.
His Dobutamine was ultimately weaned off without significant change in his blood pressure.
The family has indicated that it was their wish to have the patient moved to a facility closer to home, since he still remained dependent on vasopressors for blood pressure support, we were unable to have him transferred to a long term chronic ventilator facility or an acute rehabilitation facility with ventilator support and this required his remaining in the Intensive Care Unit.
Heart rate 89 in atrial fibrillation.
Sputum, Enterobacter, [**Female First Name (un) **] and coag positive staph, MRSA and gram negative rods as well as yeast.
The patient has coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
