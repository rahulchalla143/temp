Admission Date:  [**2132-11-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-11-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-5-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine / Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: Hip pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IR drainage of R hip R arm AV fistula graft removed R hip aspirated by ortho  History of Present Illness: 76 y/o female w/ho DMUII, ESRD on HD with tunnel cath, presents with increasing R hip pain.
The patient was in her usual state of health until [**2132-11-12**] (2 days prior to admission), when she felt very fatigued after her hemodialysis.
She went to sleep in the afternoon and suddenly awoke with severe R hip pain at 2am [**2132-11-13**].
The pain was so severe she could no longer walk due to the pain and weakness.
An MRI prelim read was concerning for R hip osteomyelitis.
End-stage renal disease.
Has had 9 thrombectomies in the fistula in her left arm, s/p stent placement in her left axillary vein, s/p balloon angioplasty for inflow and outflow (infra-stent) stenosis most recently on [**2132-1-1**].
Right arm brachiocephalic AV fistula performed on [**2132-1-16**].
Diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension 4.
Cataracts s/p bilateral cateract surgery   Social History: The patient is a former nurse's assistant from [**Country **].
Aunt had h/o "kidney problems" but she passed away at age [**Age over 90 **], and was never on HD.
RIGHT HIP, TWO VIEWS: There is no fracture or dislocation of the right hip.
There are degenerative changes of the hips bilaterally, with mild joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis and marginal osteophytes.
Dense vascular calcifications are present in the pelvis and legs.
There are degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation.
Small right greater than left bilateral hip joint effusions.
Subchondral bone marrow edema in the right femoral head and erosions in the lateral aspect of the right femoral head and posterior right femoral head.
No fracture or avascular necrosis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
TEE [**2132-11-17**] Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the right atrial appendage.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex, anterior wall, septum and anterior septum.
Unable to rule out other wall motion abnormalities.Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Impression: Possible pulmonary embolus versus a coronary event.
( [**Name5 (PTitle) 13042**] anesthesia team)  CT HEAD [**2132-11-17**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute infarction.
The ventricles and sulci are stably prominent in caliber and configuration, compatible with age-related involutional changes.
Note is made of atherosclerotic calcifications involving the bilateral internal carotid arteries at their cavernous portions, the vertebral arteries, and the basilar artery.
No acute fractures are identified.
There is mild mucosal thickening involving the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Right atrial enlargement with reflux in the hepatic veins, most compatible with right-sided congestive heart failure.
High-attenuation ovoid in appearance focus within the segment IV of the liver.
Given no known history of trauma could represent an area of shunting  and an underlying lesion cannot be excluded, however, active hemorrhage within the lesion as well as more chronic fluid/ blood in the subcapsular space is also a consideration; recommend repeat CT examination with further timing delay for further characterization of this region.
Gallbladder wall thickening and mild hyperemia could be related to cholecystitis or underlying sepsis and third spacing.
Ultrasound recommended.
Multiple punctate foci of air within the IVC and right atrium, likely related to recent instrumentation.
Small subcutaneous hematoma adjacent to the right gluteal muscles with multiple punctate foci of air, likely related to recent instrumentation.
Erosions involving the right femoral head and the right iliac bone, likely related to known septic arthritis.
Incompletely characterized 11mm left adrenal nodule.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 y/o female c/ h/o DM, ESRD on HD atraumatic R hip pain, fever to 101 in ED, white count, and MRI signs concerning for R hip osteomyelitis.
Osteomyelitis/septic joint: Given the R hip, fevers, white count, edema around R hip, and MRI signs, all are concerning for osteomyelits/septic joint.
Source most likely via R arm fistula graft for HD, especially given staph aureus.
Pain control: Patient's pain was better controlled on MS contin 30mg PO BID + Dilaudid 0.25-0.5mg IV Q3H PRN pain.
EKG concerning for severe electrolyte disturbances vs. anterior iscemia (?STE V1-4).
Cards was urgently consulted, and TEE revealed new severe RV dysfunction, raising concern for PE.
Telemetry strips with WCT concerning for VT and defibrillated twice.
Given presumptive PE, TPA administered with some improvement.
CT abd/pelvis notable for liver hematoma.
Labs continually worsened with increasing lactic acidosis.
No shockable rhythms.
Medications on Admission: Simvastatin 10mg PO Daily Valsartan 320mg PO Daily Glipizide 5mg PO Daily Metoprolol XL 50mg PO Daily Nifedipine 90mg PO QHS Tylenol 650mg PO Q6H PRN Pain Oxycodone 5mg PO Q6H PRN Severe Pain Sevelamer HCl 800mg PO TID with meals  Discharge Medications: Pt expired.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) Right hip osteomyelitis 2) Right hip septic arthritis 3) End-stage renal disease  Secondary: 1) Hypertension 2) Diabetes mellitus type II   Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: Expired.
