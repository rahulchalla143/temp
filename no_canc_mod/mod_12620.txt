Associated w/ diaphoresis & light-headedness.
Prior to transfer his pain had improved to [**1-24**].
His pain was [**6-25**].
EKG showed LAD, LAFB, IVCD, new Q waves lateral precordial leads (V4 &5), TWI in III, flattened TW in avF and V1, V3, V4, and ?V5, also ~1mm STE in lead II.
Pain reportedly resolved, thus, pt was not started on integrillin.
He arrived on the floor and reported a pain of [**2195-2-18**].
Past Medical History: - Sarcoidosis--affecting abd & lungs (dx'd at [**Hospital1 112**] years ago) - HTN - CVA 2yr ago --> residual r sided weakness/ pfo v. asd/ stress in [**2189**] (may have been done at [**Hospital1 112**]) - H/o DVT - Chronic pain - l adrenal adenoma - s/p splenectomy, cholecystectomy, ?
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged given differences  in technique with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and prominence of the hila.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
The previously noted vague opacity in the left  mid lung is not as well seen on the current study; however, please note that  the previous study was a dedicated PA and lateral chest.
No other areas  concerning for consolidation are identified.
The left costophrenic angle has been excluded; however, no large pleural effusions are noted.
There is no  pulmonary vascular congestion.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Cardiac catheterization: 20 % LAD, mild disease in the LCX and mild disease in the RCA with thrombotic occlusion of the distal wrap around PDA "dottered with balloon" with improvement in flow and partial resolution of thrombus .
On cardiac catheterization, an RCA thrombus with thrombotic occlusion of distal wrap around PDA was found.
During the procedure, the patient developed CP and with small ST elevation on EKG.
CP was reduced with morphine but was in some pain after catheterization with EKG rvealing some resolution of ST elevations in V3-V4.
On the floor, he had mild [**2-24**] constant "aching" chest pain that patient reported was chronic, related to severe sarcoid and unlike his CP on admission or in the cath lab.
An echo was obtained showing a normal EF and no wall motion abnormalities.
A lipid panel was obtained with an elevated LDL 152.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.
Discharge Condition: improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for chest pain.
You had a heart attack because of a blockage in one of your coronary arteries.
A stent was not placed due to the inability to pass through the clot.
