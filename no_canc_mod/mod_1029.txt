I am going to read the previously dictated discharge summary into the system as follows:  This 54-year-old white female diabetic with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, who was in her usual state of health until the night of her admission when she had acute onset of substernal chest pain radiating to bilateral shoulders and left upper extremity.
The pain was associated with nausea and emesis, and lasted approximately two hours.
She complained of increasing dyspnea on exertion and fatigue over the past two weeks.
Nonmalignant thoracic spinal tumor diagnosed in [**2110**] status post vertebrectomy of five thoracic vertebra.
Coronary artery disease status post PTCA and stent of the circumflex in [**2123-10-3**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
FAMILY HISTORY:  She had a positive family history with a father with a myocardial infarction.
She was in no distress.
Neck was supple with no bruits.
Heart regular, rate, and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
There was 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibials bilaterally pulses.
Skin revealed multiple white scars on the right and left forearms.
Cardiac catheterization on [**5-6**] showed 40% left main, 90% left anterior descending artery, and diffuse RCA disease with an ejection fraction of 60%.
Electrocardiogram showed anterior T-wave inversions and diffuse ST changes.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral atelectasis with no other changes.
The patient was admitted to the MICU, placed on Heparin drip, where her acute myocardial infarction was managed with nitroglycerin and Nipride as well as IV Lopressor.
Initially, she had a low cardiac index and developed acidosis prompting volume resuscitation with blood.
She developed atrial fibrillation, had several attempts at cardioversion after loading with amiodarone that were unsuccessful.
On postoperative day 10, as she was awaiting rehab placement, she experienced left sided chest pain.
Her hemodynamics were stable, but an electrocardiogram demonstrated T-wave inversion laterally similarly to preoperative, but new compared to postoperative.
She refused cardiac catheterization at that time, so a Persantine MIBI was done on [**5-21**], which demonstrated the same reversible defect as preoperative with only minimal improvement.
Her sternum was stable and there was minimal pedal edema.
It was clean and dry with some ecchymosis, but no erythema.
Spinal tumor with thoracic vertebrectomy.
Coronary artery disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
