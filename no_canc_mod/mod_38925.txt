Her daugther was in another room and heard the fall, no seizure activity.
A CT at [**Hospital6 28728**] Center showed a left frontal SAH.
Lives with daughter   Family History: Family Hx:Denies any family hx of subarachnoid hemorrhage   Physical Exam: Hunt and [**Doctor Last Name 9381**]: 2 (for moderate headache)   [**Doctor Last Name **]: 4 GCS: 15 O: T:98.9  BP:131/76  HR:69    R  18     O2Sats 95% Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, Handedness Right  On Discharge: A&ox3 PERRL EOMs intact Face symmetrical No pronator drift Motor: full   Pertinent Results: CTA Brain [**2141-11-12**]: Upon review of this study with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], endovascular neuroradiologist, seen on images 55-57, series 3, and on coronal reconstructed image 17, series 401b, is a probable aneurysm, arising from the lateral aspect of the supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery, and directed in an unusual anterolateral long axis.
Particularly in view of this revised finding, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has informed me that the patient will undergo catheter angiography today, with potential endovascular coiling as well.
CXR [**2141-11-12**]: Relatively diminished lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
No acute bony abnormality.
Stable, evolving distribution of subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Stable mild paranasal sinus disease.
ECHO [**2141-11-14**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
CTA [**2141-11-18**]: IMPRESSION:  No significant change in the size of the intracranial arteries allowing for the artifact from the coils.
Diminutive basilar artery and P1 segments along with fetal PCA pattern and prominent posterior communicating arteries withs lightly more narrow size of the Basilar artery.
If there is concern for parenchymal changes, MR can be considered if not CI.
[**2141-11-19**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-12**] through 10:  Although mediastinal vascular distention is no longer present, pulmonary circulation is engorged, and there is mild edema at the lung bases.
Elevation of the left lung base could be due to left lower lobe atelectasis or upward displacement by abdominal abnormality such as gastric distention.
No pneumothorax.
[**2141-11-21**] LENIES:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1140**] was evaluated in the Emergency room, sent for a CTA of the brain which was suspicious for an underlying aneurysm as the cause of her intracranial hemorrhage.
Patient underwent TCDs that showed no vasospasm.
On [**11-14**], She developed some delerium over night with the development of fevers and was given a dose of Haldol.
Overnight she was found to be in afib with RVR, treated with lopressor, checked cardiac enzymes which appeared negative.
TCDs showed mildly elevated velocities but no vasospasm.
She underwent a CTA to rule out vasospasm after she was found to have a new right pronator drift.
on [**11-19**], Patient was found to be somewhat confused and periodically halucinating.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained for elevated blood sugars and the patient was subsequently started on Amaryl [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 9718**] recommendations.
