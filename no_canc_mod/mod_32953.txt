Still present at least moderate layering right pleural effusion is seen on both PA and lateral views with bibasilar retrocardiac atelectasis still seen.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The right ventricle may be mildly dilated and hypokinetic but this cannot be said for certain.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Interval posterior fixation of the mid-thoracic spine, with improved anatomic alignment of extensively comminuted fracture at T7.
Persistent mild anterolisthesis of the superior portion of L7 upon the inferior portion, of approximately 6 mm.
Persistent small degree of retropulsion of fracture fragments by approximately 3 mm into the spinal canal.
Limited evaluation of spinal canal and its contents due to hardware artifact.
Post-surgical changes including subcutaneous air and foci of air within the spinal canal.
High-attenuation fluid within the pleural space bilaterally consistent with blood within the pleural space and hematoma adjacent to the fractured vertebral body.
Consolidative foci in the left posteromedial lung consistent with atelectasis versus contusion.
NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW:  The numbering used above is based on prior MR report dated [**2158-2-28**] There is a tiny fracture without displacement noted at the antero-superior aspect of the T3 body ( series 400b, im 23).
He became hypotensive and started on Neosynephrine drip.
There was concern for esophageal injury and he underwent a Gastrographin study  which ruled this out.
[**3-1**]: to OR for epidural hematoma drainage.
There were no intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively he was taken to the Trauma ICU where he remained for several days.
Psychiatry was consulted for acute change in his mental status; he was placed on a 1:1 sitter for a short period and was treated with low dose antipsychotic for multifactorial delirium.
He was evaluated early on by Physical and Occupational therapy and is being recommended for acute spinal cord injury rehab.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) Neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for agitation.
