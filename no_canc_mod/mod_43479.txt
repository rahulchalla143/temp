She was in her USOH (able to walk about 100 feet before developing dyspnea, with 24 private nurse) until late [**2140-10-10**] when she developed mild dyspnea and was treated at a hospital in [**State 108**] for bronchitis.
She improved somewhat but then had recurrent dyspnea and was hospitalized in late [**11-12**] until [**2140-12-10**], and treated again for bronchitis, discharged with home oxygen (at night) and a prednisone taper (last dose 1 week ago).
She states that over the past several weeks she has been limited to walking ~10 feet before becoming short of breath.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2141-2-7**], the calculated aortic valve effective orifice area is minimally increased, with mildly increased aortic regurgitation.
female with known critical aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.6 by Echo in [**5-13**]) presents with subacute dyspnea on exertion for elective aortic valvuloplasty on [**2141-2-7**].
Valvuloplasty attempts were made to dilate via baloon without success.
2) CAD - pt continued on ASA, beta-blocker, statin, as well as being started on Plavix  3) Anemia - pt had slight decrease in hct post-procedure & was transfused 1 unit of PRBC's to maintain her hct > 30 due to her underlying CAD.
An abdominal/pelvic CT was performed to r/o a retroperitoneal bleed, which was negative.
