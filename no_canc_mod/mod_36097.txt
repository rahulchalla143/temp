Admission Date:  [**2181-8-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2181-9-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2112-4-2**]     Sex:  F  Service:  C-MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (status post myocardial infarction in [**2174**]; status post coronary artery bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery in [**2174**]) who predominantly to the [**Hospital 620**] campus complaining of chest pain for three hours with the onset in the evening of [**8-28**] while at rest.
This chest pain was associated with nausea and shortness of breath.
There was no airbag deployment, but after the accident the patient vomited once and developed chest discomfort with radiation to the right breast and arm.
On arrival to the [**Hospital 620**] campus, the patient's electrocardiogram showed 2-mm ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with 2-mm ST depressions in V5 and V6.
During the cardiac catheterization, the patient had occasional episodes of hypotension and was started on atropine and dopamine.
The patient was found to have bleeding from her groin after multiple access attempts.
Her hematocrit was revealed to be 28 and a Swan-Ganz catheter showed low right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit without having any interventional performed.
Coronary artery disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Status post back surgery for scoliosis in [**2175-10-18**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, a thin woman in no acute distress.
No jugular venous distention.
A grade [**1-22**] to 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
The abdomen was soft and mildly tender in the lower quadrants.
No distention.
There was a large epigastric ventral hernia.
Groin revealed minimal oozing of blood in the left and right groin sites.
ST elevations of 2 mm in leads II, III, and aVF and V5 and V6.
ST depressions in V1 to V3.
Lead aVL with T wave flattening and inversion.
A chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia or congestive heart failure with mild cardiomegaly.
The procedure was terminated at that time as the patient's hemodynamic instability and retroperitoneal bleed presented prevented further attempts at stent placement.
After the patient's hematocrit stabilized, she was transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit to the Cardiology floor where she had occasional episodes of jaw pain and chest pain which were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
The patient underwent a Persantine MIBI on [**9-7**]; during which the patient had [**5-26**] chest pressure and chest pain with the infusion, but no electrocardiogram changes.
The MIBI portion revealed moderate partially reversible defects involving the mid and lateral wall which extended to the apex and a hypokinetic lateral wall, with an ejection fraction of 62%.
The following day, the patient developed an additional episode of chest pain while at rest.
The pain resolved.
RETROPERITONEAL BLEED ISSUES:  After the multiple access attempts during the patient's initial cardiac catheterization the patient's hematocrit dropped, and she became hypotensive.
The patient underwent an urgent abdominal and pelvic computerized axial tomography which revealed a large left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma in the pelvis, diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, and no evidence of bowel obstruction.
In addition, a repeat abdominal computed tomography on [**9-4**] revealed a greatly decreased left pelvic wall hematoma.
At this point, the patient's retroperitoneal bleed was felt to have resolved, and the patient's hematocrit was felt to be stable.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient had several episodes of hypotension while on the Cardiology floor.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION ISSUES:  On [**9-4**], the patient was found to have developed a low-grade fever overnight and was complaining of dysuria that a.m. and mild suprapubic abdominal pain.
The patient's urine culture revealed greater than 100,000 colonies of Escherichia coli which was pan-sensitive.
The patient was found to have significant anxiety with an additional component borderline personality trait.
The patient was continuously given reassurance by both nursing and physician staff, and the patient responded well to this increased attention and increased communication.
