Admission Date:  [**2128-2-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2128-2-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2072-11-27**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55 year old woman with a past medical history significant for severe multiple sclerosis times twenty-five years resulting in chronic debilitation and a recent left lower lobe community acquired pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia, which required intubation, who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation secondary to acute respiratory distress.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] [**2128-1-19**], with community acquired pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia.
She was started on empiric Levofloxacin and Flagyl but her pneumonia worsened, leading to eventual intubation [**2128-1-23**], to [**2128-1-24**].
Antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin/Zosyn 0/15/04, but unfortunately she was reintubated [**2128-1-27**], to [**2128-2-1**], secondary to mucous plugging.
Intensive Care Unit course was notable for ischemic acute tubular necrosis, fluid response of hypotension, culture negative, guaiac positive stools requiring two units packed red blood cells and PEJ placement [**2128-2-4**].
Chest x-ray in the Emergency Department was negative for acute infiltrate.
CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolus.
Multiple sclerosis times twenty-five years.
Status post recent left lower lobe pneumonia requiring two intubations.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general on examination, she is intubated, wide awake, following commands in no acute distress.
Neck - no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruit, no jugular venous distention, no thyromegaly.
Lungs - Slightly decreased left base and otherwise clear.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds, no masses.
Extremities - Boots bilaterally lower extremity, trace to 1+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities, warm, good capillary refill.
Fingernails possible fungal infection.
Chest x-ray showed a left sided effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis, and endotracheal tube in place.
CTA showed no pulmonary embolus, left effusion with left lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis, multiple nodular opacities of the periphery with a tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance consistent with aspiration pneumonia or other infectious etiology.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 150, left axis deviation, poor R wave progression, T wave inversions in I and V1, J point elevation in V2 to V4.
Respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to mucous plugging.
She did not have signs of infection and she was not initially started on antibiotics.
Over the next two days, the patient required frequent suctioning and chest physical therapy secondary to lack of a cough due to her severe multiple sclerosis.
Given the patient's recent aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent mucous plugging after extubation secondary to thick secretions and her inability to clear them, the patient was offered a tracheostomy and the patient and her husband agreed to this.
On [**2128-2-26**], a tracheostomy was placed by the interventional pulmonology team without complications.
Lidocaine and Epinephrine was injected around her tracheostomy site where there was some oozing and this resolved over the course of the next twelve hours.
Cardiac - After the patient was admitted, a CK and troponin was sent secondary to her sinus tachycardia.
The patient did not have any previous history of cardiac disease.
A beta blocker was not started secondary to low blood pressure.
However, the troponin leak was thought to be secondary to demand ischemia.
The patient's electrocardiograms had some T wave inversions in III, aVF and V3, however, looking back on previous electrocardiograms, these were intermittently also inverted.
The patient should have an echocardiogram to follow-up as there is no history of cardiac disease for any new wall motion abnormality.
Hypotension - During the course of her stay, the patient occasionally was hypotensive to the high 70s systolic, low 80s.
The patient never had a high fever and her white blood cell count never rose.
The patient was bolused several times during two nights secondary to her hypotension.
However, the patient was asymptomatic with this and her urine output remained steady and greater than 30cc/hour at all times.
Therefore, it was concluded that the patient's blood pressure runs low, especially when she is asleep and this did not need to be aggressively treated unless the patient is symptomatic which she does not appear to be during this hospital stay.
In addition, the patient may have some autonomic insufficiency related to her neurologic disorder.
In discussion with the patient's husband, the patient had never had a magnetic resonance scan in the past to diagnose her, lumbar puncture, and had had very little treatment or workup for her disease.
In addition, the patient's daughter had been recently diagnosed with magnetic resonance scan and it was thought that this patient's disease was not multiple sclerosis given it was atypical.
Nutrition - The patient was continued on he PEJ tube feeds during her hospital course without high residuals or other problems.
Her sputum culture grew oropharyngeal flora, gram positive rods and gram positive cocci.
In addition, the patient's urinalysis, which did not have signs of infection other than [**3-12**] white blood cells, did grow out Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus.
The patient was not treated for this as her urinalysis did not have evidence of infection and her white blood cell count was not elevated and she was afebrile.
Hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to mucous plugging.
The patient could also be considered for a neurologic referral so that she has a primary neurologist.
The patient should also be considered for a future echocardiogram to evaluate for any abnormality given recent troponin leak attributed during this admission to demand ischemia.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg twice a day, hold for loose stools.
