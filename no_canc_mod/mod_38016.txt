Recently, the patient had been admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for renal failure where he received ultrafiltration.
He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 **] and without incident yesterday he noticed a painful swollen rash on his left leg over the site of his SVG.
He said that the pain was a "stinging" [**7-5**] of ten.
It was not relieved with OTC pain medications, but the pain resolved with time.
He reports severe shortness of breath on exertion however, this is his baseline.
He also notes a chronic cough which he says is from "fluid overload."
He denies nausea, vomiting, or change in his bowel or bladder habits.

Unaware of biological family history  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals: T:97.4 BP:114/57 P:71 R:16 O2:99 General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, poor dentition Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Pt with LLE swelling x1 day.
Left leg swollen more than right.
Atrophic skin with dark venous stasis changes.
3+ pitting edema to the thigh.
Pulses 2+ Skin: Venous stasis changes b/l LE.
DISCHARGE EXAM: GENERAL: 80 yo M, extubated, AAOx3 (not date but oriented to year and president) CHEST: no wheezes, BB rales slightly worse on left, no rhonchi, CV: S1 S2 Normal in quality and intensity RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur at apex.
EXT: wwp, trace edema in LE.
Chronic venous stasis changes, no edema.
There is moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis.
The mild perihilar opacity on the right is unchanged.
No evidence of larger pleural effusions.
The diameter of the vascular structures might indicate mild fluid overload, as observed on [**2115-4-1**], 4:15 a.m. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities  CXR [**4-1**]:Compared to the previous radiograph, the film focuses on the upper abdomen.
With the given technical limitations, there are no other changes.
Moderate cardiomegaly with extensive retrocardiac and mild right perihilar opacity.
No larger pleural effusions.
No indirect evidence of arterial insufficiency to either upper extremity or indirect evidence of central venous stenosis involving either upper extremity.
Patent bilateral cephalic and basilic veins.
Note of no arterial calcifications; however, paired right brachial arteries.
EEG [**4-11**]: Abnormal EEG due to the very low voltage background activity, no definite activity of cortical origin.
These findings are indicative of a severe encephalopathy.
The most common causes of such encephalopathies are anoxia and substantial sedating medications.
Of note, this recording was not done in order to evaluate presence or absence of cortical activity and so cannot be used for prognosis.
There were no focal abnormalities but encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.
CT head [**4-12**]: FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or infarction.
There is cystic encephalomalacia of the right occipital lobe consistent with old infarction.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is consistent with age-related involutional changes.
A focus of hypoattenuation in the right putamen is consistent with an old lacunar infarct.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no fracture.
There is chronic and likely developmental underpneumatization of the right mastoid air cells which are nevertheless clear.
The left mastoid air cells and bilateral middle ear cavities are clear.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
There is probably small volume of pleural fluid bilaterally, particularly on the left because of the persistent left lower lobe collapse.
No pneumothorax.
Dual-channel right supraclavicular dialysis catheters end in the low SVC and upper right atrium respectively.
No pneumothorax or free air below the diaphragm.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2115-4-19**] 04:41AM BLOOD WBC-6.8 RBC-3.32* Hgb-8.8* Hct-28.5* MCV-86 MCH-26.5* MCHC-30.9* RDW-21.0* Plt Ct-103* [**2115-4-18**] 05:08AM BLOOD PT-16.7* PTT-39.2* INR(PT)-1.6* [**2115-4-19**] 04:41AM BLOOD Glucose-84 UreaN-19 Creat-3.6*# Na-143 K-3.9 Cl-104 HCO3-28 AnGap-15 [**2115-4-18**] 05:08AM BLOOD ALT-16 AST-23 LD(LDH)-230 AlkPhos-108 TotBili-0.6 [**2115-4-19**] 04:41AM BLOOD Calcium-7.9* Phos-2.8 Mg-2.1  Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE Patient presented to the ICU with altered mental status and respiratory distress unable to protect his airway.
Addditionally, having jerking movements concerning for seizure activity.
Continued to have worsening urine output, but improved mental status while holding cefepime, mexilitine, and quinidine.
In summary, the pt is an 80y/o gentleman with CAD s/p CABG x2, sCHF EF 25%, VT/AT/AVNRT s/p ICD and ablation, CKD, DM2 and chronic venous stasis who initially presented with LLE cellulitis, course complicated by worsening CHF unresponsive to diuresis, [**Last Name (un) **] progressing to uremia requiring HD, AMS with myoclonus requiring intubation for airway protection, and superimposed pustular MSSA cellulitis, who was subsequently extubated with gradually improving mental status and transferred to the CCU due to hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT.  #.
He is s/p multiple procedures and ICD for his various arrythmias.
Likely mechanism of his VT was thought to be re-entry from ischemia-related scar.
Reason for recurrence was thought to be mild ischemia at HD on the day of transfer due to his anti-arrhythmics being held.
He had a few rare episodes of VT in the CCU that were self-terminating.
He remained asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable throughout CCU course #1.
No focal neuro deficits.
Also had LP given vesicular rash with concern for viral encephalitis: HSV/VZV PCR negative and no e/o infection in CSF.
Likely AMS was toxic-metabolic in nature with multiple contributing causes including uremia and infection.
He was treated for cellulitis with antibiotics and initiated on HD for renal failure.
He was reluctant to participate in activities but agreed to with frequent prompting.
LLE cellulitis: Initially dx with non-purulent cellulitis, which he is at increased risk for given chronic BLE venous stasis.
In ICU developed superimposed vesicular rash (non-dermatomal pattern) for which derm consult was consulted: no HSV/VZV in CSF or vesicular swab.
He remained afebrile without leukocytosis after stopping abx and his rash did not recur.
[**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient has been hospitalized multiple times for renal failure and required UF once in the past.
This time his renal failure worsened on the floor in the setting of volume overload, then was refractory to diuretics [**12-27**] poor forward flow.
Also complicated by severe right heart failure causing preload dependence which made volume status management difficult.
Added on hepatitis serologies which were neg for HAV and HCV but c/w past infection to HBV.
Has ischemic CM including right heart failure causing significant preload dependence.
Held ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given renal failure.
Likely pt will not benefit from long-term effects of these so there is low urgency to start these.
Started isosorbide dinitrate 10mg po BID and hydralazine 10mg QID to reduce preload and afterload.
no other anticoag b/c of prostate bleeding history.
C. diff: pt developed loose stools prior to CCU transfer.
He also had lower abdominal tenderness.
He was initiated on IV flagyl and and his diarrhea and abdominal tenderness improved.
He never had leukocytosis or fever but was recently treated with multiple abx including vanco, clinda, cefepime, and zosyn.
Overnight, on the floor, he had an episode of chest pain and tachypnea at approximately 12:30am, although he was saturating well (> 95% on room air).
Troponin mildly elevated, in the setting of dialysis dependent renal injury.
At approximately 4:20am, code blue was called for patient unresponsive and pulseless.
His renal function continued to be poor, but dialysis was difficult to initiate in the setting of tenuous blood pressures (80s to 90s) and the worry that SBPs would drop with large fluid shifts.
ON ARRIVAL THERE, THE PATIENT WAS FELT TO BE CONFUSED AND WAS THEREFORE TRANSFERRED BACK TO THE [**Hospital1 18**] EMERGENCY ROOM.

You had a lot of complications during your treatment, including worsening of your heart failure and kidney function and inability to manage your fluid status, which led to initiationg of hemodialysis.
You also developed confusion from your kidney failure and infection and you were intubated to protect your breathing.
You were transferred for the cardiac ICU for an irregular heart rhythm (ventricular tachycardia) but this improved by putting you back on your home medications.
