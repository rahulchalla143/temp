The prenatal course was significant for late prenatal care, advanced maternal age, insulin-dependent gestational diabetes requiring NPH and Humulin insulin, and Rh isoimmunization.
It was unclear if the etiology of the diabetes was gestational diabetes versus type 2.
On [**2152-12-11**] she was admitted for concern that she was approaching zone 3 in [**Last Name (un) 31425**] curve, but a repeat amniocentesis during this admission showed that she was again in midzone 2.
On the day of delivery there was concern for worsening isoimmunization prompting delivery by cesarean section on [**2153-1-9**] at 2048 hours.
She required bulb suctioning and free flow 100% oxygen for a short period.
There were no sepsis risk factors.
There was no maternal fever.
Rupture of membranes occurred at the time of delivery.
In general, an active pale infant in mild respiratory distress.
Chest with mild intercostal/subcostal retractions.
Breath sounds are coarse bilaterally.
The abdomen is soft and nontender.
RESPIRATORY: [**Known lastname **] had persistent respiratory distress    and was placed on continuous positive airway pressure    shortly after admission to the neonatal intensive care    unit.
She did not have apnea of prematurity.
A cardiac echocardiogram    was performed on [**2153-1-15**] showing no patent ductus    arteriosus and a small patent foramen ovale with a    structurally normal heart.
She was    increased to 26 calories on [**2153-2-26**] from 24    calories per ounce because of poor weight gain, and since    that time has gained 165 grams in 2 days.
feeding, and they noted clinical signs of gastroesophageal reflux.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: [**Known lastname **] had a CBC on admission to the    neonatal intensive care unit with a normal white blood    cell count and differential.
On day of life 7, due to    lethargy, a blood culture was obtained and subsequently    grew Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to oxacillin.
She has    been on oxacillin, however, due to neutropenia secondary    to the oxacillin therapy she was changed to cefazolin on    [**2153-2-24**] and will continue cefazolin to complete a    42-day course.
GASTROINTESTINAL: [**Known lastname **] had unconjugated    hyperbilirubinemia in association with a hemolytic    disease.
RENAL: Renal and abdominal ultrasound was performed    looking for a possible clot or focus for the    Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.
NEUROLOGY: [**Known lastname **] had a head ultrasound on the day of    discharge ([**2153-2-28**]) which showed cysts in the    anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricles.
Also seen was a resolving left germinal    matrix hemorrhage with a small cyst.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  A 51-day-old (now 41.5 weeks postmenstrual age) infant completing a course of antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.
Clinical gastroesophageal reflux.
Left germinal matrix hemorrhage; resolving.
