Past Medical History: Unknown  Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: Upon admission: VS: BP  98.6  144/palp  92  99% (vented) Gen'l: sedated HEENT: ecchymosis left eye; + bleeding from left nare.
NONCONTRAST CT HEAD: There are tiny foci of intracranial hemorrhage adjacent to the right thalamus.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
Left temporomandibular glenoid fossa fracture, left zygomatic process fracture, left inferior and medial orbital wall blowout fractures, left inferior orbital rim fracture, left maxillary sinus medial and lateral wall fractures, left nasal fracture, left lateral orbital wall fracture, right medial lamina papyracea of fracture, multiple ethmoid fractures.
There are multiple foci of hemorrhage within the ethmoid sinuses as well as air- fluid levels in the left maxillary sinus and right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Stable exam when compared with outside study demonstrating multiple facial fractures and scattered foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
MAXILLOFACIAL CT SERIES NON-CONTRAST: Left temporomandibular clinoid fossa fracture, left zygomatic process fracture, left inferior and medial orbital wall blowout fractures, left inferior orbital rim fracture, left maxillary sinus, medial, and lateral wall fractures, left nasal fracture, right maxillary fractures are unchanged.
There are multiple foci of hemorrhage within the sinuses which are slightly increased since prior exam.
Multiple unchanged facial fractures with scattered foci of bleeding into the paranasal sinuses.
Extensive dissection of air into the soft tissues of the neck is likely secondary to air leak from chest tube in right pneumothorax.
ATTENDING NOTE: Bilateral midface [**Last Name (un) 52400**] Type II fractures are noted.
FINDINGS:  HEAD CT: Punctate areas of attenuation in the right thalamic area previously described are unchanged.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent hemorrhage as previously noted.
The paranasal sinuses demonstrate unchanged opacification of the left maxillary sinus and decreased opacification of the right maxillary sinus with better aeration.
There is bilateral ethmoid mucosal thickening.
There is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally, possibly related to intubation.
There is interval resolution of left-sided periorbital soft tissue swelling on at the level of the zygoma.
There is stable subcutaneous empysema in the anterior neck spaces.
There is residual bilateral pneumothoraces.
Bilateral subcutaneous emphysema of the chest wall is again noted.
HEAD AND NECK CTA: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent with no evidence of stenosis.
There is no evidence of filling defect or contrast extravasation.
There is no evidence of dissection or aneurysmal formation.
Radiology Report CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2156-8-16**] 1:02 PM   CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Again seen are minimally displaced fractures involving the bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami.
The fracture line extends to the articular surface of the sacroiliac joint along its anterior margin.
No proximal femur fracture is evident.
No abnormal widening or narrowing of the sacroiliac joint spaces is identified.
A small amount of air is present within the collapsed urinary bladder.
There is marked subcutaneous emphysema overlying the anterior right lower quadrant superficial to the abdominal musculature.
A small amount of subcutaneous air is seen within the right groin as well.
Fluid attenuation within the left gluteus musculature is seen at the inferior and lateral aspect of the imaged field of view and represents hematoma, also seen on the previous CT examination.
No free fluid is identified within the pelvis.
IMPRESSION:  Bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami fractures and left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture, unchanged.
Probable interval increase in left iliacus and left gluteal hematomas as described above.
Subcutaneous emphysema along the anterior aspect of the right abdominal wall, similar to that seen on previous studies.
He was taken to the operating room by Orthopedics for repair of those injuries; there were no intraoperative complications.
An IVC filter was placed given his increased risk for thromboembolism.
On [**8-16**] he was taken to the operating room by Plastics Surgery for repair of his facial fractures.
There were no noted complications.
Postoperatively his swallow was evaluated again and his diet was upgraded to ground solids with nectar thickened liquids.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) Neb Rx Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Doctor First Name **] [**Location (un) 8117**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Motorcycle crash Injuries: Left orbital inferior blowout fracutre Left nasal bone fracture Left maxillary sinus fracture; fragment sinus Greater/Lesser [**Doctor First Name 362**] sphenoid fracture Bilateral 1st rib Right 2nd rib Right 8th rib Left iliac fx minimally displaced/comminuted Superior/Inferior rami fractures Right subarachnoid hemorrhage Right tibial comminuted fracture Blood in Foley   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, tolerating a regular (soft diet); pain adequately controlled.
