admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] (on [**2-7**]) w/decompensated CHF (BNP > 5000) and ARF (Cr 3.6).
She was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after presenting to her PCP's office hypotensive 60/30, w/o radial or carotid pulse.
She was also reported to have had a self limited episode of diarrhea and decreased appetite PTP.
She has a non-displaced left posterior rib fracture at 4th/6th and 7th.
Also noted to be in new ARF (cr 3.6) which was worse than her baseline of 2.1.
At the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital she had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular repsonse which was broken with IV diltiazem.
She also complained of severe dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea, minimal PND, and some LE edema for 1-2 weeks prior to hosp.
She denies cough, fevers, chills,  but did report a 20-30lbs weight loss over the course of two months, and occasionally loose stools.
Patient states that her weight loss was secondary to poor access to food.

female with h/o CRI, htn, hyperlipidemia, chronic AF and s/p mechanical AVR w/single vessel CABG w/VG to OM 92 (s/p stenting of SVG to OM [**2142-11-12**]), hypothyroid, anxiety d/o, anemia who is transferred from OSH for BiV pacer/ICD.
Initially ([**2-7**]) presented with decomp CHF and ARF, also went into af with RVR at OSH.
After ruling her out for ischemia we attempted to diurese her with IV lasix without success.
It was thought that her heart failure was such that it would preclude her from being able to lay flat on the table.
A swan ganz catheter was placed which revealed high left and right sided pressures with a low CI so she was started on pressors and lasix.
She was initially started on dopamine but failed to have improvement in her cardiac output or urine output.
In light of her baseline hypotension the holding parameters of her antihypertensives were were lowered so that she could receive them * Rhythm: Upon admission Ms. [**Known lastname 4401**] was in atrial fibrillation.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3314**] who reassured us that she had been anticoagulated since being diagnosed with atrial fibrillation approximately 5 years ago.
Following these interventions, she was in sinus rhythm overnight, but then went back into atrial fibrillation.
She was given darvocet prn for pain which she was already taking for her rib fracture.
* Ishemia: After ruling out for an MI she was continued on aspirin and a statin.
* Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname 4401**] was found to be in acute renal failure, likely secondary to poor cardiac output in addition to renal artery stenosis.
* Hypotension: The patient has very low blood pressure at baseline often asymptomatic with a SBP in the 80s.
* Anemia The patient was found to be anemic and was transfused 1 unit PRBCs.
She continued to receive EPO since a component of her anemia may be secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.
She was not deficient in B12 or folate.
* Psych: From the psychiatric standpoint, Ms. [**Known lastname 4401**] was thought to have major depression and endorsed passive suicidal ideations and a poor mood.
She was switched from coumadin to IV heparin and she was then re-started on warfarin for her atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement thus she did not receive sub Q heparin.
