The pregnancy was conceived on Clomid, complicated by a parvovirus exposure with titers, IGG 12, IGM 133, interpreted to be recovery titers.
There was a question of pericardial effusion seen on fetal ultrasound that has since resolved.
The pregnancy was then complicated by bleeding and preterm labor for which mother was seen at [**Hospital3 **] and transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] on [**2155-8-19**] with a diagnosis of abruption.
[**Hospital 37544**] medical history was notable for inflammatory bowel disease and anxiety disorder treated with Zoloft.
On the day of delivery, there was spontaneous rupture of membranes and labor was allowed to progress.
The baby emerged with spontaneous cry, subsequently developed apnea and hypotonia with heart rate of 80s, requiring bag mask ventilation for several minutes before color and heart rate improved.
He was transferred to the NICU for further management of prematurity and respiratory distress.
The baby had poor spontaneous respiratory effort and poor tone.
Breath sounds - diminished air entry bilaterally, but symmetric, fairly clear, slightly crackles.
Heart - regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
Diffuse hypotonia with decreased spontaneous movement.
He was subsequently extubated to room air on day of life #1, and remained on room air with minimal apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
He does have an intermittent murmur, initially loud and harsh, now soft, I/VI, best heard at the left upper sternal border likely secondary to FEDA.
He is currently on single-phototherapy and appeared mildly jaundiced.
6) NEURO:  [**Known lastname **] is at risk for intraventricular bleed.
No transfusion during this admission.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  [**Known lastname **] has been doing well on room air with a few apnea of prematurity episodes.
No immunizations received.
Apnea of prematurity.
