Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] met Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his family in my office and discussed the fact that he has recurrent problems and symptoms from known gallstones.

His cardiac exam shows an irregular rhythm.
Pertinent Results: EKG: Afib with ventricular pacing at 69bpm, wide QRS in RBBB pattern.
He tolerated the procedure well, but his post-operative course was complicated by respiratory distress in the PACU requiring reintubation and admission to the Surgical ICU.
The rest of his post-operative course was uneventful, however, due to his age, comorbidities and the stress of the surgery, he required a number of days to recover.
His pain was well controlled on oral medications.
Due to his low ejection fraction and the fluid shifts of surgery, the patient's weight had increased from a baseline of the low 130s to the mid 140 lb range.
[**Last Name (STitle) 665**], the patient was transferred to the Cardiology service for management of his fluid overload secondary to his congestive heart failure in the setting of a surgical intervention and the associated fluid shifts.
He tolerated diuresis well, with no signs of hemodynamic compromise.
The patient had mild abdominal pain post-surgically, that worsened [**2133-2-12**].

The patient has atrial fibrillation, s/p pacer placement and AV junction ablation.
Prior to discharge his INR was 2.7, and his goal INR has been 1.5-2.5 because of bleeding complications.
