Currently he is in atrial fibrillation, but rate controlled.

Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Alert, oriented to hospital, but can't tell me the name.
Pertinent Results: Abd US [**3-24**]: IMPRESSION: Distended gallbladder, gallbladder wall thickening, and pericholecystic fluid are concerning for acute cholecystitis.
No definite shadowing stone though echogenic GB sludge noted.
Mild intrahepatic duct dilation without definite extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Acute cholecystitis status post percutaneous cholecystostomy with decreased distention of the gallbladder lumen.
Large amount of sludge and debris seen within the gallbladder and cystic duct.
Moderate amount of perihepatic ascites.
Three hepatic cysts or hemangiomas.
Small right pleural effusion.
These may represent most likely liquefactive hematoma versus biloma, superinfection cannot be excluded.
Multiple other incidental findings including bilateral renal cysts, tortuous, calcified aorta and its branches, and fluid-filled.
CXR [**3-30**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-25**] through 10: Right lung base elevation has worsened, probably due in large part to increasing right pleural effusion.
Left lower lobe atelectasis is worsened and small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
CXR [**4-4**] Aeration at the base of the right lung and the middle and lower lobes has improved, moderate right pleural effusion persists.
No pneumothorax.
A tiny left pleural effusion is new or newly apparent.

# Acute cholecystitis: Patient found to have acute cholecystitis and treated with cholecystostomy tube placement.
Bile fluid grew out Klebsiella and E.Coli and it was complicated by Klebsiella bacteremia (positive BCx on [**3-24**]) with all surveillance cultures negative since: Patient was treated initially with broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/levofloxacin/zosyn) and then switched to PO levofloxacin/augmentin on [**4-3**] and remained afebrile on PO antibiotics.
Repeat CT abd showed possible bilioma which was unchanged in size from prior MRI.
No intervention was taken, although plan was that if any increased abdominal pain, fever, or leukocytosis, would consider evaluation of biliary drain.
He was discharged with cholecystostomy drain in place draining bilious fluid and family trained on bile drain care.
# Atrial flutter: The patient has had multiple episodes of atrial flutter with rates in the 150s, so was started on PO metoprolol.
The patient and his family can discuss possible anticoagulation with coumadin with his PCP once he has recovered from this acute event.
# Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely due to his recent acute illness (cholecystitis/infection), change in environment, and possibly medications.
# Parapneumonic effusion: Patient found to have increased R sided effusion during hospital stay and was s/p thoracentesis on [**3-31**] with removal of 1L of yellow fluid consistent with transudate.
Patient has been having good O2 sat >94% on RA with no shortness of breath on discharge.
His exam showing dullness at R base improved from prior.
# Leukocytosis: Patient with persistent leukocytosis throughout hospital stay which ranged 15-17.
Afebrile for greater than 48 hours on PO antibiotics.
If worsened or patient with fever or worsened symptoms, would recommend further eval of biliary system or pneumonia.
