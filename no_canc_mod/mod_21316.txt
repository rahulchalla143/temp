Ressucitation manoeuvers were succesful and patient was transferred to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] where she presented with a distended abdomen and abdominal pain.
A chest x-ray showed a very large amount of free air under the diaphragm.
There was no indication of mediastinal air at all.

The operation went well with no complications.
She was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Flagyl, and Diflucan for broad spectrum empiric coverage.
Her pain was well controlled with Morphine.
She was afebrile with stable vital signs and was extubated without incident on POD0.
Her nasogastric tube was putting out minimal drainage.
As the patient's history reveals three episodes of difficult swallowing in less than 2 weeks prior to the event, a bed-side swallow evaluation was ordered and demonstrated oral/pharyngeal/esophageal dysphagia.
Her diet was advanced to thin liquids w/ ground solids.
A video swallow showed slight tongue weakness and esophageal motility dysfunction with abnormal emptying and tertiary contractions.
Patient's diet was changed to regular w/ soft consistency and thin liquids.
