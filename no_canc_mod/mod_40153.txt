NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2139-6-28**]):    NO GROWTH.
There is no pneumothorax or evidence of fluid in either the pleural space or pericardium.
[**2139-6-30**] ECHO: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetations seen.
[**2139-7-1**] Upper extremity ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Small region of nonocclusive thrombus is still seen within one of the two right brachial veins.
No new DVT is identified.
No increased tracer uptake or fluid collection about the remaining cardiac device to suggest no evidence of infection or abscess related to that device.
Diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities throughout the right lung and left lower lobe with a small to moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion also seen on [**2139-6-29**] consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Perihepatic ascites consistent with cirrhosis.
Massive splenic enlargement.
[**2139-7-5**] CXR PA/LAT/LAT [**Month (only) **] FINDINGS:  There has been improvement of the airspace opacities throughout both lungs since the previous study.
There are bilateral pleural effusion.
On lateral view, there is apparent soft tissue gas within the anterior chest wall.
Brief Hospital Course: 28M with a very-complicated history of small bowel pathology s/p multiple ex-laps and rejected bowel transplantations, now TPN dependent, s/p VF arrest secondary to electrolyte abnormalities vs. IV contrast and ICD placement ([**Hospital1 112**] [**2138**]) c/b MRSA pocket infection and septecemia, now s/p device removal ([**2139-6-11**]) and s/p partial lead extraction on this admission.
ACTIVE ISSUES #Sepsis: Patient with tachycardia to the 120s and temp to 103 while already on daptomycin.
Afebrile prior to procedure and then spiked and became tachy approx 18 hours after.
Superimposed aspiration pneumonitis on top of infected hardware.
Patient had tachycardia to 150s (sinus tach), fever, and hypotension.
Patient had both infected hardward and had likely aspiration event on floor causing aspiration pneumonia.
In the ICU, patient was on meropenem, micafungin, and dapto was changed to linezolid for both hardware infection and pulmonary coverage.
Patient's hypotension and tachycardia improved, but he continued to spike fevers.
Patient went for tagged WBC scan as per recommendations of electrophysiology, which did not reveal active infection.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient with hypoxic respiratory failure on HD3, requiring transfer to ICU.
Secondary to multifocal aspiration pneumonia after vomitting.
# Infected Wires: Patient developed MRSA septeciemia which subsequently seeded his device.
Complete device removal will be an extremely high risk procedure as there is an epicardial pacer pad which will require OR and thoractomy.
Patient continued to spike fevers despite treatment of HAP, raising concern that pacer lead infection was causing fevers.
EP recommended tagged WBC scan which showed no evidence of active inflammation.
# Pancytopenia: Patient developed worsening acute on chronic pancytopenia throughout ICU course.
Heme/onc was consulted and felt this was multifactorial due to active infection, malabsorption, TPN associated cirrhosis, and anemia of chronic disease.
Less likely due to meropenum and linezolid given history of pancytopenia.
He had no evidence of hemolysis or DIC per lab evaluation.
# DVT - Patient will be continued on lovenox as an outpatient, though he reported noncompliance.
# Pain control - patient had significant complaints of pain that were treated with IV dilaudid.
CHRONIC ISSUES # FEN: Patient is TPN dependent and requires large volume TPN with extensive modification secondary to short gut syndrome.
Carefully monitor electrolytes as his etiology of his VF arrest was likely secondary to gross electrolytes abnormalities vs IV contrast dye.
5. diphenhydramine HCl 12.5 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Fifty (50) ml PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Sepsis with resolved septic shock 2.
Multifocal pneumonia with pleural effusions; complicated by:  2a.
Acute respiratory failure 3.
Infected ICD wires  3b.
MRSA bacteremia 4.
Unfortunately, following the procedure, you developed a severe infection.
It is very important that you continue to follow with your infectious disease doctors.
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 91131**] do not want to remove the rest of your ICD wires since complete wire removal would require a very large surgery and dangerous surgery.
You have an appointment coming up with the chronic pain specialists here at [**Hospital1 18**] if you continue to have pain around your ICD site.
