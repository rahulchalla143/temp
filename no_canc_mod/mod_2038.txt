History of Present Illness: 80yoF w/ a h/o pAF (on Dronedarone) and hypertension, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 1516**], represented to the ED this morning with general malaise, chest heaviness, and self-reported bradycardia.
The patient had been hospitalized from [**2021-2-6**] for new onset atrial fibrillation and was started on dronedarone for rhythm control.
The patient represented to the ED early in the AM of [**2-15**] with Atrial fibrillation with RVR (120s).
Once she got home, she took her home medications (metoprolol, norvasc, dronedarone) and developed generalized fatigue and noted her pulse to be in the 30s, prompting her to return to the ED.
She complained of fatigue, malaise, and chest discomfort.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: mild AR and mild MR. Palpitations associated with atypical CP.
HTN GERD Hepatitis B CKD s/p L nephrectomy [**2108**]   Social History: Worked as ob/gyn in [**Country 651**], lives with husband, daughter [**Name (NI) 8513**] very involved.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
The severity of mitral and aortic regurgitation are similar.
Multiple overlying wires limit the evaluation.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
IMPRESSION: No acute interval change.
CXR [**2-17**]: IMPRESSION: Recommend repeat chest radiograph in four hours to determine stability of new left deep sulcus which raises possibility of pneumothorax post ICD placement.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o F with pAF and hypertension presenting with bradycardia, likely manifestation of sick sinus syndrome.
Presentation ECG was consistent with sick sinus syndrome with normal AV conduction (see admission EKG description in the Results section).
Her symptoms of dizziness, malaise and nausea resolved after the temp pacing wire was put in.
Patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.
# PUMP:  Patient received 4L NS bolus in ED for hypotension.
On admission to CCU, she was volume overloaded on exam with signs of L sided heart failure from aggressive fluid resusitation.
Echo on [**2112-2-15**] showed preserved systolic function.
Patient had no angina or anginal equivalents during this hospital stay.
Admission Cr 1.2, likely pre-renal etiology secondary to hypotension.
# Hepatitis B:  Diagnosed > 10 years ago, unclear mode of transmission.
Patient was seen in the Liver Clinic in [**2109**], and was recommended against liver Bx and treatment given low viral load and lack of clinical symptoms.
Acetaminophen Extra Strength 500 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every eight (8) hours as needed for fever, headache.
Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] vna  Discharge Diagnosis: Sick Sinus syndrome   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You had a pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome, a slow heart rate.
There were no complications from this pacemaker.
You will need to take antibiotics for the next two days to prevent an infection at the pacer site.
If you notice any bleeding, increasing bruising or pain at the pacer site, please call the device clinic.
Take Tylenol for any discomfort at the pacemaker site.
4. take Cephalexin for 2 days as a precaution against infection from the pacemaker.
