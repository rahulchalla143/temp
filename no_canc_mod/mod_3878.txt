................... Name:  [**Known lastname 21124**], [**Known firstname **]        Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 21125**]  Admission Date:  [**2124-7-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2124-7-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2048-6-14**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Epigastric pain and bloating.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 76-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease with a history of inferior wall myocardial infarction in [**2093**] status post CABG in [**2093**] and a redo CABG in [**2111**], who is admitted on [**2124-7-17**] for three days of persistent epigastric discomfort.
Patient at this point denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, or sweats.
The patient complained of increased bloating and belching not similar to anginal pains that he had experienced in the past.
He denied having any chest pain for the past 12 years.
On [**2124-7-19**], patient was awoken from his sleep complaining of [**10-13**] anginal chest pain.
Electrocardiogram was without evidence of ST segment elevations.
Initial cardiac enzymes were negative on admission, however, now were significant for troponin-T elevation from 0.54 to 0.85.
Echocardiogram was performed, and patient was found to have ejection fraction of 25%, PA systolic pressure of 58, which is elevated and a new 4+ mitral regurgitation.
In the Catheterization Laboratory, angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of proximal saphenous vein graft to his right coronary artery, and 80% stenosis of his distal LIMA.
Stent was placed on the proximal region of his saphenous vein graft with no evidence of residual stenosis and result in TIMI III flow.
Coronary artery disease.
Patient has inferior myocardial infarction in [**2093**] status post CABG.
Noted to have a pressure gradient across his left subclavian artery.
Peripheral vascular disease status post CABG [**2124-6-13**] with left renal stent placed for renal artery stenosis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram [**2124-7-19**] shows ejection fraction of 25%, mitral regurgitation 4+, tricuspid regurgitation 3+, akinetic left ventricular wall motion and dilated RV.
Bilateral carotid endarterectomies.
Father deceased from congestive heart failure at 80 years of age.
Patient was generally laying in bed and calm in no acute distress.
Positive bilateral carotid bruits, positive elevated jugular venous pressure.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate, S1, S2 present, [**3-9**] holosystolic murmur at the apex and left sternal border.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds bilaterally, crackles noted at the anterior bases bilaterally.
Extremities:  Pulses 2+, no edema and right femoral line placed.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 76-year-old male with coronary artery disease now with elevated troponins and occlusion of his saphenous vein graft to his right coronary artery, status post stent placement with no evidence of residual stenosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was continued on the milrinone drip for afterload reduction with the understanding that mitral regurgitation may decrease and improve perfusion.
In terms of ischemia, the patient denied any further chest pain.
No electrocardiogram changes were noticed.
Patient was noted to have ectopic beats on milrinone drip.
Patient also received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a drop in his hematocrit from 25.8 corrected to 31.6.
On admission to the CCU, patient's chest x-ray showed pulmonary vascular congestion.
In terms of his rhythm, patient converted between atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm, and demonstrated evidence of paroxysmal atrial flutter as well as premature atrial contractions, however, patient's rhythm is corrected on its own.
The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm, however, due to his current ischemia and dilated left atrium, the patient was started on Coumadin to prevent thrombus formation.
In terms of the patient's renal function, his creatinine was elevated to 2.2 on admission to the CCU with afterload reduction, increased perfusion of the kidneys, and appropriate diuresis, patient's creatinine trended down to 1.6 and is currently improving.
Patient also complained of dysuria.
Her urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrates.
The patient was not started on antibiotics, but was given trial of Pyridium for symptomatic relief.
Repeat echocardiogram showed dilated left atrium with diameter of 5.7 cm.
Left ventricular wall showed basal and mid inferior akinesis, dilated RV and LV which was larger than on previous examination, 4+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation without significant change, and an ejection fraction of 20-25%.
Cardiovascular: A. Coronary artery disease and status post PCI with saphenous vein graft to his RCA.
Pump:  Ejection fraction of 25%, 4+ mitral regurgitation, dilated left ventricle and right ventricle, and dilated left atrium.
The patient is at increased risk for atrial fibrillation given LA size and ischemia.
C. Rhythm:  As stated before, the patient will be continued on his Coumadin for risk of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and will be sent home with [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor on discharge.
Gout:  Patient had episode of pain consistent with gout in his left big toe.
Patient has had diagnosis of gout in the past, and has been treated successfully with Indocin, however, at the time of treatment, the patient's kidney function was not at baseline, therefore nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories cannot be initiated.
Renal:  Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase or nitrate.
Dysuria is likely secondary to due to inflammation and trauma from the Foley.
The patient was started on Lasix 40 q day and will be sent home on this medication as patient is likely to have dietary indiscretion as an outpatient.
