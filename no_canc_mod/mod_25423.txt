She noted that the pain was worse and throbbing when she stood up.
She felt slightly better.
Today she had a massage and her head "exploded" again.

Neurologically Intact  Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2174-2-4**] 07:57PM [**Year/Month/Day 3143**] WBC-11.9* RBC-4.59 Hgb-14.2 Hct-40.4 MCV-88 MCH-  Labs on Discharge:  COMPLETE [**Year/Month/Day 3143**] COUNT  WBC  RBC  Hgb  Hct  MCV MCH M CHC RDW  Plt Ct [**2174-2-17**] 04:30AM    6.8 4.24 13.5 39.9 94  31.8 33.9 13.2 405   ------------------ IMAGING: ------------------ CTA Head [**2-4**]: CT angiography of the head demonstrates approximately 6 mm right posterior communicating artery aneurysm extending posteriorly and having a bilobed appearance.
There is no vascular occlusion or stenosis seen.
IMPRESSION: 6 to 7 mm right posterior communicating artery aneurysm with bilobed appearance pointing posteriorly.
No vascular occlusion or stenosis identified.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 6 mm.
No vascular occlusion or stenosis seen.
[**Known lastname 86671**],[**Known firstname **] [**Medical Record Number 86672**] F  44  [**2129-4-22**]  Radiology Report CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2174-2-14**] 1:11 PM   Final Report INDICATION: 44-year-old woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage, status post aneurysm coiling and subsequent vasospasm.
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE HEAD: Compared to the prior studies, there is almost complete resolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is unchanged hypodensity in the left basal ganglia, likely representing prominent Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **] space or old lacunar infarct.
The left middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral arteries, and bilateral posterior cerebral arteries are normal without evidence of vascular abnormalities.
CT PERFUSION: Mean transit time, cerebral [**Doctor First Name **] volume and cerebral [**Doctor First Name **] flow images are normal.
Unchanged left basal ganglia hypodensity, likely representing a prominent Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **] space or old lacunar infarct.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: 44-year-old female with history of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage and status post PCom aneurysm coiling, for further evaluation to exclude vasospasm.
Artifacts are seen in this region which limits the evaluation of surrounding vascular structures.
There is now mild-to-moderate right-sided middle cerebral artery vasospasm identified without occlusion or obliteration of the lumen of the artery.
The left middle cerebral artery and the anterior cerebral arteries as well as the posterior circulation arteries are well maintained without vasospasm.
The CT head obtained before contrast demonstrate interval decrease in subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Mild-to-moderate right middle cerebral artery M1 segment vasospasm is identified which appears nonocclusive.

Brief Hospital Course: On [**2174-2-4**] Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] for what she described as an explosion in her head while receiving a massage.
On exam at [**Hospital1 18**] she had no neurological deficits and after repeating a scan and obtaining a CTA it was determined she likely had an aneurysm 2 weeks prior and had rebled.
She was admitted and on [**2-5**] she underwent cerebral angiogram for diagostics and was found to have a posterior communicating artery aneurysm which was coiled.
At post-angio check on the 13th she had severe headache.
On the morning of [**2-7**] it was noted that following the removal of her arterial line she complained of some numbness and tingling in her left hand.
She continued to complain of a slight headache while in the ICU but as of [**2-11**] her exam remained nonfocal.
CTA showed vasospasm in R MCA and ACA, but patient remained nonfocal.
Her repeat imaging was without vasospasm.
