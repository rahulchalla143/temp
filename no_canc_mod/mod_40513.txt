Admission Date:  [**2190-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-3-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2132-1-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / pentamidine isethionate  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**] Chief Complaint: Transfer for GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Angiogram RIJ line placement PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: 58 yo M with hx of HIV who was transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for initial presentation of COPD exacerbation and who then developed a massive GI bleed.
COPD improved on nebs, IV steroids and IV antibiotics.
Within 2-3 days of admission, patient developed a GI bleed, which started as a combination of melena and hematochezia.
During course of bowel prep for colonoscopy he developed massive rectal bleeding.
Patient subsequently went into hypovolemic and hemorrhagic shock and was transferred to the ICU where he received continuous blood transfusions and fluid resuscitation.
He remained persistently hypotensive and continued to bleed so he was started on pressors on [**2-23**].
They were unable to clearly visualize any bleeding because the entire colon (from the cecum to rectum) was full of blood.
The scope was sent right midway into the ileum where there was also blood suggesting a mid-point GI bleed, however GI was unable to locate a specific area.
Other complications during his hospital course included a left iliac partial thrombosis.
Also developed rising creatinine to ~1.3 and consulted renal who felt likely HIV nephropathy.
Consulted ID for possible of PCP pneumonia and per ID note he was ruled out by sputums.
He subsequently became very tachycardic and hypotensive, and was found to have large mealonic stool.
He underwent a CTA, which showed active bleeding in a loop of mid-to-distal ileum situated within the right hemipelvis.
Patient had a second CTA on [**2-28**], but no active bleed was identified.
Mr. [**Known lastname 26211**] also experienced some respiratory distress and pulmonary edema requiring 2 days of intubation.
Solumedrol, which was started at OSH for COPD exacerbation, was tapered from 40mg IV bid to 40mg IV qd.
States he has not had any BRBPR or melena today.

TOXOPLASMA IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2190-3-5**]):       NEGATIVE FOR TOXOPLASMA IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
**FINAL REPORT [**2190-3-4**]**     Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2190-3-4**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii).
Nuclear medicine GI bleeding scan [**2190-2-25**]: essentially negative GI bleeding study wuithout evidence of active GI bleeding during the 1 hr scan 2.
No mass lesion.
Moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites with mesenteric edema.
Left internal iliac artery partially thrombosed aneurysm with diffuse aortoiliac athersclerotic vascular disease.
Cholelithiasis, no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
CXR: no acute process .
There is no CHF, frank consolidation, or gross effusion.
However, there is minimal irregular opacity at the right costophrenic angle, ?
related to localized scarring and/or pleural thickening.
There are also smaller irregular opacities at the left costophrenic angle, biapical pleural thickening, and right apical linear scarring.
There is mildly distended transverse colon (6.6 cm), near the splenic flexure.
A curvilinear sliver of gas projecting above the left hemidiaphragm likely represents an artifact due to superimposition of bowel loops, rather than free air.
Findings consistent with active small-bowel hemorrhage/extravasation.
Free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis.
Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with ectatic left common iliac artery and right common iliac pseudoaneurysm and thrombosed left internal iliac aneurysm with distal retrograde filling.
Left lung base ill-defined opacity could be infectious or inflammatory, to be followed.
SMA-gram demonstrated no active extravasation.
Angiograms from ileal branches and subsequently ileocolic branch did not demonstrate active extravasation, pseudoaneurysm or early draining vein.
A nuclear RBC scan is recommended to see if there is persistent bleeding.
CTA abdomen/pelvis [**2-28**] (wet read): No active bleed at this time.
No bleed seen at the distal small bowel site, as seen previously.
Mild increase in the abdominal- pelvic free fluid and anasarca.
Bilateral moderate simple pleural effusions with basal atelectasis, slightly larger since prior study of [**2-27**].
Tagged RBC study [**3-1**]: Normal study with no evidence of GI bleeding during the time of study.
Chest x-ray [**3-2**]: Moderately severe pulmonary edema is new, accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusion, but heart size and mediastinal vascular caliber are normal.
This could be due to transient effects of transfusion, either increased osmotic load alone, or in combination with TRALI.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with normal left ventricular diastolic function.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Labs on Discharge:  [**2190-3-7**] 06:45AM BLOOD Hct-42.5 [**2190-3-8**] 06:55AM BLOOD ALT-144* AST-46* AlkPhos-109 TotBili-9.3* DirBili-0.6* IndBili-8.7  Brief Hospital Course: 58M HIV+ who was hospitalized at OSH for COPD exacerbation where he developed massive LGIB with negative colonoscopy, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible IR embolization.
# Gastrointestinal bleeding: Patient developed massive LGIB at OSH, requiring large volume RBC transfusions.
Multiple unsuccessful attempts at colonoscopies secondary to ongoing bleeding at OSH.
He does have history of hemorrhoids, but no history of diverticulosis.
On CTA, there was bleeding visualized in a loop of mid-to-distal ileum situated within the right hemipelvis.
This was most likely secondary to rising LFTs in setting of Dapsone.
Unfortunately, when patient received pentamadine treatment, he went into respiratory distress and required solumedrol.
# COPD/Repiratory Failure: Originally admitted to OSH for COPD exacerbation.
Per report, has never had diagnosis of COPD until this admission.
Also had some pulmonary edema on chest x-ray and was diuresed with Lasix.
Unclear why he had pulmonary edema, probably because of fluid overload given massive transfusions.
As patient was started on high dose steroids at OSH for COPD exacerbation, he was discharged on 2 week predisone taper.
# Hypotension: Likely secondary to GI bleed as has resolved with appropriate transfusions.
# Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to steroids.
Patient had BCx, UCx, and C. Diff all of which were negative.
Patient was started on steroids for COPD exacerbation on [**2-18**] .
# Transaminitis: Notable for elevations in ALT, AST, bilirubin.
Given trended down without alternative intervention besides hemodynamic stability, likely some element of hepatic shock.
Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 26211**],  You were initially admitted to an outside hospital initially with trouble breathing.
During the hospitalization, you developed profuse bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract and were transferred to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center for further care.
During the admission, you had a chest x-ray which showed that your lungs were quite inflated suggestive of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) which is caused by an extensive smoking history.
We increased your dose, but, this caused some blood test abnormalities suggesting that this medicine was causing your blood cells to [**Doctor Last Name **].
Unfortunately, when you received the treatment, you had an allergic reaction and had strouble breathing.
*START Albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath.
