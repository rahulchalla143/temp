DKA: The patient presented with nausea and vomiting (non bloody) that he felt was c/w gastroparesis, and halved his home Glargine because of decreased PO intake.
The likely trigger was poor absorption [**1-25**] gastroparesis.
He also underwent an infectious workup, and blood cultures, UA/urine culture, and CXR were found negative for acute infection.
Nausea/vomiting: Likely c/w gastroparesis, given consistency w/ prior symptoms.
CKD: Baseline Cr 2.5-2.6, On admission Cr 3.4 Likely pre-renal in etiology given history of nausea/vomiting and improvement w/ fluids.
When the patient presented to the ED he had very elevated pressures but did not receive medications there.
# Tachycardia: Likely [**1-25**] hypovolemia, could also be reflex tachycardia from hydralazine.
14. prochlorperazine maleate 10 mg Tablet Sig: 2.5 Tablets PO BID:PRN as needed for nausea.
You were admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (very high blood sugars) after decreasing your insulin dose because of gastroparesis.
Given that this is your second admission for diabetes in the last few months, we are arranging follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 76274**] in order to optimize your diabetes therapy.
During this admission, you also had elevated blood pressures.
If you develop a fever, pass-out, have shortness of breath, increased urination or overwhelming fatigue, or have blood sugars that you are unable to control with insulin, please call your primary care doctor or return to the emergency department.
