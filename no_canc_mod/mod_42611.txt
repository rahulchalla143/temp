RADIOLOGY  Final Report CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2117-6-4**] 3:08 PM CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS Reason: please evaluate from chin to mid thigh / include neck, arch Contrast: [**Hospital 13288**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 43 year old woman with thrombus in Aorta REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate from chin to mid thigh / include neck, arch vessels to external iliacs CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There is suggestion of left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is at the upper limits of normal for size measuring 3.5 cm in maximum dimension.The aortic valve appears tricuspid There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a tiny left pleural effusion.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
Emphysematous changes are demonstrated involving the upper lobes bilaterally.
There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Multiple low-density lesions are demonstrated within both hepatic lobes, likely cysts.
Layering high density is demonstrated within the gallbladder, likely sludge.
At the upper pole of the right kidney, there is a 2.3 cm low- density lesion with a suggestion of enhancing septations within it, further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is a large region of wedge shaped low density within the spleen consistent with known splenic infarction.
There is no ascites, lymphadenopathy, or free intraperitoneal gas.
The thyroid gland is heterogeneous and demonstrates multiple low-density regions, correlation with ultrasound is recommended.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The uterus is enlarged and the uterine contour is lobulated with multiple enhancing lesions consistent with uterine fibroids.
There is no ascites, lymphadenopathy, or free intraperitoneal gas.
No adnexal lesions are demonstrated.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
CTA: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection.
Multiple foci of adherent thrombus are demonstrated within the lower thoracic aorta and upper abdominal aorta above the level of the renal arteries consistent with known thrombus.
There are single bilateral renal arteries, which are widely patent.
No thrombus is demonstrated in the infrarenal aorta down to the bifurcation.
There is no evidence of thrombus within the iliac arteries or femoral arteries bilaterally to the level of the mid SFAs.
Multiple foci of adherent thrombus in the lower thoracic aorta and the suprarenal abdominal aorta as described.
Large splenic infarction.
Suggestion of left ventricular hypertrophy and ascending aorta at the upper limits of normal in size, correlation with echocardiography to evaluate for valvular disease may be helpful.
2.3 cm low-density lesion within the right kidney, which does not appear as a simple cyst, correlation with MRI is recommended 7.
Multiple large uterine fibroids.
No prior comparison exams are available.
Cardiac silhouette may displace mild prominence of the right atrium but is within normal limits.
The aorta is slightly unfolded.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions (left greater than right).
No evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION: Probable small bilateral pleural effusions, otherwise no acute cardiopulmonary process.
EXERCISE MIBI Reason: 43 YR OLD WOMAN WITH AORTIC ATHEROMA SHOWERING EMBOLI ASSESS CARDIAC FUNCTION PRE-OP FOR AORTIC RESECTION RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA: 9.8 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2117-6-7**]); 30.8 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2117-6-7**]); HISTORY: Chest tightness and SOB.
Resting heart rate: 82 bpm Resting blood pressure: 110/80 Exercise Duration: 7 min Peak heart rate: 133 bpm Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained: 75 % Peak blood pressure: 156/74 Symptoms during exercise: none Reason exercise terminated: fatigue ECG findings: 0.5 mm ST segment depression in V4-6 at peak exercise, which progressed to biphasic T waves in early recovery and returned to baseline by minute 10 of recovery METHOD: Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium.
Gated images were not performed secondary to technical difficulties caused by the patient's irregular heart rate.
Gated images and LVEF not calculated secondary to technical difficulties.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: f/u INDICATION: Status post endarterectomy of descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.
PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison to a day prior reveals that the patient has been extubated and pulmonary artery catheter has been removed with right internal jugular vascular sheath persisting and terminating over the upper superior vena cava.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette demonstrates no short interval change with moderate layering pleural effusions, bilaterally, as well as retrocardiac opacity.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: 1)New moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions 2)Retrocardiac opacity likely reperesents atelectasis but in the appropriate clinical setting could represent airspace consolidation.
Again is seen evidence of bilateral pleural effusions which appear likely to be unchanged on the left side and improved on the right side.
There does appear to be a tiny left apical pneumothorax.
No other changes noted since the prior examination.
2) Possible tiny apical pneumothorax.
3) Bilateral pleural effusions.
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation after endartectomy of descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.
There is worsening in bibasal consolidations and increased bilateral pleural effusion.
Although there is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema, the increased interstitial perihilar haziness may represent volume overload or mild congestive heart failure.
The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.
There is no change in mediastinal contours.
She underwent pre-operative workup and underwent a left thoracotomy on [**2117-6-8**] with the following: (1) Thoracic and abdominal aortic atherectomy using right heart bypass (2) Epiaortic duplex scan (3) Left femoral artery reconstruction (4) Endarterectomy of thoracic and abdominal aorta (5) Epiaortic duplex and (6) Repair of left femoral vessels.
On POD 1, she was afebrile and her pain was well-controlled with a Dilaudid PCA.
Her diet was advanced as tolerated without complications.
On POD 2, she continued to remain afebrile and tolerating a regular diet.
Her chest tubes and spinal drains were discontinued without complications and her pain remained well-controlled.
She remained afebrile and tolerating a regular diet.
She remained afebrile and tolerating a regular diet.
PO once a day as needed for heartburn.
Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Thoracic and abdominal aortic atheroma with history of embolic disease to the left foot, as well as the spleen   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room for the following: - chest pain - shortness-of-breath - pain not relieved by prescribed pain medication - inability to tolerate food - increased redness or purulent drainage from your incision - or other concerns .
You will need a MRI to evaluate the 2.3 cm low-density lesion within the right kidney on your CT scan.
