In summary, this is an 87-year-old left-handed man with a history of hypertension, recent pulmonary embolism, and urinary tract infection who has had a new right pontine stroke.
The patient was relatively stable although continues to have these multiple medical problems with planned transfer to Rehabilitation.
He developed progressively worsening respiratory distress most consistent with worsening aspiration on exam.
He had a progressively increasing oxygen requirement with PO2 of 48 on arterial blood gas.
He was taken emergently for chest CT to evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
This showed a moderate to large left pleural effusion which had increased in size.
There was no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out retroperitoneal bleed which showed no evidence of this.
