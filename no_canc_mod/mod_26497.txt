Acute infarcts involving the right parietal and occipital lobes as well as right cerebellum, likely embolic in nature.
Focal stenosis of the posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally.
Stenosis at the origin of the left vertebral artery and a possible focal narrowing of the left V3 segment.
[**2180-3-23**] Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
No dissection is seen (trans-thoracic echo cannot exclude).
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
There is no other likely source of embolism seen.
Radiology Report PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2180-3-26**] 7:29 AM  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 69 yo man with distended and tender abd Final Report: There are dilated loops of predominantly small bowel with relative paucity of large bowel gas.
This raises the possibility of partial or early small-bowel obstruction.
IMPRESSION: Possible small-bowel obstruction.

His MRI showed MCA/PCA territory infarction on his R side.
He was not felt to be a candidate for an intervention as his vertebral clot could break off and cause basilar occlusion if attempted to be intervened on and no other clots were identified on vessel imaging.
Further, anticoagulation was felt to be too risky due to concern for aortic root penetrating ulcer, so heparin was not started.
His BUN and creatinine were also noted to be elevated at 25/1.5, likely due to exposure to a significant amount of contrast during the catheterization.
An NG tube was placed and 600ml of bilious fluid returned immediately.
A KUB revealed possible air under the left hemidiaphram.
The family felt he was uncomfortable and requested that morphine be given.
