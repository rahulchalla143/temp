He takes his own pulse frequently and states it has been in the 80s and regular.
Today he felt suddenly short of breath with exertion.
He laid down and his symptoms resolved.
He had no chest pain or palpitations.
Recently had hospital stay for spine surgery complicated by urinary retention.
During that hospital stay he was found to have an atrial tachycardia.
He then developed symptomatic bradycardia.
In the ED he was found to be in a wide complex ventricular rhythm with rate of 35 bpm.
Coronary disease s/p CABG x4 in [**2090**] - NSTEMI [**12-19**] 2.
Hypertension 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Diabetes mellitus 5.
Chronic kidney disease 6.
Back surgery 1 week ago for spinal stenosis 7.
Atrial fibrillation on coumadin  Social History: He lives at home with his wife.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
There were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Bilateral crackles at the bases.
There were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
The heart sounds revealed profound bradycardia with a normal S1 and the S2 was normal.
There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.
The abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended.
The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars,  or xanthomas.
No ST changes or TWI.
No atrial activity seen.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: bradycardia .
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2102-5-19**] demonstrated: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No significant pulmonary edema.
The cardiac and mediastinal contours are both remarkable for stable cardiomegaly and tortuous thoracic aorta.

1)Bradycardia - The patient had a hx in the distant past of bradycardia in setting of dig toxicity.
His Bradycardia was likely due to conduction disease and a recent increased dose of beta blocker.
HE also had recent atrial tachycardia, thus the decisison was made to place a PPM for tachy/brady syndrome.
After placement of the PPM, he had episode of tachycardia (c/w atrial tach), we re-started BB and and added CCB for optimal BP and HR control.
2)Acute on chronic renal failure - the patient has a Cr baseline around 1.4-1.6.
Initially his ARF was thought likely due to increased diuresis.
However, on exam he seemed volume overloaded and receiving Lasix prn.
