Admission Date:  [**2172-11-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-11-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-11-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**] Chief Complaint: chest pain, nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: coronary catheterization with intervention with 2 bare metal stents  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 yo male with a past medical history of CAD, hypertnesion, recurrent nephrolithiasis, arthritis who was in his baseline state of good health until early this morning, when he experienced nausea, headache and asked his wife to call EMS.
He reports that he went to the bathroom in the early am hours, and he experiences urinary urgency so he felt that he had to run there.
In the bathroom, he felt nausea and headache and crawled on the floor to tell his wife to call EMS.
He reports that he did not experience chest pain until he was in the ambulance with EMS.
The pain was located in the anterior chest bilaterally around the 3rd rib.
He was found to have STEMI on EKG.
His left circumflex had 60% distal lesion.
RCA was totally occluded proximally with prominent left to right collateralls.
The patient had BMS placed in the LAD proximally and distally.
The proximal stent placement resulted in profound no reflow with acute worsening of the ST segment elevation in the anterior leads.
This was treated with nitroprusside 200mcg with near complete reslution of the angiographic reduced flow but persistance of the ST segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads.
The patient had no pain and did not have nausea at the end of the procedure.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - prostate cancer (managed at the VA) - nephrolithiasis x5 - osteoarthritis - depression - gout  Social History: - Tobacco history:  none - ETOH:  rarely, last drink 2 years ago - Illicit drugs:  never - retired electrician.

LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
His left circumflex had 60% distal lesion.
RCA was totally occluded proximally with prominent left to right collateralls.
The patient had BMS placed in the LAD proximally and distally.
The proximal stent placement resulted in profound no reflow with acute worsening of the ST segment elevation in the anterior leads.
This was treated with nitroprusside 200mcg with near complete reslution of the angiographic reduced flow but persistance of the ST segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads.
The patient had no pain and did not have nausea at the end of the procedure.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal septal/anterior, and apical akinesis and basal inferior hypokinesis.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Costophrenic angles are not fully imaged, and there is no evidence of large pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax or focal consolidation is seen.
Mild vascular congestion is present, but no edema or cardiomegaly.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE - The patient had an STEMI with ST-elevations in the anterior leads and 100% occlusion of the mid-LAD and the RCA on admission.
He did have profound no reflow after placement of the proximal stent, and the patient's ST elevations initially did not improve post-catheterization, although the patient did not experience further chest pain and his clinical symptoms improved.
Subsequently, his ST elevations did improve and his enzymes peaked at a CK of 2273, and a Troponin of 10.54, CK-MB of 150.
He initially received Nitroprusside in the cath lab for the no reflow abnormality and then came to the CCU on a Nitroglycerin gtt, which was weaned off.
# RHYTHM - The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm this admission.
He has no history of dysrrhythmia.
CHRONIC CARE: .
# HYPERTENSION - The patient's home medications included Metoprolol, Lisinopril and we maintained him on these agents on dsicharge following his procedures.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - We changed Simvastatin to Atorvastatin high dose for optimal statin utilization in the setting his known coronary disease.
# GLAUCOMA - Stable without evidence of active visual acuity issues.
# NEPHROLITHIASIS - on admission, the patient endorsed right flank/back pain for about 2-weeks, which he reported was consistent with his prior diagnoses of nephrolithiasis - a recurrent problem for the patient.
His pain is well-controlled as long as he is immobile in bed.
His U/A was negative for infection and for hematuria.
# URINARY RETENTION, INCONTINENCE - We continued the patient on his home regimen of Oxybutynin, Finasteride and Terazosin.
# DEPRESSION - Mood appeared stable this admission and was continued on his home dosing of Fluoxetine.
# SOCIAL ISSUES - The patient is the primary care giver of a disabled wife and elderly ([**Age over 90 **] years old) mother-in-law.
Switched his Simvastatin for high dose Atorvastatin in the setting of coronary ishcemia this admission.
No outstanding laboratory data, microbiologic data or imaging studies at the time of discharge.

You had a heart attack and needed to have an emergency cardiac catheterization.
The catheterizaton showed blockages in many coronary arteries but there were two severe blockages found that were causing your heart attack.
These blockages were opened and two bare metal stents were placed to keep them open.
Your heart is weak after the heart attack and we have been watching you closely for signs of fluid overload.
So far there have not been any signs such as swelling in the legs or trouble breathing.
Please weigh yourself every day and let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] know if your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Your weakened heart also makes the chances of a blood clot or stroke more likely so you will be started on warfarin (coumadin) for the next few months to thin your blood.
START taking warfarin (coumadin) to prevent a blood clot or stroke.
