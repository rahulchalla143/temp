His hypertension and diabetes has been complicated by nephropathy, and coronary artery disease, for which he underwent cardiac bypass in [**2123-6-11**].
He underwent percutaneous intervention in the spring of [**2124**] and was recently diagnosed with atrial flutter prior to his scheduled transplant in [**2125-4-10**].
He had a marked decrease in his ankle brachial index with exercise.
The interpretation was severe peripheral vascular disease worsened by ambulation.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, SVG to OM1, SVG to Om2), angioplasty and BMS ([**2-14**]) Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Diabetes mellitus, type 2 CHF s/p AICD placement ESRD on HD.
Candidate for renal transplant.
Aflutter s/p cardioversion 2 weeks ago Eye surgery - 2 days ago NSTEMI in [**10/2124**] Anemia Right eye vitrectomy complicated by intraocular hemorrhages with temporary blindness of the right eye (currently without vision in that eye) s/p left vitrectomy and laser surgery ESRD due to diabetic nephropathy, currently on hemodialysis M/W/F at [**Last Name (un) 4029**] in [**Location (un) **] (dialysis catheter in chest) Resection of colon polyps Osteomyelitis of 5th metatarsal head, s/p excision   Social History: Lives alone in [**Hospital1 8**].
Family History: Father died at 79 of an MI, had bypass at age 70 Mother died at age 82 of CHF and DM Brother had stents placed at age 58  Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 171/100 mm Hg while seated.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
There was no thyromegaly.
The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
The lungs had coarse crackles bilaterally with.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.
The abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended.
The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits.
Intraoperative ECHO ([**7-17**]) revealed dilation of the left ventricular cavity was moderately dilated, with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
The right ventricular cavity was also dilated and right ventricular systolic function appeared depressed.
The aortic  valve leaflets (3) were mildly thickened but aortic stenosis was not present.
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation was seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
There is trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Findings revealed elevated right sided filling pressures and elevated Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
Repeat ECHO on [**7-19**] revealed dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction, dilated right ventricle with at least mild systolic dysfunction, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Neurology recommendations included: CTA of head and neck (MRI possible due to AICD), IV thiamine 100 mg daily, avoiding sedating medications, maintaining normothermia, continuing normoglycemia with insulin drip, allowing BP to autoregulate until thrombosis and infarct excluded, and continuing IV heparin until thrombosis excluded.
The patient initially was placed on nitroprusside drip and hydralazine to control elevated blood pressures.
