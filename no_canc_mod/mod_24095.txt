He was found to have left hemiplegia and a Ct was done which showed a large IPH on the right side.
For his hypertension he recieved labetolol.
Eyes closed not opening to voice or pain.
Pupils pinpoitn at 2mm with very very minimal reaction.
No gag noted, no cough noted.
no sign of infection   Pertinent Results: Laboratory Data: 135  97  15  168   AGap=16 2.5  25  0.8 7.45 pCO245 pO2368 HCO332 11.9  14.8  228 PT: 14.3  PTT: 22.3  INR: 1.2 Fibrinogen: 414 UA negative Serum tox negative  Radiologic Data: NCHCT [**2194-4-21**]: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the R basal ganglia measuring approx  7.3 x 4.1 cm, similar in size to the OSH study.
Sub-falcine herniation, with stable  to minimal increase in the leftward shift of midline structures.
Mass-effect  on the third ventricle with mild dilation of the lateral ventricles.
S/p right parietal craniectomy with a small right extraaxial hematoma, as before.
Hypodensities in the left subinsular white matter could represent chronic small vessel infarcts, unusual for age.
Large right basal ganglionic hematoma with intraventricular extension and surrounding vasogenic edema, unchanged in size and appearance from most recent study, with stable size of ventricles.
Leftward shift of normally-midline structures appears slightly worse when compared to the most recent study, some of which may be due to differences in plane of scanning.
Status post right parietal craniectomy, with small right extra-axial hematoma is unchanged.
[**4-24**] Renal U/S - Bilateral renal calcifications.
In the right lower pole, a partially calcified cyst or stones within a caliceal diverticulum are also seen.
No solid mass is identified.
Right basal ganglia intraparenchymal hematoma, surrounding edema and mass with shift of midline structures similar to the prior study.
Left frontal approach EVD in stable position terminating in the left caudothalamic groove.
Mild interval decrease in the intraventricular hemorrhage.Ventricular size not significantly changed.
[**2194-4-28**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Included lung bases are clear and there is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
No focal masses are noted within the adrenal glands which display symmetrical, slightly increased thickening bilaterally, which may reflect a component of hyperplasia with no additional masses noted along the sympathetic chain including in the expected location of the organ of Zuckerkandl.
Limited evaluation of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, stomach, and bowel appear unremarkable.
Dense medullary calcification is present within the kidneys.
No free air, free fluid, or pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present.
No significant atherosclerotic plaque is noted near the origins of the renal arteries to suggest any underlying stenosis.
BONE WINDOWS: No aggressive osseous lesions are noted.
No focal adrenal masses or findings of adrenal/extra-adrenal paraganglioma.
Mild symmetrical thickening to the adrenal glands may suggest a component of underlying hyperplasia.
Bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis with imaging appearance most suggestive of medullary sponge kidney, with differential including renal tubular acidosis or hyperparathyroidism.
[**2194-4-30**] BUE dopplers: IMPRESSION: No DVT in either upper extremity  [**2194-4-30**] CTA Head:IMPRESSION: 1.
Stable appearance of a right basal ganglia parenchymal hemorrhage with ventricular extension.
Slight increase in anterior parenchymal edema is seen, with suggestion of increased transcranial herniation at the anterior aspect of the craniectomy site.
There is no active contrast extravasation (so-called "CTA spot sign").
[**5-1**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No interval change of a right basal ganglia hematoma, with neighboring edema or evolving infarction, local mass effect, intraventricular extension, and mild transgaleal herniation through the craniectomy site.
[**5-3**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Status post removal of the ventricular drain without change in ventricular size or brain compared with the prior CT from [**2194-5-1**].
[**5-5**] LENIS: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
[**2194-5-9**]  06:45a  138  103    57    104   AGap=14  4.3   25   1.0   Ca: 9.3 Mg: 2.7 P: 6.2    Brief Hospital Course: Pt was brought immediately to the OR for hemicraniectomy and evacuation of clot.
[**4-22**] Records were obtained from a previous admission [**1-6**] to [**Hospital **] hospital that indicated a previous hospitalization for hypertensive emergency resulting in a  right [**Doctor First Name **] Ganglia hemorrhage.
A fever work up has been initiated for fevers and elevated WBC.
Sputum Culture was positive for multiple organisms and as a result pt was started on vanc/cef.
He became febrile on [**4-28**] and CSF was sent which showed some PMNs.
He was afebrile overnight.
A head CT was done whcih showed no evidence of ventricular enlargement after clamping of his EVD.
he remained stable voernight and on [**5-3**] he had a temperature of 101 and urine was sent for testing.
On [**5-4**] he was evalauted by renal medicine regarding his Sponge Kidney and recommendations for 24 urine metanephrines and increasing free water through his PEG were recieved.
On [**5-6**] repeat 24hr urine revealed increased Na so his free water was increased.
Free water was decreased and increased per renal recs and serum Na's.
3. acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Solution Sig: One (1) Solution PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever >100.4.
8. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for puritis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left intraparenchymal hemorrhage Obstructive Hydrocephalus Intraventricular hemorrhage Intracranial hypertension Hypertension Fever Left hemipalegia Dysphagia Acute respiratory failure Hypernatremia Spongy renal disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
Followup Instructions: *** Please follow up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks with a non-contrast head CT.
