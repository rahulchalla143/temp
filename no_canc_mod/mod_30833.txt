CT head demonstrates loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the right temporal region and no hemorrhage is seen.

CT angiography of the head demonstrates no vascular occlusion or stenosis.
[**8-3**] MRI Brain IMPRESSION: Acute right partial middle cerebral artery infarct with small subcortical infarcts and a small area of petechial hemorrhage as described above.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage status post thrombolysis.
Hypoattenuation in the right posterior frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, findings consistent with recent infarction, though better characterized on prior MRI.
[**2149-8-2**] TTE The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
No definite structural cardiac source of embolism identified.
[**2149-8-6**] TEE No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.Evidence of patent foramen ovale is present with right to left flow at rest seen during rest injection of saline contrast (although no shuntidentified by color Doppler).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small moblie structure(s) attached the the mitral valve posterior leafelt (see clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **], last cycle) consistent with possible small vegetation versus Lambl's excrescence or other mass.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 38807**] received IV TPA in the ED for left sided facial droop, extinction to DSS on the left and dysarthria on [**8-2**], [**2148**].
Following thrombolysis, she was transferred to the ICU where her neurological deficits improved over time and she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Given her overall clinical stability and a follow up CT scan that showed no new hemorrhages, she was transferred to the floor where a work up for her first stroke was continued.
- One day prior to discharge, the patient developed some mild swelling at the site of her IV stick on the left antecubital fossa.
Her IV site was switched, and she was started on five day course of keflex for a superficial wound infection.
She did not develop fevers, and redness at the site did not spread.
- She had a TTE which showed no evidence of an atrial septal defect/PFO or valvular vegetation.
To more definitely rule out an embolic source/right to left shunt, we requested a TEE which she received on the day of her discharge.
Later that night, we noted that the final read on the TEE reported a possible mitral valve mass as well as a patent foramen ovale.
-The mitral valve lesion was most probably a Lambl's excrescence.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 38807**] had no evidence of systemic infection, no fever, and no leukocytosis to suggest the possibility of endocarditis.
-The TEE showed simple atheroma of the aortic arch.
At this time, the plan would be to pursue anticoagulation if the patient has evidence of a lower extremity DVT.
She was encouraged to follow up with her sleep medicine specialist to evaluate if a different type of CPAP mask would work better for her.
Prior to discharge, she did not have any dysarthria, language or other cortical deficits or weakness in her extremities.
Her only residual deficit was a slight ptosis on the left eye.
"bad" cholesterol was elevated above our typical goals, and so we started you on a new medication to reduce cholesterol.

Discharge Instructions: You were evaluated at the Neurology Wards of the [**Hospital1 771**] for new symptoms of left sided facial weakness and slurred speech, which we determined were secondary to a stroke which occured in the right side of your brain.
Common risk factors for strokes include elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, tobacco abuse and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.
