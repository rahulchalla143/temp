Admission Date:  [**2177-3-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-4-1**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ibuprofen / Penicillins / Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CVVH  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with end-stage renal disease on HD, CHF (EF 40%), CAD and hypothyroidism who presents with fluid overload, EKG changes and cardiac enzyme elevations concerning for ischemia transferred to the ICU for urgent dialysis.
By report of the patient, his sons and on review of his medical records, the patient had progressive shortness of breath for many months.
The patient had profound orthopnea and was forced to sit on the edge of his bed with rapid breathing.
His shortness of breath symptoms worsened and by morning the patient agreed to come to the hospital.
He notes baseline nausea unchanged and worsening dyspnea on exertion at 12 steps and 2 pillow orthopnea.
He describes unchanged peripheral edema and denies weight gain.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 1196**] where he was felt to be volume overloaded with possible anterior ST elevation on EKG and positive cardiac enzymes.
On admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] floor the patient was hemodynamically stable but in persistent respiratory distress, tachypneic to 24-30 saturating well on 3L oxygen by NC.
He was evaluated by the renal consult service who recommended transfer to the ICU for semi-urgent CVVHD for fluid removal.
Of note, the patient was has difficulty with fluid removal at HD due to hypotension.
As a result he had chronic accumulation of fluid.
Review of systems: Denies fevers, cough, weight loss, nightsweats, melena, hematochezia, rash, arthralgias, myalgias, claudication  Past Medical History: - CAD, likely prior silent MI with apical hypokinesis on echo - End-stage renal disease on HD with tunnelled line in place, failed AV fistulas, usual schedule MWF.
- Hypothyroidism - Systolic CHF, EF 40% - MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] - Pulmonary Hypertension   Social History: No tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs.
CV: MR murmur heard at the apex.
No masses or organomegaly.
Ext: Trace bilateral lower extremity edema.
2+ femoral pulses.
Integumentary: No rashes or lesions.
Bilateral pleural effusions obliterate the diaphragmatic contours and obscure the lower portions of the heart silhouette.
Significant cardiac enlargement is most likely present.
One can identify a semi-circular calcification within the heart shadow indicative of mitral ring calcium deposits.
The thoracic aorta shows extensive wall calcifications in the area of the arch, but the aorta is not significantly widened.
The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern and there is perivascular haze on the bases consistent with marked congestion.
Evidence of discrete local parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified; however, the possibility of infectious processes in the bases concealed by the congestive pattern and the pleural effusions is possible.
The presence of a left internal jugular approach double lumen catheter is recognized seen to terminate in the lower SVC just at the junction with the right atrium.
There is no pneumothorax.
Cardiac enlargement and pulmonary congestive pattern with pleural effusions existed already at that time, but these findings have moderately increased.
IMPRESSION: Progression of left-sided CHF with bilateral pleural effusions in elderly gentleman.
No new pneumonia identified which however, cannot be completely excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted for urgent CVVH given his obvious clinical volume overload causing dyspnea and relative hypoxia.
In addition, he had cardiac enzyme elevations and a newly dropped EF from 40% to 20% on this admission, likely secondary to demand ischemia due to his volume overload.
He was initially begun on integrillin and a heparin drip to treat possible occlusive thrombotic heart disease.
