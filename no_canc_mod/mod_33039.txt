He has been admitted at [**Hospital3 **] where he has been treated for bilateral lower extremity and gluteal cellulitis as well as stage II sacral decubitus ulcer.
He was initially treated with Ancef IV for his cellulitis and then changed to Vancomycin 1gm IV Q12 given h/o penicillin allergy.
He was also noted to have Stage II decubitus ulcer, was evaluated by surgery who recommended continuing local wound care.
On the morning of [**8-9**] he developed sinus tachycardia, no acute change on EKG and desaturated to 88%.
He had a Ddimer that was slightly elevated at 322.
Unable to have V/Q scan due to spatial constraints.
On transfer he was alert and oriented x 3 however during the course of his ED stay he had acute change in mental status.
Past Medical History: achondroplasia HTN spinal stenosis s/p back surgery chronic lymphedema obesity  Social History: Unknown  Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VS: T 99.5 HR 86 BP 123/60 RR 12 95% on VC 50% /500 /19 /10 Gen: sedated, intubated, does not open eyes to voic HEENT: NC, AT, pinpoint pupils, symmetric, reactive bilaterally Neck: obese, supple CV: RRR s1 s2 no appreciable murmur Lungs: vented breath sounds, CTAB anteriorly Ext: lymphedema bilaterally with chronic skin thickening, warm to palpation bilaterally, no significant erythema.
[**2133-8-11**] CT Head: Somewhat limited by motion without evidence of ICH.
[**8-20**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination, there is a minimal decrease of the signs indicative of overhydration.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
No definite aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with borderline normal free wall systolic function.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus to the lobar level.
Bilateral patchy consolidative changes may represent atelectasis, edema or aspiration pneumonia as secretions are noted in the airways.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] is a 49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema with recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis c/b tachycardia, dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
Pt with [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course below:  #1 Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Altered Mental Status - unclear inciting cause for acute hypercarbia in the ED which prompted intubation, ddx included pulmonary embolism although CTA with no evidence of large PE.
We treated for 8d with broad spectrum abx for PNA largely due to heavy secretions.
We had no pathogen.
He was a difficult wean off the vent due to likely underlying obstructive lung disease, low tidal volumes, and heavy secretions.
He still has some heavy secretions but otherwise we feel he was adequately diuresed and treated for ?
Floor course - pt being titrated down o2, assessing for OSA/OHA first with trial of CPAP, but since awaiting placement and relatively stable - monitoring o2 sat cont at night to document drop.
#2 Bilateral LE cellulitis - unclear if new cellulitis or just chronic stasis in setting of lymphedema.
No WBC or fever at OSH, unclear if appearance has changed since IV abx.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] treated with long course vanco with resolution of his cellulitis.
#Hypertension - [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] afterload reduced and used beta blocker for HTN control, continued on floor.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every [**5-10**] hours as needed for fever or pain.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: 30-60 MLs PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **]- [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypoxia  Secondary: Probable OSA/OHS HTN Ottitis Externa Cutaneous candidiasis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: 1.
It is essential as well to concentrate on reducing your weight with increased activity and calorie restricted diet for weight loss as instructed.
Have your PCP arrange outpatient sleep study and consider possible pulmonary followup.
Return to ED if you experience worsening shortness of breath.
