ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2165-10-30**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**10-29**] CXR: TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Small bilateral pleural effusions obscure the costophrenic angles, left greater than right.
A left basilar vague opacity is present likely seconday to the underlying effusion and/or atelectasis.
There is left ventricular enlargement.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2165-10-28**] 10:18 AM  IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Echocardiogram [**2165-10-24**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened and display slightly reduced systolic excursion.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high stroke volume.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pulmonary embolism.
Large, 20-cm complex, cystic pelvic mass with features highly worrisome for neoplasm.
Differential diagnosis would include such entities as ovarian cystadenocarcinoma.
No uterus or ovaries are specifically identified.
A least one, enlarged, mildly enhancing lymph node is noted.
No evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis.
There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis.
Mild thickening of a small segment of the sigmoid colon just inferior and posterior to the large cystic mass could represent a focal area of diverticulitis.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
Bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
No focal areas of consolidation is identified.
A 6-mm, rounded focus in the right upper lobe of the lung could represent a focal area of atelectasis or represent a focal nodule.
Mild anterior wedging of the L1 vertebral body could represent a compression fracture of indeterminate chronicity.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Bilateral renal low attenuation lesions, most too small to characterize but most likely simple cysts.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted with four day history of abdominal pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting and a new diagnosis of a pelvic mass arising from the left ovary.
Pelvic Mass: The patient was evaluated with CT scan which demonstrated large pelvic complex cystic mass 20 cm.
No peritoneal carcinomatosis was seen.
A medicine consult was obtained for preoperative clearance.
Her intraoperative course was complicated by emesis following intubation of 600cc of fluid.
Following initial extubation, the patient was reintubated due to concern for aspiration pneumonia and an elevated respiratory rate.
A CXR was obtained in the postoperative area which could not rule out aspiration pneumonia.
ID: The patient presented with elevated WBC of 23.8 which increased to 27 on hospital day 2.
A CT scan obtained showed diverticulosis but could not rule out a small foci of diverticulitis.
She remained afebrile since [**10-26**] 0400.
The patient remained afebrile and had no symptoms or signs of pneumonia.
A repeat CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia and significant for small bilateral pleural effusions vs atelectasis.
Per discussion with infectious disease team, no further treatment was indicated as the patient was improving without treatment for MRSA and the patient was clinically well.
The MRSA was thought to be from colonization and not evidence of an acute infection.
A CTA angiogram demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary embolism on admission.
The patient was transported intubated to the ICU given some concern for aspiration pneumonia and an increased respiratory rate following surgery.
Her oxygen requirement resolved on post-operative day 3.
On [**10-30**], the CXR showed no evidence of infiltrate.
Small bilateral pleural effusions versus atelectasis were seen.
She was maintained on her normal dose of steroids for Rheumatoid arthritis following surgery.
Cardiovascular: A Medicine consult was obtained upon admission to help manage the patient and provide guidance for clearance for surgery.
An EKG showed no changes from baseline.
CT scan showed no evidence of intraabdominal bleeding.
Anemia contributed to anemia of chronic disease.
LENIs were performed on [**10-27**] for bilateral symmetrical leg pain which were negative.
