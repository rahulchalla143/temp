Admission Date:  [**2106-7-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2106-7-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-7-15**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 42 year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, chronic renal insufficiency and known three vessel coronary artery disease not amenable to percutaneous intervention who is transferred from an outside hospital with transfer from an outside hospital with elevated finger stick blood sugars and diabetic ketoacidosis with an evolving non ST elevation myocardial infarction with elevated troponin in CKs.
The patient's symptoms began three days prior with nausea and vomiting.
Coronary artery disease status post left circumflex stent in [**2099**], cardiac catheterization on [**2106-5-28**] revealed left anterior descending coronary artery with diffuse disease, left circumflex with diffuse disease, right coronary artery with 99% occlusion with left to right collaterals, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16, left ventricular and diastolic pressure 20.
Cardiac output 2.7, ejection fraction 33% with 1+ mitral regurgitation and anterolateral apical inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis.
Elevated cholesterol.
Chronic renal insufficiency with recent baseline creatinine of 2.7 to 2.9.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for coronary artery disease and diabetes.
General appearance, the patient is awake, alert and in no acute distress.
Abdomen soft, nontender, obese with decreased bowel sounds.
Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital showed sinus tachycardic at 115 beats per minute, normal axis and normal intervals, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in leads 3F, V2 through V3 with a Q wave in lead 3 and AVF.
ST depressions in leads 1 and AVL, also with ST depressions in V5 through V6 with a T wave inversions in V5 and V6.
Cardiovascular:  The patient with known coronary artery disease with three vessel disease with recent cardiac catheterization to define anatomy considered not amenable to cutaneous intervention or coronary artery bypass graft currently.
The patient was medically managed for a non ST elevation myocardial infarction likely the precipitant for or the result of her diabetic ketoacidosis.
The patient had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure, although she did have som4e mild lower extremity edema.
Following the patient's acute presentation with a non ST elevation myocardial infarction and known disease not amenable to intervention the patient received 48 hours of heparin and Integrilin.
The patient had no episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath during this hospital stay.
Renal:  Patient with a chronic renal insufficiency with a prior baseline creatinine of approximately 1.3.
Given her likely diabetic nephropathy she was continued her Univasc.
She would likely benefit from erythropoietin given probably anemia of chronic disease.
Endocrine:  The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis.
It is unclear what the trigger was whether it preceded or was secondary to myocardial infarction.
The patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3617**] at the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center.
Gastrointestinal:  Patient with a history of gastroparesis as documented by recent gastric emptying study.
She had no nausea or vomiting.
Patient also with a history of cholelithiasis with no acute symptoms during this hospitalization.
Hematologic:  The patient was noted to have a drop in her hematocrit after initial presentation from approximately 37 to 27 without any evidence of acute bleed.
She had no hemodynamic instability.
Her initial anemia workup was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
Infectious disease:  The patient was noted to hve a superficial infection of a right antecubital intravenous site following its removal.
The patient should continue this care at home and should return should she develop fevers or chills, or worsening erythema or pain at this site.
Non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
The patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3617**] at the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center.
