Assessed to have acute left hemispheric infarction in the MCA distribution, likely embolic.
Although the precise time of onset was unclear, tPA was considered given the severity of his deficits and lack of any ischmic changes on his head CT. After discussing with girlfriend and  daughter, he was started on iv tPA.
He was admitted to neuro ICU and remained stable without complications.
CT of head was repeated the next morning showing L temporal lobe infarct but no hemorrhagic transformation.
Clinically, he regained most of strength back on his R side but remained aphasic (simple yes and no's only) with R facial droop but intact comprehension.
Carotid US was also performed given poor CTA which showed < 40% stenosis bilaterally.
His TEE did not reveal any evidence of cardiac thrombus.
Video oropharyngeal swallowing study showed deep laryngeal penetration with liquids and intermittent aspiration of nectar-thick liquids secondary to swallow delay.
On neurological exam his speech improved slowly (now being able to speak a few words); no motor deficit.
