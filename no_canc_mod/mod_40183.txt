The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
AV pacing for sinus bradycardia.
Well-seated mechanical valve in the aortic position with trivial paravalvular leak, most likely representing suture gaps and most of which resolving post protamine dose.

Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per protocol without complication.
Warfarin anticoagulation was started for mechanical aortic valve replacement and atrial fibrillation.
He went into a rapid atrial fibrillation to the 160's on POD3.
Lisinopril was added for hypertension management.
He did have some minimal sternal drainage but WBC was normal and he was afebrile so no antibiotics were started.
(Fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91209**]On POD #5 his INR was therapuetic, he was ambulating without difficulty, tolerating a full oral diet and his incision was drainging very scant amounts of old bloody drainage.
