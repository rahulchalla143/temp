Admission Date:  [**2114-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-8-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**] Chief Complaint: Digitalis Toxicity Acute renal failure diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 85 yo woman with history of CHF, hypothyroidism, and DM2, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation of bradycardia.
The patient currently lives in [**Location (un) 28626**] NH, where she and [**5-7**] of her co-residents reportedly developed diarrhea over the past week.
On arrival to [**Location (un) **] ED, the patient was found to have a Dig level of 3.2, bradycardia to the 40s, hyperkalemia to 8.0, and ARF with Cr of 2.5 (baseline 0.8).
On arrival to the ED, the patient's K was found to be decreased to 5.5, and her ECG did not demonstrate any changes consistent with hyperkalemia.
She had a Urinalysis that was positive for infection, so she was started on Cipro IV for a urinary tract infection and Flagyl IV for presumed CDiff.
She was also started on IV fluids at 100 cc/h, as she has a history of CHF with EF <35%.
On the floor, the patient denies any focal complaints.
Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Diffuse non-specific ST segment flattening in the inferior and lateral leads.
There are non-specific T wave inversions in the inferior leads.
There is retarded anterior R wave progression, question normal variant, question prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction, question chest electrode placement.
Inferior Q waves are consistent with prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Inferior T wave inversions suggest possible ongoing inferior myocardial ischemia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Renal Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
RUE ultrasound: superficial phlebitis (per radiologist- report pending)    Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 85 yo woman with history of CHF, hypothyroidism, and DM2, who presented with Acute renal failure, digoxin toxicity, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute diarrhea.
Digoxin Toxicity: The patient's Digoxin level at [**Location (un) **] was 3.2, and she was found to have junctional bradycardia with rate of 40.
She was given one dose of Digibind at the OSH (given hyperkalemia and bradycardia), and her Digoxin level upon arrival to our ED at [**Hospital1 18**] was 1.5.
She was thought to have developed dig toxicity secondary to ARF in the setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake.
She was monitored on telemetry and seen by the toxicology service, and she had no significant arrhythmias.
The indication for her digoxin appears to be CHF and it is unclear whether she still needs the medication.
Acute kidney injury: The patient's Cr on admission was 2.4, which is increased from her baseline of 0.8 (on [**7-22**]).
This was likely pre-renal in the setting of recent diarrhea.
# UTI: The patient had a U/A in the ED which was consistent with infection.
Cultures showed pan sensitive pseudomonas so she was kept on the ciprofloxacin.
She should continue a 7 day course to treat the urinary tract infection and possible gastroenteritis infection (see below).
Ms. [**Known lastname 10792**] was hospitalized approximately one month ago and was C Diff positive at that admission, so she was continued on po vanc and flagyl empirically.
The etiology of the diarrhea is unclear, and could be viral or bacterial as well as medication side effects (the pt reportedly recently started levothyroxine and duloxetine), but since the pt was already taking ciprofloxacin for her pseudomonas UTI it was thought that she should have her course extended from 5 to 7 days to also treat bacterial gastroenteritis.
The patients volume of diarrhea decreased throughout her admission.
# CHF: The patient has a history of systlic CHF, for which she takes Digoxin, Metoprolol, Lisinopril, and Lasix.
These medications were held in the setting of dig toxicity, hypotension, volume depletion, and acute kidney injury.
She was restarted on her metoprolol, but this medication can be switched to the equivalent dose of long acting metoprolol XL as this medication has been shown to be more effective in CHF patients than the short acting.
Her lasix can be restarted as an outpatient, but her volume status should be followed carefully if she develops recurrent diarrhea or other volume losses.
# Pacemaker: It was also noted that the patient had a pacemaker but that there was no pacing spikes on her EKG with bradycardia.
The patient terminated the interrogation early, but it was thought that the battery in the pacemaker was dead (as they usually only last for 7-10 years).
She should follow up with her cardiologist regarding further management and/or need for replacement.
# Thrombophlebitis: The patient was noted to have an erythematous patch on her right medial arm two days prior to discharge.
She underwent ultrasound of the arm to rule out DVT and a thrombophlebitis was found in the basilic vein.
This is not considered an upper extremity DVT and should be treated with warm compresses and elevation.
We would recommend not treating with NSAIDs at this time due to  her recent upset stomach, but this may be considered if the condition worsens.
She did not have emesis and was given one dose of zofran.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 25576**] Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Digoxin toxicity Acute renal Failure Psuedomonas urinary tract infection Diarrhea  Secondary diagnosis: Systolic CHF Hypothyroidism Diabetes type II Chronic pain   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, hemodynamically stable.
Diarrhea improving.
You were also found to have kidney failure when you arrived.
You were also restarted on antibiotics for the diarrhea you have been having and for a urinary tract infection that was found.
Please return to the hospital if you have fever above 101, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, worsening diarrhea, or nausa and vomiting to where you can not keep food or medications down, or any other concerns.
