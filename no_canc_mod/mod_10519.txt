You were admitted for low oxygen levels because you had fluid in your lungs and when you were eating, food would be going down the wrong tube.
We also suspect you have apneumonia that you acquired at your last hospitalization.
We gave you medications to help you get rid of the fluid and we also watched you very closely when eating, but you had episodes when your oxygen decreased because you swallowed food down the wrong tube.
