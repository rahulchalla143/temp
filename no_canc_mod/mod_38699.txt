Catheterization was performed which showed very tight left main and LAD disease in addition to severe left sided coronary artery disease.
She is status post right coronary artery stenting and there was only mild disease in this vessel.
But she had [**11-9**] chest pain on the balloon pump and therefore was taken emergently to the operating room for bypass surgery.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p IMI/PCI-RCA, HTN, ^chol, Cataracts, Uterine CA s/p TAH, Appy, Rt elbow fx  Social History: Quit smoking [**2142**].
Family History: No family history of premature coronary disease  Physical Exam: 126/61, 64, 18, 99% 4L Elderly female, supine, IABP in place No acute distress Oropharynx benign Neck supple, no JVD.
Lungs with bibasilar crackles.
No murmur or rub.
Abdomen benign Ext warm without edema Non-focal neuro exam.
Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed severe left-main and multivessel CAD: --the LMCA had an 80% distal stenosis --the LAD had a 95% ostial stenosis.
--the LCX had a 60% proximal stenosis --the RCA had a 50% proximal stenosis.
Left ventriculography revealed measured LVEF 77%, normal LV systolic function and no mitral regurgitation.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling pressures, with LVEDP 16 mmHg.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of the angled pigtail catheter from LV to ascending aorta.
Patient had severe angina after angiography.
A 30cc IABP was placed with resolution of the chest pain.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Acute severe hypokinesis noted in the mid to apical septum and mid to apical anterior and anterolateral wall.
This resolved with heart rate control and pericardial opening.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Aortic sclerosis is seen, [**Location (un) 109**] is around 2.1 cm2 by planimetry.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Aorta is intact post decannulation DISCHARGE LABS: [**2187-7-4**] 06:05AM BLOOD Hct-31.5* [**2187-7-3**] 05:18AM BLOOD WBC-12.9* RBC-3.46* Hgb-10.6* Hct-30.7* MCV-89 MCH-30.6 MCHC-34.5 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-134* [**2187-7-4**] 06:05AM BLOOD Glucose-86 UreaN-23* Creat-0.7 Na-137 K-3.4 Cl-93* HCO3-38* AnGap-9 [**2187-7-3**] 05:18AM BLOOD Glucose-96 UreaN-30* Creat-0.9 Na-137 K-3.5 Cl-94* HCO3-37* AnGap-10 [**2187-7-2**] 05:20AM BLOOD Glucose-82 UreaN-30* Creat-1.1 Na-139 K-4.4 Cl-99 HCO3-31 AnGap-13  Brief Hospital Course: Given left main lesion and persistent chest pain, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was emergently taken to the operating room where Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
She returned to the operating room later that night for postoperative bleeding.
She was also given multiple blood products.
By postoperative day two, the IABP was removed and she was extubated without incident.
She had an episode of SVT which broke with Adenosine.
She also experienced episodes of paroxsymal atrial fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone.
She remained in a normal sinus rhythm without further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
