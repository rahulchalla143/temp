Admission Date:  [**2166-5-28**]     Date of Death:  [**2166-7-1**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex: Male  Service: Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and fatigue.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old male who was recently admitted from [**5-3**] to [**5-27**] to [**Hospital1 346**] for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and untreated pulmonary embolism.
He presents on [**5-28**], after increasing shortness of breath and fatigue, just as in former hospitalization, one day after discharge.
He was also complaining of a nonproductive cough.
He also had questionable change in mental status.
He received a 400 cc normal saline fluid bolus and his pressure increased.
Coronary artery disease, status post recent myocardial infarction, refusing all interventions except for blood pressure medicines and aspirin.
Congestive heart failure, with an echo showing an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% and four chamber dilation as well as severe hypokinesis of the left ventricle and right ventricle.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, not being treated secondary to the patient refusing Coumadin.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on baseline five liters home oxygen.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, type II.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of right lower extremity cellulitis and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.
Sublingual nitroglycerin.
Sclera anicteric.
Normal S1 and S2, distant heart sounds.
No mitral regurgitation appreciated.
Pulmonary:  Upper airway noises, crackles [**11-28**] the way up bilaterally, diffuse rhonchi, no wheezes.
Abdomen:  Obese, distended, normoactive bowel sounds, soft and nontender.
Extremities:  Left stage II heel ulcer with no drainage.
Erythema and chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally, right greater than left.
However, his hypotension self-resolved and the pressors were able to be weaned without any further intervention.
The following morning, he had an additional hypotensive episode.
It was thought at the time that his low blood pressures may have been secondary to multiple pulmonary embolisms.
He had no further episodes of hypotension throughout the remainder of his hospitalization, after coming out of the unit.
Acute renal failure.
Though he initially had an elevated creatinine and BUN on admission, he received fluids and they trended down with no further intervention made.
It is likely that he had hypotension causing his renal failure.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
The patient initially had elevated CK's and troponin during his early hospitalization.
The patient and his wife wanted no intervention for these.
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus.
The patient has a known deep vein thrombosis and multiple pulmonary emboli from his prior admission, as found by lower extremity Dopplers and CTA.
However, he and his wife refused anticoagulation continually, even though they were told of the risks of the clot burden, causing further pulmonary emboli and respiratory and cardiovascular compromise, resulting in possible death.
Congestive heart failure.
The patient has known systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% and global ventricular dilation as well as aspects of hypokinesis and akinesis.
During the end of his hospitalization, with worsening congestive heart failure, as shown both clinically and on physical examination, as well as on chest x-ray, his wife agreed to have occasional doses of intravenous Lasix, to which he responded with increased urine output per the nurses but clinically as still short of breath.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
His son also became involved in case of the need for discharge to a subacute care facility; however, the patient was never medically stable, secondary to worsening respiratory status, felt secondary to congestive heart failue, COPD, and potential additional pulmonary emboli.
On [**7-1**], the patient had increasing respiratory distress with apneic breathing and cyanosis.
Lasix was given, which had no effect.
In the setting of his decreasing heart rate, Atropine and epinephrine were attempted as well, with no effect.
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction.
Diabetes type II.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
