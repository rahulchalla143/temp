Admission Date:  [**2201-1-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2201-1-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-6-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Midazolam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: ventilator dependent patient with ?trach leak  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchscopy Tracheostomy tube replacement PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 116**] is a 75F with COPD, pulmonary HTN, atrial fibrillation, and chronic respiratory failure who is ventilator dependent who is transferred from an OSH for IP evaluation of a possible tracheostomy leak.
Of note, the patient has had been admitted continuously since [**2200-5-1**] for failure to wean from ventilator.
On the morning of admission, the patient had desaturations and required ventilation with an ambu bag.
She had consistently low tidal volumes ranging from 250-280, but in no distress.
The team from the OSH also had concern for C diff, but labs are still pending at time of transfer.
Past Medical History: Cardiopulmonary arrest [**2198**] Chronic respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy : Shiley #8 ??????
89mm  CHF Atrial fibrillation COPD LUL resection [**2-2**] cyst-no CA found Pulmonary hypertension Epilepsy GERD h/o shingles with post herpetic neuralgia Thrombocytosis Anemia Hypothyroidism Right upper extremity brachioplexopathy   Social History: Divorced, lives alone.
Severe scarring and traction bronchiectasis more prominent in both upper lobes, could be due to old granulomatous exposure such as tuberculosis, less likely sarcoid.
Multifocal peribronchial and bronchiolar opacities on the right, likely due to aspiration.
Left lower lobe secretions with newly develped atelectasis could also be due to aspiration.
Note that it is impossible to rule out a spiculated lesion from this extensive scarring given the absence of prior study for comparison.
Marked volume loss on the left with shift of the mediastinum.
The left upper lobe bronchus is not identified, could be obstructed or due to prior left upper lobectomy.
Mild emphysema.
Signs of pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
No evidence of retroperitoneal or intrathoracic hemorrhage.
Slightly worsened peribronchiolar and dependent opacities in the right lower lobe, suspicious for aspiration.
Unchanged severe bronchiectasis and scarring in the upper lobes bilaterally, which [**Known lastname **] be due to prior granulomatous disease.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
CXR [**1-28**] Improving L lung aeration   Brief Hospital Course: A 75 year old lady transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for Interventional Pulmonary evaluation of persistent tracheostomy leak.
She was found to have a developing Pneumonia on transfer for which she will be treated with Doripenem & Vancomycin  until [**2201-2-9**].
She was evaluated at bedside by interventional pulmonology (IP), underwent bronchoscopy via tracheostomy tube which showed copious purulent secretions which were aspirated.
The leak persisted, but the patient tolerates CMV with tidal volume set at 600 (breathing ~ 350).
The was clearly an anxiety component to her complaints of dyspnea because while she was sleeping or sedated, her tidal volumes improved.
She had transient episodes of desaturation which improved with suction.
She was treated with morphine to resolve symptoms of air hunger.
Pneumonia:  Gram stain of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage was significant for Gram negative rods and Gram positive cocci.
Tachycardia:  The patient was found to be in sinus tachycardia from 95-130 while admitted despite a history of atrial fibrillation.

Morphine 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for air hunger.
Pneumonia 3.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disorder   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable on Ventilator AC Mode.
They found that you had a persistent leak around the cuff of the tracheostomy and replaced your breathing tube.
Unfortunately, there are no further interventions that our Pulmonologists can offer at this time.
While you were here you developed a pneumonia which we have been treating with appropriate antibiotics.
