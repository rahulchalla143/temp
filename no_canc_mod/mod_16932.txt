Neurology:  The patient was initially on significant amount of sedation as he often had episodes of significant agitation which caused his ventilation to be impaired.
He was evaluated by the Neurology consult service, who obtained an electroencephalogram which showed diffuse encephalopathic pattern consistent with either medication effect or toxic metabolic pattern.
He underwent a head CT on [**2152-1-7**], which showed no intracranial hemorrhage or major vasculature territory infarction.
White matter microvascular disease and basal ganglia lacunes which are unchanged from prior study done on [**12-24**].
Overall, given the picture of minimal responsiveness on sedation and the fact that he had several episodes of hypotension as well as one episode of ventricular fibrillation arrest followed by PEA arrest, the prognosis was deemed fairly grim, with little chance of meaningful neurological recovery.
Repeat electroencephalogram done on [**2152-1-8**], showed moderately slow background with bursts of additional delta frequency slowing.
No electroencephalogram seizures were recorded during the tracing.
From a pump standpoint, the patient was initially significantly volume overloaded as well as having elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and we were able to diurese only on significant amount of pressor support with dopamine and low cardiac output and index.
From a rhythm standpoint, the patient was consistently in and out of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and normal sinus rhythm.
An attempt was made at electrical cardioversion on [**1-9**], however, this was also unsuccessful, with return to atrial fibrillation within several seconds.
The decision was made to rate control with metoprolol and Digoxin, and discontinue the amiodarone, as the patient seemed to be tolerating atrial fibrillation without rapid ventricular response.
The decision was made to perform a tracheostomy, which was done on [**2152-1-4**], by Interventional Pulmonology.
Post-tracheostomy placement, he was changed over to pressor support with minimal sedation being given.
The tracheostomy course was complicated by bleeding from the tracheostomy site.
Heparin was discontinued briefly, and lidocaine and epinephrine were injected into the tracheal site, and the bleeding stopped.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2152-1-10**], by Interventional Pulmonology, which showed no evidence of active bleeding around the tracheostomy site, however, there was some mucosal irritation that was likely unmasked with heparin, and after the heparin was held for one day, it was restarted and there was no further evidence of bleeding from the tracheostomy site, and no bleeding from endotracheal suctioning.
Infectious Disease:  Initially it was unclear if the patient had septic physiology that was contributing to the low arterial pressures, and was empirically treated with levofloxacin, Flagyl, and vancomycin.
However, the patient continued to spike fevers and developed a consolidation on chest x-ray.
The concern was for ventilator-associated pneumonia with empiric coverage for pseudomonas with Zosyn, which was started on [**12-29**] and was treated with a two week course of Zosyn.
There were no further episodes of spiking fevers.
At the time of this dictation, there is no evidence of any ongoing infection.
There was a brief period of hypernatremia starting on [**2152-1-12**], which was corrected with free water boluses through the orogastric tube, with normalization of sodium.
Renal:  Early in the hospital course, there were significant episodes of hypotension, likely causing some degree of acute renal failure and possibly some acute tubular necrosis.
Acute myocardial infarction 2.
Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the left anterior descending, D1 left circumflex and obtuse marginal lesions 4.
Hypoxic respiratory failure 5.
Likely anoxic brain injury 9.
Congestive heart failure 10.
Atrial fibrillation  DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.
Neurological status is marginally improved, with consistent following of commands and consistent response to verbal stimuli.
Due to significant deconditioning from the cardiogenic shock as well as hypoxic respiratory failure and possible anoxic brain injury, will require a stay in rehabilitation for improvement of deconditioning.
