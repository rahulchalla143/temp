Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2144-6-12**] - Placment of right femoral catheter [**2144-6-18**] - Placement of left femoral 12 french triple lumen temporary dialysis catheter [**2144-6-18**] - Removal of left tunneled IJ hemodialysis catheter [**2144-6-21**] - Thoracentesis of right pleural effusion [**2144-6-26**] - Placement of a tunneled Left IJ 14.5-French HD catheter [**2144-6-26**] - Removal of L femoral temporary HD catheter [**2144-6-26**] - Placement of Left PICC line [**2144-7-7**] - Removal of Left PICC line [**2144-7-7**] - Placement of Right PICC line [**2144-7-11**] - Removal of Right PICC line secondary to displacement [**2144-7-13**] - Attempted placement of Right IJ line, attempted placement of right femoral line [**2144-7-13**] - Placement of Left femoral central line   History of Present Illness: 61 M with h/o ESRD on HD, Etoh cirrhosis, hep B and hep C, seizure d/o, gout, HTN, line infections, recently d/c'd after admit for 1 week history of diarrhea, now readmitted from HD for hypotension, continued diarrhea.
At that time, he denied nausea/vomiting, fever, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, or SOB, hematemesis, recent laxatives or antibiotics.
He did note progressive leg weakness over several months, and RN at the NH reported progressive mental status decline since [**10-6**], with lethargy, psychomotor retardation and confusion.
During recent admit, patient had a CT of the abdomen that showed thickening of the ascending and transverse colon c/w colitis.
It was felt that he likely had a viral enterocolitis, or less likely, an ischemic colitis from possible hypotensive episode during HD session.
Another possibility was a viral enteritis causing hypovolemia, then the resulting hypotension causing ischemic colitis.
New acute onset of inflammatory bowel disease was thought very unlikely.
He is not clear what medicines he has been getting at [**Hospital1 11851**], including if he has gotten any laxatives or stool softeners.
Was admitted for dehydration from continued diarrhea.

A right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is again demonstrated and not significantly changed compared to the prior study.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2144-6-12**] Radiology CT ABDOMEN PELVIS: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A right-sided pleural effusion and bilateral lower lobe multifocal patchy opacities are again demonstrated not significantly changed compared to the prior study.
There is apparent wall thickening of the transverse colon as well that was also demonstrated on the prior study.
The splenic flexure and descending colon is under-filled, however there also appears to be wall edema affecting these locations as well.
Note is made of free fluid tracking along the pericolic gutters, increased compared to the prior study.
There are no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Unchanged appearance of the chest compared to the prior study with a right-sided pleural effusion and patchy multifocal opacities.
Wall edema/thickening of the ascending and transverse colon and possibly descending colon consistent with colitis with interval increase in free fluid tracking along the pericolic gutters.
Differential diagnosis includes infectious, inflammatory, and ischemic etiologies.
[**2144-6-14**] Port Chest: 1) Persistent small curvilinear opacity at the left apex, which may reflect a small pneumothorax.
2) Stable moderate to large partially loculated right pleural effusion with adjacent opacities in the right middle and lower lobes.
[**2144-6-18**] Port Chest: Persisting moderate right-sided pleural effusion with progression of associated consolidation, which given the clinical history is likely consistent with pneumonia.
[**2144-7-6**]: Left UE US- Partially occlusive thrombus in the left internal jugular vein.
Possible partially occlusive thrombus in the left basilic vein along the PICC.
No free air.
Ill-defined nodular density at the left lung base, likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology given that it was not present on the recent prior exam.
Stable position of left internal jugular venous access catheter.
Increase in the patchy opacities at the left base.
Findings could be consistent with aspiration.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
[**2144-7-14**]: pORT CHEST: IMPRESSION:  No short interval change.
No pneumonia or overt fluid overload.
A day after the sigmoidoscopy, he underwent HD where he was afebrile and stable, and was transported to the GI suite for possible colonoscopy but developed severe rigor and fever.
Dopamine was started on the floor in addition to fluid boluses, and pt was transferred to the MICU.
He also has adrenal insufficiency from long term use of prednsione for gout.
The source was thought to be either from sigmoidiscopy or line related as he had femoral line in his right groin as well as tunneled HD line in his left IJ.
Placement of this catheter was complicated by the fact that patient was having mental status change and did not have a health care proxy.
On [**2144-6-28**], the patient was noted to have a brief desaturation on the floor down to about 89% on room air, which increased to 98-99% with non-rebreather.
At this point, the patient had completed ceftriaxone for his previous E. Coli bactermiea, but was already receiving Flagyl for a possible previous aspiration.
The patient was noted the day following to have a leukocytosis, which was also accompanied by abdominal pain.
A [**Name (NI) 5283**] sono was negative and a port chest and KUB did not demonstrate any evidence of disease including free air.
In the setting of this leukocytosis, the patient again became hypotensive and was empirically started on Vancomycin IV and Zosyn.
The patient, who previously had been weaned back down to 10mg PO qd of prednisone was again brought to his stress dose steroid of 100mg hydrocortisone qd for possible adrenal insufficiency.
The patient was additionally given 1 unit PRBC for low Hct.
In the setting of continued GI output, the patient additionally had a rectal tube placed on [**2144-7-5**] to avoid contamination of his sacral decubitus ulcer.
A LUE US revealed partial obstruction of the left IJ and Left basilic vein.
THat evening, the patient was noted to have some epistaxis without hemodynamic compromise and the Heparin Drip was immediatley stopped.
While in HD, team was called as patient had acutely decompensated since his arrival.
He was with mental deteriation and O2 sats to the high 70's and 80's.
As the patient was DNR/DNI it was determined that the patient may recieve pressors if necessary in the unit, but at most could receive bi-PAP or CPAP for ventilatory support.
The patient was not receiving insulin, and was given amps of dextrose as needed for hypoglycemic episodes as well as basal fluids with D5.
The patient was immediately given 1 unit of platelets for hrombocytopenia and the patient previously that evening had received i unit of FFP for an elevated INR.
Given the above and his recent medical decompensation, thought likely to represent sepsis and DIC, the decision was made, agreed upon by all healthcare workers involed in his care, that Mr. [**Known lastname 52065**] would not have wanted continued aggressive medical management.
On the morning of [**2144-7-16**], the patient was noted to be demonstrating an agonal breathing pattern.
The patient quitely passed away within a few hours without incident.
CT of the abdomen showing wall thickening of the ascending, transverse, and descending colon.
He underwent sigmoidoscopy which showed multiple patchy erythematous and edematous area but etiology was inconclusive.
The plan was to send him for colonoscopy but patient became septic with E. Coli bactermiea s/p sigmoidoscopy for which he was treated with ceftriaxone.
After resolution of his septic episode, the patient continued to have diarrhea during his hospital stay, accompanied as well by abdominal pain.
The patient was additionally started on PO Vancomycin at this time 125mg po q6h for treatment of likely C. Diff Colitis.
The patient was additionally found during his stay to have frequent contamination of his sacral decubitus ulcer with feces.
Because of this, a rectal tube was placed while the patient experienced diarrhea to avoid contamination of his open wound.
The patient was with resolution of his diarrhea, without a rectal tube, and had his questrum dosing decreased to tid until the events as noted above.
3)Pneumonia: CXR in MICU suggestive of possible PNA as well as worsening right side pleural effusion which was tapped.
The pleural fluid was consistent with exudate by Light's criteria and is likely parapneumonic.
He likely had aspiration pneumonia in the ICU while his mental status was altered.
Flagyl was added in addition to Ceftriaxone to cover for anerobes for pneumonia as well as empiric coverage for GI flora.
4)Thrombocytopenia: He has a baseline thrombocytopenia from chronic liver disease.
However, he had a drop in plt count to the 40's.
5)Mental Status: progressively declining mental status since last [**Month (only) 359**]; unclear etiology.
He became more confused and disoriented after the MICU stay which was thoguht to be ICU psychosis and toxic-metabolic picture.
7)Nutrition: Pt with albumin of 1.8 primarily from persistent diarrhea and decreased po intake from inumerous NPO peri-procedure and ICU stay.
remainder of hospital course as above  8)Gout: Pt with long standing use of prednisone 10 mg qd for chronic gout.
10)CODE: DNR/DNI-well documented.
