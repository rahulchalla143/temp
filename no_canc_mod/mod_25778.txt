He was unresponsive initially with ?
ST elevations, which resolved on presentation.
He became SOB and CXR and BNP revealed CHF.
Chest CT showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, ?CHF vs PNA, no PE.

Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had mild diffuse disease.
The abdominal aorta was noted to be extremely tortuous on arterial access, requiring placement first of a 5F long sheath up to the iliac bifurcation before advancing a magic torque wire could be advanced to the aortic arch.
This was exchanged for a 5F short sheath at the conclusion of the case.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The global LVEF improved to 20% with inotropic support.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta at the level of the LSCA.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Hyperdensity is noted in the right anterior cranial fossa appering to be predominantly intra-axial hemorrhage, however, components of extra-axial hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
The right frontal lesion appears to be most likely a hemorrhagic contusion, but recommend comparison with the outside MR examination.
[**2168-11-1**] Carotid Ultrasound No significant carotid artery stenosis bilaterally.

His cardiac catheterization revealed severe three vessel disease.
Mr. [**Known lastname 83853**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed no significant disease.
As he had bilateral hygromas seen on an outside MRI, the neurology service was consulted for clearance for surgery.
It was determined that these were at a very low risk for hemorrhage during anticoagulation while on bypass.
A CT scan was obtained which showed no acute process.
