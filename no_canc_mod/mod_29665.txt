His symptoms progressed and he began to have dyspnea with minimal DOE.
He also had profound orthopnea and PND and was unable to sleep unless he was sitting upright.
He also began developing LE edema over the past few says.
An echo was obtained which showed EF 55%, mod to severe AI and elevated pulm pressures.
He was transfered for cath to [**Hospital1 **] for ischemia evalation.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
has 2 adult children - Tobacco history: denies - ETOH: social, 1 alcoholic drink/ week - Illicit drugs: denies   Family History: Father: died of aortic aneursym at age 66, Brother s/p aortic aneursym repair, sister with HTN, grandfather with CVA  Physical Exam: GENERAL: NAD.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
2-3/6 soft diastolic murmur heard best over RUSB LUNGS: respirations unlabored, CTAB over ant/ bilateral chest ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits or hematoma.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The LAD had a distal occlusion and a 70% lesion in the first diagonal branch.
The LCx had a mid 50% vessel narrowing and a 70% stenosis in the LPL branch.
The RCA had a total chronic occlusion with left to right collateral filling.
Ascending aortography demonstrated severe aortic insufficiency with retograde filling of the left ventricle within two heart beats.
No dissection flap noted.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severly elevated left ventricular filling pressures, with an LVEDP of 38 mmHg.
There was also severly elevated pulmonary hypertension, with a PASP of 77mmHg.
The mean PAP did not improved with inhaled 100%FiO2, but did lower with reduction in systemic blood pressure.
The patient had severe systemic hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 220/87 mmHg.
There was no significant transaortic valvular gradient on careful pullback.
Severe aortic insufficency.
Severe systemic hypertension.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Severly elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
ECHO ([**2-25**]): Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with a hypoplastic appearance to the right coronary cusp.
There are no vegetations seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe aortic regurgitation in a trileaflet valve, mostly through the apparently-hypoplastic right coronary cusp.
Moderately dilated left ventricle with mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary embolism of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery, mainly involving the anterior segment.
No right heart strain.
No evidence of thoracic aortic aneurysm.
Aortic regurgitation cannot be assessed on non-ECG-gated CT images.
Echocardiography or MRI might be considered for further workup.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusion.
Discharge Labs ([**2-26**]): [**2158-2-26**] 01:20PM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-5.36 Hgb-14.5 Hct-45.1 MCV-84 MCH-27.0 MCHC-32.1 RDW-14.6 Plt Ct-278 Chemistry: pending  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year-old man with a PMH of hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with 2-3 weeks of progressive shortness of breath, signs and symptoms of CHF found to have severe aortic regurgitation on echocardiogram and right upper lobe pulmonary embolism on CT angiogram.
# CHF with aortic insufficiency: Patient had no history of valve abnormality and the eitology was further evaluated with 3D echocardiogram that revealed a tri-leaflet valve and an LVEF of 42%.
There was no evidence of endocarditis on echocardiogram.
It is likely that his CHF/AI was exacerbated in the setting of his severe hypertension with SBP 200 on admission and possibly by PE that was later found on CTA.
Preexising CHF may have caused aortic annulus dilation worsening the AI and AI was likely contributing to worsened heart failure.
On cath, patient had elevated pulmononic pressures and was therefore diuresed.
Pt was started on metoprolol 50mg TID to control heart rate and kept on home losartan for BP control.
Severe elevation in LV pressure was somewhat more consistent with fairly acute regurgitation to which the heart had not yet had a chance to compensate vs fairly old AI with new cardiac decompensation and inability to maintain ventricular emptying in setting of AI.
Pt was initially given some IV lasix to help with volume overload and had good urine response.
# CAD: Patient found 3 vessel disease and would likely benefit from CABG at time of aortic valve replacement.
Did not appear to be having an acute coronary event as biomarkers were negative and there were no acute EKG changes indicative of a new event.
# HTN: patient admitted with severe HTN with SBP to 200s.
# HLD: Lipid panel showed acceptable control of LDL and somewhat low HDL.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease Congestive Heart Failure Aortic Insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath.
You were found to have congestive heart failure that was causing fluid accumulation in your lungs.
You were also found to have a leaky aortic valve (aortic insuffiency) which further worsens your heart failure symptoms.
You were also found to have significant caronary artery disease that would benefit from coronary artery bypass grafting.
Your Benicar was STOPPED  No additional changes were made to your home medications.
You should also see your dentist for surgical clearance for cardiac surgery.
