Briefly, patient was diagnosed with AIH overlapped with PSC in [**2158**] and since that time has had numerous admissions for obstructive jaundice and possible cholangitis.
During an admission in [**3-/2165**] he was found to have CA [**72**]-9 markedly elevated at 325, AFP at 6.7 with MRCP showing no evidence of cholangiocarcinoma.
He has been maintained on imuran and prednisone although there is some question whether the patient has been fully compliant with his regimen.
He initially presented to an OSH with fatigue and was found to have decompensated cirrhosis with jaundice, ascites and acute renal failure (creatinine 1.5 from baseline of 0.7- 1.0).
Given concern for possible cholangitis, he underwent ERCP w/ sphincterectomy on [**2165-9-5**] which showed stable, known constrictions without acute pathology.
Enroute to the hospital, he noted diffuse abdominal pain.
- EtOH: heavy up until [**2162**], no alcohol in 2 years - Drugs: none - Smoking: none   Family History: mother with diabetes, died at 37. father with HTN & CAD s/p CABG no history of liver disease.

Subsequently, a small area of atelectasis is seen at the right lung bases.
No pleural effusions.
No pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Markedly cirrhotic liver with diffuse nodularity and heterogeneity, but no mass visualized.
Intrahepatic biliary dilatation is also noted.
No evidence of portal venous thrombosis.
However, the left portal vein drains into a markedly enlarged umbilical vein while the right portal vein is significantly attenuated in size.
Moderate ascites.
ECHO [**2165-9-9**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Erythema and petechiae in the stomach body compatible with gastropathy.
No evidence of postoperative complication.
No intraabdominal fluid collection or free air.
Dilated ascending and transverse colon, likely colonic ileus.
Small right-sided pleural effusion with associated overlying atelectasis.
Tube cholangiogram [**2165-9-18**]: Gravity cholangiogram demonstrating contrast within a small bowel loop without evidence of contrast within bile ducts.
Findings concerning for early/partial small-bowel obstruction; possible etiologies include adhesion versus mass effect from the catheter positioned within the pelvis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
No deep vein thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Nuclear lung scan [**2165-9-23**]: Matched ventilation and perfusion defects.
Low likelihood of pulmonary embolism.
He had experienced a large increase in his ascites with worsening LFTs.
He was febrile on [**9-7**], with an elevated WBC.
Assumed to be due to cholangitis from ERCP performed on [**9-5**] at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Paracentesis showed no SBP.
Remained afebrile with WBC stable around 12.
Liver duplex showed patent vasculature, no ductal dilatation or perihepatic collections.
He had a persistent leukocytosis to 59K for many days without fever or other sign of infection.
On [**2165-9-17**], he was acutely anemic with orthostasis and hematocrit of 15.7.
EGD demonstrated esophageal varices, but these were not banded.
There was no clear site of bleeding in the jejunum and no active anastomotic bleed.
Around this time, he developed acute renal failure from tacrolimus toxicity and hypoperfusion.
He was persistently orthostatic due to hypovolemia due to high JP ascites output which required IV fluid/albumin.
CT chest showed no pneumonia.
He was extubated without difficulty.
On [**2165-9-19**] TPN was started for nutrition, as the patient developed ileus requiring NGT.
Hematocrit stabilized and there was no further evidence of bleeding.
Vancomycin was changed to linezolid for VRE growing from bile sampled from his Roux tube.
CXR found little interval change, and nuclear lung scan showed low likelihood of PE.
Orthostasis continued to be a problem impairing his ability to ambulate.
Hyperkalemia ensued due to Prograf toxicity.
Hyperkalemia was treated with IV meds and po Kayexalate.
Of note, he was found to have an elevated TSH 8.5 and low T3/T4 on [**9-17**].
Lasix was started for edema as well as for ascites that had accumulated after abdominal JPs were removed.
Cell count was indicative of peritonitis with 1350 WBC with 88 polys.
