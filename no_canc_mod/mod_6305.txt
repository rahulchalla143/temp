Admission Date:  [**2185-6-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-6-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2126-3-29**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease status post multiple PCIs, prior non-Q-wave MI, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, panic disorder, peripheral vascular disease, who was referred to [**Hospital1 188**] for outpatient cardiac catheterization.
On [**6-9**] while at the beach, the patient had felt lightheaded, had bilateral transient blindness, and a syncopal event.
The patient was taken to [**Hospital3 3583**] for syncopal workup.
He was ruled out for combined myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes and at that time no arrhythmias or dysrhythmias were noted.
In the ensuing days, he stated developing increasing chest pain typical of his previous angina.
He went for his stress test.
Myoview showed mostly fixed inferior wall defect with very mild inferior and lateral-wall reversibility.
The patient had intense chest pain.
When the patient went home he had increasing angina at rest relieved with nitroglycerin.
He had CAD risk factors, high cholesterol, and hypertension.
There was no diabetes mellitus.
He had stenting of his distal RCA and proximal circumflex in [**2182-5-7**], stenting of his marginal 2 and angioplasty of OM1 on [**2183-6-7**], angioplasty of inferior OM and superior branch OM [**2184-6-6**].
The patient also had workup for TIA due to increasing numbness in his hands bilaterally.
At that time he had a carotid duplex which showed no signs of flow abnormalities.
He has also had a MRI in the past, which revealed small vessel discharged and an EEG performed in [**2181**], which showed no seizure activity.
The patient's syncopal episode had been observed and he had no seizure activity or urinary incontinence.
The patient denies feeling diaphoretic prior to the syncopal episode.
Coronary artery disease.
Peripheral vascular disease status post right femoral bypass in [**2181**].
Degenerative disk disease L1, L4, L5.
Transient ischemic attack.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN, CAUSING NAUSEA AND VOMITING.
FAMILY HISTORY:  History revealed the patient's brother died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 47.
Father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.
Catheterization findings were normal left main, LAD with 50% mid, 60% ostial diagonal 1, left circumflex 50% lower pole of obtuse marginal 1, 70% upper pole, RCA with occluded PDA with left to right collaterals, 90% stenosis in PLV stent.
During the procedure, the patient was noted to have Wenckebach A-V block of varying degrees, temporary transvenous pacing wire was left in place.
Post dilation, the EKG revealed first degree AV block.
This is a middle-aged man lying in bed in no acute distress.
NECK:  Neck was remarkable for no JVD, but right carotid bruit.
He had regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, [**1-12**] holosystolic low pitched murmur at the apex and the left lower sternal border without radiation to the axilla.
Femoral line showed no bleeding and no bruit.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, 2+ radial pulses, no DP or PT palpable.
The motor was [**4-10**] in all extremities except for the proximal left lower extremity secondary to femoral sheath.
He had decreased sensation on the dorsum of both feet bilaterally and the medial aspect of his right thigh.
The patient had no ectopy, but occasional bradycardia overnight, but transvenous pacer never paced.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient had no episodes of syncope or vasovagal events.
He had no signs of arrhythmias, while ischemic-induced arrhythmias are a possible cause for the syncopal event.
The patient did not show any signs of ectopy or arrhythmias during the hospital course that would suggest such an etiology.
The patient had no pulmonary issues.
He had no active renal issues.
The transvenous pacer was pulled and the femoral line remained without signs of oozing, hematoma, or bruit.
The patient had no infectious disease issues or GI issues.
Coronary artery disease, status post catheterization.
