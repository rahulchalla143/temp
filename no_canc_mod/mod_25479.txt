He later became combative with EMS.
He again became combative and was intubated.
CT torso revealed potential aspiration pneumonia.

Central vascular congestion without overt edema or pneumonia.
The pelvis is intact without fracture or dislocation.
Degenerative changes are noted at the lumbosacral junction.
Bilateral femoral heads are appropriately located with no fracture of the proximal femurs identified.
No evidence of acute thoracic or abdominal traumatic injury.
Bilateral basal opacities in the lung could represent dependent atelectatic changes.
Considering the presence of fluid in the right main bronchus in this intubated patient, aspiration cannot be ruled out.
Diffuse emphysematous changes of both lungs.
No acute cervical spine fracture.
Multilevel degenerative disease with posterior osteophytes at C4, C5, C6, C7, and T1 levels, causing mild spinal canal narrowing at that level.
Recommended MRI of C-spine, if the patient has signs of cord injury.
[**2151-10-29**]: Head CT: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or major vascular territorial infarction.
White matter hypodensities are noted in bifrontal white matter, consistent with chronic microangiopathic ischemic disease.
Bilateral mastoid air cells, external auditory canals appear clear.
Brief Hospital Course: 72M with history of gout, prostate cancer, and remote history of skin cancer (?type), admitted to the MICU with altered mental status and intubation after likely seizure.
Likely representing post-ictal changes.
Imaging and seizure workup as noted below.
# Seizure.
The prelimary read showed post-seizure changes, with the final read as follows: "Extensive areas of FLAIR hyperintensity in the cortex, in the frontal lobes on both sides as well as left temporal lobe, with another focus in the left frontal subcortical white matter; a 0.8 x 0.6 mm round enhancing lesion noted in the right frontal lobe anterior to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
The differential diagnosis for the FLAIR hyperintense areas includes seizure- associated phenomena, drug induced, other etiologies like encephalitis, viral in etiology.
However, given the small enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe, superimposed inflammatory or infective etiologies, less likely neoplastic etiology like metastasis are also in the differential diagnosis.
Followup evaluation in a few days can be considered to assess the stability of the FLAIR signal abnormalities based on the clinical condition.
# Elevated troponins/NSTEMI.
There were no ischemic changes on EKG and patinet reported no chest pain or shortness of breath.
He was initially started on ASA, beta blocker, and statin therapy, which were discontinued at discharge given lack of evidence for use in troponin elevation related to demand.
# Renal insufficiency.
Denies past history of renal insufficiency.
# Urinary frequency/dribbling: He had foley trauma in MICU when, while delerious, he attempted self dc of foley catheter.
He had bladder neck contracture on cystoscopy.
Oxybutinin was tried for symptomatic benefit.
Will need dilantin level check, neurology referral, possible eventual cardiac workup as above.
Left message for patient regarding details of his appointment.
Prostate cancer Gout Hypertension Elevated troponins   Discharge Condition: Medically stable for discharge home   Discharge Instructions: Mr [**Known lastname **], .
You underwent a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) which was unrevealing for potential causes of altered mental status.
Tests for herpes simplex virus in your spinal fluid were pending at the time of discharge.
You should call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience any of the following: -Uncontrollable shaking, tremulousness or repetitive movements -Loss of consciousness -Severe chest pain or chest pressure -Blood in your urine, or painful urination .
Please ask him to address your elevated troponin levels.
