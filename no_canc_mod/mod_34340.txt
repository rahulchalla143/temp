He presented to the OSH on the evening of [**4-28**] after a week of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
At OSH he was noted to be in DKA with no prior history of DM with BG of >1200, gap 37.
He was also noted to have pancreatitis with a lipase 167 and amylase 425.
Additional issues during his hospital course included the following: 1) non-oliguric renal failure (Cr 4.0), likely due to hypotension and volume depletion.
2) respiratory distress in the setting of renal failure requiring intubation.
A repeat abdominal CT was performed which revealed possible mesenteric ischemia, and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Non-occlusive thrombus in the left portal vein.
A spot was marked for paracentesis to be performed by the clinical team in the lower pelvis in the midline.
Findings consistent with extensive hemorrhagic pancreatitis involving head and body of the pancreas and almost complete devascularization, consistent with necrotic pancreas.. 2.
Moderate amount of ascites with mild enhancement of peritoneal leafs on the right.
Small amount of bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
Mild splenomegaly.
Partial left portal vein thrombosis.
Mild dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree, left more than right, without evidence of CBD dilatation.
No significant change in the necrotizing pancreatitis with minimal to no residual enhancing pancreas.
There may be a small amount of enhancing head and uncinate process.
No significant change in the multiloculated fluid collections within the pancreatic bed.
No gas is seen within these fluid collections at this time.
No significant change in thrombosis of the SMV extending into the main portal vein and distalmost splenic vein.
Numerous abdominal collaterals and mild splenomegaly consistent with portal hypertension due to the thrombosis.
Possible mild hypoenhancement of the upper pole of the right kidney.
This may not be a clinically significant finding, however, could possibly be seen in pyelonephritis and therefore correlation with urinalysis recommended.
Nodular opacities in the right middle lobe, incompletely evaluated, but likely infectious or inflammatory in nature.
Findings concerning for pseudoaneurysm formation arising from a branch of the inferior pancreatic artery.
No evidence for rupture.
Stable appearance of multiloculated fluid collections replacing most of the pancreas, consistent with necrotizing pancreatitis.
Stable mild splenomegaly with perisplenic varices, consistent with portal hypertension.
Likely reactive inflammation in the duodenum and ascending colon.
New small pleural effusions with atelectasis.
Lateral segment right middle lobe pneumonia versus aspiration  Brief Hospital Course: 35 year old man with past history of alcohol abuse was transferred from OSH for further management of severe complicated alcoholic acute pancreatitis.
Acute pancreatitis Etiology thought to be secondary to alcohol.
Abdominal CT showed hemorrhage and near-complete de-vascularization of the pancreas with necrosis.
Two repeat abdominal CT's obtained throughout his hospital stay showed no evidence of further hemorrhage or abscess formation.
ICU course was also complicated by respiratory failure, which quickly resolved, as well as acute renal failure attributable to severe pancreatitis which resolved with hydration.
His pancreatitis gradually improved and upon discharge, he was tolerating a regular diet with pancrease.
Pancrease was given before meals for presumed pancreatic insufficiency resulting from necrosis of the pancreas.
New-onset Diabetes Mellitus Etiology was thought secondary to extensive necrosis of the pancreas, complicated by DKA.
Fevers Patient was febrile on presentation to the ICU and was empirically treated with Meropenem for five days.
Repeat abdominal CT at that time showed no evidence of pancreatic abscess.
He was afebrile for at least the last 7 days of his hospitalization.
Anemia Patient had a marked decrease in his hematocrit and was found to have guaiac positive stools.
He underwent an upper endoscopy significant only for portal gastropathy attributed to extensive portal vein thrombosis; no varices or active bleeding noted.
Portal vein/superior mesenteric vein thrombosis Patient seen in consultation by general surgery and hepatology, who recommended anticoagulation given the risk of mesenteric ischemia with SMV thrombosis.
The patient was started initially on a Heparin to Coumadin bridge with 5mg of Coumadin daily, but quickly became supratherapeutic with an INR to 4.0 after only two doses of Coumadin.
Thrombocytopenia His platelets were in the 40's upon presentation, attributed to severe pancreatitis and alcohol abuse.
His platelets rose to a high of 140, then decreased to the 90-100 range in the setting of high fevers.
No evidence of primary liver disease or cirrhosis noted on imaging or endoscopy; very low suspicion for HIT given one negative HIT antibody and the steady rise in his platelet count early in his hospital course while on Heparin.
Pseudoaneursym During his admission, he underwent a CT Abd/Pelvis which revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the inferior pancreatic artery.
Due to concern for bleeding from this aneurysm, he was recommended to undergo a coiling procedure with IR.
He underwent angiography with IR, but no pseudoaneurysm was seen.
