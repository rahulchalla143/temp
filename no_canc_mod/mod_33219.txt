This AM, pt at gym working out as per his normal routine, found unresponsive, reportedly found in vfib and shocked x1, EMS reports suggest pt in NSR, then lost pulse in ambulance, CPR initiated, intubation attempted without success.
Pt continued on heparin drip and AC ventilation while in CVICU, given coreg with SBP drop from 140 to 90, a-line in place with 2pIVs.
Past Medical History: Cardiomyopathy - thought viral [**12-26**], diagnosed at [**Location (un) **], with multiple readmissions for CHF exacerbations with signficant DOE and LE edema in [**2096**].
ECHO then showed global dyskinesis with EF 20%.
Did show e/o asymptomatic VT in [**2096**] DC summary.
Sister died from ovarian cancer.
RR, normal S1, S2, +S3, 4/6 SEM throughout, ?iabp Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PERTINENT LABS/STUDIES:  EKG: [**8-19**] leads strip EKG 6am - irregularly irregular, with st-elevation v3, with marked st changes with depressions in lat leads, elevations III and avF, nl axis.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
Severely depressed LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Eccentric MR jet.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Some residual atelectatic changes on the left.
No focal deficit evident on exam.
Psychiatry was consulted for recommendations, as Mr.[**Known lastname **] remained in the CVICU for continued confusion and supervision.
EP was consulted re:EF=20% and history of cardiac arrest preadmission, and the possible need for an AICD.
Due to the persistent state of agitation and confusion, and need for supervision during recovery,medications were titrated.
His hemoglobin A1C was elevated at 6.7, and he required sliding scale insulin coverage throughout his hospitalization.
Keep wounds clean and dry, shower daily, no bathing or swimming.
Call for fevers, redness or drainage from wounds.
