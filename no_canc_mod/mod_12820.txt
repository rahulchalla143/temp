The patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 3325**] on [**2106-10-18**] with abdominal pain, nausea, and recent diarrhea.
The patient reports in the week prior to her presentation at [**Hospital1 46**] she was having many (>10) bowel movements per day but that this diarrhea had stopped in the last day or so before she went to [**Hospital1 46**].
Of note, the patient reports multiple similar bouts of diarrhea and abdominal complaints during the past six months that could be quite severe and then completely resolved.
At [**Hospital 26580**] Hospital the patient underwent a CT abdomen that revealed possible pneumatosis of the small bowel (possible focal air in the mesentery adjoining the ileum) though it was a poor quality scan.
She also developed chills and a vesicular rash.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was complaining of abdominal pain.
DERM: Grouped pustulovesicles on left dorsal hand and bilateral dorsal feet.
Anicteric sclerae.
No conjunctival injection or exudate.
No oral lesions.
No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.)
Diminished breath sounds at right base.
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Quiet heart sounds.

Thyroid U/S [**2106-10-21**]: Multinodular goiter with a dominant nodule in the left mid to lower lobe.
Repotedly, this dominant nodule has been previously biopsied but the camparison films are no longer available to evaluate for a change in the nodule.
KUB [**2106-10-21**]: No evidence of small bowel obstruction.
NOnspecific linear areas of contrast in the lower abdomen/pelvis.
Chest Radiograph [**2106-10-28**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased potentially reflecting improved ventilation.
The appearance of the pre-existing right basal opacity is more suggestive of an atelectasis than of pneumonia.
A similar opacity is also seen at the left lung base.
No pulmonary edema.
No larger pleural effusions.
There is contrast material seen throughout the colon, without signs of bowel obstruction.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 39599**] is a 59 year-old female who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from [**Hospital3 3583**] with abdominal pain, possible pneumotosis of the small bowel, hypotension to the 90s, and acute kidney injury.
NAUSEA/VOMITING/ABDOMINAL PAIN/DIARRHEA/CONSTIPATION: The patient reports intermittent prolonged periods of diarrhea the most recent resolved just before she went into [**Hospital3 3583**].
These are associated with abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Because of her abdominal pain and question of pneumatosis of the ileum she had been started on empiric therapy with ciprofloxacin/metronidazole that had been broadened to tigecycline/metronidazole by her time of presentation here.
At presentation here she was seen by surgery who remained with relatively low concern for an acute surgical abdomen but did think she had a significant enteritis and thus tigecylcine was continued.
Gastroenterology evaluated her as well and thought an inflammatory bowel disease versus an infectious etiology was most likely and recommended checking inflammatory markers, which were elevated.
Over the course of the patient's hospitalization her stool cultures all returned negative and her symptoms began to improve with less pain and nausea so that she could be advanced to a full diet.
Unfortunately, due to a large amount of retained barium from her outside hospital scan, which proved refractory to attempts to clear it with mineral oil, aggressive bowel regimen including docusate, senna, and lactulose, and eventually a GoLytely prep she was unable to be reimaged with CT prior to discharge.
As she had drastically improved regarding her abdominal pain and had no clinical sigsn of periotonitis or fever even after antibiotics were stopped (on [**11-4**]) she was discharged to continue her work-up as an outpatient.
At the time of discharge, however, she only had very minor abdominal pain and was tolerating a full diet without concern.
She was seen by nephrology who looked at her sediment and thought most likely etiology was acute interstitial nephritis with most likely causative [**Doctor Last Name 360**] being ciprofloxacin, which had been restarted at time of transfer, though pantoprazole was another possible offender.
HYPOTENSION: The patient was relatively hypotensive at presentation with SBP's in the 90's.
These resolved back to the 110's with multiple fluid boluses shortly after her presentation to the MICU.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/ ASTERIXIS: At presentation to the hospital the patient had mental status changes primarily somnolence and inability to hold position.
These were thought most likely due to polypharmatcy in the context of the multiple anti-psychotics and narcotics the patient received at the OSH.
On the night prior to transfer out of the MICU she became extremely sedated and difficult to arouse.
A stat ABG was obtained which showed some hypercarbic respiratory acidosis, and physical exam revealed reactive but pinpoint pupils bilaterally.
She frequently would ask for increases in these doses or decreasing intervals, which were refused secondary to her unimpressive discomfort on exam and the fact her pain did not seem to affect her functioning.
DIGIT RASHES: At presentationg the patient had vesicular lesions on the backs of her hands and feet and given her presentationg with kidney injury there was concern these were vasculitic.
Given history of IVDU hepatitis seriologies were sent given concern for PAN along with complement levels and ANCA were sent.
Dermatology was consulted who thought the rash was due to dihydrotic eczema and started a hydrating ointment along with clobetasol cream.
This led to resolution of the vesicularl lesions though she did continue to have dry and cracking skin on her extremities.
These were held initially secondary to her altered mental status and hypotension but then were partially restarted.
Clonidine was restarted due to her anxiety and hypertension and then trazodone was restarted for sleep.
After confirming her outside doses citalopram and buproprion were also restarted though her quetiapine was held on the advice of psychiatry who were unconvinced the patient had bipolar disorder and thought it best to minimize medications in the acute setting.
Trazodone 100 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Dilaudid 2 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5-1 Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 5 days.
Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Ileitis, presumed infectious without clear organism identified Eczema Acute Kidney Injury, like secondary to acute interstitial nephritis   Discharge Condition: Stable, able to take and tolerating food by mouth, ambulating.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the outside hospital because of abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Regarding your abdominal pain there was concern based on outside hospital imaging that your intestines had perforated, which can lead to a severe infection.
The surgeons were eventually very reassured by your exam that you did not have an acute surgical process in your abdomen and were comfortable with you going home and following up with your primary care doctor.
We feel comfortable you do not have an acutely dangerous process in your abdomen.
We were not able to rule out several abnormalities including the possibility you could have an inflammatory bowel disease.
You were given a prescription for pain medication if you continue to have pain for the next few days.
Please call your doctor or come to the ED if you have fevers, night sweats, inability to eat or drink due to nausea, bloody or black tarry stools, progressive abdominal pain, or any other concerning changes in your health.
