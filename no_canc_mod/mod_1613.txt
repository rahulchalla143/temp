The patient reports his current symptoms began this morning when he developed sudden onset, dull, substernal chest pain while walking at a leisurely pace at an automobile dealership.
The pain was associated with diaphoresis, and subsequently developed nausea while being transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
His symptoms were noted to be different than his prior anginal symptoms of epigastric pain.
The patient reports he began developing radiating left arm pain and precordial pain when he reached the ED.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation of coronary artery revascularization.

Dynamic ST depressions in inferior and precordial leads, more pronounced with increasing HR on seria EKGs in the ED.
The LMCA had no angiographically-apparent lesions.
The LAD was occluded proximally, and had a 90% stenosis just distal to the LIMA-LAD touchdown.
There was 90% stenosis in the native LAD just distal to the LIMA-LAD anastamosis.
Selective venous conduit angiography revealed a totally occluded SVG-D1/OM1 graft at the proximal segment of ostial stent.
The SVG-PDA graft was patent to the RCA, but had a 90% retrograde stenosis to the PLSA/PLB.
Patent LIMA-LAD graft with progression of native distal LAD disease.
Patent SVG-PDA graft with progression of disease in the ostium of the PDA that fills retrograde into the PLSA and posterolateral branches.
Post-CABG changes and scattered areas of calcified atherosclerotic disease in the aortic arch and aortic valve/annulus but none in the ascending aorta.
Subtle ground-glass opacities in the right upper and right lower lobes, possibly representing areas of aspiration.
A 3-mm right lower lobe nodule; given the patient's history, a one-year followup CT is recommended to document stability.
Moderate right pleural effusion and moderately severe right basal atelectasis are unchanged, but previous left lower lobe atelectasis and left pleural effusion are improved.
There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax  [**2140-12-25**] WBC-12.6* RBC-3.63* Hgb-10.9* Hct-32.4* MCV-89 MCH-30.0 MCHC-33.6 RDW-13.5 Plt Ct-408 [**2140-12-24**] WBC-13.7* RBC-3.58* Hgb-10.9* Hct-31.4* MCV-88 MCH-30.4 MCHC-34.7 RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-379# [**2140-12-10**] WBC-11.6*# RBC-4.55* Hgb-13.5* Hct-40.2 MCV-88 MCH-29.7 MCHC-33.6 RDW-12.9 Plt Ct-205  [**2140-12-25**] Glucose-147* UreaN-27* Creat-1.2 Na-138 K-3.5 Cl-94* HCO3-35* [**2140-12-24**] Na-138 K-4.2 Cl-97 [**2140-12-24**] UreaN-23* Creat-1.1 Na-138 K-3.4 Cl-95* HCO3-32 [**2140-12-23**] Glucose-158* UreaN-19 Creat-1.2 Na-138 K-2.9* Cl-97 HCO3-32 [**2140-12-10**] Glucose-204* UreaN-16 Creat-1.1 Na-138 K-3.9 Cl-102 HCO3-25  Micro: [**2140-12-24**] URINE FINAL REPORT [**2140-12-25**]  URINE CULTURE (Final [**2140-12-25**]): YEAST.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: 66yoM with significant CAD s/p CABG ([**2125**]), DES to SVG-D1/OM x2 ([**2135**], [**2138**]) who presents with chest pain and dynamic EKG changes, found to have SVG graft, PDA, LAD stenosis needing intervention.
# Chest Pain/CORONARIES:  Patient with CABG and DES to SVG-D1/OM x2 most recently in [**2138**] now presenting with chest pain and dynamic EKG changes in the inferior and precordial leads.
The patient's symptoms occurred subsequent to discontinuing Plavix 10 days ago for a lithotripsy.
He was on a Heparin gtt and was plavix loaded, and his chest pain was controlled on a Nitro gtt prior to cardiac catheterization.
Integrillin gtt and Morphine IV prn were started prior to catheterization for recurrent chest pain refractory to up-titration of Nitro gtt.
Cardiac catheterization [**12-13**] showed completely occluded SVG-D1/OM, 90% stenosis of SVG-PDA, known 90% LAD stenosis just distal to touchdown.
The patient had an acute drop in his platelets (described below) and Integrillin gtt was discontinued.
Shortly thereafter, he had a presyncopal episode on [**12-16**] during which he stood up, became pale, lightheaded, and developed mild left sided chest pain.
Vitals were stable but EKG showed new ST depressions in two leads, CE's negative.
He was transfused 1 unit PRBC for anemia (had previously refused transfusion) with resolution of symptoms but persistent ST depressions on EKG.
The patient remained chest pain free until CABG-redo on Tue.
Thrombocytopenia:  Patient developed severe thrombocytopenia,secondary to Integrillin.
Although the patient's thrombocytopenia occurred later than expected for integrillin-induced thrombocytopenia, the precipitous drop and extended period of time he was on integrillin both support this as the most likely etiology.
5H HIT Risk Score was also low, making it less likely to be HIT.
However, Heparin gtt was discontinued in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia given the patient has been chest pain free.
In the setting of thrombocytopenia, he developed significant bleeding from around his foley catheter and recent lithotrypsy procedure, which was switched to a 3-way foley on CBI.
# Urine analysis:  Patient with large blood, significant leukocytes, protein on UA likely [**1-26**] recent lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement.
Patient had significant bleeding from around the foley and it was replaced with a 3-way foley catheter on CBI.
Repeat UA today in setting of culture showing "probable" enterococcus previously in the setting of significant blood in urine and improved urine currently.
Repeat UA and UCx sent after bleeding hematuria improved.
The patient was treated with Cipro 250 mg x7 days for complicated cysistits in male with recent urologic procedure.
(d1=[**12-15**])  On [**12-15**] Mr.[**Known lastname 1007**] was taken to the operating room and underwent Redo sternotomy/ Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 (reverse saphenous vein grafts to the second branch of the posterior left ventricular branch, obtuse marginal artery, and left anterior descending artery)with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
