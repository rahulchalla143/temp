Admission Date:  [**2162-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-4-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparinoids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: 85 year old male well known to our service presents from vent rehab ([**Hospital1 **]) with tachypnea and hypotension, after recent discharge from MICU on [**2162-4-9**] for ESRD pancreatitis.
He is a gentleman with h/o CAD s/p 3V-CABG X 3 [**2162-3-5**] (OSH in Fla) c/b mediastinal hemorrhage requiring re-exploration ([**2162-3-6**]), post-op AFib, prolonged vent wean requiring trach ([**2162-3-15**]) and PEG ([**2162-3-24**]), acute on chronic renal failure requiring dialysis, and persistent post-op AFib and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2162-3-30**] for cholangitits c/p ERCP pancreatitis.
At rehab it is noted that he became increasinly tachypneic and aggitated with SBP in the ~200's.
(no hypoxia noted).
6) Stenotrophomonas cx'd from sputum [**2162-4-5**], on TMP/SMX 7) Right carotid stenosis: 80-99% by U/S 8) HTN 9) PVD 10) hypothyroidism 11) prostate CA s/p XRT 12) R renal artery stenosis; L renal artery occlusion 13) 4 cm infrarenal AAA 14) DJD 15) bilateral THR 16) s/p appy 17) bilateral inguinal hernia repair 18) Cholelithiasis: ERCP [**2162-4-5**] which showed diffuse dilation of CBD up to 10 mm without filling defects (although gallstones noted in GB) and dilation of pancreatic duct to 6 mm; the CBD was stented, c/b post-ERCP pancreatitis.
20) ERCP pancreatitis.
PS 15/5, PEEP 5, FiO2 40%, 100% Gen: elderly, ill appearing, sedated HEENT: Pupils non-reactive to light, EOMI, OMMM, OP clear, trach in place with dried thick secretions on dressing.
Cardiac: irregularly irregular, no m/r/g.
Pulmonary: coarse BS throughout with late wheezes R>L Abd: scaphoid abd, NABS, NT/ND, no masses, no HSM:  PEG site no erythema or discharge Ext: No cyanosis or edema.
[**4-12**] Echo: Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
[**4-12**] CXR: Improving left retrocardiac opacity and left pleural effusion.
No significant change in patchy right basilar opacity.
[**4-13**] CXR: Interval increase in size of the left pleural effusion with compression atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 year man with a history of CAD s/p recent CABG, AFib, s/p recent cholangitis and ERCP, post-ERCP pancreatitis, presented with a change in mental status and hypotension after receiving benzodiazepines and narcotics for aggitation.
He ruled out for an MI by enzymes and EKGs.
He was afebrile, with a normal WBC, normal LFTs/[**Doctor First Name **]/lip, and no new culture data.
# Altered mental status: Improved quickly once the benzos and narcotics wore off and patient returned to his pre-hospital / rehab mental status per family within 24 hours.
A CT head on [**2162-4-8**] showed no acute pathology, and an MRI head was not performed due to concern of pacer wires (reportedly in place but not seen on CXR) and metal clips in his sinuses.
Given the improvement in his mental status no further imaging was pursued.
# Agitation: Pt occasionally has problems with agitation with increased respiratory rate.
It is very important to avoid narcotics, benzodiazepines in this patient as he becomes hypotensive after administration of these medications.
Pt also became somnolent and hypotensive after 5mg of zyprexa.
# Lower GI Bleed: The patient had a small smount of BRBpR on [**4-13**] and [**4-14**].
A PEG tube lavage was heme negative, and on rectal exam the patient had an internal hemorroid.
# Respiratory failure: Patient was brought in from a trach rehab were his was attempting a slow respiratory wean.
CXR on [**2162-4-13**] showed an increase in size of the left pleural effusion with compression atelectasis of the left lower lobe, as well as improvement in the opacity at the right lung base.
He initially presented with a mild anion gap metabolic acidosis, presumably from his renal disease, but his gap and acidosis improved with HD.
The weakness was likely do to deconditioning but could have been due to ICU myopathy or an intracranial process.
MRI imaging was not done due to the question of cardiac pacer wires.
# Atrial fibrillation: which started post-CABG.
While in hospital the patient was rate controlled on amiodarone, and his coumadin was held for two day due to a slow lower GIB.
#  HTN: Antihypertensive medications were held in the setting of hypotension and recently started on hemodialysis.
The patient will need to establish a new baseline BP and BP regemine now that he has started hemodialysis.
Also a small amount of blood loss from lower GI bleed.
# CAD s/p CABG: Patient was continued on his ASA and his statin.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Change in mental status and hypotension likely due to benzodiazepines .
Atrial fibrillation ESRD on hemodialysis Coronary artery disease s/p CABG   Discharge Condition: Stable on trach ventilation  Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.
