NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
if pulmonary Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Blastomycosis,       Aspergillosis or Mucormycosis is strongly suspected, contact the       Microbiology Laboratory (7-2306).
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
per trauma surgery  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 1 mo + s/p traumatic arrest with fever, no clear source.
FINDINGS: There is near complete opacification of the bilateral ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses, with small gas collections within them.
There is moderate air-fluid level with mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus and moderate mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus.
A small amount of air-fluid level is seen in the frontal sinus.
Nasal passages demonstrate air- fluid levels, with soft tissue thickening.
IMPRESSION: Near complete opacification of the ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses.
Moderate air-fluid level with mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus and moderate mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus.
These findings most likely represent infection on chronic changes.
LINE PLACEMENT  Reason: confirm line placement, r/o PTX  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 29 year old man with mutliiple TRAUMA, now s/p PEA arrest today and now with fever , s/p new R subclavian line REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: confirm line placement, r/o PTX AP CHEST, 10:53 P.M.  HISTORY: Multiple trauma.
Bibasilar consolidation has improved dramatically since [**9-21**], suggesting this may have been an atypical pulmonary edema or atelectasis rather than pneumonia.
Continued followup for regions of bibasilar consolidation is nevertheless still recommended.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax.
Fracture of the mid right clavicle has been present without much change since at least [**8-23**].
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
There is possible focal basal inferior hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Possible mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with low normal global systolic function.
Right pleural effusion.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Chest CXR showed a right basilar consolidation and bibasilar atelectasis.
Problem list: Neuro:  severe neurologic dysfunction.
Patient remained without seizure activity and was continued on anti-epileptic medications as per neurology service recommendations.
Cardiac:  By report, patient experienced a brief episode of asystole.
No changes or issues this admission.
ID: Patient with fevers to 102 and leukocytosis.
Blood cultures were drawn and eventually grew 1 of 4 bottles with gram positive cocci (being speciated).
CT scan of sinuses were also obtained and showed opacification consistent with sinusitis.
Over the next several days patient's leukocytosis began to normalize and his fever curve improved.
However, he continued to have low grade temps with no other source of infection.
