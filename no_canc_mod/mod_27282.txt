CONTRAST: 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast was administered due to rapid rate of bolus injection.
CTA OF THE AORTA: There is a dissection extending from the mid portion of the aortic arch inferiorly to below the renal arteries.
No intramural hematomas identified.
The right renal artery originates from the true lumen; however, the dissection appears to involve the very proximal portion of the origin of the right renal artery.
No filling defects or pulmonary emboli are identified within the pulmonary arteries.
There is a focal aneurysmal dilatation of the right common iliac artery, measuring 16 mm in maximum diameter.
There is extensive calcification of the aorta.
No hilar or axial lymphadenopathy seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, greater on the right than the left, which demonstrate attenuation values consistent with simple fluid.
Minimal atelectasis is noted at the lung bases.
Lung window images demonstrate no pulmonary nodules or parenchymal masses.
No other abnormalities are identified within in the liver.
There is asymmetric parenchymal enhancement of the right kidney compared to the left, which may be related to involvement of the origin of the right renal artery with the dissection.
No focal infarcts are identified.
There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid.
The bowel is normal, without evidence of bowel wall thickening or dilatation.
No free fluid or free air is noted.
No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen.
There is prominent submucosal fat within the gastric mucosa.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is extensive diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
No free fluid is noted.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Degenerative changes are seen within the mid thoracic spine, at the L5/S1 level.
There is an aortic dissection extending from the mid portion of the arch of the aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, and extending along the aorta to and below the renal arteries.
The main branch vessels, including the SMA, celiac artery, and left renal artery arise off the true lumen.
Additionally, there is increased cortical parenchymal enhancement of the right kidney in comparison to the left.
No definite areas of infarct identified.
No intramural hematoma is seen.
Focal hypodensity in the dome of the liver, which is too small to characterize.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, without any evidence of diverticulitis.
Focal aneurysmal dilatation of the right common iliac artery, measuring 16 mm.
Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than the right.
