About 9:30AM [**10-21**], daughter-in-law woke pt up and noted that he had trouble sitting up, and was not speaking right.
Repeat labs here with INR 1.4 so no blood products given.

No obvious neglect  Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to  2 mm bilaterally in dark, brisk.
Right facial droop but does grimace to nasal tickle bilaterally.

Cerebral atrophy, probably c/w age-related changes.
Some chronic microvascualr changes periventricularly as well.
There is interval worsening of opacity in the left lower lobe as well as interval increase in size of a small left pleural effusion.
There is new patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region.
The bibasilar pulmonary opacities may be due to aspiration in the setting of an apparent hiatal hernia.
Brief Hospital Course: 87yo M h/o HTN, Parkinson's disease presented with difficulty speaking and increased lethargy to OSH.
Workup there revealed left basal ganglia bleed.
Neuro: Initial exam showed right arm and face paresis and increased tone in the right arm.
Also, he was very lethargic and not following commands or speaking.
Likely cause of bleed was hypertension, given location and PMH.
Etiology of decreased alertness was less clear as CT showed only mild surrounding edema, no mass effect or midline shift, and initial labs did not suggest metabolic derangement.
His dose of Sinemet was increased in the first several days of his admission as it was thought that his increased tone and bradykinesia could be attributed to his Parkinsonism.
However, he became increasingly lethargic, and Sinemet was reduced to his home dose w/ a response in his mental status back to his baseline.
Additionally, he was found to have aspiration pneumonia and a UTI, which likely attributed to his lethargy.
Dilantin was loaded but not continued - no evidence of seizures during this admission.
R arm flaccid but bradykinetic and rigid in remaining extremities; attends to both sides, and has blink reflex.
no spasticity; withdrawals to pain stimulus.
He will need intensive physical therapy and support but may not be able to return to baseline (which his son reports as ambulation w/o assistance).
Pt should continue Sinemet, have BP control, and f/u w/ his neurologist in the next few months.
His BP should be <140, and would recommend further titration of his meds to achieve that goal for future stroke prevention.
ID - Pt was found to have UTI and aspiration PNA although he had been afebrile and wnl WBC.
Pt should be monitored for aspiration pneumonia as he still has difficulty swallowing his secretions and he remains at higher risk of aspiration w/ PEG in place.
GI - On upper endoscopy, pt found to have gastritis.
Pt has coarse upper airway sounds, likely due to inability to swallow secretions.
He should continue to receive chest PT and suctioning.
He should have another eval in the future when pt's neurologic symptoms show improvement.
Make sure to take them as instructed - it is important to help prevent any further bleeding in your brain.
