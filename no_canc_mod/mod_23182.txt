Per history obtained later, he had been in USOH until the weekend before admission when he had his "usual" episodes of severe abdominal pain.
He then had an episode of vomiting post-ictally with a report of significant aspiration per EMS.
There is no documented exam at OSH but by verbal report to ED resident, he had been posturing; he received more propofol.
Past Medical History: Chronic abdominal pain x 13 years, episodic per wife   Social History: Pt is married and lives with his wife; he does not smoke, drink alcohol or use any drugs including IV drugs.
Family History: There is no family history of strokes or coagulopathies.
Mild proptosis Neck: No Carotid bruits on right.
V, VII: Face symmetric Weak corneals bilaterally right<left No cough/gag  Motor: No tremor.

No definite pleural fluid is seen.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
MRI/A/V UPON ARRIVAL TO [**Hospital1 18**] 4:16 AM: FINDINGS: The diffusion-weighted imaging shows slow diffusion throughout the entire cerebellum, brainstem as well as within the posterior medial left temporal lobes and both occipital lobes.
There is also extension of slow diffusion up into the left thalamus.
These findings are consistent with posterior circulation infarct with an acute posterior circulation infarct along the basilar artery territory into both posterior cerebral artery territories, left greater than right.
No areas of significant magnetic susceptibility are identified to indicate an acute hemorrhage.
The cerebellar tonsils appear slightly low which is likely a sign of mass effect in the posterior fossa.
The axial T1 fat saturated images through the neck do not demonstrate evidence of a dissection.
There is also flow within the distal vertebral arteries and small amount of the proximal basilar, but no flow signal is identified within the mid-to-distal basilar artery as well as very proximal posterior cerebral arteries.
The MRV demonstrates no evidence of sinus thrombosis.
IMPRESSION: Large posterior circulation territory infarct involving the basilar and both posterior cerebral arteries.
Developing obstructive hydrocephalus.
Edema and mass effect in the posterior fossa.
No evidence of dissection or venous sinus thrombosis.
Local anesthesia with 7 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.
The needle was exchanged for a 6-French vascular sheath.
Left vertebral arteriography was performed.
Angiography through the microcatheter was performed at various intervals during the administration of thrombolytic to assess for progress of thrombolysis and for any residual thrombus.
Angioplasty of the area of thrombus in the distal basilar artery was performed with a 4-mm diameter x 10 mm long HyperGlide balloon.
FINDINGS: Left vertebral arteriography with imaging from the C6-7 vertebral level to the confluence of the vertebral arteries.
There is an area of minor irregularity of the left vertebral artery at the occiput-C1 vertebral level.
Left vertebral arteriography with imaging focused on the cranium in the frontal and lateral projections: This demonstrates total occlusion of the basilar artery in its mid portion.
Post-procedure left vertebral artery arteriography in the frontal and lateral projections demonstrated the vertebral arteries to remain patent in their visualized portions.
Again, minor irregularity of the left vertebral artery in the level of the occipital condyles was visualized.
IMPRESSION: Complete occlusion of the mid basilar artery extending to the basilar tip was treated with a combination of pharmacologic and mechanical thrombolysis (a total of 19 mg of TPA was utilized).
There is extensive hypoattenuation throughout the entire cerebellum and most of the brainstem extending into the both occipital lobes and the left posterior medial temporal lobe.
These findings are consistent with the documented posterior circulation infarct (please see the MRI from earlier in the day).
On this exam, there is increased attenuation material within the suprasellar cistern and large rounded area of density within the left portion of the pons.
There is also high-density material posteriorly within the fourth ventricle.
This could be due to hemorrhagic conversion of the infarct or vessel rupture.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION: Large posterior circulation territory infarct.
High-density material along the right portion of the pons and into the fourth ventricle and the suprasellar cistern.
Brief Hospital Course: 33 yo male with no sig PMH except some chronic abdominal pain (13 hr history) presented as a transfer from OSH after being found unresponsive, head CT showing "bilateral occipital lobe infarcts" and cerebellar infarcts.
He had an MRI/A upon arrival which showed a clot in the basilar artery, as well as multiple areas of acute infarction - cerebellar, occipital, brainstem, L basal ganglia.
He underwent placement of a ventricular drain for obstructing hydrocephalus by the neurosurgical team.
At 7AM on [**2-26**], he underwent cerebral angiography and received 19 mg TPA to the site of the clot as well as balloon angio, with recanalization of basilar artery, but persistent occlusion of left PCA.
Stat head CT performed just following the procedure showed extravasation of contrast/blood, subarachnoid blood around brainstem into 4th ventricle, and swelling of posterior fossa.
Following the procedure, exam off propofol and paralytics showed absent brainstem reflexes with pupils 5-6 mm and unreactive, no corneals, no gag, no nasal tickle, could not assess OCR because hard collar in place; there was trace tripleflexion versus withdrawal to nox stim in lower extremities, absent movement to noxious stimulation in the upper extremities, trace DTRs and mute toes.
He was evaluated further by neurosurgery who felt he was not a surgical candidate as exam suggested brain death (though with recent propofol and paralytics, he could not definitively be considered brain dead at this time).
At 1600 on [**2-26**], the patient had an episode of bradycardia and hypotension requiring epinephrine, atropine and neosynephrine gtt.
At 11AM, in accordance with the patient's family's wishes, brain death exam was performed and confirmed brain death via absent brainstem reflexes, including absent response to cold calorics, failed apnea test with rise in PCO2 from 35 to 69 within just 5 minutes of no ventillation (with 100%fio2 supplementation).
He was continued on the ventillator for harvest of organs in the OR, until time of apnea and asystole following organ harvest.
