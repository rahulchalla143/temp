Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and lateral walls from the lower base to apex in the setting of mild to moderate global hypokjinesis.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.

This results in an eccentric jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation which is posteriorly directed.
There is a bileaflet mechanical prosthesis in the mitral position.
The normal mild valvular mitral regurgitation is seen.
No large perivalvular jets are seen.
