On this admission he presented to the Emergency Department on [**2193-11-21**] complaining of fatigue, weakness, vomiting and cough times several weeks.
Chem 7 showed hypoglycemia and anion gap acidosis after which he got D50, magnesium, bicarbonate, banana bag, 1 liter of normal saline and Ativan.
Later in the Emergency Department he vomited coffee ground emesis and a nasogastric lavage with 300 cc showed coffee grounds and returned bilious fluids.

Depression / substance abuse.
Following morning he was noted to have alcoholic ketoacidosis with a bicarb of 17 after fluid repletion.
By hospital day two the patient was noted to have increasing respiratory distress, worsening acidosis and progressive obtundation and was electively intubated.
This was felt possibly secondary to sepsis as 1 out of 6 blood culture bottles was positive for gram negative rods and gram positive cocci.

On hospital day four the patient noted to have pan sensitive e coli bacteremia and antibiotics changed to Ampicillin.

PCG of the abdomen showed pulmonary consolidation, marked fatty liver, no pancreatic stenosis or necrosis and gallstones with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Spontaneous breathing trials were initiated on hospital day ten and bronchoscopy was performed which noted some blood in the endotracheal tube which was suctioned clear.
The patient was extubated on hospital day 11 without problems.
The patient was noted to have a rash felt secondary to Ampicillin.
The patient was noted to have a seven beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, however given a normal echo on admission and no electrolyte abnormalities the decision was made by the MICU team not to pursue this issue further.
Upon arrival to the floor the patient complained of wheezing, cough and generalized weakness.
He denied any fevers, chills, headaches, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria or focal weakness.

Chest x-ray left lower lobe atelectasis, consolidation and low lung volumes noted.
Abdominal and pelvic CT scan on [**2193-11-28**] extensive pulmonary consolidation bilaterally with small pleural effusion unchanged.
