Posterior dislocation of the left humeral head.
No fracture identified.
Tib/Fib: negative for fracture  MR [**Last Name (Titles) **]: 1.Acute displaced and comminuted fractures of T5 and T6, with anterior wedging of T6 and retropulsed fragments causing moderate-severe cord compression, 2.
Focal high signal intensity within the cord at T5-6, likely representing contusion or edema.
Prevertebral hematoma at the fracture site.
Mild degenerative changes.
Acute fractures of T5 and T6 with components of lateral translation and anterior compression resulting in an unstable injury.
Additionally, there are small displaced osseous fragments projecting into the central canal at this level with associated narrowing of the central canal.
Given all of these findings, an emergent MRI is recommended to further assess the spinal cord and to exclude the possibility of an epidural hematoma.
Left 6th posterior rib fracture.
Nondisplaced posterior fracture of left second rib.
Posterior dislocation of the left humeral head with associated impaction fracture of the anteromedial humeral head (reverse [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 3450**] fracture).
No evidence of solid organ injury.
Pt brought to OR [**2170-11-21**] -  T1-10 fusion and left iliac crest bone graft.
He tolerated this procedure well but due to long time prone in OR was kept intubated and transferred to TICU.
He continued to have sensation in legs bilaterally and began to slowly regain some movement in lower extremities throughout hospitalization.
Wound care did evaluate pt for blisters on buttock.
