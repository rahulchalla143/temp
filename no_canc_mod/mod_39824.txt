She was found to have new onset a.fib w/ rate in the 120's to 130's and lateral ST depressions c/w demand ischemia.
Troponin was mildly elevated at 0.05, CK flat.
She had a negative U/A, CXR showed small left pleural effusion o/w no evidence of PNA and CTH was negative.

No intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral edema, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Paranasal sinus mucosal thickening and opacification as described.
The medial left hemidiaphragm is somewhat obscured relative to the prior studies, probably due to mild retrocardiac atelectasis.
No focal consolidation is seen.
The left costophrenic sulcus is blunted, probably due to small left pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
CXR [**2101-1-24**]: In comparison with the previous examination, there are newly appeared bilateral small pleural effusions and bilateral perihilar haziness.
Both changes are consistent with mild-to-moderate fluid overload.
No signs suggestive of pneumonia.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Preserved left ventricular systolic function.
The right ventricle is not well seen but may be dilated and mildly hypokinetic.
Micro: [**2101-1-24**] 9:34 am Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture       Source: Nasopharyngeal aspirate.
CULTURE CONFIRMATION PENDING.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
Urine ([**1-23**]) - negative Blood ([**1-23**]) - NGTD x 2 sets  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]yoF with h/o dementia and depression who presents w/ hypotension, fevers, and altered mental status.
# Altered mental status - Given fevers and leukocytosis, the patient was thought to have an infection.
Other sources of infection include possible bronchitis or sinusitis.
She was treated with empiric levofloxacin and her mental status improved.
# Hypotension/Hypertension- Presented with hypotension to SBP in 70s in the setting of new onset arrhythmia vs sepsis vs hypovolemia.
She was further bolused with IVF during her first night in the ICU, but then developed pulmonary edema on the next morning.
She became hypertensive to the 200s systolic.
She was diuresed with lasix with 5L of urine output and her respiratory status and hypertension improved.
Although she was not on anti-hypertensives prior to her admission, she has symmetric LVH on her echocardiogram, suggesting that she has had chronically elevated blood pressures.
# Atrial fibrillation - new onset per [**Hospital1 18**] documentation; likely due to stress of fluid depletion w/component of infection and transient hypoxia at her NH.
No h/o structural abnormality/CAD.
She had no further episodes of AFib during her stay.
# EKG changes w/elevation in troponins - likely due to demand ischemia.
# Dementia: at [**Name (NI) 5348**] is not oriented to place/situation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypotension and fever Pulmonary edema Atrial fibrillation Delerium Dementia   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, breathing comfortably, saturations are 95% on room air.
