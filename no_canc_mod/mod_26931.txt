Admission Date:  [**2113-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-7-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-7-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7744**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Puncture Endotracheal intubation   History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname **] is a 56 year old Cantonese-speaking man with history of hypertension and delusional disorder who presented from home after being found unresponsive by family, not responding to voice but protecting airway and with pulses intact.
PCP states that he is usually not delusional during clinic visits, though neice states that he is quite delusional and paranoid accusing his sister of things at home.
PCP has no knowledge of narcotics for this patient.
Patient had been complaining of chest pain in the spring, missed scheduled ETT in [**Month (only) 958**], missed a few times, now rescheduled for 8/[**2112**].
Patient was given narcan 0.4mg with no response.
Head CT showed No acute intracranial process.
CT Torso showed lower lobar opacification (Left greater than right), likely atelectasis though cannot rule out potential aspiration on left.
No additional acute intrathoracic, abdominal, or pelvic process was noted in the preliminary read to explain the patient's circumstance.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain due to altered mental status.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Delusional Disorder - on medications Gout Latent Tuberculosis - s/p treatment last year x6 months  Social History: Lives with elderly mom and sister.
- Tobacco: quit smoking 17 yrs ago - Alcohol:  none - Illicits:  none   Family History: Mother with bad diabetes.
IMAGING [**7-3**] Head CT: No acute intracranial process .
[**7-3**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no change.
Left greater than right lower lobar opacification likely reflects atelectasis, although an element of aspiration, particularly on the left, cannot be excluded.
No additional acute intrathoracic, abdominal, or pelvic process to explain the patient's circumstance .
[**7-4**] EEG: This is an abnormal EEG due to a disorganized background with fairly.
consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
The potential causes include but a metabolic, infectious, or sedative [**Last Name (un) **] consistent with common causes of encephalopathy include medications, infections, disturbances .
[**7-6**] MRI Head: Punctate area of slow diffusion in right medial temporal lobe medial to the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle.
This likely represents a small area of ischemia .
[**7-7**] TTE: No ASD or left ventricular thrombus seen.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
If clinical suspicion of a PFO is high, consider a transesophageal study or transcranial Dopplers .
Head CT shows no evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates no vascular occlusion or stenosis.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion, stenosis or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.
Brief Hospital Course: 46M Cantonese-speaking man with history of delusional disorder presenting with unresponsiveness that gradually improved, so thought to be due to a seroquel overdose.
# Altered Mental Status - Patient was found at home unresponsive, with a pulse and breathing on his own.
In the emergency department, the patient was found to have no acute process on Head CT.
Patient had no signs of cirrhosis on abdominal CT, and ammonia level is 17.
In the MICU, the patient was noted to have continued miosis, a prolonged QT, tachycardia, and urinary retention, consistent with possible seroquel overdose.
He underwent EEG that showed no evidence of seizure.
He also underwent brain MRI which showed a small area of ischemia in the temporal lobe, though this did not seem to completely explain his initial presentation so medication effect still thought to be the primary explanation for patient's altered mental status.
Pt exhibited no focal neurological deficits on exam.
# Ischemic Stroke: Pt was found to have a small ischemic stroke on Brain MRI.
No focal neuro findings.
Stroke w/u showed only mildly elevated triglycerides and LDL, but no other risk factors.
# Agitation - On transfer to the floor, pt became quite agitated, kicking at nursing and pulling at his Foley.
Cause of pt's agitation thought to be delirium due to recent administration of ativan in addition to the effect of seroquel withdrawal.
Pt had no further episodes of agitation for the remainder of his stay.
# Fever - On day 1 of admission, the patient began to have intermittent fevers.
ED lumbar puncture showed no evidence of infection.
The patient underwent repeat CXR that showed mild edema.
Pt subsequently developed an acute gout flare near his right toe, which was thought to be the most likely source of his fever.
He remained afebrile for the remainder of his stay.
# Bilateral lower lobe opacifications - On admission, the patient was noted to have bilateral lower lobe opacifications on chest CT, left side worse than right side.
He did complain of some cough, but this was thought to be due to atelectasis so pt was encouraged to use an expectorant and incentive spirometry.
Etiology unclear, but likely related to toxic ingestion and pre-renal causes such as hypovolemia.
# Delusional Disorder - Chronic.
As patient's presentation likely due to overdose of home seroquel, his seroquel was initially held on admission but re-started prior to discharge.
Prednisone and NSAIDs avoided in setting of pt's underlying psychiatric disorder and his recent gastritis, respectively.
# Rectal bleeding - Pt reported minor amounts of blood in his stool.
On exam, pt found to have external hemorrhoids.
# [**Name (NI) 5779**] - Pt's LFTs to 100s elevated on Sunday in the setting of recently increased statin dose.
Negative for Hepatitis B.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - Patient's seroquel level pending at the time of discharge and needs to be followed up as possible explanations of his mental status - Patient will need education about the importance of taking his medications regularly and only as prescribed - Pt should follow-up with neurology in one month with a follow-up MRI to evaluate her ischemic lesion - Patient will need monitoring of LFTs and renal function as outpatient  Medications on Admission: seroquel 50mg QHS simvastatin 20mg daily allopurinol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] vit D 1000u omeprazole 20mg daily colchicine 0.6mg prn Vitamin B12 250mg   Discharge Medications: 1.
Outpatient Radiology Pt needs a repeat MRI brain to evaluate his possible ischemic lesion seen on MRI in [**7-/2113**] 2.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: (Primary) Toxic metabolic encephalopathy secondary to Seroquel overdose Cerebrovascular accident in right medial temporal lobe [**Location (un) 5779**] (Secondary) Delusional Disorder Gout GERD Hearing loss   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
This medicine is important to control your delusional disorder but can make you dangerously sleepy if you take too much.
**  While you were here, you had an MRI of your brain which showed an area concerning for a stroke.
