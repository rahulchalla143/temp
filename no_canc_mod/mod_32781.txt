Moderately large right frontotemporal subgaleal hematoma without underlying skull fracture seen.
7-mm acute right frontotemporal, acute subdural hematoma and small bilateral intraventricular hemorrhages.
Large right lateral upper thigh hematoma with findings suggesting active extravasation.
Fluid surrounding the pancreas is concerning for pancreatitis.
Bowel injury is also a consideration in the trauma setting, but no bowel wall thickening or free air is seen.
Mild dilation of pancreatic duct without demonstrable obstructing mass is of uncertain significance.
Distended gallbladder which contains a couple of gallstones.
No CT evidence of wall thickening.
Minimal stranding along gallbladder base likely secondary to pancreatic process.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Repeat head CT scan [**2174-5-22**] IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right subdural hematoma and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Stable moderate ventriculomegaly, which may be related to cerebral atrophy, but a component of hydrocephalus cannot be excluded.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has moderate aortic stenosis.
Based on [**2170**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**12-3**] years.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
She underwent pelvic arteriogram because of gluteal hematoma and concern for active extravasation and decreasing hematocrit despite transfusions.
No extravasation, pseudoaneurysm or active arterial bleeding noted.
Geriatric Medicine and Cardiology were consulted for delirium and atrial fibrillation.
She has experienced ongoing issues with urinary retention and has required a Foley catheter.
There was an initial attempt at voiding trial and she was noted to retain >500 cc urine on bladder scan and therefore had the catheter replaced.
Physical therapy was consulted and has recommended rehab after her acute hospital stay.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML's PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: [**12-5**] Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 3548**] [**Doctor Last Name 3549**] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Fall Forehead laceration Subdural hematoma Right gluteal hematoma Atrial fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, tolerating a regular diet, pain adequately controlled.
Followup Instructions: Follow up in 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Trauma Surgery for evaluation of your gluteal hematoma.
Inform the office that you will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
