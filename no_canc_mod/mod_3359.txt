There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-2-28**], criteria for elevated LVEDP are not seen on the current study.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of large acute vascular territorial infarct.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Sphenoid sinus disease.
[**3-21**] Renal ultrasound: Increased echogenicity of the renal cortex consistent with medical renal disease.
No evidence for renal artery stenosis.
Labs on discharge: **************   Brief Hospital Course: 35 year old woman who is G7P4, status post C-section on [**2-28**] at 28 weeks for preeclampsia who presents with hypertensive urgency and acute renal failure.
# Hypertensive urgency:  Patient initially presented with SBP to 200s requiring labetalol drip and was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] initially.
She was evaluated by Ob/Gyn in whose assessment was that this is not consistent with post-partum preeclampsia and was likely unrelated to the pregnancy.
Renal ultrasound was negative for renal artery stenosis.
At the time of discharge she did not have any complaints of dizziness/lightheadedness, headache, vision changes or nausea.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Creatinine was up to 2.9 on this admission, up from 1.9 during the previous admission when she had c-section for preeclampsia.
Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
Renal consultants assessed the patient and renal failure was thought secondary to longstanding essential hypertension which was acutely worsened by her preeclampsia.
The patient has a strong family history of essential hypertension at young ages.
# Headache:  HTN urgency was contributing.
# Anemia: Likely due to renal insufficiency, recent C-section.
# Anxiety/Depression:  continued lexapro.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypertensive urgency Acute on chronic renal failure   Discharge Condition: Stable blood pressures, stable renal function.
You also had some dysfunction of your kidneys, and were followed by kidney doctors during your hospital course.
