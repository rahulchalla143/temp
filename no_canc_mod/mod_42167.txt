No fracture, malalignment or prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
Degenerative changes with mild spinal canal stenosis at C5-6.
Canal stenosis predisposes to cord injury in the setting of trauma.
Right adrenal hematoma.
Acute lateral right rib fractures 4 through 9.
Acute left rib fractures 3 and 4.
Old left rib fractures 3 through 6.
Displaced segmental fracture of femoral shaft.
Prepatellar soft tissue swelling.
There is a metallic plate and screws about the proximal tibia transfixing a previous fracture.
Intramedullary rod with distal screws is seen about an extensive fracture of the lower shaft of the femur.
The upper portion of this fracture cannot be seen and there is some apparent displacement of fracture fragments.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated aortic arch.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
he was then transferred to the Trauma ICU for diltiazem drip, pain control, pulmonary toilet and for close monitoring of his hematocrits given the adrenal hematoma noted on CT imaging.
Because of the dysrhythmia noted he underwent an ECHO which showed a normal EF and no VSD or pericardial effusion.
Orthopedics was consulted and he was taken to the operating room for ORIF right supracondylar femur fracture with intra-articular extension, retrograde nail right femoral shaft fracture and ORIF patella fracture.
There were no intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively he was noted with a hematocrit drop; his pre-op HCT was 29.3, postoperatively it was 27 and dropped to 22 without any hemodynamic instability.
It was explained to him at length that he required at least another 1-2 days in the hospital for ongoing monitoring of his hematocrit; for continued work with Physical and Occupational therapy and for optimal pain management.

Also you should return to the Emergency room if you experience fevers, chills, productive cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, increased swelling in your legs, redness or drainage from your incision and/or any otehr symptoms that are concerning to you.
