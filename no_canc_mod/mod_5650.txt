Admission Date:  [**2142-1-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-1-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2101-5-8**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 40 year-old female with a history of unstable angina.
She had presented with substernal chest pressure on exertion that began to occur at rest as well.
Given the degree of severity of the left main disease in the setting of the substernal chest pressure and unstable angina the patient was therefore scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft.
Off pump coronary artery bypass graft was done secondary to the fact that the patient has a history of nephrotic syndrome and was at risk for coagulopathy, stroke, etc.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hepatitis B and C treated with interferon.
Cryoglobulinemia as well as nephrotic syndrome.
She does have a history of chronic low back pain and is on Roxicet chronically and there is a question of past history of intravenous drug abuse.
Therefore given the proximity to the Operating Room her chest was immediately opened to rule out any tamponade physiology from anastomotic leak or bleed.
It was found that she did have blood in the pericardial space.
The intraoperative findings were significant for a dissected left internal mammary coronary artery graft.
Her Swan-Ganz catheter was left in place for hemodynamic monitoring.
Chest x-ray on postoperative day one had shown patchy infiltrates with a right pleural effusion.
At this point she was being maintained on a morphine PCA with Toradol and Percocet for breakthrough pain.
Given her chronic opioid dependence she did have significant issues of tolerance and therefore was ultimately referred to the Acute Pain Service who had recommended to use Oxycodone 20 mg po q 3 to 4 hours prn as well as morphine sulfate intermediate release 15 mg po b.i.d.
Electrocardiogram was done at that time, which showed no significant changes for ischemia or infarction.
No dysrhythmia.
Her chest x-ray at that time additionally showed a left pleural effusion.
The right pleural effusion was stable.
The left pleural effusion was somewhat new.
There was also evidence of a loculated retrosternal collection in the right upper hemithorax, however, this was stable.
Her vital signs remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout her entire hospital course once she was out of the Intensive Care Unit setting.
The patient's vital signs at the time of discharge, she was afebrile with a temperature maximum of 99.0, pulse 70 and sinus, 123/68 blood pressure, 97% on room air saturation.
She was in no acute distress.
There was no erythema or exudate.
Her lungs were clear with decreased breath sounds left greater then right.
No crackles were present.
She had palpable pulses distally in the dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse bilaterally.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Unstable angina status post off pump coronary artery bypass graft followed by redo coronary artery bypass graft on the night of surgery for V tach/V fibrillation arrest.
