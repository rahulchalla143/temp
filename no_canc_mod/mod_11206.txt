Chest X-ray  showed multilobular consolidation.
CT-A showed no PE or obstructive bronchial lesion, but central bilateral consolidation secondary to pneumonia and CHF was noted.

Multilobar consolidation, which could reflect asymmetrical edema and/or multilobar pneumonia.
A postobstructive process in the right middle lobe cannot be excluded.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
No parenchymal mass lesion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
No acute pulmonary embolus.
Central bilateral consolidation mainly along the inferior hilar regions with patchy areas of consolidation in the upper and lower lobes.
Enlargement of the central arterial pulmonary vasculature and mild cardiac enlargement suggestive of background pulmonary hypertension.
Small bibasilar pleural effusions.
These findings may all be due to cardiac failure with pulmonary hypertension.
Infective consolidation should be also considered depending on the current clinical correlation.
On exam the patient had rhonchorous breath sounds, difficulty mobilizing her secretions.
Despite improvement in her O2 sats, the patient continued to have labored breathing.
The patient became tachypneic breathing at an average rate of 30.
She had one episode of desaturation to the 80s which did not resolve after one minute.
CXR showed mucus plugging of the entire left lung.
Leukocytosis: Pt's leukocytosis was likely [**2-2**] to pneumonia and UTI.

Hemoptysis: Pt had episodes of hemoptysis on the floor, but not in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Chest pain: Pt had episodes of fleeting, pleuritic chest pain on the floor, with Trop 0.10, which was likely due to renal insufficiency.
The family and patient agreed not to have any intervention for any possible cardiac issues.
Acute renal failure: Pt's acute renal failure was likely due to a dye load with the CT. Cr improved with fluids.
CHF: Pt had evidence of CHF on CXR, with trace edema on the posterior aspect of her legs.
