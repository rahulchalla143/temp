Admission Date:  [**2185-6-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-7-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-7-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Flagyl / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Keflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: Bright red blood per ostomy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 61 year old male with past medical history significant for rectal cancer s/p LAR with end colostomy ([**2174**])and XRT, CAD s/p CABG ([**2172**]), CHF (EF=25%) s/p placement of PPM, HTN and DM who presents to ED with complaints of bloody output from ostomy accompanied by dizziness.
He denies however any associated chest pain or shortness or breath.
The patient reports that he takes aspirin daily, which he has been doing for 10+ years, but otherwise has not added any additional NSAIDs or anti-platelet drugs to his daily regimen.
The patient reports that he has been eating and drinking well at home without any associated nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain currently.
However, the patient does reports dull abomdinal pain for 1-2 days preceeding the current episode.
In the ED, the patient was evaluated and a gastric lavage was negative for acute bleeding.
Since his presentation to the ED to his evaluation by surgery, the patient had decreased bloody output and more normal appearing stool.
The decision was made at that time to admit the patient to medicine, assess the patient again in the morning, and make possible plans for colonoscopy.
In the evening, around 8:00 pm, the patient again began to have bloody output, with 425cc documented in the ED nursing chart.
The patient reported that he still felt lightheaded, but denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.

Chronic draining sacral ulcer   Social History: Social History: Pt is a retired elctronic engineer.
Anicteric sclera.

Pertinent Results: [**2185-6-13**] CXR - No evidence of congestive heart failure [**2185-6-15**] ECHO - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe hypokinesis of the inferior and lateral walls including the apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2185-6-20**] LE Doppler (R) - No deep venous thrombosis within the right common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, or popliteal veins [**2185-6-21**] GI Bleeding Study - No evidence of active bleeding.
[**2185-6-21**] UGI SGL W/ SBFT - No reason for bleeding identified in this study.
[**2185-6-27**] GI Bledding Study - No evidence of active bleeding [**2185-6-28**] CXR - Interval development of congestive heart failure with perihilar and basilar edema and new small right pleural effusion.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There is minimal upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
There is a small-to-moderate right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Aside from the right base, no focal infiltrate is identified.
There is mild diffuse parenchymal scarring.
Compared with [**2185-6-13**], the right pleural effusion is new.
[**2185-7-4**] CXR - There has been interval right thoracentesis with near complete resolution of a previously noted right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is identified, and there is otherwise no significant change since the recent chest radiograph of 1 day earlier.
[**2185-7-4**] Pleural Fluid - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2185-7-7**]): NO GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
He was in and out of the MICU for an episode of active bleeding and was then sent out to the floor again on [**2185-6-16**].
The night float resident was called to the floor on the evening of [**6-26**] due to a finding of 300 cc of BRB in the ostomy bag - MICU evaluation was called - pt found to have bled a total of 550 cc by 1 am [**6-27**], although he remained hemodynamically stable.
On evaluation by the MICU resident, he was initially found to have a pressure in the 140's, and a HR in the 80's, although he is on a beta blocker.
Additionally, he complained of syptoms of dizziness and was transported to the MICU expeditiously.
Colonoscopy reveals some angiodysplasia and laceration in ostomy.
So far, however, no active bleeding detected by EGD, colonoscopy, or tagged red blood cell scan.
This was likely prerenal secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of active GI bleeding.
CHF - The patient has a history of CHF, but on admission had denied any SOB and a CXR had shown no signs of fluid overload.
After the patients episode of active bleeding and time in the MICU, the patient became fluid overloaded, secondary to aggressive fluid resusitation and s/p 10 units of PRBC.
A subsequent CXR showed: "Interval development of congestive heart failure with perihilar and basilar edema and new small right pleural effusion."
The patient was still having SOB so a subsequent CXR was ordered.
It showed a worsening pleural effusion.
The pleural effusion was tapped and the patient was continued on lasix.
