Admission Date:  [**2132-2-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-2-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-8-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: Seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Puncture  History of Present Illness: The pt is a 39 year-old right-handed M who presented with confusion and agitation to [**Hospital3 **] today after an apparent generalized seizure.
He was seen to lose consciousness, foam at the mouth, then stiffen and shake all over for 1-2 minutes, followed by an extended period of confusion and drowsiness.
He then saw a neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37270**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 77974**]), but the diagnosis of seizure was left uncertain and he was again not treated.
This event, like the others, was associated with amnesia for what had happened on the part of the patient.
He is currently taking 50mg [**Hospital1 **] and no other anticonvulsants.
He had no adventitious movements at this time.
He seemed "zoned out" and was moving his head around aimlessly.
He then suddenly lost consciousness, began to foam at the mouth, stiffened and shook, with no apparent focal onset of motor activity.
Per his wife, he had a normal birth and developmental history, with no other history of seizures, febrile or otherwise.
Physical Exam: VS 98.0 96-120 126/59 12 100% Gen intubated, NAD HEENT NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Lungs CTA bilaterally CV RRR, nl S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abd soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted Ext No C/C/E b/l Skin no rashes or lesions noted  NEURO MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] briefly, he opens his eyes to noxious stimuli.
Does not track or follow commands.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
No overt facial asymmetry.
No asterixis noted.
No myoclonus noted.
Pertinent Results: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording the background consisted of low voltage fast beta frequency activity.
There were no areas of  prominent focal slowing.
There were no epileptiform features.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the abnormal  background consisting of low voltage fast beta frequency activity.
This likely reflects medication effect from benzodiazepine or barbiturate administration.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing.
There were no epileptiform features.
No electrographic seizure activity was noted.

Neurologic exam on arrival present was reassuring for minimal sedation and intact brainstem reflexes and no asymmetry on exam.
The likely cause of his seizure was inadequate coverage with anticonvulsants.
1) Seizure Disorder- There were no signs of infection or other triggering event.
The patient was noted to have CK ~6,000 the evening of admission with low grade temperature of 100.5.
Report and images were obtained and without evidence of abnormality.
Routine EEG with mini-sphenoidal electrodes was performed showing generalized slowing with fast Beta, but no asymmetry or epileptiform discharges.
2) Elevated CK's- Likely secondary to seizure and large (35mg) dose of haloperidol given at outside hospital.
His TSH was also notably elevated to 23.
3) Elevated TSH- Notably elevated to 23.
