No comparison images are available to assess for interval change.
Head CT [**1-3**]: IMPRESSION: Status post evacuation of right-sided subdural hematoma with small amount of high-density blood remaining layering posteriorly.
There is significant decrease mass effect with resolution of right uncal herniation and decreased compression on the right lateral ventricle.
Decreased leftward subfalcine herniation.
Head CT [**1-15**]: FINDINGS: Heterogeneous fluid collection and subdural hematoma in the right frontoparietal convexity is stable to slightly increased in size compared to prior study.
No shift of midline structures is noted.
Unchanged intraventricular component of hemorrhage in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle is identified.
There is no new hemorrhage.
Post-surgical changes in the right frontal region, small pneumocephalus and craniotomy again identified.
Bilateral lower lobe interstitial promenince and linear opacities of uncertain chronicity.
Without prior studies, infection cannot be excluded, although the findings may reflect a chronic process.
Small pericardial effusion.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
CT Head +/- [**1-18**]: FINDINGS: The frontal component of the hypodense right subdural collection appears stable measuring 13.5 mm in maximal transverse dimension.
Its isodense occipital component is more conspicuous on the postcontrast images of this study compared to the noncontrast images of this and the previous studies.
The hyperdense epidural collection underlying the right frontal/parietal craniotomy is slightly smaller.
The overlying right subgaleal collection is also slightly smaller.
Enhancement along the dura underlying the craniotomy and along the subgaleal collection is expected in the post- operative setting, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded by imaging.There is no new hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or evidence of a major vascular infarct.
Configuration and size of ventricles is unchanged from prior studies, with partial effacement of the right lateral ventricle.
LENIS [**1-13**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
CT Head [**1-25**]: Considering technical differences the right frontal and right occipital extra-axial fluid accumulation is relatively unchanged in size measuring approximately 13 mm in the right frontal region and 12 mm in right occipital region.
No new focus of hemorrhage is noted.
No infarction or new mass effect is noted.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent consistent with involutional changes.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged size of right frontal and right occipital subdural fluid accumulation with interval evolution of blood products within the right frontal region.
There is no new focus of hemorrhage.
There is a similar mild mass effect exerted on the right frontal and occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] ventricles.
There is no midline shift.
On non-contrast-enhanced images, there is slight asymmetry of the superior sagittal sinus as demonstrated on prior MR from [**2144**] (outside study).
There is no abnormal enhancing lesion.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged size of right frontal and occipital subdural fluid collection consistent with subacute/chronic subdural hematoma.
The patient was not doing well with swallowing and a dophoff was placed for tube feedings.
On [**1-10**] there appeared to be a fluid collection in the subgaleal space where the prior surgery was done.
The patient had low grade fevers.
The patient had tachypnea into the 30s while on the floor and was transferred back to the ICU for respiratory distress.
On [**1-24**] the patient was transfused due to low crit and hypotension.
On [**1-27**] the patient was reintubated for continued tachpnea and respiratory distress.
On [**2-2**] a repeat head CT was stable with no obvious fluid collection.
The patient is on amiodarone for recent a-flutter.
