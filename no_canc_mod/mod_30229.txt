The patient is followed by ID and had been diagnosed with sinusitis earlier in the week and was started on Levofloxacin.
The headaches continued and she presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**10-4**] and was given compazine and some pain killers and discharged.
On returning to the  ED, she was found to have bilateral marked papilledema; a head CT was consistent with significant global edema with marked sulcal effacement and ventricular narrowing as well as swelling adjacent to the basal cisterns.
No diplopia, difficulty with speech or swallowing, weakness, numbness, dizziness, vertigo.
Denies f/c/s/d, chest pain, palpitations, constipation, weight loss or gain, blurry vision.
Physical Exam: PE: Gen WD WN [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] NAD HEENT AT/NC, MMM no lesions Neck Supple, no thyromegaly, no [**Doctor First Name **], no bruits Chest CTA B CVS RRR w/o MGR ABD soft, NTND, + BS EXT no C/C/E.
no rashes or petechiae  Neuro MS: AA&Ox3, appropriately interactive, normal affect, normal fund of knowledge, normal insight Attention: WORLD forward and backwards Language: fluent without paraphrasic errors.
Memory: [**2-17**] at 5 minutes L/R confusion: No L/R confusion Praxis: Able to mimic brushing teeth with either hand.
CN: I--not tested; II,III-PERRLA, VFF by confrontation, bilateral papilledema; III,IV,VI-EOMI w/o nystagmus, no ptosis; V--sensation intact to LT/PP, masseters strong symmetrically; VII-no facial asymmetry, muscles of facial expression strong; VIII-hears finger rub bilaterally; IX,X--voice normal, palate elevates symmetrically, uvula midline, gag intact; [**Doctor First Name 81**]-- SCM/trapezii [**4-21**]; XII--tongue protrudes midline, no atrophy or fasciculation.
Motor: normal bulk and tone, mild LEFT hand postural tremor @high frequency, rigidity or bradykinesia, no pronator drift.
No evidence of extinction.
Gait: Not tested   Pertinent Results: IMAGING: [**2107-10-6**] Head CT: FINDINGS: There is evidence of swelling or filling of the sulci with isodense material.
There is also effacement of the CSF spaces at the level of the foramen magnum, suspicious for tonsillar herniation.
No acute hemorrhage or evidence of midline shift is identified.
Osseous windows reveal no acute fractures or bony abnormalities.
There is mucosal thickening within the ethmoid sinuses and a likely mucus retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus.
Trace amount of opacification is seen within the right mastoid air cell.
Thus the possibilities include brain swelling or meningitis.
[**2107-10-7**] MRI/MRA/MRV of Brain with Contrast: 1.
Diffuse abnormal T2 signal within the white matter and some areas of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, associated with sulcal effacement.
Imaging findings are most consistent with brain edema that may be related to an infectious or inflammatory condition, although, clinical correlation is necessary.
[**Doctor Last Name **] downward displacement of cerebellar tonsils.
This is likely secondary to cerebellar edema, and though the amount has progressed since the prior MR of the cervical spine from [**Month (only) **] [**2103**], the supracerebellar cistern remains patent.
[**2107-10-18**] MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM: There appears to be a slight improvement in the extent of the abnormal T2 signal hyperintensity throughout the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
There are no new areas of abnormal enhancement or focal lesions.
Visualized paranasal sinuses are clear, with the exception of minor areas of high T2 signal within the posterior aspects of both mastoid processes, which is unchanged since the prior study.
IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in extent of abnormal T2 signal hyperintensity throughout both cerebral hemispheres.
No new abnormal enhancement.
NEURO: CT imaging showed limited sinus disease, but marked diffuse cerebral edema.
The question of edema secondary to infection (although she did not look toxic and had a negative Brudzinski) was addressed, as well as venous sinus thrombosis (secondary to a sinus infection), and metastatic processes.
Neurosurgery was consulted in case intervention became necessary, and the patient was admitted to the ICU with neurochecks q 1 hr.
Her HAART therapy on admission was continued with the addition of ampicillin, and urine, sputum, and blood cx's were sent.
On [**10-7**], the patient continued to have frontal and parietal signs, along with papilledema.
MRI revealed diffuse T2 signal abnormality and 8mm downward displacement of cerebellar tonsils.
Given the high level of concern for CNS infection, and after discussion with ID and neurosurgery, it was decided that an LP was necessary.
A repeat MRI was performed first, and showed no progression of edema and no change in the level of the cerebellar tonsils.
Gram stain was negative for bacteria or poly's.
There was some concern that this represented HIV meningoencephalitis, but was not thought to be a definite explanation for her cerebral edema.
During the course of the admission Ms. [**Known lastname **] neurologic exam remained non-focal, with some mild difficulties with executive function.
Her repeat MRI on [**10-19**] showed improvement in the edema and white matter changes.
Ultimately, no definitive etiology was found for her cerebral edema, although it is suspected to have been infectious in nature (HIV versus other infection).
Following tests were sent on [**10-7**]: HCV Ab, Cryptococcal Ag negative, VZV IgG positive, CMV IgG positive and IgM negative, EBV IgG positive and IgM negative, Toxo Ab negative, Lyme serology negative, RPR negative, Mycoplasma Ab negative for acute infection.
Ophthalmology was consulted on [**10-13**] and found no evidence of CMV, toxoplasmosis, PC choroidopathy, or lymphoma.
Abacavir has a risk of rash but this did not occur during the admission.
PSYCH:  Unfortunately, although Ms. [**Known lastname 1313**] had been doing quite well neurologically after her steroid wean, she became progressively more anxious and agitated during the weekend of [**11-13**], and by the morning of [**10-17**] was reporting hearing voices, obsessing about the Bible, and wandering about agitatedly.
Psychiatry was consulted and thought this could be related to a steroid psychosis, although its coincidence with the wean of the steroids was a bit atypical.
The patient had no prior history of psychiatric illness, except some mild depression.
On the morning of [**10-19**] Ms. [**Known lastname 1313**] again became acutely psychotic, now reporting that she heard a voice commanding her to harm herself, randomly calling relatives and telling them "you're Satan", and repeatedly shouting for [**Doctor Last Name 2319**].
An EEG was obtained due to concern for temporal lobe epilepsy and revealed no epileptiform activity.
On [**10-20**] she was quite calm and seemed to be doing well during the day, but that night she awoke with nightmares and began walking outside her room and screaming.
