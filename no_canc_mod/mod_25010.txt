On arrival to MICU, patient is intubated and sedated, not responding to stimulation or comands.
Respiratory failure requiring intubation, followed by failure to wean, requiring tracheostomy.

There are low lung volumes.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There is mild vascular congestion.
There are minimal atelectases in the right lower lobe.
If any, there is a small right pleural effusion.
woman w/ a history of post-intubation tracheal stenosis, s/p multiple IP procedures, who presented with dislodged tracheostomy tube now POD1 s/p percutaneous tracheostomy tube placement.
Attempts were made to dilate the stoma and place the tracheostomy tube under the guidance of fiberoptic bronchoscopy but it was unable to be placed.
Thus, in the OR she was intubated for airway protection in preparation for another attempt w/ a rigid bronchoscopy the next day.
She also became agitated after the procedure, requiring restraints, Zyprexa, and lorazepam.
However, the next morning, she was calm and cooperative and was able to be taken off the ventilator and transitioned to 10L high-flow O2 for her trach.
#Hypokalemia: She developed hypokalemia (K 3.3) in the post-op setting.
#Hypophosphatemia: She developed hypophosphatemia (2.4) in the post-op setting.
#Leukocytosis: She developed leukocytosis to 13.2 on POD1.
It is c/w her leukocytosis she developed in the past in the same setting.
There was minimal blood loss during the procedure, but there was low concern for any active bleeds.
She did receive several L NS in between these readings, which may have contributed to the decreased Hct, w/ her procedure causing an acute rise in platelets and WBC, keeping all cell lines from being down.
# CAD/Hypertension: She was continued on home lisinopril, labetalol, amlodipine, aspirin and atorvastatin until she was post-op, at which time these medications were held since she did not have an NG/OG tube in place in anticipation of a quick wean off the ventilator.
She had clonazepam and lorazepam held while sedated prior to procedure.
