The mid and distal superficial femoral veins on the left showed no evidence of thrombus.
No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
A small pulmonary AV shunt is probably present.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small, loculated (apical) pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits on the surface of the heart.. .
Very large bowel-containing right inguinal/scrotal hernia without evidence of obstruction or ischemia.
Thickening of the bladder wall with possible intraluminal blood clots.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion.
No intraabdominal mass or lymphadenopathy.
BLADDER ULTRASOUND STUDY ([**11-24**]):  Numerous images of the bladder demonstrate a diffusely abnormal wall with irregular thickness and contour, predominantly on the anterior aspect.
Some areas of the irregularly thickened anterior wall demonstrate increased vascularity.
There is echogenic fluid in the bladder with debris seen in the dependent portion, some of which is mobile.
IMPRESSION:  Irregularly thickened bladder wall, most pronounced anteriorly with small areas of increased vascularity.
CT head without contrast ([**11-26**]): FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
There are areas of low attenuation within the periventricular white matter, most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic change.
There are no fractures.
IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage.
No mass effect.
TTE ([**12-26**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

There is no pericardial effusion.
Urine cytology ([**1-12**]): NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

Brief Hospital Course: 78M with no known past medical history originally p/w CP & SOB, found to have saddle PEs, ARF, and urinary retention.
Patient arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED from [**Location (un) 620**] with known bilateral saddle pulmonary emboli.
He was continued on heparin, started on IV fluids, and transferred to the CCU given evidence of heart failure on echo (EF 25%, RV dysfunction).
An US of his lower extremities showed a clot in his left common femoral vein.
On day 2 of his hospital course, a removable IVC Filter was placed successfully without complications.
The patient developed agitation and delerium, threatened to leave AMA, but was deemed not competent to make medical decisions.
Course on the floor as follows:  #) Bilateral saddle PEs: Presented with CP and SOB, found to have bilateral PEs and DVT with evidence of heart failure and RV dysfunction.
Anticoagulated with heparin and then coumadin briefly but then d/c'd coumadin in favor of lovenox as planned for inpaitent cystoscopy for malignancy workup (see below).
Following resolution of the acute issues, he has remained hemodynamically stable with no respiratory complaints.
Discussed removal of IVC filter with IR but they believe high likelihood of failure and procedural risks so deferred.
Likely etiology was toxic-metabolic [**1-24**] acute illness and urinary infection in the setting of chronic dementia.
Improved somewhat with resolution of acute medical problems but not completely.
Psychiatry was consulted and the patient was started on standing haldol [**Hospital1 **] with improvement and resolution of his agitation.
He required a 1:1 sitter due to flight risk and occasional agitation.
#) Urology: UTI, urinary retention, acute renal failure, abnormal bladder ultrasound.
His Foley catheter was removed, but patient developed urinary retention with drainage of 1.4L from his bladder.
Renal failure was likely post-renal due to obstruction and resolved with drainage of bladder.
The foley was initially left in place due to the difficulty of placement and the fact that he was asymptomatic; he was continued on ciprofloxacin, but he developed symptoms of bladder irritation on [**1-20**].
Repeat urine culture grew pseudomonas resistant to quinolones and MRSA.
Also found to have bladder U/S with irregular wall thickening.
Concern was for malignancy, however urine cytology was negative and the patient underwent cystoscopy on [**2172-1-24**] which revealed no evidence of malignancy.
#) Malignancy screening: Given hypercoagulability, initiated cancer screening as possible etiology.
Abdominal/pelvic CT was notable for a thickened bladder wall and further followed up with a bladder US that confirmed the finding.
Chest CT at presentation showed bibasilar nodular densities in the setting of bilat PEs, and repeat study revealed that these had completely resolved.
However, an indicental finding of hypoattenuating liver lesion was noted that should be followed up with MRI per radiology as an outpatient.
#) Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 222 on arrival, and noted slow downward progression during initial hospital course with nadir in low 100s.
Possibly [**1-24**] consumption for underlying blood clots, but not clear.
Discontinued protonix secondary to small likelihood that PPI/H2 blockers cause thrombocytopenia.
#) Cardiac: No known CAD and on no cardiac meds at home.
No further issues.
#) Scrotal hernia:  Large scrotal hernia noted on exam, althogh patient asymptomatic.
No evidence of incarceration, volvulus.
Patient declining eval for herniorraphy and given no symptoms unlikely need at this time.

You were found to have a possible abnormality in your liver.
You will need to be accompanied by an attendant or your guardian.
