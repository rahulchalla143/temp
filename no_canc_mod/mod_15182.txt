30% EF) who was in usual state of health until 1 wk PTA developed URI symptoms of cough, rhinorrhea, mild neck pain.
Was improving but 3 days PTA he developed increasing confusion, more severe neck pain, headache and fever.
Past Medical History: DM-2 AVR ([**Hospital3 9642**], [**2146**]) CAD HTN hypercholesterolemia hypothyroidism chronic back pain - spinal stenosis (s/p back surgery [**2147**]) COPD, OSA on CPAP and home O2 Restless Leg Syndrome  Social History: married lives at home, has 2 daughters.
Transferred to MICU where he was intubated for increasing respiratory distress.
Became hypotensive --> pressors.
Repeat head CT on [**5-18**] and then on [**5-26**] demonstrated same nonenhancing lesion unchanged from [**5-16**] involving the cerebellar peduncle with some extension into the pons.
TEE was performed twice with no demonstration of any vegetations.
The patient remained mildly febrile with a normal WBC until he was switched from CTX to PCN G 4MU q4h after which his fever dissipated.
DELERIUM: On the floor remained delerious but with slow improvement.
The etiology of his delerium was felt to be secondary to toxic-metabolic enchephalopathy (sepsis, CNS toxic drugs), and ICU psychosis.
CNS toxic agents were held, low dose risperidone 0.5 mg qhs was started to help reinstate an appropriate sleep-wake cycle, and ropinirole was given to minimize periodic leg movements (restless leg syndrome).
He remained with good cardiac function without any evidence of heart failure albeit on minimal activity.
No significant changes in mumur characteristics or conduction were noted.
COPD, OSA on BIPAP: It was felt that the patient's respiratory distress was compounded by the patient's underlying chronic lung disease.
CEREBELLAR INFARCT, septic embolus: Mr. [**Known lastname 52461**] remained ataxic on his left side with a wide step gait and headaches at the base of his skull/neck.
Serial CTs of the head with contrast demonstrated normal evolution of the infarct without evidence of a cerebellar abscess.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE At the end of his hospital stay, Mr. [**Known lastname 52461**] developed acute renal failure secondary to dehydration (based on calculated FENa = 0.8%, physical exam findings consistent with dehydration and reversal of rising Cr with rehydration).
He was treated with increased PO fluid intake and IVF.
His LISINOPRIL, LASIX, AND METFORMIN were held pending normalization of his renal function.
: Lasix 80mg PO qd, lisinopril 5 mg PO qd, and metformin 500mg PO BID were held while patient was in acute renal failure due to dehydrattion.
Please contact his primary care physcian and see "Hospital Course Section - ACUTE RENAL FAILURE" before restarting these medications.
