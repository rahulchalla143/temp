MODERATE GROWTH.
Confirmation should be requested in cases of treatment failure in          life-threatening infections..  [**5-26**] Urine legionella Ag: Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2161-5-27**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
[**5-26**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Right lung opacities with possible small left lower lung opacity, raising concern for multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
In the setting of trauma, pulmonary hemorrhage/contusion or aspiration not excluded.
No acute fracture with minimal retrolisthesis of C3 on C4 which is most likely degenerative in etiology, although of indeterminate ge.
Multilevel degenerative change with posterior disc osteophyte complex at C5-C6 causing mild-to-moderate spinal canal narrowing.
If clinical concern exists for cervical cord injury, consider MRI if no contraindication.
Partially imaged right lung consolidation may be due to infection and extent better assessed on accompanying chest radiograph.
[**5-26**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Improved, but persistent multifocal pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 46742**] is an 87 year old man with a PMHx significant for idiopathic capillary leak syndrome, moderate AS, and recent pneumonia with RML abscess who presented to the ED s/p a fall and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with PNA and hypoxemia.
His stay was complicated by acute kidney injury which resolved over course of admission  # Pneumonia and hypoxemia: Mr. [**Known lastname 46742**] presented to the ED on [**5-26**] following a fall from standing.
CXR performed on admission demonstrated a multifocal pneumonia.
Sputum cx grew H. influenzae and was trated with empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn which was changed for oral Amoxicillin on [**2161-6-2**].
With his baseline creatine of 0.7, cachectic body habitus, and physical exam consistent with volume depletion, this was thought to represent prerenal azotemia.
#Aspiration: Given recurrent pneumonias including abscess it was felt pneumonias were likely to be related to aspiration.
However, speech pathologist evaluation on [**2161-6-2**] did not show any evidnce of dysphagia or aspiration, so he was changed to a regular diet.
#Lung nodule: Patient was found to have persistent GGOs on chest CT performed in mid [**Month (only) **] compared to CT in [**Month (only) 547**].
Medications on Admission: Omeprazole 20mg po daily Detrol LA 4mg po daily  Discharge Medications: Detrol LA not restarted as patient had difficulty voiding during hospital stay.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of shortness of breath and kidney failure.
