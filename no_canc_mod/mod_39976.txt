She was discharged to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital and returns on [**6-20**] with hypertension, fever and pus draining from her right internal jugular catheter, which is being used for chronic total parenteral nutrition.
Several deep venous thromboses status post [**Location (un) 260**] filter.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Chronic abdominal pain.
General, jaundiced woman lying supine in no acute distress.
Oropharynx dry with dry mucous membranes and dried blood on her tongue.
No jugulovenous distention.
Cardiovascular tachycardic, irregular, III/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border radiating to the axilla.
No rubs or gallops.
Lungs decreased breath sounds right lower lobe.
Abdomen:  She has a two prominent fistula sites both midline and infraumbilical.
The fistula is draining a large amount of bilious guaiac positive fluid.
There is no rebound or guarding.
She had 2+ pitting edema in bilateral feet.
No facial asymmetry.
The patient had urine cultures times two from Foley specimen both showing multiple species of bacteria consistent with fecal contamination.
The patient had an echocardiogram of the heart which demonstrated an ejection fraction of roughly 75% with no vegetations.
The patient also had a renal ultrasound that showed a right kidney at 13.9 cm, left kidney 10.5 cm, no evidence of hydro or stones.
Clinically limited due to body habitus.
The patient's electrocardiogram on admission was notable for sinus tachycardia at 108, normal axis and normal intervals, biphasic T waves in V4 and V5.
No ischemic changes.
She had a chest x-ray, which showed no pulmonary vascular congestion, effusions or pneumothorax.
There was a persistent hazy opacity at the right base improved in the interval with atelectasis versus infiltrate with a differential diagnosis.
Infectious disease:  The patient presented with hypertension and a systolic blood pressure of 80 and a fever of 103.4.
She was subsequently grew Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus from her right IJ site and blood bottle.
After two days she became afebrile and her norepinephrine drip was weaned.
She also grew out fecal organisms in her urine, suspect a Foley specimen likely from enterovesicular fistula.
She should not receive antibiotics through the course unless culture data demonstrates infections with persistent colonization.
Cardiovascular:  The patient's hypertension resolved after two days of antibiotics and support with norepinephrine.
Her blood pressure remained around 95/40 likely due to her underlying liver disease.
However, at this blood pressure the patient had persistent urine output at greater then 30 cc an hour.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had multiple recurrent high output enterocutaneous fistula now with a new enterovesicular fistula, not a surgical candidate.
She requires chronic total parenteral nutrition and intravenous fluids to keep up the high output of her fistula.
She has a history of cirrhosis which is unclear.
The patient also has chronic abdominal pain and was continued on her prior dose of Dilaudid 2 mg q 2 to 4 hours prn for pain.
Her abdominal pain was stable during her hospital stay and no further workup was initiated.
Renal:  The patient presented with acute renal failure and was seen by the renal service who felt this was primary due to ATN from her hypertension.
Her creatinine remained elevated above her baseline and at discharge was 1.9.
However, there is no indication for hemodialysis.
Enterocutaneous enterovesicular fistulas.
Acute renal failure.
