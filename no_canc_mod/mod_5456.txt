assault vs. suicide found to be in rhabdomyolysis, w/ decreased UOP, transaminitis, and b/l basal ganglia infarcts  Rhabdomyolysis - Pt had markedly elevated CKs upon admission to the MICU.
Surprisingly, her renal function was never markedly compromised despite the elevatd CKs  Transaminitis - The patients' LFTs were also markedly elevated upon hospitalization.
There was some thought that the elevated transaminases could have been the result of rhabdomyolysis, however her INR was also elevated impaired hepatic function.
Hepatitis serologies were also sent and showed no acute infectious process.
Basal Ganglia Infarcts - Patient was found to have bilateral basal ganglia infarcts of unclear age.
Neurology was consulted and they commented that the infarcts could be from either toxic or anoxic injury.
The patient had an EEG study to evaluate the possibilty of a seizure focus, given the unclear circumstances of her condition before hospitalization and the past report of seizures.
EEG showed some slowing consistent with a toxic metabolic process.
However she did have some residual cognitive defecits upon repeated examinations by neurology and psychiatry.
Also she had limited recall of the events at home.
Ulnar neuropathy - the patient had some decreased sensation of her left upper extremity thought to be secondary to compression from being down for an extended period of time.
This treatment was initiated specifically because there was a question of assualt with no other information.
She will require a one month treatment of the Combivir and will then need a followup HIV test.
