HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 43 year-old male with history of HCV and cirrhosis on transplant list who now presents for liver transplant.
Patient has had several admissions including the most recent on [**2192-10-8**] during which time a TIPS procedure was performed for diuretic resistant ascites and hyponatremia which has helped in control of his ascites.
But eventually he became jaundiced with the bilirubin rising to 11.
The patient was notified on [**2192-10-30**] that there was a potential liver transplant.
The patient has no episodes of confusion although his wife does say that he is somewhat drowsy and sleeps quite a bit.
His abdominal pain has improved.
His abdominal distention and ankle edema has improved too.
Patient has no recent fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.
- t.i.d., Senna, Colace, Gas-Ex, calcium, vitamin D.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is married with three children, no tobacco.
Abdomen distended but nontender.
No organomegaly palpated.
No fluid wave.
Patient had an orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant (piggyback, portal vein, portal vein anastomosis, common hepatic artery (recipient to common hepatic donor, common bile duct - common bile duct anastomosis over a French T tube performed by [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24748**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and [**Doctor Last Name **].
Patient had a central line, triple lumen placed.
Postoperative day #1 patient did have a duplex liver ultrasound demonstrating unremarkable hepatic vasculature and transplanted liver perfusion on the right.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted because of steroid-induced diabetes mellitus and had followed patient while patient was an inpatient.
On [**2192-11-9**] patient had a postoperative T tube cholangiogram that demonstrated that there was no evidence of extravasation.
Luminal narrowing of the anastomosis with delayed passage of contrast which could be secondary to postoperative edema.
One of the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains because of decreased output was removed.
On postoperative day 7 the second [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain was removed because of no output.
Patient's liver function tests were slightly elevated after capping T tube.
A duplex ultrasound was performed on [**2192-11-12**] because of slightly elevated liver function tests demonstrating that there was a 5 x 5.8 x 3.5 fluid collection adjacent to the right lobe consistent with a biloma.
2) There was dilation of the common bile duct, common hepatic duct and central intrahepatic duct consistent with a substantial obstruction/stenosis.
Nonspecific bowel gas patterns which could represent     ileus with many air fluid levels.
CT of the abdomen was     obtained the following day on [**2192-11-13**]     demonstrating there is mild central intrahepatic biliary     ductal dilatation and the common duct measures 11 mm to     the level of the T tube.
Ascites fluid within the abdomen greatest inferior to the     right lobe of the liver.
No discrete fluid collection is     identified.
There is also fluid adjacent to the spleen     within the lesser sac and within the pelvis.
5 Minimal right basilar atelectasis.
This prompted to have a T tube cholangiogram which demonstrated that there was post liver transplant T tube cholangiogram demonstrated filling of the native common bile duct and no opacification of the transplant biliary tree.
Filling of the right and possible also left intrahepatic bile duct in Trendelenburg position demonstrates normal appearing intrahepatic bile duct.
Patient had increased amount of stool and placed originally on Flagyl, then this was discontinued, but on [**2192-11-17**] because he was having increased stool on tube feeds and although multiple stool cultures were obtained which demonstrated that there was no C difficile, but because he improved clinically with his stools with the frequency of loose stools lessened with Flagyl, it was decided to place him back on Flagyl.
Patient is to call transplant surgery immediately at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, increase in abdominal birth.
To call if there is any change in the incision any discharge to the incision.
Also notify transplant if he has difficulty with appetite, urination or bowel movements.
HCV cirrhosis, status post liver transplant [**2192-11-4**].
Steroid induced hyperglycemia.
Chronic hyponatremia.
