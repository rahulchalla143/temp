The patient reports a history of a myocardial infarction appropriately 10 years ago with occasional chest discomfort.
Hypertension 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Status post myocardial infarction approximately 10 years ago 5.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 7.
Chronic back pain 8.
Status post multiple CVAs, most recently one year ago 9.
Rheumatoid arthritis 10.
Descending thoracic aneurysm approximately 6.3 cm  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1.
Status post hysterectomy  Preoperatively, the patient reported the residual deficits from her CVA were occasional aphasia and poor memory.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient was noted to have erythema under both breasts and over the lower aspect of the sternum thought to be due to fungal infection.
On the evening of postoperative day 0, the patient was noted to have a significant respiratory acidosis.
Chest x-ray revealed a left upper lobe collapse.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy which revealed a left upper lobe mucous plug which was removed.
Post bronchoscopy chest x-ray revealed mild improvement in the aeration of the left upper lobe.
The patient initially had a low cardiac index which responded to volume resuscitation and increasing the milrinone infusion.
On postoperative day #1, the patient underwent repeat bronchoscopy which showed mild bilateral tracheobronchitis and again a mucous plug in the left upper lobe which was removed.
The patient was continued on a propofol infusion through the first postoperative day due to patient tenuous respiratory status.
The patient was noted to have a cough and gag with suctioning.
The patient was noted to move head with noxious stimuli and pupils were 3 cm equal and reactive to light, but it was noted that there was no movement of arms or legs.
The patient had been started back on Plavix for her previous carotid endarterectomies and patient had improving respiratory status and was able to decrease the ventilatory support, however the patient continued to have decreased neurologic function and a neurology consult was obtained and a head CT scan was obtained.
CT scan of the head showed a ACA hypodensity bilateral watershed hypodensity extending posteriorly on the left and an old cerebellar stroke.
Her neurologic exam on postoperative day #3 was no spontaneous eye opening, however opened eyes to noxious stimuli.
Neurology felt that it was unclear whether or not that patient's status was due to her preoperative neurologic findings or a new neurologic event and requested an EEG to rule out subclinical seizure activity.
On postoperative day #4, the patient underwent EEG study which showed no epileptic features, generalized swelling with suggestion of encephalopathic condition.
On neurologic exam, it was noted that the patient had bilateral Babinski sign.
The patient had a sputum culture sent for increasing tracheal secretions which subsequently are positive for Haemophilus influenza and Pseudomonas.
It was felt by the neurology service that due to the patient's early improvement in the first week, substantial recovery over the next few weeks to months was possible and it was decided that the patient would undergo tracheostomy and PEG placement and would be evaluated for neurologic rehabilitation.
After the tracheostomy placement, the patient as noted on chest x-ray to again have a whiteout of the left side and underwent bronchoscopy for large amounts of bloody secretions.
As the patient has a history of anxiety, it was thought that the patient has a combination of delirium and dementia complicated by encephalopathy and it was recommended to continue the present management.
The patient has non purposeful movements of her upper extremities and will withdraw her lower extremities to pain.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
Lungs - breath sounds are coarse with scattered wheezes and rhonchi throughout.
The patient is being intermittently suctioned for small amounts of yellow secretions.
Abdomen is obese, positive bowel sounds, nondistended.
PEG tube is in place without erythema or drainage.
The patient's sternal incision is clean and dry without erythema.
The patient's vein harvest site is clean and dry without erythema or drainage.
