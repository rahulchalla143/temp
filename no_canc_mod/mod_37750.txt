Admission Date:  [**2163-11-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2163-11-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2102-11-17**]     Sex:  M  Service:  GENERAL SURGERY CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bright red blood per rectum, dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year-old African American male with a very complicated past surgical in [**2151**] complicated by a large ventral hernia, which was repaired with a large prosthetic mesh.
The patient's hernia repair was complicated by a prolonged hospital stay with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tracheostomy and ultimately an enterocutaneous fistula, which was treated with multiple abdominal wound debridements and was definitively treated with an exploratory laparotomy with a small bowel patient's postoperative course was complicated by a deep venous thrombosis in which an IVC filter was placed.
The patient presented with a large amount of bright red blood per rectum over the course of six hours with signs of hypovolemia.
The patient was evaluated in the Emergency Room and was aggressively resuscitated and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for serial hematocrits and hemodynamic monitoring.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic pain, hypertension, history of deep venous thrombosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, history of gastrointestinal bleed.
Multiple abdominal debridements and eventually an exploratory laparotomy with a small bowel resection and hernia repair and an IVC filter placement.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient underwent an upper endoscopy, which showed mild gastritis but no active bleeding and no obvious source for his large blood volume loss.
The patient continued to have gastrointestinal bleeding and was transfused 9 units of packed red blood cells as well as plasma and on [**2163-11-5**] underwent a bleeding scan, which demonstrated brisk positivity in the cecal region.
The patient went onto angiography and an ileocolic vessel at the cecum was seen with active bleeding into the cecum.
The patient was started on low dose intraarterial vasopressin and this resolved the bleeding and the patient's bleeding resolved over the course of the next twelve hours.
On [**2163-11-6**] the vasopressin was stopped in the evening and the patient was stable until the evening of [**2163-11-7**] when he began passing copious amounts of bright red blood per rectum again.
Secondary to the patient's history of abdominal surgeries and complicated surgical course, surgery was not chosen as a first line therapy, but secondary to his failure to progress with nonoperative management it was decided that an operative procedure would be the best course of action due to the danger of embolizing an end artery to the cecum.
The patient's transfusion requirement resolved.
The patient had a nine beat run of ventricular tachycardia on postoperative day two, which was treated with electrolyte repletion.
The patient was restarted on his preoperative medications with advance to a regular diet as he showed bowel function and on postoperative day five he was discharged to home with a stable hematocrit and no further bright red blood per rectum and no further ventricular ectopy by telemetry.
It should be noted that this patient due his multiple blood transfusions in the past has built up many antibodies and is extremely difficult to cross-match for compatible blood.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
PROCEDURES:  Angiogram with intraarterial vasopressin delivery and right colectomy for cecal bleeding.
