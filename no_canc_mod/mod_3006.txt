Admission Date:  [**2169-1-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-1-20**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**] Chief Complaint: worsening dyspnea on exertion and LE edema  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 6512**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o CHF (EF=55%), valvular disease (AS & MR), and Afib admitted overnight with complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion and LE edema.
Per ED notes, caretaker reported pt has had worsening LE swelling over the last 2 weeks (L>R), decreased activity, and decreased PO intake.
Also reports of increased left breast edema.
Caretaker says for the past several days pt has c/o DOE and decreased activity.
On admission, patient denied recent F/C/cough, CP/SOB/trauma.
EMS also indicated that she was A&Ox4, but ED note states had altered mental status.
CT head was performed in the ED which showed no acute bleed.
CXR showed CHF, effusions, and posterior opacity c/w ?pneumonia.
Past Medical History: - CHF, EF >55% - AS/MR ([**12-18**]) - HTN - AFib   Social History: - Lopressor - Digoxin - ASA   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: T= 92.2 (ax); HR = 73; BP = 94/56; RR = 16-30; O2 = 90-92% 3L NC.
HEENT: anicteric, surgical pupil OS, Pinpoint pupil OD, OP slightly dry, no erythema NECK: supple, prominent EJ, JVP not elevated.
CV: irregularly irregular, II/VI systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at LUSB, [**1-17**] sys M at apex.
No R/G ABD: NABS, soft, ND, some tenderness to palpation diffusely.
+reducible ventral hernia LUNGS: bibasilar crackles, no wheezes, poor air movement.
No tenderness to palpation.
SKIN: erythematous rash on left breast w/ swelling/warmth NEURO: arousable, answering some questions; will not follow commands for neuro exam.
Congestive heart failure with moderate effusions.
New posterior opacity, on the lateral view, which may relate to edema, but in the appropriately clinical setting raises concern for infection.
CT HEAD [**2169-1-16**] No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI with diffusion-weighted images is more sensitive in the evaluation for acute ischemia/infarct and for vascular detail .
R LE doppler [**2169-1-16**]: No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
CT head [**2169-1-16**]: no evidence of hemorrhage.
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened; mild aortic stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2) Trace aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral regurgitation.
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2166-7-24**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased mitral regurgitation are now seen.
The severity of aortic stenosis is similar.
# HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The etiology for her respiratory failure was unclear.
Differential diagnosis of her respiratory failure in this patient: CHF, mucous plug.
Echo shows new right ventricular hypokinesis and EF 60%, this in conjunction with elevated d-dimer and clinical picture makes PE more likely.
Hypoventilation due to sedating meds possible, but patient did not receive narcotics, benzos, or other sedatives since admission.
Bicarb appears chronically elevated (~28-29) over the last month.
Possibly acute on chronic resp failure; ?neuromuscular or obstructive disease.
Confusion likely secondary to hypercarbia.
Could be also be due to infection (possible pneumonia).
She was treated empirically with vanco, ceftriaxone, and azithro for presumed pneumonia and mastitis .
# PNEUMONIA: Posterior opacity on CXR.
# MASTITIS: Patient had rash on L breast and swelling, consistent with mastitis.
# CHF: Patient likely with CHF exacerbation on admission supported by elevated JVD, rales on lung exam, peripheral edema reported by ED note.
Echo showed EF 60%, new right ventricular hypokinesis.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr 1.9 on admission, now 2.9.
Right kidney showed no hydronephrosis.
# ELEVATED TROP: Troponin had been elevated before.
This was possibly elevated [**1-13**] to renal failure or demand from CHF.
# DECREASED PLATELETS: plts noted to drop from 200->100 while on heparin SC during prior admission, plts appropriately increased off heparin.
HIT antibody negative.
# H/O HTN: BP currently slightly low; Lopressor held.
# CODE: DNR/DNI, no Central line, no pressors, no BiPAP (confirmed with patient and family) .
# DISPO: Her respiratory and renal functions continued to decline while in the MICU.
