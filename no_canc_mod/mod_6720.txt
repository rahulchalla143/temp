There has been marked interval enlargement of a right hemispheric subdural hematoma with both acute and hyper-acute blood identified measuring approximately 1.2 cm in greatest diameter.
There is approximately 6 mm of right to left midline shift.
There are periventricular white matter hypodensities which are most likely attributed to chronic ischemic microvascular disease.
There is diffuse parenchymal atrophy which is age appropriate.
Mass effect from the subdural on the right hemisphere is causing early uncal herniation as evident by widening of the ipsilateral prepontine cistern.
There is a soft tissue hematoma within the right posterior temporo- occipital region.
IMPRESSION: Significant interval increase in size of right hemispheric hyperacute on acute subdural hematoma causing approximately 6 mm of right to left midline shift and early uncal herniation.
