Prior to EMS arrival, pt had episode of limb shaking for a few minutes, which stopped when he touched her arm.
Husband denied that she had any incontinence or tongue biting.
Pt denies HA, visual changes, N/V, fevers, chills, night sweats, or bowel/bladder incontinence.
Pt has no h/o prior seizures.
Past Medical History: bipolar disorder hypertension hypothyroidism skin cancer osteoporosis  Social History: Lives with husband.
Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS:  101.4  110/70  104  14  98% on AC 550x14/0.7/5 Gen: intubated, sedated HEENT: PERRL, ETT in place CV: RRR, nl S1/S2, no murmurs appreciated Pulm: coarse upper airway sounds anteriorly but clear Abd: soft, NT/ND, +BS, no masses; NG tube in place and to suction Ext: no c/c/e Neuro: sedated, increased tone in lower extremities, toes neither up nor downgoing, PERRL   Pertinent Results: EKG: 80bpm, NSR, nl axis and intervals, no ST/T wave changes suggestive of ischemia .
CXR: no evidence of aspiration .
CT C spine: No evidence of acute fracture or gross malalignment of the cervical spine.
Bilateral posteriorly seen atelectasis as described above.
CT head: chronic small vessel infarcts, no acute process .
CT chest: IMPRESSION: Multifocal pulmonary consolidation most readily explained by pneumonia particularly aspiration.
Followup advised to exclude the simultaneous presence of bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma.
It would be useful to obtain a chest radiograph today to correlate with the CT findings In order to determine the rate of change of the multifocal pulmonary abnormality seen.
Edema within the C6 and C7 vertebral bodies, without associated edema of the C6/7 intervertebral disc.
The finding could be degenerative in nature, though other etiologies of marrow edema cannot be entirely excluded, such as infection, although the absence of disc T2 hyperintense signal argues against this possibility.
Small disc osteophyte complexes at C5/6 and C6/7 indent the thecal sac without mass effect on the spinal cord at these levels.
CXR PA/LAT [**2197-3-15**] - IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in the appearance of the lungs since [**2197-3-12**].
Right upper lung opacity is also stable.
No focal or epileptiform features were seen.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.
[**2197-3-15**] 07:10AM BLOOD WBC-8.4 RBC-4.15* Hgb-13.6 Hct-39.4 MCV-95 MCH-32.9* MCHC-34.6 RDW-14.0 Plt Ct-223 [**2197-3-15**] 07:10AM BLOOD Plt Ct-223 [**2197-3-15**] 07:10AM BLOOD Glucose-105 UreaN-10 Creat-1.1 Na-141 K-4.2 Cl-105 HCO3-23 AnGap-17  Brief Hospital Course: What follows is a hospital course by problem: [**Name (NI) **] recieved a complete syncope, seizure and meningitis workup.
Our hypothesis is thus neurocardiogenic syncope in the setting of micturation.
CT head normal except for chronic small vessel infarcts.
MRI/MRA was performed to evaluate for possible CVA, but revealed no evidence of acute infarct.
Possible NPH - seems unlikely in setting of mild gait abnormality and no Urinary symptoms.
Treated with levofloxacin for PNA posteriorly seen on CT scan and CXR.
Cardiac Echo - No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.
Regarding hypoxemic respiratory failure - Patient was intubated at outside hospital for airway protection, as she was reported as unresponsive on her initial presentation.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she did have significant A-a gradient with PO2 in 170s on FIO2 70%.
1. hypoxia resolved.
2. urinary Legionella antigen: negative.
CT chest shows PNA and possible BAC cancer - will follow nodule as outpatient - radiology reports will accompany the patient.
Patient intially complaining of neck pain, but subsequently reported that this was a long term/stable issue.
Patient did have midline TTP on exam.
CT c spine negative; MRI negative but did show edema of cervical vertebrae.
Cervical verterbral edema will be communicated to PCP.
Patient has diagnosis of depression - held bupropion because of concern for seizure.
Hypothyroidism - Patient found to have elevated TSH despite normal T4 - increase dose of levothyroxine to 150mcg qd.
Patient did not recieve this medication because of seizure risk but should be restarted.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for agitation/anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center of [**Location (un) 3320**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Syncope, likely of neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) etiology.
Right upper lobe nodule.
Ready for short term rehab.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a loss of consciousness.
We ruled out serious neurological, cardiac, and vascular cuases including seizure, stroke, heart attack, abnormal heart rhythm, and low blood pressure.
Finally: Despite treatment of your pneumonia your chest x-rays and CT-scan have shown a persistent nodule in your lungs.
Per the radiologist, this finding does not imply a poor prognosis, but is rather an unusual abnormality.
