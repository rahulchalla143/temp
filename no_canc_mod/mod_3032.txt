The patient has had multiple b/l foot infections, mostly treated here at the [**Hospital1 18**].
In [**Month (only) 216**], he underwent a R TMA, complicated by persistent wound infections requring a treatment course of Bactrim for MRSA and a wound VAC.
Healing of the wound has been slow.
He was found to have DKA, leukocytosis of 28, and ARF on CKD.
Further workup revealed a MRSA positive blood, foot and urine culture.
An MRI was obtained, which showed a suspcion for osteoyeltitis throughout the stumps of the metatarsal of the right foot.
Because of persistent fevers and bacteremia, a TEE was ordered and reportedly showed a soft density on mitral valve and suggestion of an aortic valve leaflet density consistent with endocarditis.
The etiology of his renal failure was believed to be pre-renal in nature, due to dehydration in the setting of DKA.
The patient is now transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further manegment and evaluation for the need or cardiac surgery.
