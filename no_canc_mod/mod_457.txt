Admission Date:  [**2167-11-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-11-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-3-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: urosepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 80 Russian female with h/o CAD, AF s/p PPM, HTN, CHF (EF 45-50%), CRI (Cr 1.5), lung CA s/p resection in [**2153**], chronic pain who presents to the ED with complaints of progressive LE pain and weakness over the past several days to weeks.
She also complained difficulty urinating recently, as well as some constipation.
The urinary difficulties include both getting to the bathroom in time (due to pain and DOE), as well as the sensation that she does not completely void.
She has no dysuria.
The swelling in her legs is associated with mild increase in pain and redness, as well as itching.
Her back pain has been worse.
She was dx with CHF and her medication regimen was adjusted.
Cardiac ROS: She describes intermittent chest pain with activity, marked DOE with minimal activity, positive orthopnea and PND, and has a h/o claudication, though pain is different now.
ED COURSE: In ER, she was found to be hypotensive to 70s/40s, have a positive UA, lactate 2.1, acute renal failure.
No head, neck or back trauma recently.
[**Name (NI) **] diarrhea or dysuria.

due to pain or massive swelling).
Marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with underlying bowel-containing air is again seen.
There is adjacent compressive atelectasis at the left lung base.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
*PMIBI [**2167-10-12**]: Moderate, predominantly fixed basilar inferior wall perfusion defect.
In comparison to the report from the prior study, there has been no interval change.
*TTE [**2167-10-8**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed, but appears to be at least mildly reduced, with inferior-posterior hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-7-1**], no major change is evident, but the technically suboptimal nature of the present study precludes definitive comparison.
Heterogeneous bilateral ICA calcific plaque, however, no associated ICA or CCA stenosis (graded as less than 40% ICA stenosis bilaterally).
Lower extremity arterial hemodynamics unchanged compared to the [**2-1**], i.e., minimal right-sided tibial disease, left-sided aortoiliac disease.

She presented with complaints of weakness and hypotension and most likely cause was infection (UTI/urosepsis and cellulitis given leg findings.)
Fluids and levophed used to improve BP with minimal effect.
Her infections were initially covered by vanco, levo, flagyl to broaden GP as well as possible MRSA from recent hospitalizations.
Urine cultures grew enterococus and e.coli.
However, during the course of treatment, patient developed acute renal failure/oliguria, worsening CHF, and persistent hypotension.
Likely multifactorial on top of chronic renal insuffiency.
She has had poor PO intake, as well as episodes of hypotension over the past few weeks.
She was given fluid boluses with minimal effect and decreased urine output ultimately to 5cc/hr.
Furthermore, her INR rose steadily and was felt also to be multifactorial from poor PO intake, worsening liver synthetic capabilities.
