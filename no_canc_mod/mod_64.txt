RUQ Hematoma Evacuation.
woman with primary progressive MS [**Name13 (STitle) 32**] in [**2143**] with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump placment in '[**64**], s/p tracheostomy in '[**65**] [**1-8**] to chronic respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her nursing home.
CXR showed cardiomegaly but no infiltrate.
Abdominal CT was negative for an abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump.
Head CT showed questionable changes from prior that might suggest the possibility of a right MCA infarct.
Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2143**] when pt was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**64**]) for spasticity 2.
for urosepsis - thought [**1-8**] to chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder.
Recurrent aspiration PNA - [**3-/2162**], [**10/2166**] - admitted both times requiring MICU stay, during '[**65**] admission trach was placed because was unable to clear secretions on her own [**1-8**] to respiratory weakness 1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if [**1-8**] to aspiration 4.
COPD 5.
HTN 6.
Scarlet fever as a child 8.
Chronic constipation 9.
Hx of sacral decubitus ulcer   Social History: Social History: Pt is widowed.
She has no children.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: PE: VS P 123 BP 129/73 O2Sat 97% on mechanical vent FiO2 0.50, 550, 15/5 General: older white female being mech ventilated through tracheostomy HEENT: pupils equal and reactive to light bilaterally 5-->3mm, MMM, trach site clean, attempted to bend pt's neck but remained stiff, unclear if that was volitional Chest: coarse breath sounds throughout Cardiac: sinus tach nl s1, s2, no s3, s4, no murmur appreciated Abd: soft, obese, distended +bowel sounds throughout; in RUQ, can appreciate outline of intrathecal baclofen pump, overlying skin appears mildly erythematous, feels warm to touch, but then again she feels warm to touch over the rest of her abdomen, erythema appears localized to skin overlying pump, no streaking.
Pt with Babinski bilaterally.
Does not respond to verbal stimuli.
-STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
No obvious mass or vegetation seen.
CT abd post-op: 1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal wall.
2) Gallbladder with dense material .
3) Bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones.
4) Atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases.
EEG [**2172-3-28**]: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the  presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized slowing followed by periods of suppression.
In addition, there were independent bifrontal sharp slow waves seen.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe encephalopathy.
EEG [**2172-3-31**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage II sleep with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of intermittent and independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both sides.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis.
In addition, exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the underlying infection.
MRI [**4-4**]: Increased signal along the occipital horns could be due to cellular debris from meningitis.
No evidence of acute infarct seen.
Mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild communicating hydrocephalus.
MRV [**4-4**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of thrombosis.
No evidence of vascular occlusion seen.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Her intrathecal baclofen pump was thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying pump in RUQ).
The following day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be hypotensive with an SBP of 70.
Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm hematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site.
Pt was taken emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow ooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized.
Pt developed erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought to be [**1-8**] to PCN allergy.
CSF analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis.
A TTE ruled out endocarditis in the setting of group B strep bacteremia.
RUQ Hematoma: As above, after the removal of the baclofen pump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to be bleeding into the RUQ pocket.
Neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but found a new fluid collection.
Surgery was consulted and they diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given that it had no signs of infection.
She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent for culture.
The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram negative rods (not pseudomonas).
After the pt's swallowing study, she was noted to have increased secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was assumed that the pt aspirated.
That day she also spiked a temperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.
Supraglottic edema As above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she failed a passy-muir valve.
On bronchoscopy it was noted that she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.
The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.
Ideally, she will get surgery by ENT to improve her subglottic edema when the patient has recovered from her acute illnesses.
Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease.
Pt's baseline hct is between 26 and 29 and except for the hct drop after the bleed in the RUQ pocket, pt's hct remained stable.
She was without signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e.
Her decreased responsiveness was thought to be [**1-8**] to meningitis, but although pt seemed to have resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished reponsiveness persisted.
Neurology was following the pt and recommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ?
of stroke at OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule out subclinical seizures.
An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with severe encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.
An MRI was finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke.
Towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and eventually returned to her baseline mental status.
(At baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis but does not require mechical ventilation.
HTN In unit, pt initially normotensive, then mid-way through stay became hypertensive with SBPs in the 150-170s.
Pt has hx of hypertension.
Pt then passed the video swallow but again had some signs of aspiration after trying some ground solids.
Pt should remain on tube feeds until her tracheal swelling is much improved.
