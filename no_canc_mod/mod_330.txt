# Goals of care: On admission the patient was very agitated and delirious.
The family at the time agreed to make the patient DNR but continued potential for intubation.
At baseline the patient would lay in bed screaming or vocalizing sound without a clear source of pain or agitation.

#PNA: Suspected to be secondary to aspiration, with possible contribution from AMS secondary to polypharmacy.
S&S evaluation done, and the patient failed, so she was NPO, no meds, no ice chips.
# Altered mental status: likely secondary to delirium from multiple infections and pain from recent humerus fracture.
Over the course of admission the patient had some increased alertness but waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
Troponin elevations were likely secondary to demand in the setting of sepsis rather than secondary to plaque rupture.
#Hx of mesenteric ischemia: no evidence of active ischemia during this admission.
If pt seems to be suffering from pd related problems at the nursing home, can be given sublingial sinemet.
#Anemia: Baseline Hct around 31, Hx of pernicious anemia.
