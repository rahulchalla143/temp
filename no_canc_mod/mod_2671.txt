Admission Date:  [**2169-10-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-11-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-2-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tetracyclines / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Location (un) **] ER with anterior STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with Cypher stent to proximal LAD   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old male with a hx of an inferior MI in [**12/2165**] s/p overlapping velocity hepacoat stents to the RCA (no other significant CAD was noted at that time) who was transferred form [**Location (un) **] ER with an anterior STEMI.
He has cardiac risk factors positive for being a previous smoker who quit in [**2165**] with a 30 pack year tobacco history, HTN, and HLD not currently on a statin due to muscle weakness.
He has remained chest pain free with an unlimited exercise tolerance until this 12:15PM when he was climbing a ladder and had [**11-14**] right-sided crushing substernal chest pain radiating down both arms with associated nausea and excessive diaphoresis.
He took two aspirin which did not resolve his chest pain and called the ambulance.
Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with patent stents in the RCA; 30-40% proximal, 40% distal RCA lesions, 90% proximal LAD with TIMI 2 flow and no significant LMCA or LCX lesions.
Hypercholesterolemia 2.
Family History: Father died of CHF at 75 y/o with no hx of MI Mother died of brain cancer with no hx of MI   Physical Exam: -Vitals: Temp=afebrile, BP=118/49, HR=75 NSR, O2sat=98% on 2L nc -Gen: Patient lying flat in bed.
He is conversational and speaking in full sentences with no shortness of breath.
No JVD, no carotid bruit -Resp: CTAB -Abd: Abdomen is tight (patient states that it is normal for him), but non-tender.
No abdominal bruit -Ext: Cath site is c/d/i with no evidence of hematoma, flank tenderness and good distal pulses.
No edema or cyanosis.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include distal anterior, apical, and mid and distal septal as well as very distal (apical) inferior and inferolateral akinesis.
4.The aortic root is moderately dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to the previous study of [**2165-12-12**], the right ventricular and inferior wall function has normalized while there are new anterior, septal and apical akinesis is new.
Consider mid LAD occlusion.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with LMCA that was free of angiographically significant disease.
The LAD had a proximal 90% stenosis with TIMI 2 flow.
LCX had  no significant disease and RCA stents were patent with 30-40% proximal and distal lesions in the vessels.
Hemodynamic assessment showed elevated left and right sided filling pressures and preserved cardiac index.
Successful PCI of the proximal to mid LAD with overlapping Cypher drug eluting stents (3.0x18mm proximal to a 3.0x8mm with post dilation to 3.5mm in the mid portion).
Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old male with hx of previous MI in [**2165**] who presents with an acute anterior STEMI s/p successful PCI with cypher-DES to LAD.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Coronaries:  Cardiac cath showed 90% proximal LAD lesion which underwent succesful PCI to the LAD with cypher-DES resulting in 0% occlusion and TIMI III flow.
The patient was also placed on pravastatin since he had muscle weakness from other statins.
This revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40-45%, with anterior, septal and apical akinesis.
We started him on coumadin with Lovenox bridge for 6 months for prophylaxis against intramural thrombus formation.
The patient did not have symptoms of heart failure throughout his admission.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient had several runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during the 24 hours after his catheterization.
Thereafter, he did not have any ventricular tachycardia and remained in a sinus rhythm for the duration of his admission.

Hypercholesterolemia            2.
Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Stable.
Ambulating without assistance.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a heart attack and you had a stent placed for a blockage in your coronary arteries.
If you experience chest discomfort, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or episodes of loss of consciousness, please return to the ED.
