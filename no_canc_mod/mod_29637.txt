Admission Date:  [**2124-8-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2124-8-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2081-7-8**]     Sex:  M   Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 37996**] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 94673**] is a 43-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, hepatitis D, HIV positive three days prior to his last admission at this institution.
He stated that he had been having abdominal pain since the day he left the hospital without being able to move his bowels.
He also noticed that he took relatively large amount of Opiate pain medication that was prescribed to him postoperatively in a matter of 24 hours.
Upon evaluation in the Emergency Room, a KUB was obtained and he was found to have dilated loops of small bowel with multiple air fluid levels.
The patient upon his evaluation in the Emergency Room was very agitated, requiring Ativan and Morphine for his pain and agitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for HIV positive, hepatitic C positive, hepatitic B positive, history of hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, upset, disoriented, mildly confused, alert but no place, no time.
Heart, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, thrills, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen softly distended, tender to palpation, positive bowel sounds.
Incision of the umbilical hernia repair was clean, dry and intact without erythema, induration or drainage.
There was no guarding or rebound, no palpable masses.
Extremities were warm, well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Radiology, KUB was obtained as stated above that showed multiple gas and distended loops of small bowel with air fluid levels.
There was no free air under the diaphragm.
Upon some of his issues there was a profound hyponatremia that was corrected with normal saline.
The liver team evaluated him at that time and there was a question of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis since the patient underwent the umbilical hernia repair a couple of days before.
He was tapped looking for infected ascites and the liver team that performed the procedure noticed that once they did the tap they absorbed fecal material making them think that they had entered the bowel.
He had episodes of tachypnea with respiratory rate in the mid 30's, low 40's becoming progressively more acidotic.
That morning his Propofol was stopped in order to evaluate him neurologically and he presented a tonic clonic seizure.
At that time there was no obvious foci of irritability and this seizure was attributed to the hepatic encephalopathy.
Head CT and abdominal CT was obtained and was read as unremarkable head CT with dilated loops of small bowel in the abdomen.
There was no obvious source of perforation or major intra-abdominal collections that could be drained.
Infectious disease was also consulted and they agreed with the antibiotic coverage suggesting to add Fluconazole to the antibiotics just to cover a potential fungal infection.
They manifested that it was the patient's desire not to be maintained on critical care support as well as ventilatory support in the event that he would have a complication related to his disease.
