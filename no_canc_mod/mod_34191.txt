Placed [**2179**] for calcified bicuspid valve A fib, began about 3 years ago, s/p 3 ablation procedures, last about 1 month ago.
s/p angioplasty, stent in left circumflex non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, ?
Patient has experienced "shakes" before during hospitalization, but never seizures or hallucinations.
Family History: Family history is notable for father who died of MI at age 50.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.

No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No prior in system, but per cardiologist note, prior shows wide left bundle branch block with qRs duration of 190 ms.  ECHO: [**7-/2194**] EF 30-35%, severe hypokinesis of septal,inferoseptal and inferobasal walls.
Mild apical hypokinesis.
Dilated aortic root.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-3-9**] 3:07 PM No acute intracranial process.
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-3-9**] 3:08 PM No significant interval change in the large hematoma in the left  thigh adductor muscle compartment since the prior CT scan dated [**2195-3-8**].
Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions with almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe and right basilar opacities, could be due to atelectasis or aspiration, much less likely pneumonia.
Aortic valve replacement.
Coronary artery and mitral annulus calcifications.
Signs of volume overload.
Mild upper lobe predominant centrilobular emphysema.
No definite sign of restricted diffusion to suggest acute spinal cord ischemia.
Interval increase in size of large hematoma in the left thigh adductor muscle compartments since prior CT of [**2195-3-9**], with internal hematocrit effect.
This could represent a liquefying hematoma or, if the thigh circumference has increased, could be due to acute bleeding.
No retroperitoneal hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 69 year old man with mechanical heart valve and a fib, admitted for anticoagulation before PVI ablation by EP the day after admission.
Repeat INR the morning of [**2195-3-6**] was 2.1, so patient was taken to cath lab for procedure.
After his procedure, he became tremulous and agitated in the PACU with significant groin bleeding.
No history of seizures or hallucination.
Given difficulty with holding pressure and significant groin bleeding, patient was intubated in the PACU and sent to the ICU on [**3-6**].
On [**3-7**] patient was restarted on Warfarin 10mg but had a significant Hct drop and was treated with Vitamin K, platelets and FFP on [**3-8**].
On [**3-8**] extubation was attempted but the patient failed due to altered mental status so was reintubated.
He was then extubated and reintubated on [**3-8**] with continued altered mental status in the setting of Valium.
On [**3-8**] he was also started on Vanc/Levofloxacin for concern for CAP and GPC in sputum & CXR concerning for left lung process.
Mini-BAL on [**3-15**] revealed no microrganisms and no PMNs, which ultimately grew oral flora.
Also on [**3-15**], he spiked a new fever and was pancultured and antibiotics were broadened to Cipro/Vanc/Zosyn for VAP.
Given his failure to improve for several days following, IP was contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible trach placement but could not do so given his C-collar.
On [**3-20**] his sputum culture revealed ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES and his antibiotics were narrowed to cefepime.
The patient finished a full 8 day course of cefepime and had no furthe symptoms.
** Pt was also found to have small lung nodules on CT scan of your chest.
# Groin Hematoma- For his traumatic sheath pull, EP and Vascular continued to monitor his groin wound and provide recommedations.
Ultimately, patient was restarted successfully on a heparin gtt without a Hct drop until [**3-15**].
Thus, on [**3-16**] he went to the OR were evaluation revealed no active extravasation but old, liquified hematoma.
# AMS - For his altered mental status, this was initially attributed to Valium use in the setting of poor hepatic function and failure to clear.
As time continued, more extensive work-up was pursued for infectious etiology (pneumonia was found, but no other source was identified) versus a neurologic process.
Per his wife, he always had a left foot drop.
EEG without evidence of seizure.
The patient was noted to have cervical spondylosis with mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at C3-4 and C4-5 with mild extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord, but no evidence of cord impingement.
This was continued as his primary bowel regimen, though there was no definitive evidence of hepatic encephalopathy.
Pt was thought to have delirium vs. Korsakoff syndrome [**2-2**] etoh.
Pt intially had significant sundowning and agitiation that would require haldol 2-3mg overnight.
He may require a small dose of haldol for the next few days, but we do not expect this to be an ongoing issue with is resolving delirium.
# Cervical Spondylosis: (As above) Per neurosurgery, pt to remain in C collar until neurosurg f/u in [**4-6**] wks w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
# Atrial fibrillation- For his atrial fibrillation, patient underwent PVI placement.
Anticoagulation was above, being held when evidence of active bleeding, and continued when more stable.
His TSH was mildy elevated but FT4 was normal, and LFTs were mildly elevated.
Concerning anticoagulation pt was placed on heparin while his INR became subtherapeutic, but was d/c once pt reached his goal of 2.5-3.5 (due to the mechanical valve).
# [**Name (NI) 11646**] Pt was on vanco for Coag neg staph from [**3-22**] in [**4-4**] bottles coag neg staph.
The source was unclear as had no central lines at that time.
The cultures were reviewed by Infectious disease who believed that the bactermia was contiminant and vancomycin was discontinued.
# Dilated ascending aorta - incidentally noted on one of the cT scans done in ICU.
Haloperidol 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS: prn as needed for agitation.
Amitriptyline 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO qHS, prn: as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 671**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Atrial Fibrillation, Ventillator associated Pneumonia  Secondary: mechanical aortic valve, hypertension, dyslipidemia, alcohol withdrawal, spinal stenosis   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
Imaging also revealed that you have narrowing in your spinal canal so you were placed in a hard cervical collar.
We treated you for pneumonia with Zosyn, and were thought to have endocarditis but the bacteria in the blood was found to be a contaminated and the antibiotic was discontinued.
** You were found to have small lung nodules on CT scan of your chest.
