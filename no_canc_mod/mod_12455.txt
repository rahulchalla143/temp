This pregnancy was notable for an abnormal alpha fetoprotein and triple screen, which was followed with serial ultrasounds.
There was a lag in prenatal care.
The mother presented to her [**Name (NI) **] office on the day of delivery showing poor fetal growth and reported leaking of amniotic fluid for two months.
No kidneys or lungs were visualized.
She underwent a cesarean section for concern for fetal heart rate decelerations.
His evolving chronic lung disease is treated with Diuril.
A trial of bronchodilators showed no added benefit.
On three occasions within a week he has had respiratory arrest events marked by profound bradycardia.
An echocardiogram was performed on day of life number two and showed moderate to severe biventricular dysfunction.
A small pericardial effusion was noted.
The heart was otherwise structurally normal with a small atrial septal defect.
Most recent echocardiogram was on [**2152-8-3**] showing a moderate atrial septal defect, mild right ventricular overload and left peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
Serum electrolytes have been closely monitored due to the diuretic treatment.
The culture was no growth.
On [**2152-7-10**] an abscess was noted over the left wrist.
Due to prior concern for sepsis [**Known lastname 43153**] was being treated with Vancomycin and Gentamycin.
A second incision and drainage was performed on [**2152-7-28**] and again the same Citrobacter koseri was cultured.
Also of concern with infectious disease with his hepatic workup he was found to be hepatitis A antibody positive.
Further testing showed him to have the hepatitis A immunoglobulin negative.
Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname 43153**] has presented with some unidentified liver dysfunction.
An extensive metabolic and gastrointestinal workup has been undertaken and multiple metabolic tests sent.
A HIDA scan showed a normal gallbladder and ruled out biliary atresia, alpha one antitrypsin level had MM typing.
[**Known lastname 43153**] has also had an elevated direct bilirubin, which peaked at 8.3 on day of life 45.
Endocrine:  [**Known lastname 43153**] has had persistent problems with hypoglycemia despite multiple attempts to wean him from continuous feeds.
Serum insulin growth hormone and Cortisol levels have been drawn on numerous occasions with the episodes of hypoglycemia and all levels have been within the normal range.
The etiology of his glucose requirement is unclear.
Endocrine does not have suggestions at present for further evaluation.
Musculoskeletal:  A fracture of the right humerus was noted incidentally on a chest x-ray.
This was likely a result of severe metabolic bone disease.
Serial retinal examinations have been performed and showed mature retinas on [**2152-7-12**].
State newborn screening have been sent on multiple occasions with only the carnitine abnormality detected.
Immunizations recommended, Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria - born at less then 32 weeks gestation, born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for day care during RSV season, with a smoker in the household or with preschool siblings or with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age the family and other care givers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Prematurity at 34 weeks gestation.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Chronic lung disease.
Atrial septal defect.
Global cardiac dysfunction.
Suspicion for sepsis ruled out.
Citrobacter koseri cellulitis of the left wrist.
Congenital carnitine deficiency.
Right humeral fracture.
