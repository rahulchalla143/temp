In brief, this is a 64yo M w/CAD s/p CABG X 3 who presented to an OSH with chest pain that began after shoveling snow on [**2112-12-28**].
He describes the pain as a sharp sensation below his right lower rib.
He took 2 NTG tablets without effect and presented to [**Location (un) 1514**] (NH) Hospital where biomarkers were positive (peak Tn 2.4, CKMB 10.8, CK 147).
He underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a patent vein graft to the LAD with the remaining grafts and native vessels occluded or severely diseased.
Following the procedure he had persistent chest pain despite high dose nitro gtt.
He was felt not to be a candidate for re-do bypass by the surgeon at the OSH.
On arrival to the CCU, he continued to c/o CP but soon thereafter became pain free on a heparin gtt, integrilin and a nitro gtt.
Family reports he developed slurred speech 3 days ago the day prior to the onset of his chest pain.
Denied motor deficits or disorientation.
He has had chronic anterior chest pain as a result of his repeated sternotomies for which he takes oxycodone x 10 years.
On cardiac review of symptoms, cardiac and musculoskeletal chest pain as above.

The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 13712**] is a 64M with severe CAD s/p CABG x 3.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Patient with CAD s/p CABG x 3.
Prior to transfer from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**], he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a patent vein graft to the LAD with the remaining grafts and native vessels occluded or severely diseased.
Following the procedure he had persistent chest pain despite high dose nitro gtt.
He was felt not to be a candidate for re-do bypass by the surgeon at the OSH.
On arrival to the CCU, he continued to c/o CP but soon thereafter became pain free on a heparin gtt, integrilin and a nitro gtt.
On HD 3, patient spiked a fever to 103.7 with accompanying low flank pain and there was concern that this represented an infection of the IABP.
His IABP was then pulled on HD 4, but given his persistent fever cardiac catheterization was postponed and Vancomycin started.
Patient c/o abdominal pain and a CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained after removal of the IABP that demonstrated inflammation of his ascending [**Last Name (STitle) 499**] so he was started on Flagyl & Ciprofloxacin.
On HD 6, he became afebrile and all of his blood cultures were negative, so his Vancomycin was stopped.
He was cleared for cardiac catheterization, but his Hct was 20.0 and the patient refused blood products because of his religious beliefs.
He subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on HD6 with a radial approach to minimize blood loss, but none of his lesions were intervenable.
Fever & Abdominal/Flank pain: Patient with fever, abdomen & flank pain on HD3 as noted above.
After removal of balloon pump, patient had CT abdomen & pelvis that demonstrated thickening of the cecum and ascending [**Last Name (LF) 499**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] his IV Flagyl/Cipro/Vancomycin was continued.
After the balloon pump was removed, he remained pain free and defervesced quickly.
This was thought to be [**1-24**] hemolysis from the balloon pump and from some bleeding at the IABP site.
He was found to be guaiac positive, but had no e/o frank blood in his stools.
CT did not demonstrate an RP bleed or free fluid in the abdomen.
Patient appeared euvolemic on exam without evidence of failure.
To do: F/U outstanding blood cultures from [**1-1**], [**1-2**]/, and [**1-3**]  Medications on Admission: TRANSFER MEDICATIONS: ASA 325mg qd Atenolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] Norvasc 10mg qd Zetia 10mg qd Gemfibrizol 600mg [**Hospital1 **] Glyburide 5mg qd Protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] Quinapril 10mg [**Hospital1 **] Ranexa Zocor 80mg qd Integrilin gtt   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Non ST elevation myocardial infarction Ascending Colitis (likely ischemic)  Secondary: Iron Deficiency Anemia Diabetes Mellitus, Type II Hypertension Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain and a small heart attack.
Additionally, in the hospital you had some fevers and abdominal pain.
You were started on antibiotics and your fever and abdominal pain resolved.
-LISINOPRIL: This is a NEW medication to treat your blood pressure.
-Ascorbic Acid (Vit C): This should be taken with the iron and will help absorb it -Ciprofloxacin (CIPRO): This is an antibiotic to treat the inflammation in your gut.
Finally, you will need to be seen by a gastroenterologist for an evaluation of your low blood counts and recent gastrointestinal inflammation.
