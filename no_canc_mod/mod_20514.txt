Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 63072**] Admission Date: [**2199-10-15**] Discharge Date: [**2199-10-16**] Date of Birth:  [**2199-10-12**] Sex:  F Service:  Neonatology   ADMISSION HISTORY TO NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  Infant is a 37-5/7 weeks, 2,215 grams female newborn who was initially admitted to the NICU for hypothermia and hypoglycemia.
Pregnancy was noted for abdominal situs inversus with a gastric bubble located on the right, liver on the left.
A fetal echocardiogram did not reveal any major heart defects, although the study was not complete.
Artificial rupture of membranes less than 24 hours prior to delivery for clear fluid.
Cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no grunting, flaring, or retracting.
Regular rate and rhythm was her cardiovascular exam with no murmur.
Abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Hips were stable with patent anus and no sacral anomalies.
Respiratory: Patient remained stable throughout her     hospitalization requiring no supplemental oxygen.
Hematology: Patient did have a CBC on admission to check     for [**Location (un) **] Jolly bodies in association with abdominal     situs inversus and associated asplenius.
Some [**Location (un) **] Jolly bodies were seen but this     is not necessarily suggestive of aplenia because some well     newborns may have this soon at after birth.
GI: Patient also did have an abdominal ultrasound on [**2199-10-15**] which revealed stomach lying on the fetal right and the heart lying in the normal position with a midline liver.
Given the abdominal situs inversus and possible association with malrotation and volvulus, a surgical consult was also obtained which recommended an upper GI, which showed malrotation, as expected.
These above findings (azygous continuation of IVC, situs inversus, no gallbladder, and no severe acrdiac defects) are most consistent with POLYSPLENIA.
If there is no splenic tissue identified, the infant will require pneumococcal prophylaxis.
If splenic tissue is identified, no prophylaxis will be needed.
Patient was started on     amoxicillin due to risk of sepsis with encapsulated     organisms especially pneumococcus given the asplenia.
Genetics: Patient was seen by genetics with a plan for     followup in the genetics clinic 3 months after discharge     to review progress and to assess for Kartagener risk.
Medications: Amoxicillin (50mg/kg/d divided [**Hospital1 **]) for pneumococcal prophylaxis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS LIST: 1) Abdominal situs inversus 2) polysplenia vs asplenia 3) azygous continuation of IVC                          [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**MD Number(1) 56662**]  Dictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 58729**] MEDQUIST36 D:  [**2199-10-16**] 07:38:06 T:  [**2199-10-16**] 08:24:16 Job#:  [**Job Number 63076**]
