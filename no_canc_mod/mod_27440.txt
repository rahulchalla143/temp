Admission Date:  [**2175-5-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2136-2-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from OSH for liver and renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Liver biopsy Dialysis catheter placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 39 yo male with HIV diagnosed in [**2164**] but was only recently started on HAART therapy about 2 months ago in [**Month (only) **] [**2175**].
He also has HepC and disseminated MAC with liver biopsy in [**2174-11-16**] demonstrating AFB positive granulomas and was subsequently started on ethambutol/azithro/rifabutin.
He has had several recent admissions this past month at OSH for PNA, neutropenia and left renal calculus with hematuria.
His current course started on [**2175-4-29**] when he presented to [**Hospital 189**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital with fever, left flank pain and RUQ pain.
The workup for his pain was difficult because he has chronic abdominal pain requiring narcotics.
The differential for his liver failure at this time included HIV cholangiopathy vs. drug induced hepatitis vs. reactivation MAC infection from starting HAART therapy.
The differential for his renal failure included HIV nephropathy vs. membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis [**2-17**] Hepc vs. chronic renal calculi vs. reconstition syndrom from HAART therapy.
Given his liver failure, renal failure and complex infectious history including HIV, HepC and disseminated MAC, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tertiary care.
Currently his chief complaint is left sided abdominal pain and RUQ pain.
He denies fevers currently but reported having fevers at OSH.
He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
He is making urine and has no dysuria.

This is a 39 yo man with HIV/AIDS and hep C cirrhosis not a candidate for interferon or HAART with progressive liver and renal failure.
Below is a detailed history of his recent hospitalization.
The patient has hep C and HIV not previously on medication until late [**2174**] (per conversation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 72851**], ID at OSH).
Hep C viral load 55,000,000.  per OSH records, his HAART was held upon admission to OSH [**2-17**] concern for reconstitution syndrome in addition to concern that HAART regimen could be causing liver failure (pt was briefly treated with solumedrol for reconstitution at OSH, but this was discontinued upon his admission).
His PCP prophylaxis and MAC treatment were also held because of concern that these could be causing his elevated LFTs.
The patient was treated with a 7 day course of zosyn [**Date range (1) 72852**] upon presentation because of coarse breath sounds, and fever, however CT CHEST revealed only ground glass opacification at bases, but no clear infiltrate.
given his elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, concern was for a biliary source of infection, however RUQ USN [**2175-5-14**] showed minimal gallbladder wall edema, without significant distension, or evidence of cholelithiasis.
The patient underwent HIDA [**2175-5-17**] which showed no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Given a high concern for biliary infection (RUQ pain, fever, elevated tbili), the patient undwerwent ERCP on [**2175-5-17**], at which time mildly dilated biliary tree was visualized with filling defect in distal CBD consistent with a stone, thus stent was placed.
Given elevated LFTs, and clinical suscpicion for fungal infection, the patient was started on ambisome on [**5-27**].
He was without elevated wbc throughout admission (indeed was neutropenic as below).
He continued to have low grade temperatures (99-100.6) until [**5-31**].
In close consultation with the infectious disease team, the patient was ultimately felt to not be a candidate for HAART therapy out of concern for further liver toxicity and inability to tolerate the therapy.
The patient presented to an OSH with fever and RUQ pain.
The patient had known hepatitis C, viral load on this admission was 55,000,000.
There was no evidence of HIV cholangiopathy.
Given elevated LFTs after ERCP with stent placement, pt underwent liver biopsy on [**2175-5-23**] which revealed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, with cirrhosis.
LFTs began trending down shortly after biopsy, however, thus pt's hepatic failure was felt more likely to be the result of medication (most likely azithromycin or HIV medications), superimposed upon hepatitis C infection and underlying fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis.
# RENAL.
The patient presented without a history of renal disease, however creatinine 1.2 upon presentation to OSH up to 3.3 upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
His OSH course was complicated by hyperkalemia for which he underwent hemodialysis on [**5-11**] and [**5-12**].
The patient did apparently have complicated history of bilateral renal calculi and he was admitted at OSH recently for renal calculi and hematuria.
Abd CT at OSH [**2175-5-7**] showed no hydronephrosis.
UA and UCx were unremarkable, and CT ABD/PELVIS this admission was negative for calculi, or hydronephrosis.
The patient developed progressive renal failure.
The patient's renal failure continued to progress and in accordance with the patient's wishes he had a temporary dialysis catheter placed and 2 cycles of hemodialysis in able to prolong his life to allow his family to see him.
After his family's arrival - and in accordance with the patient's and his family's wishes - his dialysis catheter was removed and the patient had no further dialysis.
The patient presented with anemia and thrombocyopenia.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed which revealed hypercellular marrow with mild erythroid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia and left-shifted myelopoiesis.
