Patient initially presented [**6-29**] with coag-negative Staph lumbar epidural abscess at L3-S1 and bacteremia attributed to prior epidural infection for chronic LBP.
TTE at that time was without evidence of endocarditis.
Patient returned for follow-up to ortho spine clinic [**10-30**] and was found to have recurrent back pain and difficulty walking.
MRI L-spine showed L3-L4 discitis and osteomyelitis with recurrent paraspinal fluid collection.
[**Name8 (MD) **] RN, patient with hypoxia to 83% on 35% facemask when need suctioning.
Suctioning with scan white sputum, and improves O2 saturation to 96% on facemask FiO2 35%.
This AM patient was improved early but spiked to 102 mid-morning, followed by respiratory distress with O2 sats down to 70's, RR up to 30's, tachycardia.
New lower left chest consolidation on exam; CXR obtained and difficult to interpret given ileus.
Transferred to ICU for presumed PNA and further respiratory support.
Post-op course also complicated by altered mental status.
MI ([**4-29**]) with subsequent DES to unknown vessel Hypertension Diabetes mellitus type 2, complicated by neuropathy Hyperlipidemia Low back pain, chronic   Social History: Social History: lives with his wife.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2102-11-17**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):     ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2102-11-18**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2102-11-21**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**6-/2399**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
Lungs are essentially clear except for bibasal linear small opacities consistent with small areas of atelectasis.
There is slight deviation of the upper trachea towards the left that might be consistent with thyroid enlargement, unchanged since the prior study.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
Changes consistent with laminectomy from L3 to S1.
Disc space narrowing and degenerative arthritic change are again noted.
L3-4 endplates are less distinct and this may be due to post-surgical change.
There is spinal fixation hardware in the lumbar spine.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave change.
The previously recorded ST-T wave abnormalities persist.
[**2102-11-23**] CXR There are persistent low lung volumes.
Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient and are associated with bibasilar atelectasis.
Opacity previously seen in the right perihilar region is obscured by the pleural effusion and right lower lobe atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 76yoM originally admitted to ortho spine service s/p I&D, laminectomy L3-S1 for coag negative Staph epidural abscess, who was readmitted for recurrent lumbar epidural abscess, L3-L4 discitis and osteomyelitis, went to the OR for repeat partial vertebrectomy, fusion, debridement, and vertebral spacer placement at L3-L4, who then went to the MICU and intubated for respiratory distress, and now extubated, found to have a HAP during his MICU [**Last Name (un) 10128**], Tx'd with IV ABx.
Epidural abscess/osteomyelitis: Pt had original debridement on coag negative staph epidural abscess in [**6-/2102**], presented for f/u to ortho spine [**10-30**] with recurrent back pain and difficulty walking, admitted for second round of debridement and ortho instrumentation [**2102-11-17**].
Respiratory distress/HAP: The pt had post operative respiratory distress requiring transfer to MICU where he was intubated for three days, likely secondary to aspiration vs HAP.
Sputum cultures found to have GPC's in clusters/pairs.
CAD s/p BMS to OM1 in [**4-29**], BMS to LAD in [**2094**]:  Prior to the procedure, patient's ASA+Plavix was held because of the bleeding risks with the procedure.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Six (6) Puff Inhalation Q4 PRN () as needed for wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for dyspnea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Willow Manor - [**Hospital1 189**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis - L3-L4 discitis/osteomyelitis with extensive paravertebral phlegmon - Hospital Acquired Pneumonia  Secondary - Coronary Artery disease   Discharge Condition: Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane) Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Mental Status:Clear and coherent   Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized because you had back pain.
You were found to have another epidural abcess and underwent a procedure to remove part of your vertebrae.
You also had a short ICU stay for respiratory distress and pneumonia and were treated with antibiotics.
