Per wife, pt has had increased sleepiness and fatigue since discharge from rehab 3 days prior to admission.
Today, pt had episode of unresponsiveness while getting into shower.

On the floor, pt without complaints aside from dry cough that began in ED, arms feeling uncomfortable (in flexion), and uncomfortable, cold legs.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies recent weight loss or gain, headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion, shortness of breath, wheezing, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: -Admitted to hospital in [**11/2198**] s/p fall, found to have central cord syndrome with quadriplegia with hospital course c/b PE and respiratory failure requiring intubation c/b ventilator acquired pneumonia --> MRI [**11/2198**] of cervical spine was consistent with multiple cervical spine fractures and stir changes within the cord from C2-C6 but showed no canal compromise and no role for emergent surgical intervention.
-Quadriplegia, motor level C5 -left hand fracture -Segmental Pulmonary Embolism, first discovered on [**12-2**], started on anticoagulation with LE Doppler on [**2198-12-9**] showing superficial thrombus in R peroneal vein; hematology finally recommended against formal anticoagulation since PE was subsegmental.
HOWEVER, then on [**12-11**], pt had episode of desaturation and chest CT on [**12-12**] revealed new segmental PE in right lung --> anticoagulation -s/p IVC filter  Social History: - Recently discharged home from [**Hospital3 **] ([**4-16**]); lives with wife, has [**Name (NI) 269**] services; has son in [**Name (NI) **] studying linguistics and anthromology - Biology professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] - Tobacco: none - Alcohol: none since [**2198-11-16**] - Illicits: none  Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: T: afebrile BP: 141/72 P: 88 R: 10 @100%(2L) General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, laying still in bed with blankets up to chin HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: Old trache scar near jugular arch, supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly with some basilar crackles on lateral exam.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present GU: Suprapubic catheter with some visible purulence; no erythema, blood.
No clubbing, cyanosis.
Sensory level with some sense of pressure to legs bilaterally.
Babinski + bilaterally, but no notable clonus or hyperreflexia in LE.
DISCHARGE EXAM: T: afebrile BP: 128/78 P: 86 R: 18 @100%RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, laying still in bed  HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: Old trache scar near jugular arch, supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly with some basilar crackles on lateral exam.
No clubbing, cyanosis.
IMAGING [**2199-4-19**] CXR: Mild left base atelectasis, mild component of aspiration not excluded.
[**2199-4-22**] ECHO: normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
-[**2199-4-19**] 2:30 pm urine culture:MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
-[**2199-4-22**] 5:43 pm urine culture: NO GROWTH.
-[**2199-4-23**] 8:53 pm urine culture: NO GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 M s/p fall in [**11/2198**] now with C5 quadriplegia (s/p trach, peg, and urostomy tube), who was brought into the ED following unresponsive episode with hypotension, and found to have grossly purulent urine, leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, and positive UA with clinical picture concerning for sepsis.
# Urosepsis: Patient was empirically started on clindamycin and cefepime in the ED, and was hypotensive requiring fluid reuscitation and a brief span of Levophed.
Urine culture returned positive for Proteus sensitive to meropenem so the linezolid was stopped.
Final sensitivity showed pt's Proteus was sensitive to Ceftriaxone as well, so his antibiotic was changed from Meropenem to Ceftriaxone.
He remained afebrile and was clinically stable for transfer to the floor.
While on the medicine floor, pt spiked a fever and blood cultures and urine cultures were obtained.
One set of the urine cultures returned positive for staph aureus coag positive.
Pt was d/c'd home after he was afebrile for >24 hrs with continuation of Meropenem for additional eight days to complete a 14 day course at home.
If there is a leakage, this can be a sign of infection and pt should contact his primary care physician as soon as possible.
# EKG Changes: The patient was noted to have asymptomatic t wave inversions in V4-V6 with troponin elevated to 0.11, and then 0.08.
This was felt to be secondary to the underlying sepsis, rather than ACS.
While on the medicine floor, pt was asymptomatic and did not have any chest pain.
A follow up ECHO was done, and it was positive for regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Similar T waves changes were appreciated.
The decision was made to start medical management only as pt was asymptomatic and the troponin leak was not significant at this time and trending down.
# Quadriplegia s/p fall in [**11/2198**]: continued baclofen, neurotin, IS, and bowel regimen.
# S/p Segmental Pulmonary Embolism in [**11/2198**] s/p IVC filter: INR was supratherapeutic at 4.3, so warfarin was initally held.
Pt's stool was guiac negative and physical exam was negative for acute bleeding.
Given pt's stable vital sign, the HCT drop was thought to be due to dilutional effect from the large amount of IVF for his hypotension.

Disp:*8 bags* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 269**] Care  Discharge Diagnosis: urosepsis troponin leak   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for low blood pressure and hypotension, and were found to have a urinary tract infection and abnormal EKG changes.
# Sepsis: The source of infection was likely proteus from urine.
Leakage from the tube can be a sign of infection and you should contact your physician as soon as possible if there is leakage.
#hx of segmental pulmonary embolism w/IVC filter ([**11-25**]): on admission your INR was elevated.
# Elevated cardiac enzymes and T wave inversions: you did not have any chest pain or shortness of breath.
# Quadriplegia s/p fall in [**11/2198**]: you were continued on Baclofen.
#Increase bowel movements: you were tested for c. diff and the result was negative.
