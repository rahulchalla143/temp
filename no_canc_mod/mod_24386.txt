After speaking with his mother, it was discovered that he has a history of polysubstance abuse, was admitted to [**Hospital 792**]Hospital in the past few weeks after an episode of intoxication, thought to have taken PCP and [**Hospital 30148**], with possible other co-ingestions at that time.
After discussion with his mother he has had multiple episodes of stopping his lithium in the past, and recently has been doing several different drugs.
His mother states that in [**State 87616**] his tox screen was positive for cocaine, methamphetamines and alcohol, she also says that she knows that he has been doing [**State 30148**] and possibly PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 15925**].
Toxicology was consulted who felt that this fit with a sympathomimetic clinical picture, they recommended avoiding further haldol given that it can lower the seizure threshold, sedation with benzodiazepines, and further work up of his acid base status.
A head CT was done that preliminarily did not show any acute ICH, fracture or other acute process.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease seen (excellent-quality study).
In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.
No evidence of DVT within the right upper extremity.
Clinical picture was consistent with a sympathomimetic toxidrome, however tox screen was initially negative for methamphetamines.
He was stable, without symptoms of intoxication or withdrawal.
He remained without leukocytosis.
He was found to have a palpable cord in his RUE at an IV insertion site; the line was removed and Ultrasound revealed superficial venous thrombosis.
ID consult was obtained; TTE was an excellent quality study showing no vegetations.
The cord is still palpable, and he has remained afebrile without signs or symptoms of infection.
Continued aggressive IVF hydration given risk for rhabdomyolysis, mildly elevated CK and U/A with large blood but 0-2 RBC??????s.
He likely had mild rhabdomyolysis and by the time of discharge, his creatinine was 0.9.
He remained without any hallucinations or racing thoughts, and he will follow up with Psychiatry as an outpatient.
You developed a superficial phlebitis (superficial venous clot) which we do not believe is currently infected, but you did have one positive blood culture so you will need 4 weeks of IV antibiotics.
Please insure that you inspect your right arm regularly and seek medication attention for redness, warmth, swelling or pain at the site of the superficial clot in your right arm.
On the day of discharge you had been afebrile and without evidence of infection; please ensure that you see your PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] visit to insure the you remain in good health.
