Past Medical History: depression  Social History: Pt is married and has 2 children  Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: T: 97.4  HR: 74  BP: 138/82  RR: 17  93% RA Gen: no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric, neck supple, no masses Card: regular rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended Ext: no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, bivalved short arm cast intact on right upper extremity, pt unable to abduct or elevate left shoulder greater than 30 degrees Neuro: CNII-XII grossly intact, pt reports tingling and burning over left shoulder  Pertinent Results: TRAUMA #2 (AP CXR & PELVIS PORT)  [**2183-9-1**] 5:46 PM IMPRESSION: Unremarkable trauma series.
No evidence of soft tissue injury within the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
Mild anterior wedge compression fractures involving T10 through T12.
Nondisplaced spinous process fractures of T9 and T10.
Minimally displaced right posterior rib fractures of T9 through T11.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-9-1**] 5:58 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS  [**2183-9-1**] 6:21 PM CONCLUSION: No radiographic evidence to suggest that there is a vascular injury or other area of hemodynamically significant stenosis present.
Fractures involving the posterior elements of T9 and T10, without evidence of epidural hematoma.
Mild compression fractures involving T10 through T12.
Multiple right-sided posterior rib fractures.
MRA NECK W&W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-9-2**] 4:18 AM CONCLUSION: No definite sign for luminal compromise of the right vertebral artery at the level of the C1 fracture.
MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-9-2**] 4:18 AM CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the possibility of multiple sites of soft tissue injury, but without clearly identifiable focal ligamentous disruption or alignment abnormality of the spine identified.
SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) TRAUMA LEFT  [**2183-9-2**] 6:46 PM IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of an acute bony injury.
HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT PORT  [**2183-9-3**] 5:42 PM IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of an acute bony injury.
Soft tissue swelling is seen dorsally, at the level of the metacarpals.
MR BRACHIAL PLEXUS W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-9-7**] 9:03 AM IMPRESSION: Traumatic injury of the left anterior scalene muscle with edema surrounding the muscle and the brachial plexus posteriorly, just superior to the thoracic outlet.
The brachial plexus fibers are grossly intact, however, evaluation is slightly limited by patient motion.
Edema within the teres minor and deltoid muscle without muscle atrophy.
Susceptibility artifact in the superior glenoid extends into the spinoglenoid notch.
Per neurosurgery's recommendations, the patient was treated with a hard c-collar at all times (for 6 weeks), log-roll precautions, and an MRI/MRA of the pt's neck was performed to rule out carotid & vertebral artery injury.
It was found that the patient had a 5th metacarpal dislocation.
This injury was managed with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning and short arm cast on HD8.
Orthopaedic surgery was consulted for the pt's left shoulder numbness and weakness.
MR of the brachial plexus and shoulder demonstrated an injury to the left anterior scalene muscle.

Disp:*qs ML(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 1110**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p [**Location 75131**]biking crash Right C1 transverse process fracture Right posterior rib fracture T9-T12 Anterior wedge compression fractures T10-T12 Nondisplaced spinous process fractures T9-T10 Right 5th metacarpal dislocation   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after your mountain biking accident and were found to have fractures in your cervical and thoracic spine as well in your 9th-11th right ribs.
Because of persistent dislocation of your right fifth finger, you had a pinning of your right fifth finger and a cast was placed.
Because of left shoulder numbness & weakness you had an MRI which showed traumatic injury of your scalene muscle but no obvious injury to the nerves (brachial plexus).
You should see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] in [**2-2**] weeks for your shoulder pain and weakness.
You may require an additional test known as an EMG if your weakness persists.
