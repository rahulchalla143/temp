Admission Date:  [**2156-6-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-7-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Speach difficulties  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Iv tpa  History of Present Illness: 50 RHM w/ hx multiple prior strokes (one [**2152**] sx of sig language difficulty, requiring long term speech tx, and mem problems, one [**3-11**] with sx of vertigo, transient diplopia and left arm weakness) DM, HTN, HLD, AF, not on coumadin [**1-5**] job w/ BPD, and CRF (Cre ~2.0), was at home, talking with his wife, heated some pizza, and got distracted by some nails sticking up on the deck that he felt needed hammering.
Despite her urges to remain seated on the ground, the pt stood up, ate more pizza (wife suggests he may have been thinking his sugar was low), and walked to the living room without report of ataxia, though his wife suggested he was bumping into things on the L.  In the living room, he finally sat down, but continued to have dysarthric speech, difficulty producing coherent language, and a possible R facial droop.
In the ER he received a CT/CTA/CT perf with CT head showing several areas of old hypodensities (one prominently in the R occipital area, one in the L parietal ares, and a small L capsular one) and CT Perf showed an area in the left frontal lobe with proolnged MTT but relatively normal CBV, suggestive of an ischemic penumbra, probably in the territory of the superior div of the L-MCA.
Due to his significant deficit and rapid arrival in the ER, risks and benefits of IV tPA were discussed w/ pt and his wife and they opted to accept this tx.

Speech is largely non-fluent though has periods of fluency for short phrases.
No dysarthria.
Visual fields w/o BTT on R. Extraocular movements cross midline bilaterally, no nystagmus.
No observed myoclonus or tremor No pronator drift Strength appears full in the UE and LE B/L.
Toes appear down but withdraws bilaterally  Coordination: no gross ataxia  Gait: deferred    Pertinent Results: CT/ CTA/ CTP:  1.
Large acute infarction in the left frontal lobe.
Large acute infarction in the left parietal lobe, which is shown to also involve the left posterior temporal and lateral occipital lobes on current MRI.
Both of these infarctions are located in the left internal carotid artery territory, given the fetal configuration of the posterior cerebral arteries.
Multiple chronic infarctions as described above.
No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses or occlusions in the intracranial circulation.
Mild cervical carotid atherosclerosis without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis.
Chronic left maxillary sinusitis with atelectasis and wall sclerosis.
Enlarged inferior left thyroid lobe with questionable nodularity.
Two large acute infarctions in the left cerebral hemisphere, both in the territory supplied by the left internal carotid artery, given the fetal configuration of the left posterior cerebral artery.
Chronic infarctions in the left parietal, right parietal, and right occipital lobes, as well as in the right cerebellar hemisphere  ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild-moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

Due to his significant deficit and rapid arrival in the ER, risks and benefits of IV tPA were discussed w/ pt and his wife and they opted to accept this treatment.
He recieved t PA therapy, and he was admitted to neuro ICU for close monitering.
he was started on coumadin and Heparin SQ was conrinued for DVT prophylaxix.
Heparin IV was not considered given recent t PA and small bleed.
