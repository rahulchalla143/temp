Patient notes acute onset of RUQ sharp, stabbing abdominal pain while watching TV.
Cannot say if changes with food as she has not been able to tolerate any po intake since onset of pain as also associated with nausea and vomiting of all po intake.
Denies chills or nightsweats.
She notes watery diarrhea for the last day as well but denies any melena, or hematochezia.
During that admission she was ruled out for MI with serial enzymes.
She had a normal BNP despite LE edema and crackles.
Her peripheral edema was eventually attributed to renal dysfunction given >100 protein on U/A.
During her admission she also had unexplained anemia requiring blood transfusion.
During that admission she was also found to have diffuse ground-glass opacities in the lung apices and a right lower lobe ground glass nodule with some mildly enlarged mediastinum lymph nodes of unclear significance.
Lipase elevated at 63 (last normal 10/[**2104**]).
Electrolytes normal with exception of glu of 209, BUN of 30 (cr 1.1), and elevated K 5.8 which improved to 4.9 with kayexalate, Cagluc, bicarb, and humalog.
U/A not c/w infection but 100 protein and 1000 glucose.
CT abdomen (w/o contrast d/t reported allergy) showed no abnormalities with exception of known lung abnormalities seen on most recent admission, and were stable.
On the floor, she is sleeping comfortably but upon arousal, complains of significant abdominal pain.
On further ROS, she notes 1 wk of dysuria as well as 2 wks of foul smelling urine.
Also notes new LE edema over the last day although review of OMR notes LE edema at the time of her last admission.

minimal RUQ TTP, No rebound or guarding.
1+ edema to sacrum, decreased LE sensation and pulses.
Pertinent Results: CT abdomen [**2105-3-11**]: no appy, diverticulitis, or bowel obstruction.
13mm ground glass nodule in the right lung base, which has been stable since [**2104-11-3**].
RUQ u/s [**3-11**]: Liver displays normal echogenic pattern and architecture without focal mass lesion identified.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation with the common duct measuring 6 mm (may be normal in a post cholecystectomy patient).
No right upper quadrant ascites is present.
S/p cholecystectomy without evidence of retained stone.
L LE ultrasound [**2105-3-12**]: No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.
Subcutaneous edema in the left calf.
Localized erythema, congestion and erosion of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the antrum.
These findings are compatible with erosive gastritis.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Elevated resistive indices of the intraparenchymal vessels suggest chronic parenchymal disease.
MRV [**2105-3-21**]: Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava below the IVC filter, extending into both common iliac veins.
IVC Gram [**2105-3-24**]: Large amount of thrombus in the IVC extending to the external iliac veins bilaterally.
During this procedure, the patient developed throat tightness and hypoxia after infusion of TPA through the AngioJet and dropped O2 saturations to the low 80s.
It is believed that her symptoms during the case represented either PE or contrast reaction.
Echo [**2105-3-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-3-20**], no change.
No retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis, and ground-glass opacity, most consistent with pulmonary edema.
CXR [**2105-3-27**]: CHF and underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be totally excluded.
Bilateral LENI [**2105-3-30**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

Course complicated by peripheral edema, hypotension, prerenal ARF due to large IVC filter clot, s/p attempted thrombolysis and initiation of anticoagulation.
GI was consulted and performed EGD, which showed findings consistent with diabetic gastroparesis and erosive gastritis.
Pt had persistent symptoms of pain, nausea/vomiting thoughtout the admission, with fluctuating ability to tolerate POs.
# IVC thrombus: During pt's workup for abdominal pain, she was noted to have worsening peripheral edema.
Heart failure and liver disease were ruled out, as were amlodipine, thyroid abnormalities, hypoalbuminemia, and nephrotic syndrome.
Abdominal ultrasound showed patent renal and portal vasculature.
[**Name (NI) 79481**] pt suffered from respiratory distress peri-procedure concerning for anaphylaxis (although received prophylactic solumedrol, benadryl) vs showering of emboli (although filter in place).
Pt was then monitored in the ICU while her SOB and hypoxia spontaneously improved.
Pt underwent bilateral LENIs without visualization of femoral clots or revascularization.
# Acute Renal Insufficiency: In the setting of repeated hypotension (thought to be due to poor venous return in the setting of IVC filter clot), pt developed prerenal acute renal failure, peaking at a Cr of 2.5.
Attempted fluid repletion worsened peripheral edema, but seemed to not improve pt's hypotension.
At no point during pt's severe [**Doctor First Name **] sarca, did pt develop pulmonary edema or respiratory distress and thus sht was allowed to self regulate and slowly improved her blood pressure and then renal function.
Blood pressure eventually provided room for diuresis, which was done with daily Lasix 20mg IV.
Renal function returned to baseline prior to discharge and was 1.3 on [**2105-4-5**].
Hypoxia - Pt's baseline oxygen saturation was mid 90s on room air.
This was thought to be due to known ground glass opacities, obesity hypoventilation, and likely OSA.
Differential included showering of emboli in setting of thrombolysis, vs anaphylaxis to contrast exposure.
Pt showed no signs of infections on CXR or symptomatically thus was only treated with antibiotics very shortly.
As per prior plan, pt should have follow up imaging of her ground glass opacities in [**2104-7-6**], 6 month after their initial diagnosis.
# Hypercoagulability: Pt carried the diagnosis of protein C deficiency from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital.
Pt was confirmed to NOT be protein C deficient, or have any other hypercoagulability syndrome.
As pt's filter has been in place for approximately 9 months, and is not possible to remove, she will likely need lifelong anticoagulation to prevent clot extension or reformation.
Workup did incidentally note a slightly low IgG, which may be due to current infection and heme-onc recommended repeat in 6wks.
Her anemia studies showed normal MCV, elevated RDW with severe iron deficiency, and inappropriate retic count.
Etiology of iron deficiency remained unclear, and pt was recommended to under go an outpatient colonoscopy once able to tolerate bowel prep.
Pt required pRBC transfusion for several episodes of Hct drop <21, which she tolerated well.
She was treated initially with flagyl, and then due to worsened nausea and vomiting was switched to PO vancomycin to complete the 14 day course.
She was also put on the BRAT diet and ordered TID yogurt for probiotics, Pt remained afebrile, without leukocytosis and with benign abdomen throughout the course of the C diff infection.
# Guaic positive stools: Pt was noted to have guaiac positive stools in setting of epistaxis, c diff, gastritis and iron repletion.
Given known iron deficiency anemia, recommended for pt to have a colonoscopy.
However due to inability to tolerate POs, and poor renal function, pt was unable to tolerate colonoscopy prep as an inpt.
She was thus known to have non-obstructive CAD on recent cath.
Also recent normal ECHO and stress test.
Pt had recurrent, almost nightly, chest pain, not thought to be cardiac in origin (repeated EKG unchanged, CEs neg).
# DM1: Pt's type 1 diabetes was monitored with QID finger sticks and treated with escalating doses of lantus and sliding scale to parallel her increasing PO intake.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Diabetic Gastroparesis IVC thrombosis C Difficile colitis Urinary tract infection  Secondary: DM I Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable, INR 1.9   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
You also developed severe peripheral edema, thought to be due to a large clot on your IVC filter.
You also developed a diarrhea that is called C. Difficile.
You also had multiple repeated episodes of chest pain.
The most likey cause is GI disease such as heart burn, esophageal spasm or gastritis.
You were also noted to have bloody stools as well as severe iron deficiency anemic.
Although we repleted your iron, you will need to continue iron at home, and follow up with gastroenterology to have a colonoscopy in the near future.
