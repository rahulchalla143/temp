This did not show any evidence of bleeding.
He became hemodynamically stable and he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**], where he had a bleeding scan, EGD, upper GI series and a small bowel follow through.
He then underwent a bleeding scan at [**Hospital1 69**], which was negative for acute bleeding, but which showed pooling blood.
He then underwent an angiography in an attempt to identify the bleeding vessels.
Angiography was also undertaken to identify the bleeding vessel to guide surgical intervention and to attempt occlusion of the bleeding vessel.
At intervention radiology/angiography, the bleeding vessel was identified, however, attempted occlusion of this bleeding blood vessel was unsuccessful.
Intraoperatively, Mr. [**Known lastname **] received 7.2 liters crystalloid, had an estimated blood loss of 500 cc and urine output of 350 cc.
Incidental finding at the time of surgery was that Mr. [**Known lastname **] was asplenic, presumably because his spleen had been removed at the time of his prior surgery for bleeding diverticula-a right hemicolectomy.
The procedure was without complication.
Mr. [**Known lastname 6237**] past medical history was significant for diverticulosis with recurrent lower GI bleeding for which he was treated with a right hemicolectomy in [**2156**] at an outside hospital.
Past medical history also was significant for hypertension, glaucoma, rheumatic heart disease and hemorrhoids.
ALLERGIES:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had no known drug allergies.
This was intended to augment the normal diuresis of third space fluid following his surgery.
But, he continued to have mild to moderate abdominal distention with minimal tenderness.
Portable chest x-ray taken at that time showed no pneumonia, but some suggestion of pulmonary edema.
