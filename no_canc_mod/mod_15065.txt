PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile at 97.9 degrees.
Cardiovascular examination was significant for irregularly irregular rate.
The lung examination revealed hoarse breath sounds with transmitted sounds and end expiratory wheezing.
A Vac dressing applied over two enterocutaneous fistulae in the lower quadrants and a third enterocutaneous fistula through the mesh in the right abdominal area.

Postoperatively, the patient had supraventricular tachycardia and Cardiology Service was consulted again and this was controlled with intravenous Lopressor, digoxin and amiodarone.
Towards the end of his hospital stay, the patient had an episode of bradycardia and this was resolved with discontinuation of amiodarone and decrease in the dose of Lopressor.
Respiratory system:  The patient has a history of long-standing severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
