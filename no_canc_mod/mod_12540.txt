The pregnancy was notable decreased growth two weeks prior to the delivery.
There was no history of maternal hypertension and the patient's mother did receive one dose of betamethasone prior to delivery.
Was intubated in the Delivery Room for poor effort.
The skin was without any lesions.
There was bilateral red reflex noted.
The lungs had coarse crackly breath sounds bilaterally.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly.
The patient did have conventional ventilation settings that have remained high even to date.
The patient developed bilateral pleural effusions that seemed to be related to leakage of parenteral nutrition.
The PICC line came from below and had no access to the chest cavity itself and the IVC was below the diaphragm, however, the fluid that was tapped from the right and drained from the left with a chest tube on [**11-23**], was consistent with parenteral nutrition.
The patient has not had any further reaccumulation of pleural effusions.
until [**12-16**], when it was discontinued because of little perceived benefit.
However, the patient did have an episode where he his chest was tight with poor aeration that appeared to respond to Combivent.
As a result, Combivent was restarted on [**1-13**], with what seemed to be a positive result.
The patient, for chronic lung disease management, was started on a trial of Lasix on [**12-7**], and was changed over to Diuril on [**12-9**] and to this day remains on Diuril 40 mg per kilo per day in an effort to help improve the chronic lung disease.
In an effort to improve the need for extremely high ventilator settings and chronic lung disease management, inhaled Beclomethasone was started on [**2103-1-11**], with eight puffs q. four hours.
Currently, [**Known lastname 5621**] [**Known lastname 37227**] is on ventilator settings of 28/7 with a rate of 28, remains on Diuril, Aldactone, and dexamethasone for his chronic lung disease management as well as fluid restrictions.
CARDIOLOGY:  [**Known lastname 5621**] had his first cardiac echocardiogram on [**2102-11-10**].
This echocardiogram report showed a large PDA with a dilated left and right atrium with good left and right ventricular function and also a patent foraminal valve.
The patient has never had any other evidence of a PDA and currently does not have a murmur.
Line access initially did include a UAC, UVC and has had a peripheral arterial line as well as PICC as mentioned above.
The patient was hypotensive at least initially and was started on Dopamine shortly after birth with a peak Dopamine requirement of 20 micrograms per kilo per minute which was weaned fairly rapidly after the PDA was closed and the Dopamine was discontinued on [**2102-11-17**].
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was initially NPO, was started on D10 and then advanced to parenteral nutrition due to concerns of sepsis in addition to PDA and courses of Indomethacin.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had the initial problems with sepsis which I will detail in the next subsection as well as being PN dependent for the first three to four weeks of life and has subsequently had a rise in his both total and direct bilirubin as well as his liver function tests.
The patient was started on phenobarbital for elevated bilirubin on [**1-4**], and seemed to have a good response.
They also asked for urine for CMV which was sent today, [**1-16**], and depending upon the results of the HIDA Scan they would consider starting Ursodiol.
The patient has not had any overt signs of reflux and has been fed over two to three hours, not necessarily for concerns of reflux, but rather due to problems with sugars.
There has not been a pH probe or an upper GI done to this point.
Due to dilated loops and a distended abdomen and concerns about NEC, Clindamycin was added and the patient remained on Ampicillin, Gentamicin and Clindamycin for the first 14 days of life.
A subsequent rule out sepsis was performed in the end of [**Month (only) 404**], on [**12-19**] to [**12-22**]; the patient was on Vancomycin and Gentamicin and the rule out sepsis turned out to be negative.
On [**2102-12-28**], after several days of increasing amounts of trachea aspirate and a color change from white to tan, a trachea aspirate culture was sent which showed moderate beta Strep as well as [**Known lastname 37228**] and antibiotics at that time were started.
A lumbar puncture obtained at that time was benign and was felt to be an isolated respiratory infection.
It was determined at that time to finish a 14 day course and then begin treatment for the chronic lung disease with the inhaled steroids.
Head ultrasound number one was done on [**11-13**], which showed a left Grade III intraventricular hemorrhage.
Head ultrasound number two on [**11-16**], showed mild retraction of the clot with no further dilatation.
Head ultrasound number five on [**12-16**], showed a resolving clot with a recommendation for follow-up in one month.
Head ultrasound number six on [**1-12**], was essentially normal with a small choroid plexus cyst and lateral ventricles that were within the normal range but more prominent that the slit appearance that was present on the [**12-12**] scan.
OPHTHALMOLOGY FINDING:  The first eye examination on [**12-20**] showed a Stage I, Zone I, with two clock hours bilaterally.
Respiratory distress syndrome, now Chronic lung disease.
Patent ductus arteriosus, s/p Indocin.
9.  r/o gastrointestinal reflux.
Resolved left Grade III intraventricular hemorrhage.
Retinopathy of Prematurity.
