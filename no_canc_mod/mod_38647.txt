She noted decreased urine output over the previous 4 days as well as fatigue.
Per report, pt had recently started Klonopin and had decreased PO intake with some nausea and vomiting.
At [**Hospital1 **], patient was found to be in ARF with elevated Cr to 8.0 (from 0.9) and K of 6.8 but no EKG changes.
Patient was subsequently transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she was given 1 amp of bicarbonate, 70mg of Kayexalate, NS x 1 L, CaCl, insulin 10 units with dextrose.
She was intubated for airway protection and acidosis management.
She was put on IV fluids with HCO3 for her ARF and acidosis.
Her hyperkalemia was managed with Calcium, Insulin and Dextrose, and Kayexelate, and her potassium normalized.
Arthritis - on methadone for pain 2.
Asthma 3.
Diabetes Mellitus - oral antihyperglycemics 4.
R sided heart failure from pulm HTN 7.
Cholelithiasis - recent bout of cholecystitis, tx w/ abx, needs ccy 8.

Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: 97.7 94/45 17 97 [**Telephone/Fax (1) 107364**] getting intubated General: obese female, opening eyes to voice, following commands, incoherent, HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, clear OP Neck: obese, no JVD visualized CV: distant HS, rrr Lungs: CTAB/L anteriorly ABd: larger protruberant, soft, no fluid wave, non-distended extremities: mild edema, no cyanosis, no evidence of rash or cellulitis.
F with morbid obesity, OSA, DM2 who presented with mental status changes from ARF with hyperkalemia and acidosis.
# ARF - Etiology likely prerenal from dehydration, although NSAID use may suggest intrinsic component.
Patient was educated re: need to watch hydration when taking lasix and she was discharged on a low dose (lasix 40mg po bid) to prevent recurrence of prerenal failure.
# Respiratory distress-- patient was intubated for acidosis that did not respond to IV bicarb as well as airway protection given her poor mental status.
During her hospitalization, she returned to her baseline oxygen requirement of 2L nasal cannula at night and intermittently during the day.
She did not have EKG changes.
# Acidosis--was felt to be both metabolic from her renal failure and respiratory from her baseline hypoventilation/CO2 retention.
# Chest pain--patient had an episode of chest pressure which she says was brought on by anxiety.
- Cardiac enzymes negative x 2, no EKG ST segment changes - pt was given oxygen, morphine, and aspirin while being ruled out for MI - pt has no h/o MI, states that she often experiences chest pressure during episodes of stress .
# Anxiety - on Celexa - started Clonazepam 0.5 mg PO BID PRN--discharged on 1mg Clonazepam in accordance with OMR record.
# Hypernatremia--most likely secondary to post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis.
Patient was given 1/2 NS and her hypernatremia resolved.
# BP - hypertensive at baseline, but metoprolol and lisinopril were held during admission to prevent renal damage and b/c her systolic BP was <120 during her stay.
# OSA/obesity hypoventilation - pt was maintained on inhalers during her stay.
# Arthritis--patient takes methadone 10mg [**Hospital1 **] at home--this was held during hospital stay because of her altered mental status.
Clonazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for anxiety.
