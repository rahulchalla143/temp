History of Present Illness: This is a 52-year-old woman with a history of IDDM Type II complicated by nephropathy and neuropathy, CHF with LVEF of 30%, HTN, HLD, CAD s/p CABG x2 complicated by sternal wound abscess (MSSA/MRSA), CKD, HIT and COPD recently discharged from [**Hospital 87678**] on [**2169-6-15**] presenting with subdural hematoma, acute renal failure and altered mental status.
Patient was admitted to MEEI for endophthalmitis panophthalmitis and L sinus disease treated empirically with Vanco/Ceftaz/Levofloxacin while inpatient at [**Hospital 13128**].
ENT evaluated patient and drained maxillary sinus which grew MSSA and VSE.
CT chest showed possible phlegmon of lower portion of chest surgery wound but seen by CT surgery who did not feel there was concern for sternal wound infection.
Her course was also complicated by ARF [**3-16**] supratherapetic Vancomycin levels, continued leukocytosis (WBC 16), LUE superficla clot, lymphadenopathy noted on abdominal CT of uncertain significance, polyarticular pain for which she was seen by rheumatology (thought to have gout though crystals not found on knee arthrocentesis).
She was having auditory and visual hallucinations.
On eval at OSH, CT head showed small tentorial SDH and so was transferred here for neurosurgery evaluation.
Plan to admit to medicine for multiple medical problems and further workup of AMS and plan for rescan with NCHCT in 24hrs."
Nursing staff indicates patient was experiencing l eye blurry from recent infxn being treated with erythromcyin and cipro drop.
Mild right nasolabial fold flattening and asterixis.
Otherwise unable to give reliable history due to altered mental status.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 52-year-old woman with a history of DM2 c/b nephropathy and neuropathy, CHF with LVEF of 30%, CAD s/p CABG x2, CKD, recent sinus infection c/b endopthalmitis, admitted for subdural hematoma, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, altered mental status, in the setting of supratherapeutic gabapentin levels, s/p hypertonic saline treatment with good response.
Urine sediment showed muddy brown casts suggesting ATN.
Other etiologies of renal failure include medication effect and AIN.
Etiologies of hyponatremia include renal failure and excessive fluid intake, decompensated heart failure, or medications.
# SUBDURAL HEMATOMA:  Patient fell at home likely in the setting of altered mental status.
She was taken to OSH where there was concern for subarachnoid bleed; upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], thought was that bleed was more consistent with subdural hemtoma.
# GABAPENTIN TOXICITY: patient's gabapentin level was 41 on this admission, which was likely related to her acute on chronic kidney disease.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The patient initially presented with confusion, hallucinations and associated muscle twitching.
Unclear whether it seeded from her sinus infection or from other source (?sternal wound infection)  Patient was continued on eye drops and antibiotics.
# PANCYTOPENIA:  Likely in setting of prolonged Linezolid course.
Patient was admitted on levofloxacin and linezolid for endopthalmitis (course was to be finished on [**7-4**]).
The linezolid may have also been contributing to patient's peripheral eosinophilia.
# EOSINOPHILIA:  Etiology not completely clear, but possibly in the setting of Linezolid.
# CHF: Systolic CHF with LVEF of 30%, no evidence of acute exacerbation on admission.
Likely ischemic etiology given multiple PCIs and 2 CABGs most recently [**2167**].
Her echo showed no significant changes from prior.
# DM II: complicated by nephropathy and neuropathy.
# LYMPHADENOPATHY:  Per d/c summary from Mass Eye & Ear, she had CT abdomen that showed lymphadenopathy.
# PULMONARY HYPERTENSION: Evidence from Echo.

You were admitted to the hospital because you experienced confusion and hallucinations, and  you fell and hit your head.
You were found to have acute kidney injury, low sodium level, and a brain bleed (subdural hematoma).
Your symptoms improved and you were no longer confused.
This medication can build up in your body if you have kidney problems.
EPIPEN: Use once intramuscularly as needed for anaphylactic reaction to daptomycin.
