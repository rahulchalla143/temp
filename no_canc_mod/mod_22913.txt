Admission Date:  [**2120-11-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-11-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-7-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**] Chief Complaint: Thoracic Aortic Ulcer, acute renal failure (bilateral stenosis)   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Angiogram with angioplasty/stenting of renal arteries [**2120-11-15**]   History of Present Illness:  68 y/o F with a past medical history of hypertension, non-alcoholic pancreatitis presented to an OSH on [**11-9**] with sudden-onset [**7-16**] back pain radiating to the epigastrum.
CT scan done showed a probable type B aortic dissection.
CT scan done here showed intra-aortic intramural hematomas, penetrating ulcer in aortic arch, and significant right renal artery stenosis/thrombosis.
Patient became oligutic during the day on [**11-10**], and creatinine increased to 2.0 this morning.
Neck: No masses, Trachea midline, No masses or nodules, No right carotid bruit, No left carotid bruit.
Nodes: No clavicular/cervical adenopathy, No inguinal adenopathy.
Skin: No atypical lesions.
Gastrointestinal: Non distended, No masses, Guarding or rebound, No hepatosplenomegally, No hernia, No AAA.
Extremities: No popiteal aneurysm, No femoral bruit/thrill, No RLE edema, No LLE Edema, No varicosities, No skin changes.
High density within the wall of the aorta, on correlation with the recent CT, imaging features are suggestive of an intramural hematoma.
Delayed excretion of contrast from the left kidney consistent with renal dysfunction.
No hydronephrosis and no perinephric fluid collection identified.
Penetrating ulcer within the arch of the aorta with an associated intramural hematoma, which arises below the level of the left subclavian artery (type B).
Tight stenosis of the right renal artery and a small right kidney is present.
Mild stenosis of the left (lower) renal artery.
US No evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis in both lower extremities.
No hydronephrosis and no perinephric fluid collection identified.
For her worsening renal failure (given rising Cr and oliguria), renal consulted and likely etiology contrast nephropathy with chronic renal stenosis.
Her hospital stay can be summarized by the following review of systems -  Neuro: Pt pain controlled with iv and oral narcotics.
Pulm: Pt with h/o COPD and exhibited some hypoxia during hospital course - unclear etiology but responded with nebulizer treatments.
Cardio: BP control critical in setting of intramural hematoma and bilateral renal artery stenosis.
LENI did not show any DVT's for concerns that PE was causing her respiratory hypoxia.
However, she was weaned to room air on discharge with no other symptoms.

Disp:*40 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Penetrating ulcer in aortic arch and intramural hematoma Bilateral renal artery stenosis, acute/chronic renal failure HTN COPD   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Lower Extremity Angioplasty/Stent Discharge Instructions  Medications: ??????
You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post procedure pain or discomfort  What to expect when you go home: It is normal to have slight swelling of the legs: ??????
Elevate your leg above the level of your heart (use [**1-10**] pillows or a recliner) every 2-3 hours throughout the day and at night ??????
Avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting without your legs elevated ??????
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing or band aid over the area that is draining, as needed ??????
Numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions ??????
Bleeding from groin puncture site  SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site) ??????
You will be discharged on new anti-hypertensives and any concerns of light headedness or low blood pressure (< 90) will warrant an emergency department visit or phone [**Name6 (MD) 138**] to M.D.
Do not continue lisinopril for concerns of worsening renal failure in the acute setting.
