Admission Date:  [**2119-11-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-12-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-11-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**] Chief Complaint: code stroke minimally responsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -PEG tube placement -intubation x2   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 57 yo woman with a negative previous medical history, obesity, who presents [**2119-11-21**] after being found in the parking lot with R hemiparesis.
There was no movement on the right side.
There were no meds in her purse.
Sister was able to tell us over the phone that she has no known HTN, no HL, no meds, no OCP, no smoking/ETOH or drugs.
No tob, no etoh.
Family History: HTN and high cholesterol in family; however, sister admits that nobody in her family goes to doctor.
Physical Exam: VS:    T:    BP:   hard to measure - then 170 to 260 over palp P: 120's    RR:      O2 sat:  80's to 70's RA General: patient actively vomiting and airway being protected by primary team.
Appears overwght, well perfused, with no spontaneous movemnts on the right.
MS: not answering any questions, no discernible speech, even when not having emesis, looks at my facewhen I am on the left side of bed for a second to command, but she also has a L gaze preference, so it is not entirely clear if she is following my command.
No midline commands.
Exam upon discharge: awake, alert, following simple commands, non-verbal, but seems to understand well PERL, limited tracking, R-facial droop, severe dysphagia Dense R-hemiplegia; able to move L side spontaneously Sensory exam intact to noxious (localized on L; withdraws some on R)  Pertinent Results: [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   PLT COUNT-315 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   PT-12.0 PTT-18.5* INR(PT)-0.9 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   WBC-13.1* RBC-5.18 HGB-15.2 HCT-43.0 MCV-83 MCH-29.3 MCHC-35.3* RDW-13.5 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   WBC-13.1* RBC-5.18 HGB-15.2 HCT-43.0 MCV-83 MCH-29.3 MCHC-35.3* RDW-13.5 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   ALBUMIN-4.4 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   CK-MB-3 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   ALT(SGPT)-36 AST(SGOT)-33 CK(CPK)-121 ALK PHOS-81 [**2119-11-21**] 05:40PM   GLUCOSE-268* UREA N-13 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-136 POTASSIUM-4.7 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-19 [**2119-11-21**] 09:45PM URINE  bnzodzpn-NEG barbitrt-NEG opiates-NEG cocaine-NEG amphetmn-NEG mthdone-NEG [**2119-11-21**] 09:45PM URINE  HOURS-RANDOM .
There is diffuse bilateral alveolar airspace opacification.
There is no pneumothorax.
Initial CT [**11-20**]: FINDINGS: There is a large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the left basal ganglia which measures 6.2 x 2.5 cm.
There is also blood within the bilateral lateral ventricles and also a small amount of blood within the third ventricle.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus and the ventricles are of normal size.
There is minimal shift of the midline structures to the right side.
There is no evidence of uncal herniation or herniation of the tonsils.
There is calcification of the right vertebral artery.
Examination of the bone windows demonstrates normal aeration of the visualized portions of the mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses.
Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the region of the left basal ganglia, with intraventricular extension.
MRI/A BRAIN [**11-23**]: FINDINGS: Again seen is a large acute hemorrhage likely centered in the left lentiform nucleus with effacement of the left lateral ventricle and minimal shift of normally midline structures to the right.
Of note, there is a linear focus of hemorrhage in the left anterior temporal lobe consistent with a developmental venous anomaly.
While some of these foci likely represent subarachnoid blood, many foci appear intraparenchymal.
TECHNIQUE: 3D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
No aneurysms are identified and no area of significant stenosis is seen.
IMPRESSION: Large acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage likely centered in the left lentiform nucleus.
Numerous foci of susceptibility, especially in the cerebral hemispheres, consistent with micro-hemorrhages.
Overall, these findings are suggestive of a hypertensive etiology.
However, given the presence of a developmental venous anomaly in the left temporal lobe adjacent to the intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the presence of multiple cavernous malformations is a consideration.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical  quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Worsening bibasilar opacities, most likely due to a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
She had gone to lunch around 3pm, and was found in her car about an hour later with emesis and right sided weakness.
Then in the ICU around 10pm she became hypotensive to 60's -> 90's with IVF and head down; started pressors.
Repeat head CT showed slight worsening of L-ICH.
Drop in pressure was either sepsis-related (with aspiration pna) or related to damage of insula and autonomic instability.
On [**11-21**], BP had stabilized and the pt was off pressors; CXR had demonstrated pulmonary edema, widened mediastinum thought related to volume overload/hilar infiltrates.
On [**11-23**] she underwent MRI/MRA of the brain which revealed many microhemorrhages on susceptibility; there was the question of a developmental venous anomaly in L anterior temporal lobe adjacent to the hemorrhage, as well as the question of multiple cavernous malformations.
On the night of [**2119-11-27**], cardiac telemetry demonstrated that the patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation for hours that did not respond to IV lopressor, diltiazem drip, amiodarone, or esmolol.
With respiratory distress, RAF was thought potentially related to pulmonary edema versus pneumonia.
She was started on linezolid for VRE positivity and spiking temps, wbc ct 14.5, and for pus at the site of one of her lines (which was replaced).
Given her history of pulmonary edema, i/o should be monitored closely and she should be diuresed if needed.
A PEG tube was placed on [**12-6**] as the patient continued to have severe dysphagia.
Tubefeeds were resumed and fluid boluses were given to treat a hypernatremia (but watch out for pulmonary edema).
Acetaminophen 650 mg Suppository Sig: [**11-27**] Suppositorys Rectal Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever .
