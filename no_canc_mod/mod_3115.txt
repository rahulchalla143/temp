Micro data: [**2197-12-4**] 3:56 am BRONCHIAL WASHINGS                             **FINAL REPORT [**2197-12-6**]**    GRAM STAIN (Final [**2197-12-4**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
**FINAL REPORT [**2197-12-8**]**    WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2197-12-8**]):    No significant growth.
Developing right upper lobe infiltrate.
Continued bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
Findings concerning for mild congestive failure.
There is a clear connection, however, into the stomach and no evidence for free air or free fluid.
No radiographic explanation for falling hematocrit.
Multiple incidental findings including right staghorn calculus, porcelain gallbladder, anasarca, bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, and severe atherosclerotic disease.
[**12-9**] CXR: Compared to the study from the prior day, there is increased vascular congestion and increased volume loss in both lower [**Known lastname **]s. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
Diffuse alveolar opacities are again seen.
# Blood from trach: Seems from clinical history provided by rehab that patient's secretions initially were "blood tinged" and progressed to frankly blood over the course of the day on [**12-3**].
Bronchoscopy on arrival to the ICU demonstrated bloody secretions which did not clear but became progressively bloodier making diffuse alveolar hemorrhage most likely diagnosis.
However, could also represent lesion near trach insertion but this is less likely given bronch findings.
Held aspirin and coumadin, reversed INR with FFP, Vitamin K PO, and then Vitamin K IV for refractory elevated INR.
# Anemia: Hct drop x3 since admission.
Initial drop explained by DAH.
Hct did not bump appropriately, found to have melena x1 and repeatedly giauac pos stool.
Hemolysis labs negative.
Enlarging hematoma in L arm, axilla, and anterior chest, but likely source of  Hct drop.
CT showed no intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
# Respiratory failure: Initial decompensation likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, although contribution of underlying pneumonia, fluid overload, and baseline [**Known lastname **] disease (?)
Of note, during prior admission patient was unsuccessfully extubated twice and could not be weaned off the vent after several attempts due to high RISBIs  and acidemia.
The patient continued to be ventilator dependent at her rehab facility and has failed trach mask and low pressure support ventilation during this admission b/c of very low tidal volumes (down to 130?????
Stenotrophomonis pneumonia treatment course completed.
Ecoli also isolated for PEG site culture and Urine culture.
# Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion secondary to blood loss and up titration of lasix at rehab and in MICU as creatinine has trended up over the past week per their records Higher bicarbonate level and FeUREA of 34% would support volume depletion as well.
Did have hematuria, but difficult to interpret in setting of indwelling foley, elevated INR.
On urine culture grew ceftriaxone-sensitive E.coli and antibiotic regimen was adjusted to cover.
Could also represent component of systemic process if DAH associated with Goodpasture's or Wegener's (however anti-GBM negative).
Staghorn R kidney stone noted on CT could be contributing.
VRE colonized in urine as well.
Initially improved after 3 days on vanco and after padded bandage placed between PEG and skin but has worsened over last 48 hours with increasingly purulent exudate around the tube.
No free intraperitoneal air was noted on CT. [**12-11**] repeat  EGD showed dobbhoff still post pyloric.
No stiches needed.
Cultures of discharge shown to be E.coli, also sensitive to ceftriaxone.
CT confirmed PEG placement, dobhoff placement and r/o free air (final read pending).
# Paroxysmal afib: The patient was recently started on coumadin at the rehab facility with INR now > 5 on coumadin 5 mg daily.
CHADs-2 score by my calculation only 1 due to age-not clear that patient has h/o hypertension or CHF and no documented h/o stroke or DM.
# Abdominal distension: NTTP.
CT w/PEG findings discussed above and porcelain gallbladder, but no evidence of intraperitoneal bleed or other intraabdominal process.
# Recent Stenotrophomonas VAP: Treated with Bactrim 250 mg IV q8h, stop date 12/5 per prior d/c summary.
# Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] who is HCP .
# Communication: With patient and son [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 17578**]([**Telephone/Fax (1) 17579**] cell .
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol [**Hospital1 **]: 2-4 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing.

You were found to have diffuse [**Known lastname **] injury termed diffuse aveolar hemmorhage.
The bleeding in your [**Known lastname **]s was stoped with reversing your coumadin.
You had acute renal failure from overdiuresis and blood loss.
You were found to have E. coli present in your [**Known lastname 17580**], over the PEG, and in the urine.
If you develop presistant fever, return of bloody secretions from your [**Known lastname 17580**], abdominal pain or return of pus from around the PEG site, dirrhea, please seek urgent medical attention.
