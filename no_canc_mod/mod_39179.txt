He was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital where he was stabilized and imaging revealed that he had a R posterior acetabular blowout fx and a L C2 pillar fx.

Lung volumes are markedly diminished.
Evidence of cervical fusion hardware is noted at the superior edge of the radiograph incompletely evaluated.
The costophrenic angles are difficult to assess due to overlying structures.
No large effusion or pneumothorax is noted on the supine radiograph.
No displaced fractures are evident.
Small bony fragments project also inferiorly in the joint space.
The sacrum likewise demonstrates no fracture.
There is baseline bony deformity of both femoral heads due to significant underlying degenerative disease.
IMPRESSION: Wide mediastinum with well-defined margins.
If there is concern for mediastinal vascular injury, cross-sectional imaging is advised.
There is at least the posterior wall of the right acetabulum fracture with likely subluxation to possible dislocation of the right femoral head.
Judet views or cross-sectional imaging advised.
Orthopedics was consulted for the acetabular fracture and was able to reduce his dislocated hip and placed traction pins while the patient was in the ED.
His hospital course is as follows by systems:  NEURO: There was concern for vertebral artery injury based on preliminary imaging.
Because of allergies to contrast and gadolinium he was unable to undergo a CTA, instead a non-contrast MRI/MRA of the neck was obtained which showed no acute vertebral artery injuries or dissection.
He will follow up in 2 weeks with Orthopedic Spine surgery.
PULM: He was left intubated postop from his ACDF due to the anesthesia team's concerns for laryngeal nerve damage and edema given the extensive instrumentation of his cervical spine.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: He underwent ORIF acetabular fracture, transverse posterior wall without any complications on [**2168-4-21**].
He is receiving Heparin SQ and compression boots for DVT prophylaxis.
