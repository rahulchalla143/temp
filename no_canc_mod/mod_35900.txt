Admission Date:  [**2149-12-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2149-12-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-12-2**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiac Intensive Care Unit  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 66-year-old Spanish speaking male with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, congestive obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary artery disease status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2147**], PTCA and stenting of the right coronary artery in [**2148-9-21**], PTCA of the left anterior descending artery in [**2149-7-21**], and inferior wall myocardial infarction with right ventricular infarction in [**2149-10-21**] with subsequent PTCA and stenting of the proximal right coronary artery, who presents with an episode of acute onset [**10-30**] substernal chest pain.
The patient reports acute onset of substernal chest pain with radiation down both arms.
The pain began approximately one hour prior to presentation.
Pain was associated with nausea, syncope, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, and chills.
The patient was transported to the Emergency Department by EMS and on route, was found to have a blood pressure of 60/palpation and complete heart block with a ventricular rate of 36.
In the Emergency Department, the patient complained of persistent chest pain and was found to have a blood pressure of 92/50, heart rate 37, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a 100% nonrebreather.
The patient's initial electrocardiogram demonstrated complete heart block with a sinus rate of 60 and junctional rate of 38, with ST elevations in the inferior leads and reciprocal ST depressions laterally.
The patient also demonstrated [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevation in right sided lead V4 consistent with right ventricular infarct.
Coronary artery disease with three-vessel disease status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery in [**2147**] with LIMA to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the OM, and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.
Also status post right coronary artery stenting x2 in [**2148-9-21**], status post left anterior descending artery PTCA in [**2149-7-21**] (80% stenosis distal to the LIMA touchdown), status post inferior wall myocardial infarction in [**2149-10-21**] with PTCA and stenting of a proximal right coronary artery total occlusion; the inferior wall myocardial infarction was just complicated by a right ventricular infarction with hypotension requiring intraaortic balloon pump and pressors.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor with a reaction of cough.
In general, the patient is an obese male lying at 30 degrees in no acute distress.
Anicteric sclerae.
Neck examination:  Notable for elevated jugular venous distention with no lymphadenopathy, supple.
Cardiovascular examination: Regular, rate, and rhythm with normal S1, S2, S4 with no murmurs or rubs.
