His course was complicated by a worsening pleural effusion thought to be [**2-6**] lymphatic tracking originating from the perinephric space.
Other complications include elevated troponins to 0.22 with normal CK and CKMB, and new TWI in V1-V3.
No report of chest pain.
Past Medical History: 1) Diabetes type 2 2) HTN 3) CRI (baseline 2.4), 4) CHF 5) CVA 6) Seizure disorder on Keppra, 7) Emphysema .

Ext: No edema Neurol: AOx2, not cooperative with neuro exam.
Pertinent Results: [**9-17**] Head CT: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Large area of encephalomalacia in the region of the right posterior cerebral artery territory, secondary to an old infarct.
No CT evidence to suggest acute major vascular territorial infarction, though if clinical suspicion is high for this entity, MRI would be more a superior diagostic imaging study.
[**9-18**] CXR: Persistent severe pulmonary edema with pleural effusions.
[**9-19**] CXR: Diffuse mild hydrostatic edema.
Linear right infrahilar opacity is likely anterior segment right upper lobe atelectasis.
Left lower lobe collapse also evident.
[**9-19**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D  or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with  normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve  leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild  (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation  is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate  pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**9-23**] EEG: Abnormal EEG due to a diffusely slowed record with two  distinct patterns of slowing seen suggesting a moderate to moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy.
No discharging features were seen.
[**9-23**] CXR: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left lower lobe atelectasis, and moderate pulmonary edema have all worsened since [**9-20**].
No pneumothorax.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads unchanged in their respective positions.
No pneumothorax.
Large bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis of the majority of the lower lobes of both lungs.
Subcapsular hemorrhage of the right kidney undergoing expected evolution but not changed insize from [**9-8**].
Left upper pole renal cyst with amorphous, but [**Known lastname **] calcifications, not entirely simple in appearance.
Further evaluation with ultrasound (patient has a pacemeaker) is recommended as this lesion was not entirely imaged on this study.
Coronary artery calcifications and calcifications of the aorta.

# MENTAL STATUS CHANGE - Patient's mental status improved signficantly after transfer to the floor.
The cause for his mental status changes was thought most likely secondary to ICU delerium and medication.
However, it was also thought that there could have been an effect of his high keppra dose and anticholinergic drugs.
There was no identifiable infection on blood cultures, CXRs, or urinalysis.
He was initially given Haldol at night to control his evening agitation but it was later weaned off.
# PLEURAL EFFUSION - His first thoracentesis removed 1.5 L but the pleural fluid removed was not sent for diagnostic testing.
He had reaccumulation of bilateral pleural effusions during the course of his admission.
The differential for the effusion was CHF versus malignancy but it seemed less likely to be CHF given normal systolic function seen on ECHO [**9-19**].
His pleural effusion was tapped again on [**2110-10-1**] for diagnostic purposes and fluid was sent for analysis.
Fluid analysis was suggestive of transudate with LDH ratio of 0.3, total protein ratio of 0.3, fluid LDH of 185.
There was concern for a malignant pleural effusion, possibly secondary to a mesothelioma not visualized on chest CT due to the large pleural effusions.
# BACTEREMIA - He had a coagulase neg staph grow out of 1 of 4 culture bottles on [**2110-9-17**] that was believed to be most likely a contaminant.
All subsequent cultures were negative and he remained afebrile without leukocytosis throughout admission.
# PERINEPHRIC HEMATOMA - He had embolization of one of the branches of his right renal artery by Interventional Radiology.
# hypertension- patient was hypertensive to the 190s on the floor on beta blocker and long acting nitrate.
Given his renal insufficiency and likelihood of requiring large doses of ACE inhibitor to obtain appropriate blood pressure control, he was started on po hydralazine with excellent improvement in pressures.
# CVA - he was on warfarin and aspirin prior to his perinephric hematoma for stroke.
Given his risk of falls and hematoma, only his aspirin was continued and his warfarin was held.
# BPH - He was continued on his finesteride and flomax.
# ELEVATED TROPONIN - His troponin peaked at 0.22 with no elevations in CK or CK/MB, and he had no chest pain.
He had EKG changes that were initially concerning for STEMI.
However, cardiology reviewed the EKGs and did not feel that the EKG changes were consistent with acute coronary syndrome.
The troponin elevation was most likely given his known chronic renal insufficiency.
# DM - His oral hypoglycemics were held during admission and he was managed with an insulin sliding scale.
He was not restarted on his glipizide given his renal failure but was started on low dose avandia at the time of discharge.
# SEIZURE D/O - His keppra was decreased to 250 mg daily for appropriate renal dosing.
He had no episodes of seizure activity.
His EEG did not show any evidence of seizure activity.
# CRI - His renal function remained stable at his baseline of 2.1 to 2.3. .
# SPEECH AND SWALLOW - He was evaluated by speech and swallow.
