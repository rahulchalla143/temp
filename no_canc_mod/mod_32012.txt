He denies orthopnea or pnd although he notes that he sleeps more comfortably on his R side.

221.3 lbs Gen: WDWN middle aged male in NAD but appears mildly dyspneic.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Resp were mildly labored but he was speaking in full sentences w/o accessory muscle use.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ feet warm but non-palp pedal pulses   Pertinent Results: TTE [**2167-4-14**]: Focused study: Initially, there is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Towards the end of the study, there is resolution of the effusion with only a trivial amount remaining and improvement in right ventricular filling.
TTE [**2167-4-15**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-45 %).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
1.2 cm right kidney angiomyolipoma.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
However other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver diseased (i.e.
CXR [**2167-4-21**] In comparison with the study of [**4-17**], substantial enlargement of  the cardiac silhouette persists but there is no evidence of congestive failure.
Small amount of opacification in the right costophrenic angle could reflect some atelectasis or residual effusion.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Head CT [**2167-4-22**]: No acute intracranial process.

Prior to ablation he developed hypotension and tachycardia.
A stat TTE revealed pericardial effusion and tamponade.
A repeat tte showed trivial effusion.
After this he had several follow up TTEs with no change in the trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade.
On admission to the CCU he was in NSR, however, over the course of the night he began to have runs of tachycardia consistent with his previous episodes of afib.
He then developed a wide complex tachycardia and was pulseless.
# Systolic Heart Failure: On TTE patient was noted to have new low EF.
Unclear if this was secondary to tachycardia induced CM vs ischemic CM vs (most like) effect of VT arrest/shocks/compressions.
In the setting of this new CHF and positive fluid balance and minimal urine output, pt became significantly volume overloaded with new pulmonary edema.
Pt's lisinopril was held in the setting of renal failure.
# ARF: Patient developed rise in creatinine after poor perfusion due to tamponade and VT arrest.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of obstruction but a 0.2 cm right kidney angiomyolipoma.
There was no evidence of superimposing infection or flair.
This was thought to be multifactorial, including contribution from multiple new meds, hospital relocating, and likely hypoperfusion of frontal lobe during tamponade/code blue.
CT head was obtained and showed no acute bleed.
Urinary retention: Pt had pain at site of foley requiring removal but repeatedly retained urine requiring reinsertion.
This was thought to be due to pt's baseline prostate disease and recurrent catheter trauma.
On discharge pt had received 2 days of flomax and had been without foley for 48 hrs without difficulty.

of [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Atrial Fibrillation  Secondary: Pericardial Tamponade, Ventricular Tachycardia Arrest, Acute tubular necrosis, Acute Systolic CHF   Discharge Condition: Stable, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia that makes your heart beat irregularly and fast.
You underwent a procedure to control this arrhythmia but had a complication which required you being monitored in the ICU.
You then developed another arrhythmia which we were able to reverse with compressions, shock, and a new medication.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerning symptoms, please call Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11679**] or return to the hospital.
