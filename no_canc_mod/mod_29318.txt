History of Present Illness: 29 year-old male patient with a history of DM2, obesity, OSA and pericarditis (6 months ago) who presented to [**Hospital1 14360**] on [**2178-5-16**] with chest pain, back pain, fevers, chills and shortness of breath for one day.
His pain was described as sharp, worse with inspiration and on laying supine and relieved by sitting and leaning forward.
He also reported diaphoresis and cough productive of green sputum.
He had a similar episode 6 months prior to admission and was diagnosed with pna and "fluid accumulation around the heart".
He received 2L IVF boluses, 1gm of CTX and 500mg of Azithromycin.
He was given a diagnosis of percarditis, treated with Motrin 800mg tid, and admitted to teh ICU.
There was no pericardial effusion and RV appeared normal size.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, the patient was thought to be in either cardiogenic shock or septic shock from a pneumonia.
Renal did not feel that there is an acute need for HD at this point and agreed with IVF and pressors.
Infectious disease got a history of the patient recently removing dead rodents from an automobile fan and felt that atypical organisms were highly likely.
Hepatology felt the clinical picture was most consistent with shock liver.
The patient is being transferred to MICU per the request of ID and given evolving septic shock.
OSA on BiPAP 4. h/o Pericarditis 6 months ago  Social History: Patient is married and has a 12 year-old daughter.
No recent tick, bug or animal bites.
Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: VS: Tm 103.7 Tc 101.4, BP 112/68 (88-122/62-88), HR 123 (125-150), RR 24 97% on Vent: AC: Tv: 700 x 24, FIO2 0.4, PEEP 10 -> PIP 35, Plateau 29, ABG 7.34/30/99, 7.32/28/130 CVP 23, CO 8.5, CI 2.63, SVR 687, MVO2 76 GEN: morbidly obese young man intubated and sedated HEENT: ETT in place, mmm Neck: large neck but no JVD appreciated CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, no m/r/g PULM: mechanical breath sounds appreciated, crackles at the bases bilaterally ABD: obese, NABS, NT/ND Ext: cool extremities, no c/c/e, 1+ DP and PT b/l Neuro: intubated, sedated Derm: no rashes noted.
Pertinent Results: CXR ([**5-17**]): Ill-defined opacities are present in the left mid and lower zones consistent with pulmonary consolidation.
CXR ([**5-18**]): Air bronchogram present in the left lower lobe suggesting LLL pneumonia.
Increased opacification in the right lower zone c/w atelectasis rather than pneumonia  Abd US ([**5-18**]): Limited examination.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease, including more significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
Chest/Abd CT ([**5-18**]): Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.
No acute abdominal pathology  Sinus CT ([**5-18**]): No sinusitis.
Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with EF 15-20%.
No masses or thrombi are seen in  LV.
LV inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure  ECHO [**2178-5-25**]:  Conclusions:  There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is no pericardial effusion.
B/L LE US:  CONCLUSION: Study is limited by body habitus, but there is no evidence of DVT in the left or right lower extremity.
No CT evidence of pancreatitis.
Stable bilateral lower lobe consolidations which could represent aspiration or atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: *Shock: There was an initial concern for cardiogenic shock in the setting of possible pericarditis/myocarditis, EKG changes, elevated cardiac enzymes and Echo showing EF 25%.
However, fevers, elevated WBC count and low SVR suggested more of a septic picture.
Shock was complicated by acute renal and hepatic failure, respiratory failure, relative adrenal insufficiency, cardiac depression and DKA.
Source of septic shock was initially unclear and included multifocal pneumonia, pericarditis/myocarditis, atypical organism in setting of exposure to rodents.
Chest/Abd CT without pathology.
No sinusitis on Sinus CT.
All blood and urine cultures showed no growth, he had negative serologies for Chlamydia pneumoniae, [**Location (un) **] B, Leptospira, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, HCV, HBV, Influenza and Parainfluenza,ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **].
He was IgG positive, but IgM negative for EBV and CMV.
He also tested positive for Legionella Antibodies and hepatitis.
There was a suggestion of multifocal infiltrates on CXR suggesting possible pneumonia with bacterial pathogen.
ID was consulted and considered atypical organisms such as mycoplasma, chlamydia, legionella, Leptospirosis and viral pathogens such as hepatitis, influenza, adeno, CMV, EBV, HIV, [**Location (un) **] and Hanta virus.
US of LE were done bilaterally without evidence of DVT.
His fevers were likely related to atelectasis, with possible contribution of pancreatitis (see below).
*Cardiomyopathy: Echocardiogram on [**5-18**] showed EF 15-20% in the setting of tachycardia (25% at the OSH on [**5-17**]), although windows suboptimal.
Likely viral myocarditis (possible induced by [**Location (un) **] B vs. adenovirus vs. Hep C vs. CMV vs. Echovirus vs. EBV) vs. sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy vs. restrictive pericarditis given recent episode of pericarditis and filling defect on Echo.
His BP was stable and heart failure and fluid retention was treated with CVVH.
Unclear if possible Hantavirus infection could have been contributory and final results were still pending at discharge.
Repeat echo about a week into his hospital course demonstrated recovery of EF to 45% (on [**5-25**]), normal LV cavity size, and no pericardial effusion.
FENa was less than 1% and his renal failure was felt to be a complication of his shock.
His potassium gradually increased and his volume status worsened and he was started on CVVH on [**5-21**].
Large volumes of fluid were removed with ultrafiltration.
Initial anuria resolved and pt puts out small amounts of urine now.
*Acute hepatitis: The patient was admitted with markedly elevated LFTs to an AST of 11,916.
*Respiratory distress: The patient was intubated at the outside hospital in setting of respiratory distress and DKA.
There was no evidence of ARDS on imaging exams and he did well on the ventilator.
He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**5-19**] which showed scant secretions that were negative for organisms.
He had bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on CT scan, and was started on vancomycin/zosyn, as well as doxycycline for atypical coverage, as above.
*DKA: The patient was admitted with elevated blood sugars, anion gap and trace ketones in urine.
He had a persistent anion gap which was felt to be secondary to his renal failure, as repeat ketone/beta hydroxybutyrate assays were negative.
*Pancreatitis: He had low grade fevers even after about 9 days of antibiotics, and in search of a cause, his pancreatic enzymes were found to be elevated.
An abdominal CT scan did not reveal radiographic evidence of pancreatitis.
There was a thought that doxycycline could also have contributed, and this was changed to azithromycin.
Once extubated, he denied abdominal pain, and his fevers resolved.
After transfer to the floor his lipase and amylase steadily came down, pt was non-tender in epigastric area on exam and denied abdominal pain.
He had no hilar or mediastinal adenopathy making sarcoidosis less likely.
It's possible that he developed portal hypertension acutely in the setting of shock liver.
On the floor he complained of transient LUQ pain on two occassions for which he did not require any treatment or further work-up.
*Hypertension/tachycardia/bigeminy: The patient had persistent tachycardia during the hospitalization, probably related to his fevers, as well as his body habitus/deconditioning.
He was noted to have ventricular bigeminy just after starting HD on [**5-27**].
*Leg pain: Pt developed leg swelling, discolorisation (red to purple), blisters (bloody and non-bloody), necrotic changes on toes and pain in both feet.
These changes were most likely due to malperfusion, secondary to cardiogenic shock.
*Nausea: Pt had waxing and waining episodes of nausea during the course of his hospital stay which were well controlled with Prochlorperazine.
