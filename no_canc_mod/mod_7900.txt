Again the patient's trachea is deviated to the right with a left-sided density consistent with enlarged thyroid.
Questionable blunting of the left costophrenic angle is felt to most likely be due to overlying soft tissue.
No definite focal consolidation.
There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2483**]  Xray Pelvis/L Femur [**2149-10-21**]: FINDINGS:  No previous images.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or other intraabdominal fluid collection.
Small 1.7 x 1.0 cm low density collection adjacent to the superior aspect of the left greater trochanter is compatible with a post-operative collection.
Streak artifact limits evaluation but no evidence of hardware complication is identified.
Other findings include superior and inferior endplate compression deformities of L3, 2.8 cm liver segment VI cyst with small rim calcification, 4.0 cm left renal midpole cystic structure compatible with simple cyst, right anterior abdominal wall surgical clips which may represent prior hernia repair, atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta.

#Hypotension: Most likely secondary to combination of anemia and hypovolemia following recent ORIF.
Infection less likely as pt remained AF and WBC was not elevated.
CXR with no signs of infiltrate or consolidaton.
CE not elevated and ECG unchanged from baseline lowering suspicion for cardiac etiology.
No signs of hematoma at surgical site or active bleeding.
Guaiac neg in ED and recent colonscopy with only a few polyps found make GI etilogy less likely.
Considered anemia secondary to lysis as pt has antibodies to several blood antigens and it is unclear if she was transfused during recent ortho procedure.
LDH was elevated and haptoglobin less than five however bilirubin was not elevated.
X-rays of the hip were negative for fluid collection, and CT abdomen was negative for intraabdominal process.
Although there was no evidence of bleeding, because of profound anemia on presentation, her Lovenox was discontinued and this decision will be communicated to her Orthopedic surgeon at [**Hospital1 2177**] as well.
#Respiratory Distress: Patient noted SOB over several days leading up to admission.
Most likely secondary to anemia in setting of unremarkable infectous and cardio work up.
She had good oxygenation on admission and did no require supplemental O2.
Pt did note CP earlier in the weak which may be chronic vs. secondary to anemia.
Her home BB and antihypertensives were held in MICU in setting of low BP, but restarted slowly prior to discharge.
Plavix was also held in setting of possible bleeding source for anemia, but was restarted prior to discharge.
Senior Vitamin *NF* (multivitamin-minerals-lutein) 1 tab Oral daily   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Anemia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 30834**] you were admitted to [**Hospital1 1170**] after presenting with fatigue and short of breath.
You were found to have low blood counts (you were anemic).
You had multiple blood tests x-rays of your hip and a CT scan of your abdomen which did not show that you were bleeding.
In addition, we tested your stool which did not have blood in it either.
We decided not to restart your blood thinner (Fragmin) because this put you at increased risk of bleeding.
