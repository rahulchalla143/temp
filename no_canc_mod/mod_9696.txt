Given maternal group B Streptococcus colonization and antibiotic treatment of less than two hours, the infant was count was unremarkable and the infant was transferred to the Newborn Nursery.
The heart was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
The lungs were clear to auscultation without increased work of breathing.
The abdomen was soft with active bowel sounds and without hepatosplenomegaly.
The patient remained comfortable breathing in room air without need for supplemental oxygen.
Gastrointestinal - The patient was treated for significant hyperbilirubinemia presumed secondary to ABO incompatibility with intensive phototherapy and intravenous fluid hydration.
The initiation of quadruple phototherapy and the possible need for an exchange transfusion, the patient was initially maintained NPO.
Subsequent electrolytes revealed persistence of the metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate level of 12 and anion gap of 18.
The patient was initially restarted on soy formula given one pending test for galactosemia still pending at the State Laboratory.
Urine was checked often and remained negative for ketones throughout.
On the day of discharge, day nine of life, the final test from the State Laboratory for galactosemia returned normal and the patient was switched to regular Enfamil.
This was tolerated without difficulty.
Urine on the day of discharge was still negative for ketones.
Metabolic - Given the unusual metabolic acidosis seen at day two to three of life, metabolic evaluations were undertaken.
Serum was sent for aminoacids and urine was sent for aminoacids and organic acids.
Lactic acid level on day three of life was found to be 3.1; a follow-up level two days later was 2.8.
Initial screens for aminoacids and organic acids on day three of life were sent to Quest Laboratories.
