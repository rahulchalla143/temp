Chest: Diffusely wheezy and rhoncherous with poor air movement throughout.
No murmurs appreciated.
Diffuse ecchymotic patches.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Partial right lower lobe collapse secondary to obstruction of the basal segments of the right lower lobe bronchi secondary to secretions.
Near complete obstruction of the left main stem bronchus secondary to secretions with only minimal left lower lobe atelectasis identified.
Ground-glass opacities within the right middle lobe, lingula and left lower lobe, which may represent the sequelae of aspiration.
Multiple borderline enlarged probable reactive mediastinal lymph nodes.
Multiple bilateral calcified granuloma with several noncalcified nodules measuring less than 3 mm as described above, which could represent noncalcified granulomas.
Brief Hospital Course: An 81 yo woman with history of [**Month/Year (2) 9215**], COPD and eosinophilic lung disease who presents with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of several days of worsening dyspnea.
# Acute respiratory failure The most likely etiology for her symptoms was pneumonia in the setting of chronic obstructive lung disease.
She also has a history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based on mucosal biopsy from [**2138**].
CTA was negative for PE but did show a right lower lobe infiltrate.
She was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin for pneumonia (gram + cocci in sputum) in addition to Flagyl for history of C dif.
Albuterol, ipratropium, and steroids were given for COPD exacerbation.
Her worsening respiratory acidosis required intubation on the second hospital day.
She was transferred to the floor with stable oxygen saturations and respiratory status on oxygen by nasal cannula ...  # Atrial fibrillation / supraventricular tachycardia She was noted to have irregular rate tachycardia to 160s two days after extubation.
EKG was consistent with atrial fibrillation.
# Sepsis She was started on levophed for dropping systolic blood pressure.
# ECG changes Most likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of respiratory distress.
# History of congestive heart failure As above, her home statin and aspirin were continued.
Metoprolol and Lasix held due to low blood pressure.
# Anemia Her hematocrit was stable and at baseline.
A work-up in [**1-23**] was consistent with anemia of chronic disease and possible iron deficiency.
# Abdominal distension KUB was done to ensure no small bowel obstruction.
