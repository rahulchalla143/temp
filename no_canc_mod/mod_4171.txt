History of Present Illness: This is a 34 year old right handed man with ahistory of HTN who was transferred from an outside hospital with L MCA stroke.
He initially presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with right sided weakness and a headache.
Initial head CT was normal and LP was performed which showed elevated protein of >200 he was then admitted to the floor.
He had MRI which was reportedly negative for stroke and his R sided weakness appeared to have resolved.
He later was found to have a left hemiplegia with right eye deviation and dysarthria.
Repeat head CT showed dense R MCA infarfct with subsequent MRI showing acute infarct of R MCA territory.
Per patient, he awoke this morning with HA and visual field defect with R side weakness.
He reports that the vision deficit and weakness has lessened but he still has pressure like headache over the R temple.
He denies any recent chest pain, racing heart, fever/chills, cough, N/V/D, abdominal pain and/or injury/falls.
HTN 2.
Fibromyalgia 3.
Dyslipidemia  - HTN - HLD - asthma - h/o seizures during benzo withdrawal - idiopathic gastroparesis - anxiety/depression - fibromyalgia   Social History: Lives alone and was working as a auto-mechanic but currently unemployed.
Physical Exam: On Admission:O: T:   BP: 158/112 HR: 62  R: 14   O2Sats: 99% NC Gen: Mildly sleepy appearing but NAD.
HEENT: Pupils: 3->2mm Neck: No carotid bruits noted.
Abd: Soft, NT, BS+ and no abdominal bruit noted.
Neuro: Mental status: Mildly sleepy but eyes open spontaneously.
Mildly slow with latency and mild/moderate dysarthria.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
LUE is plegic with some extensor posturing to noxious stim and triple flexion of LLE with noxious stim.
Face shows asymmetry with left facial droop.
Tone in flaccid on the left and there is no movement.
Large right MCA territory infarct with no evidence of hemorrhage.
Irregularity along the posteromedial wall of the proximal right internal carotid artery with surrounding increased attenuation may represent a focal dissection or, less likely, an ulcerated plaque.
Symmetric abnormality on the MTT, CBV and CBF maps.
Large right MCA territory infarct with no evidence of hemorrhage.
Irregularity along the posteromedial wall of the proximal right internal carotid artery with surrounding increased attenuation may represent a focal dissection or, less likely, an ulcerated plaque.
Symmetric abnormality on the MTT, CBV and CBF maps.
Similar increase of attenuation is also noted in the right periventricular white matter.
Persistent mass effect with near complete effacement of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], but no gross midline shift.
No developing hydrocephalus.
No evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhagic extension.
[**3-21**] Brain MRI - Continued maturation of large right MCA territory infarction with hemorrhagic transformation within the right putamen.
While this examination did not include an MR angiogram, there is suggestion of interval recanalization of the right M1 segment which has a probable flow void.
[**3-21**] CT Head - Interval increase in the hemorrhage within the known large right MCA territory infarct, with increased mass effect and leftward shift of midline structures and mild uncal henriation.
No evidence of transtentorial herniation.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is mild vascular congestion.
Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.
Left perihilar and left lower lobe atelectases are increasing.
Mildly decreased leftward shift, from 13 mm to now 10 mm.
Unchanged right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] effacement and mass effect.
Similar large ill-defined hemorrhagic focus centered at the right basal ganglia, with extensive hypodensity along the right MCA distribution, may relate to edema, ischemia or post-surgical changes.
Unchanged small intraventricular hemorrhage in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is mild vascular congestion.
Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.
Left perihilar and left lower lobe atelectases are increasing  CT Head [**2108-3-24**] FINDINGS: Overall, there is no significant interval change.
There is a large parenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
There is a stable 8-mm leftward shift of midline structures, and similar right transgaleal brain herniation.
There is a stable small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage seen layering in bilateral posterior horns.
There is persistent air and blood superficial to the dural flap and similar appearance of the subcutaneous hematoma.
There is no evidence of uncal herniation.
There is air-fluid level in the sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION: Overall, no significant interval change.
Stable large right frontal hemorrhage with vasogenic edema.
No pulmonary edema.
No pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Stroke [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 22159**] was admitted as a OSH transfer after an MRI demonstrated an acute Right MCA infarct.
He developed hypoxia from aspiration and from a failure to protect his airways and was intubated on a non-emergent basis.
Homocysteine was elevated and dyslipidemia and hypertension are present.
He was also started on Keppra [**Hospital1 **] for seizure rpophylaxis.
Craniectomy On [**3-21**] Patient developed increasing lethargy and a head Ct obtained demonstrated interval increase of rigth cerebral edema with midline shift and right uncas was trending downwards.
He tolerated the procedure well without intraoperative complications.
Mutism There is no neurologic reason for this, although it is possible that edema of the supplementary motor area might contribute.
Pneumonia Ceftriaxone was chosen given likely community origin.
His chest x-ray reveals questionable infiltrate without frank pneumonia.
If his respiratory status worsens, nosocomial coverage would be indicated.
Fever He was persistently febrile with fever typically lower than 101.
We would not recommend broadening antibiotic coverage on the basis of fever less than 101 alone, but only if there is other evidence of infection.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 38**] Rehabillatation  Discharge Diagnosis: Right MCA stroke Itraparenchymal Hemorrhage Exacerbation of Seizure Disorder Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You came to [**Hospital1 22160**] transferred from another hospital, after having a stroke.
You have elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure, along with elevated homocysteine.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-1**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
