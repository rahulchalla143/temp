PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  No prior medical problems.
MEDICATIONS:  No outpatient medications.
The patient was found to have a left open comminuted fracture of the left lower extremity with a significant degloving injury.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room for washout and external fixation of the patient's fracture by the orthopedic team.
A plastic surgery team then covered the patient's open defect with a rectus free flap.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no intraoperative complications.
The patient also had a split thickness skin graft placed over the flap, as the patient had significant loss of skin tissue from his degloving injury.
The patient did well after surgery and flap had no complications.
Throughout his stay, the patient continued to have a strong Dopplerable signal both arterial and venous and a good take of his skin graft.
Throughout his stay, the patient was also given aspirin q day and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin.
He will continue to be non weight bearing on the left lower extremity with dangling only, however the patient may transfer to a chair as long as his left lower extremity is elevated.
