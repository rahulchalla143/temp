Admission Date:  [**2198-11-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-11-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**] Chief Complaint: GIB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: colonoscopy Central line placement by VIR  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 70011**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with severe RA who presented to OSH with LGIB on [**11-11**].
Only poor peripheral access was obtained (20G in foot) and therefore a CVL was attempted.
She denies any LH or dizziness.
Past Medical History: PMH: Rheumatoid Arthritis - c/b chronic right pleural effusion, s/p recent thoracentesis, felt to be due to RA HTN Atrial fibrillation h/o of CVA with residual L sided weakness Frequent UTIs .
PSH: S/p b/l TKR in [**2193**] s/p R total hip replacement in [**9-/2198**] complicated by a DVT for which an IVC filter was placed  Addendum/clarification based on discussion with the PCP ([**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70012**]):  She underwent R THR at [**Hospital3 934**] in [**5-15**] without complications, discharged on coumadin for DVT prophylaxis.
Readmitted in [**6-14**] with thigh pain and a DVT was seen.
On lovenox, plavix and aspirin, she developed a thigh hematoma complicated by hypotension, so anticoagulation was stopped and they placed an IVC filter.
She was readmitted [**8-15**] for chest pain and hypotension and found to have RA pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and pleuritis.
Readmitted [**10-15**] for the same and also developed A fib which spontaneously recovered.
Readmitted [**11-11**] from rehab because she was placed on heparin SQ despite the IVCF and developed BRBPR and hypotension.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Gen: NAD, AAOx3 HEENT: PERRLA, mmm, no dentures in place NECK: no LAD, no JVD visible COR: S1S2, regular rhythm, non-radiating systolic murmur [**12-15**] over precordium, distant heart sounds.
PULM: CTA b/l, no wheezing or rhonchi ABD: + bowel sounds, soft, nd, nt Skin: cool extremities, no rash, limited range of motion in UE joints, ecchymosis in R groin, wire taped to her left shoulder EXT: 1+ DP, no edema/c/c, dermatosclerotic changes in feet b/l   Pertinent Results: [**11-11**]: EKG: rate 72, Nsr, no ST changes or TWIs, normal intervals  .
[**11-11**] CXR: Bilateral pleural effusions.
Subsegmental atelectasis right base.
Increased density in the retrocardiac area, which may represent atelectasis or consolidation.
CT colonography unable to be performed due to lack of rectal tone.
Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis.
Assessment of the nondistended colon is limited, but there is an area of asymmetric wall thickening with mucosal enhancement in a loop of redundant sigmoid colon low in the left lower quadrant.
While this could be related to recent colonoscopy or represent inflammatory changes from diverticulosis, given the history of GI bleeding, a neoplastic process cannot be excluded.
Targeted colonoscopy of this area or single-contrast barium enema could be performed for further assessment.
Findings consistent with proctitis.
Given extensive diverticular disease, in the absence of prior Foley catheterization, this would raise suspicion for enterovesicular fistula.
No areas of asymmetric bladder wall thickening are identified adjacent to sigmoid colon to indicate an enterovesicular fistula.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: [**Age over 90 **] F with PMH of RA, THR c/b DVT, s/p IVC filter placement, admitted to MICU with LGIB.
1) LGIB: Patient presented to outside hospital with lower GI bleed and hypotension.
She was admitted to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] and GoLytely was administered in preparation for a colonoscopy.
On admission to this institution, she had a large drop in her hct from 33.8 to 26.6 and was transfused an additional 2 units of PRBC's and started on IV PPI.
EGD/colonoscopy revealed ischemic-appearing mucosa in the sigmoid colon and severe sigmoid narrowing, which they were unable to pass with the colonoscope.
She underwent a diagnostic colonography under fluroscopy for further evaluation of  stricture vs. obstructing mass.
This study revealed severe sigmoid diverticulosis and findings consistent with proctitis.
If indeed these findings are consistent ischemic colitis, it may be related to hypotensive event (reported per PCP) which occurred at outside hospital.
This was discussed with both patient's son and her PCP who stated their agreement with plan for conservative management.
IR found that in fact this was not the case, and they were able to remove the wire without difficulty.
A left SVC triple lumen catheter was placed by IR for access in the setting of active GI bleeding, as patient had a tenuous situation with peripheral IV's.
3) Rheumatoid Arthritis - Patient has a long history of RA for 30 years and is on a slow prednisone taper for recent RA pericarditis & pleuritis.
Current dose of 20 mg was continued to prevent adrenal insufficiency.
4) Leukocytosis:  Most likely due to chronic prednisone.
No clinical, radiographic, or other laboratory evidence of infection.
7) Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
PPI for GI prophylaxis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 941**] - [**Location 942**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: GI bleed Diverticulosis Ischemic colitis Gastritis CVL wire coiled in IVC filter .
SECONDARY: Atrial fibrillation Hypertension Rheumatoid arthritis Pericarditis Pleuritis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted from [**Hospital **] Hospital with a catheter coiled in the filter in your inferior vena cava.
You have also been evaluated for the source of your GI bleeding.
Your colonoscopy showed evidence of diverticulosis and of ischemia in your sigmoid colon (which means that your bowel may not be getting adequate blood supply to it).
Ischemic colitis is likely the source of your lower GI bleed.
There is no further intervention necessary for these conditions.
Your bleeding has subsided, and you have been hemodynamically stable for several days.
You should return to the hospital if you experience gross blood in your stool, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
