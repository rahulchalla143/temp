Admission Date:  [**2195-7-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-7-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-4-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**] Chief Complaint: "Not feeling well."
[**2195-7-27**]: cardiac catheterization with placement of a permanent pacemaker  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 20951**] is a 61 year old man with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, ?DM, atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), atrial thrombus who presented to his PCP's office today with bradycardia and hypotension.
He specifically denied chest reflux symptoms, arm pain, jaw pain, or diaphoresis.
Of note, he had been recently admitted and discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (3) 20952**]) for r/o MI with a diagnosis of GERD after a negative P-MIBI with EF 51% and negative serial cardiac enzymes.
Workup in ED was significant for atrial fibrillation with HR in 30s and hypotension (SBP 80).
ST elevations were present in II, II, and avF with reciprocal depressions in V4-V6.
Cath showed a total occlusion of the mid RCA with thrombus, which was stented with 3 bare metal stents.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
No family history of CAD or MI.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; right femoral cath in place; 2+ DP Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP   Pertinent Results: EKG on admission demonstrated atrial fibrillation with HR in 30s and hypotension (SBP 80).
ST elevations were present in II, II, and avF with reciprocol depressions in V4-V6 and Q in II, II.
[**2195-7-17**] Chest x-ray: IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, no radiographic evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA, LAD, and LCX had no angiographically apparent disease.
The RCA had a mid vessel total occlusion with distal vessel filling via left to right collaterals.
Successful ptca and stenting of the mid and mid-distal RCA with overlapping 2.5x15, 2.5x15 and 2.5x18mm mini vision stents.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow.
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
[**2195-7-18**] Chest X-ray: IMPRESSION: New right lower lobe infiltrate.
[**2195-7-18**] Transthoracic Echo: Conclusions The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2).
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral segments.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation with mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The estimated PA systolic pressure is now mildly elevated.
[**2195-7-19**] Chest x-ray: IMPRESSION: Interval development of currently mild pulmonary edema with asymmetric appearance involving right lung more than the left.
No pneumothorax.
Small amount of right pleural effusion.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures with RVEDP 19 mmHg and PCWP 30 mmHg.
There were prominent V waves on the PCWP tracing to 47 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 56 mmHg.
Elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures with prominent PCWP V-wave and moderately severe pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels persists, more marked on the right, consistent with mild asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Slight haziness of the right base is consistent with small pleural effusion.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
[**2195-7-20**] Chest x-ray: IMPRESSION: 1) Slight worsening of pulmonary edema in a patient with MI could suggest decompensated heart failure.
There is no overt pulmonary vasculature overload.
No air space consolidations are identified.
There is a temporary pacer which is unchanged in appearance.
The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, notable for cardiomegaly.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for pneumonia.
[**2195-7-17**] EKG: Probable underlying atrial fibrillation with slow and regular ventricular complexes representing either slow junctional escape rhythm or ventricular escape rhythm.
Inferior Q waves and ST segment elevations in leads III and aVF with T wave inversions suggest an inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age, possibly acute.
There are also diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities, including ST segment depressions in the right precordial leads, which could represent reciprocal changes.
Evidence of inferior myocardial infarction is new suggesting an acute process.

# Coronary artery disease/Ischemia: Mr. [**Known lastname 20951**] presented with bradycardia and inferior myocardial infarction, and was found to have a mid-occlusion in his right coronary artery.
Two days after his initial catherization, there was concern for new ischemia or re-stenosis based on EKG changes and  he underwent a second cardiac catherization, with placement of a temporary pacing wire.
The patient initially appeared volume overloaded on exam and CXR, and was diuresed with Lasix to good effect.
The pacing was discontinued on [**7-21**], and his rate without pacing was 70s-80s and in atrial fibrillation.
Over the following days, he was noted on telemetry to have episodes of bradycardia to 40s, with pauses up to 2.5 seconds, and later developed periods of Afib with RVR to 150s.
It was felt that although he may have had arrhytmia in the setting of myocardial stunning, these changes represented tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome.
# Hypoxia: Patient was transiently hypoxic, which was felt to be multifactorial, related to fluid overload as noted above, also radiographic findings concerning for right low lobe pneumonia.
# Valves: Post-MI echocardiogram showed [**2-11**]+MR, consistent with prior echos.
He was continued on an ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction.
# Alcoholism: Patient with prior history of alchol abuse and admitted to current moderate use, but no evidence of withdrawal.
CIWA protocol was initiated but the patient did not require Ativan within the withdrawal window.
