Admission Date:  [**2164-3-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-3-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-3-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: CHEST PAIN  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the proximal left anterior descending artery   History of Present Illness: 37 year old male smoker with no significant past cardiac history who awoke this morning at ~ 3AM with chest and bilateral arm pain associated with diaphoresis.
Chest pain was described as central, sharp and [**7-17**] that awoke him from rest.
When he went back to sleep, the pain did not resolve by morning, so he presented to [**Hospital3 **] where he was found to have STE in aVR and V1, with diffuse STD elsewhere.
The patient was found to have 95% proximal LAD occlusion at the 1st diagnoal which was opened with 1 DES.
Post catheterization the patient's chest pain resolved and his ECG changes normalized.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Tobacco history: + tobacco abuse (10 years x 0.5 pack) Denies heavy alcohol or illicits Endorses sporadic exercise, which is primarily walking He was a graphic designer but currently not employed.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 95% thrombotic lesion at the 1st diagnoal, but was otherwise free of angiographically significant coronary artery disease.
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
Acute anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction due to a 95% thrombotic proximal LAD lesion.
Early ACE inhibitor therapy, beta-blockers, and high-dose statins.
ECHO [**2164-3-26**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the mid anterior septum.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with very mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
# STEMI: Patient who was otherwise healthy and presented with chest pain awakening him from rest, found to have proximal LAD STEMI.
He was started on ASA 325 daily, plavix 75 daily, Lipitor 80 daily, lisinopril 2.5 mg PO qD and metoprolol.
TTE revealed very mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD and mild mitral regurgitation.
# Gout - pt had flair in R knee on day prior to d/c.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST elevation myocardial infarction Tobacco Abuse   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had chest pain and an ECG showed that you were having a heart attack.
Do not miss any doses or stop taking aspirin and plavix unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tells you it is OK.
