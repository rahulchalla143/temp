Admission Date:  [**2175-1-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-1-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Univasc / Hydrochlorothiazide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: expired  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 87 year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with chest pain and shortness of breath x 2 days.
She describes the pain as being a crushing pain across across her chest.
The pain was associated with shortness of breath.
It was not associated with nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
The pain lasted for the entire night and finally went away in the morning.
She went to bed again Sunday night and experienced the pain again in the morning.
Of note the patient also notes worsening lower extremity edema over the past two days.
The patient reports that she has never had chest pain in the past.
She does get short of breath with exertion but feels that this is partially secondary to deconditioning.
She can walk around her apartment without getting short of breath but cannot climb stairs secondary to feeling fatigued.
Her family does say that she has dyspnea on exertion.
On arival to the hospital she was pain free.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST segment changes.
The heparin drip was stopped because it was felt that her troponin elevation might be secondary to her renal insufficiency.
Otherwise no acute ST setgment changes.
She had a CXR which showed no acute cardiopulmonary process and no significant evidence of edema.
On review of systems she denies lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria.
She denies orthopnea or PND.

Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 95.1 BP: 120/60 HR: 60 RR: 20 O2: 99% on 2L General: elderly female, lying in bed on one pillow in no acute distress HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, sclera anicteric, oropharynx clear Neck: JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: RRR, S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Resp: clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi GI: soft, non-tender, non-distended, +BS GU: no foley Ext: WWP, trace edema to shins bilaterally, no clubbing or cyanosis Neurologic: grossly intact  Pertinent Results: Transfer Laboratories: Troponin 0.1 BNP 901 .
EKG from [**Hospital1 **]: EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST segment changes.
CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary process .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior wall, anterior septum, and the all of the distal LV segments/apex.
Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 32%.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-11-16**], extensive regional wall motion abnormalities are new and pulmonary pressure is higher.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 87 year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with chest pain and shortness of breath x 2 days.
Chest Pain/Coronary Artery Disease: On presentation the patient described atypical chest pain.
It was assocatiated with shortness of breath.
On admission her cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated and this was of unclear significant.
She underwent repeat echocardiogram on [**2175-1-26**] which revealed extensive new regional wall motion abnormalities compared with her previous study in [**2174-11-7**].
On hospital day four she was noted to have an increase in her troponin to 0.84 which peaked at 0.9.
It is unclear whether she suffered a new infarction or other cause of circulatory failure such as sepsis given that she also developed a leukocytosis.
She developed bradycardia and hypotension to the 60s systolic.
Acute Renal Failure:  On the morning of hospital day four the patient was noted to have developed acute renal failure with increase in her creatinine from 1.7 to 3.6.
She had a renal ultrasound which was negative for obstruction.
Her urine electrolytes were consistent with prerenal azotemia.
Atrial Fibrillation:  No evidence of arrhythmias during this hospitalization on telemetry.
She was continued on sotalol and her coumadin was held given elevated INR on presentation.
Urinary Tract Infection:  Patient was found to have an e coli urinary tract infection on presentation for which she was started on bactrim.
On hospital day four she developed circulatory collapse with hypotension and inappropriate heart rate response.
