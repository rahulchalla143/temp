Admission Date:  [**2172-5-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-5-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-7-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**] Chief Complaint: vfib/vtach arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Atrial fibrillation and PVI/ablation Coronary Artery Catheterization Cardiac Arrest  History of Present Illness: This is a 53 year old gentleman with hypertension and history of atrial fibrillation.
He underwent a successful cardioversion in [**2171-7-5**] but reverted to atrial fibrillation within four days.
The patient was seen in consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3321**] for his arrhythmia and ablation was discussed as an alternative to other medications.
He reports in addition to dyspnea, fatigue and a decreased exercise tolerance he has associated palpitations,lightheadedness and profuse sweating.
His afib ablation was successful until the end of the procedure when he went into vtach arrest.
Reportedly, he received an asynchronous emergency shock which put him into vfib which was refractory to 3 360J external shocks and required an internal defibrillation for restoration of sinus rhythm.
He was put on a neo and epi drip for BP support.
The cause of his vtach was thought to be from triggered activity from the catecholamines he was on for the procedure.
His coronaries were imaged and there was no thrombus.
Echo showed no tamponade, no gross wall motion abnormality, and mildly depressed RV function.
Reportedly, he recovered consciousness and was appropriate before being sedated again.

# Vtach/Vfib arrest: Vtach occured at the end of Afib PVI after isoproterenol administration.
After Vtach/Vfib arrest he underwent cardiac cath which showed no coronary lesions.
Head CT was negative for acute stroke or bleeding.
These were sequentially discontinued with no recurrance of Vtach.
# Afib: Afib s/p PVI.
# Ant/Lateral right leg numbness: The morning after his proceedure he complained of right thigh numbness, w/o distal numbness, no weakness.
On physical exam, his leg numbness was localized to the L3/4 dermatone with purely sensory deficity, distal ext with strength 5/5, good sensation and DP 2+ consistent with lateral cutaneous femoral nerve compression (meralgia parastetica).
It is unclear exactly why he developed these symptoms but it most likely due to nerve compression while lying on his right side overnight.
Alternatively, he had had a mild rt femoral arterial groin bleed with resolved with pressure to the groin; however, right groin U/S showed no hemamatoma or pseudoaneurysm.
MRI L-spine showed no nerve compression.
# Pleuritic CP: Pt only has CP when taking a deep breath, EKG w/o ischemic changes.
CP is likely MSK [**3-7**] to chest compressions during code and mild pericarditis [**3-7**] to procedure.
# Incidental lymphadenopathy on CT: A large right hilar lymph node was seen on CTA performed for PE.

You will also be sent home with a heart monitor.
On your CT scan of your chest, there was an enlarged lymph node.
Then as needed for chest pain.
On your CT scan of your chest, there were some enlarged lymph.
