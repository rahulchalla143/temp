- CXR: New interstitial opacities much more predominant in the right upper lung versus the right lower lung.
While a superimposed acute process such as multifocal pneumonia may be considered, the overall appearance, in the setting of a prior known cancer, is suggestive of possible lymphangitic spread.

Anticoagulation was held, and she underwent bronchoscopy which did not find any evidence of cancer recurrence.
Anticoagulation was re-started, and patient had no further episodes of hematemesis.
complained of profuse watery diarrhea and abdominal cramping.
While awaiting these results patient was started empirically on Flagyl with no change in her stool output.
Her diarrhea slowed but did not resolve during her hospitalization, and was thought to be secondary to antibiotic associated diarrhea as well as cessation of narcotic pain medications (see below).
In discussion with the patient's PCP further collaboration of medication misuse was unable to be confirmed, but given these concerns and the patient's initial presentation of being found down for several hours, her long-acting pain medications were stopped and Oxycodone was begun.
The patient became very upset when told by her daughters that she was addicted to drugs and needed to attend Rehab, and that her pain medication use was contributing to the dissolution of one daughter's marriage; she then insisted on stopping her narcotic medications entirely.
History of Multiple PE's: Coumadin managed by [**Hospital1 18**] anticoagulation services.
Hypertension: Patient's home anti-hypertensives were held initially in the setting of hypotension on admission.
Pertinent issues to be addressed at this visit include pain control, diarrhea, and blood pressure control.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1* 18. loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 16449**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: hypotension fall community acquired pneumonia emphysema lung and breast cancers  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had hypotension (low blood pressure) after a fall at home.
It was thought that hypotension was from dehydration and community-acquired pneumonia.
We stopped your blood thinners for some time and we discussed bronchoscopy to reveal the source of bleeding and rule out the possibility of lung cancer coming back.
The bronchoscopy showed no evidence of cancer.
You experienced severe diarrhea and cramping in the hospital felt to be due to the antibiotics you were receiving; infectious causes of the diarrhea were ruled out.
No other changes were made to your home medications.
