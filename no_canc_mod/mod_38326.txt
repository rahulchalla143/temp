There is increased opacity at the right base with homogenous opacification consistent with a pleural effusion.
There are air bronchograms evident in the right lower lung; however, this may be related to either compressive atelectasis or pneumonia  CT Abdomen: 1.
Complete opacification of the right lower lung lobe with a moderate-sized pleural effusion.
There is a smaller consolidation and tiny pleural effusion at the base of the left lung.
No intra-abdominal or intrapelvic source of infection.
There is perinephric stranding seen around the right kidney as well as free fluid within the pelvis from likely from aggressive hydration or poor nutritinoal status.
Several hypodensities seen bilaterally and a soft tissue density lesion seen in the inferior pole of the right kidney.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 y/o M with Stage IV CKD (Cr 4.5), HTN, DM2, p/w weakness & SOB x 3 days, found to have RML/RLL PNA and acute on chronic renal failure, transferred for consideration of urgent hemodialysis.
He was treated initially for community acquired pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone, but switched to vancomycin and cefepime as he did not intially improve.
He was extubated initially on [**2180-4-3**], but became acute hypoxic due to mucous plugging and suffered PEA arrest.
On [**2180-4-7**], he passed a spontaneous breathing trial and was extubated without complication.
# Cardiac Arrest: On [**2180-4-3**] patient was extubated, became acutely hypoxic and suffered PEA arrest.
Chest compressions were started promptly, he received epinephrine, atropine and received one electrical defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation.
He received adenosine for SVT, then switchedinto atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Sepsis: On hospital day 2, patient became progressively tachycardic and hypotensive responsive to fluid boluses and briefly required norepinephrine.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: On arrival patient had increased BUN and creatinine (4.5 -> 8.8) from baseline, mild hyperkalemia (5.7) and metabolic acidosis.
His electrolyte abnormalities gradually improved.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] will likely require longterm hemodilaysis from this point on.
# Atrial Fibrillation.
On hospital day two, patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation.
He should follow up with his PCP at discharge to discuss cardiology referral for evaluation/management of his atrial fibrillation.
# Abdominal Pain:  Patient had tenderness to palpation of the abdomen on exam.
Given rising white count and question of perinephric fluid collection on the outside CT, an abdominal ultrasound was performed that were unremarkable.
He was treated empirically for possible abodminal infection with tigecycline from [**2180-3-31**] to [**2180-4-6**] and his pain resolved.
# Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase:  Alk phos increased after admission to 500s.
He should see his PCP to discuss cardiology referral for his atrial fibrillation.
- CBC/hematocrit should be checked on Monday (patient may require transfusion for Hct < 21).
Disp:*120 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: St. [**Hospital 11042**] Hospital rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Legionella pneumonia Acute renal failure necessitating dialysis Pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest Atrial fibrillation/flutter (new) Anemia  Secondary: Type II diabetes Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **] you presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2180-3-29**] in severe respiratory distress due to pneumonia illness.
During this time you were diagnosed with pneumonia due to legionella infection and were begun on Levofloxacin IV antibiotics.
Your ICU course was complicated by an arrhythmia called atrial flutter/fibrillation.
You also demonstrated significant weakness likely due to the long admission in the intensive care unit.
Your renal failure requires hemodialysis at this time.
You will need to copntinue hemodialysis as an outpatient with a renal physician following your care.
- BEGIN TAKING diltiazem 30 mg PO every 6 hours for heart rate control (your doctor may wish to change you to a once-daily formula once you are stable on this regimen) - BEGIN TAKING warfarin 2.5 mg PO daily (your doctor will need to monitor your INR and may need to adjust your dose) - BEGIN TAKING Phos-Lo to control your phosphate levels (total 4 tablets daily or as directed by your nephrologist) - BEGIN TAKING aspirin 81 mg PO daily - TAKE AS NEEDED acetaminophen for fever or pain - COMPLETE COURSE of levofloxacin (antibiotic) for your pneumonia (3 more doses over 6 days)  Please continue to take your medications as prescribed.
