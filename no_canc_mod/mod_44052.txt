She is a 76 year-old right-handed woman with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, HTN, hyperlipidemia, obesity, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety and spinal stensosis who presented with word finding difficulties.
She has been struggling over the last several weeks with generalized, weakness, lethargy, and difficulty getting upstairs (with DOE).
She was producing "nonsensicle" strings of words, including some simple isolated consonants.
Her pronounciation was mildly affected, but it seemed that finding the words was the primary difficulty.
There was no facial droop and no appendicular weakness or precipitous change in gait.
Regarding the workup for her weakness/DOE she has had a normal CXR, normal EKG, and a stress ECHO in late [**Month (only) 216**] revealed a normal EF, with poor exercise tolerance, but no EKG changes and no focal hypokinesis.
Of note until these recent difficulties with shorness of breath and fatigue arose she was living independently in a [**Location (un) 1773**] appartment.
Past Medical History: HTN Type 2 diabetes mellitus Hyperlipidemia Anxiety/Depression Obesity Spinal Stenosis.
Renal insufficiency of uncertain etiology - thought to be due to HTN, DMII, but then there is a note on [**2125-6-21**] that suggests here renal insufficiency was getting worse faster than one would expect with those etiologies.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated - can hear heartbeat in the carotids.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities: She has pitting edema in the left lower extremity greater than the right lower extremity.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
There is a deficit in fluency, in that her production is slow.
There was no evidence of neglect on interpreting the cookie theft picture.
There is no ptosis bilaterally.
-Coordination: No intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No dysmetria on FNF bilaterally.
Took very small steps.
She didn't ever seem like she would fall, to me, but she did ask for assistance.
Slight interval decrease in bibasilar atelectasis and unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
Small kidneys.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Within limits of this examination, no aneurysm is seen.
There is nonvisualization of the left distal vertebral artery and proximal stenosis or possibly hypoplasia cannot be excluded.
No proximal high-grade stenosis is seen.
The left distal vertebral artery is not visualized, which may be from proximal hypoplasia or stenosis.
No evidence for acute ischemia in the brain or PRES.
Mild small vessel ischemic sequelae in the subcortical and periventricular white matter.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 year-old woman with DMII, Hyperlipidemia, obesity, chronic renal insufficiency, anxiety, h/o supressed TSH with cold thyroid nodule, benign essential hypertension who presented with word finding difficulties, SBP 230.
She was hypertensive in the ED BP was 196-256/71-136, HR 70's-80's sat 100% 3L NC, T 96.7.
A trigger was called and she was transferred to the micu for respiratory distress and treated for flash pulmonary edema with 40mg iv lasix x1 with good effect, and albuterol neb.
She was then transferred to the medicine service and started on a nitroglycerin drip for BP control.
She was seen by the nephrologists for her acute renal failure.
They suspected this was due to hypoperfusion [**12-23**] poor forward flow, hypertension and volume overload.
She was also evaluated for renal artery stenosis with a renal doppler flow study.
We recommended she follow this up as an outpatient given the unclear reason for the acute worsening of her blood pressure and kidney disease this year.
Three days prior to discharge, she developed a leukocytosis, and her urine grew E. Coli.
We started her on a 5 day course of Cipro for urinary tract infection.
She had high anxiety in the hospital and we started ativan PRN, then restarted her sertraline.
Given her altered mental status on arrival we did not want to send her out on any benzodiazepines.
