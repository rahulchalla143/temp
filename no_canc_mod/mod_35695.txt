In general, an obese and thick-necked gentleman in no apparent distress.
Lungs revealed poor air movement.
Extremity examination revealed venous stasis changes.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diastolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and gastroesophageal reflux disease with and active chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS ISSUES:  (a)  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation was likely secondary to pneumonia on chest x-ray two weeks prior to admission.
No evidence of pneumonia on current chest x-ray.
The patient was continued on ceftriaxone throughout his hospital stay for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on a regular insulin sliding-scale with q.4h.
The patient's oral hypoglycemics were initially held due to his acidosis and pulmonary edema.
The patient's respectively acidosis improved as his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was brought under control.
GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on his home dose of pantoprazole.
