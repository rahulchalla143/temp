He was worked up and found to have severe cervical spinal stenosis from a calcified OPLL with resultant narrowing of the spinal canal.
The patient had a whiplash injury with several broken areas of calcifications.
There was no clear cervical fracture identified.
The patient was emergently taken to the operating room for decompression, assuming that he had suffered a cervical cord contusion with subsequent swelling in the setting of spinal stenosis.

He has ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament from C2-C5 with most likely underlying spondylotic myelopathy.
He either had a vagal episode or cardiac arrest at the time and was quickly resuscitated.
He had questionable withdrawal to pain in his feet and hands, but there is only slight spontaneous movement of his left hand.
He does have a left triceps reflex.
On post op day 1 an MRI was completed that showed ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament extending from the C2 through C4 vertebral body levels, compressing the spinal cord anteriorly.
At C3/4, there is evidence of cord contusion.
No cerebrospinal fluid is seen posterior to the cord at the level of compression and  C3/4 and C4/5 anterior ligamentous tears.
The ICU team tried to wean the patient ventilator with variable success alternating between periods of CPAP and assist control.
