He was deemed Child's B in [**2156-5-17**] with ongoing ethanol abuse, admitted to Intensive Care Unit due to acute decompensation of chronic liver disease due to alcoholic hepatitis and Escherichia coli sepsis.
He had abdominal pain for approximately one month with increasing abdominal girth, was noted to be febrile to 100 degrees on presentation and was tachycardiac 130, stable blood pressures.
He was noted to have distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness computerized tomography scan of the abdomen which showed ascites and large nodule of the liver, splenomegaly, paraesophageal varices and loops of thickened bowel.
He was also noted to have troponin 3.3 with flat creatinine kinase, no acute process was noted on the electrocardiogram.
No murmurs or gallops appreciated.
The patient subsequently developed ascites in the few days after his assessment for transfer to the floor.
Extremity: positive clubbing, positive dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
Neurological, the patient initially had a decreased level of consciousness.
No intravenous drug abuse.
Computerized tomography scan of abdomen as already described, cirrhosis of liver, positive varices, positive ascites, bowel thickening, increased since last examination.
The patient had Escherichia coli on blood cultures, decompensation of his hepatitis C/alcohol cirrhosis with positive troponin coagulopathy, encephalopathy and developing ascites.
Gastroenterology - The patient was seen by Liver Service and had Escherichia coli, gram negative sepsis and lactic acidosis that resolved with treatment.
He was underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed Grade 3 varices of his distal esophagus, no signs of bleeding were noted and banding was not attempted.
for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
The patient was taking Lactulose to resolve his hepatic encephalopathy with good results.
Infectious disease - On admission the patient's urinalysis was with 10 white blood cells, a few bacteria, positive nitrate and culture grew out mixed Flora.
Blood cultures showed 4 out of 4 bottles of Escherichia coli.
His original source of bacteremia was unclear, chest x-ray was negative for infiltrate.
The patient did develop spontaneous bacterial peritonitis during his stay.
He had increasing ascites that was tapped initially on [**6-30**].
The patient's initial fluid showed 2,325 white blood cells, 4,100 red blood cells, 86% polys, 5% lymphs consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Neurological - The patient was nephropathic, encephalopathic and improved greatly on the Lactulose.
Cardiopulmonary - The patient had an echocardiogram on [**6-25**] which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mildly depressed left ventricular function, global hypokinesis, inferior HK +1, acute mitral regurgitation with no vegetation.
Prophylaxis - The patient has been on subcutaneous heparin, pneumo boots, Colace, Protonix as well as Ativan for agitation and possible alcohol withdrawal which the patient at this late juncture has not had.
Most likely his macrocytosis is secondary to his alcoholic liver disease.
The patient has had chronically low magnesium which has been supplemented throughout his hospital course.
