The patient was found face down with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 3 and in the prehospital stage was hemodynamically stable with strong pulses and intact gag reflex but dilated and fixed pupils.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for definitive care.
On arrival the patient was found to have a superficial open head laceration, a left open tibia and fibula fracture and a laceration to the right upper extremity.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy and left upper extremity fracture.
The patient had a large equalizing posterior scalp avulsion and forehead laceration.
There were no step-offs.
There was decreased rectal tone and no gross blood.
He had palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and an open fracture at the left shin.
CT of the C spine showed a linear non displaced fracture of the pars intraarticularis at C7.
A CT of the head showed a very small amount of subarachnoid blood seen on the right tentorium.
CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed only a small area of consolidation in the left upper lobe and bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
There was no evidence of other injuries.
The left tib fib film showed a mid shaft comminuted left tibial and fibular fracture.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the operating room by orthopedic surgery for repair of the left tibia and fibular fractures and open reduction and internal fixation was performed with placement of an intramedullary rod.
In the unit neurosurgery was consulted who commented on the questionable area of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Spine surgery was consulted for the C7 to T1 facet fracture who recommended that the patient continue the C collar for approximately 6 weeks.
He remained markedly confused with disorganized speech.
This was initially felt to be consistent with the schizophrenia although after several days of evaluation it was determined that this is likely a component of traumatic brain injury as well.
This study showed multiple areas of low signal insusceptibility images at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] white matter junction indicative of diffuse axonal injury and bilateral frontal subdural effusion.
There was also a large hematoma seen which was followed while the patient was on the hospital floor.
