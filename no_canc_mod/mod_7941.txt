HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female, status post total colectomy for ulcerative colitis with an end ileostomy, who presents with pain around her ileostomy times 48 hours with decreased ileostomy output.
She has had nausea and vomiting time four over the last two days.
Chest x-ray showed no free air.
The KUB showed dilated loops of small bowel.
In conclusion, this patient presented with an incarcerated parastomal hernia.
Thus, on [**9-2**], the patient had a preoperative diagnosis of parastomal hernia, strangulated ileostomy.
Postoperative diagnosis was parastomal hernia, strangulated ileum, and distended gallbladder consistent with early cholecystitis.
The patient had a bit of a low urine output in the early postoperative period, thus the patient was kept intubated on postoperative day #1, while her fluid status was being managed.
On [**9-4**], the patient was doing well from a respiratory status and was extubated.
However, she still had low urine output despite multiple fluid boluses.
The urine output began to pick upl and improve as of [**9-5**].
The ICU Team continued to optimize the patient's fluid status and cardiac status.
The patient was continued on Kefzol and Flagyl, on which she had been put postoperatively for cellulitis around the area of the former ostomy site.
The nursing home, where the patient resides, requested that the patient have a PIC line, as opposed to a central venous line, in her neck.
