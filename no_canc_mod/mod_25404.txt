The infant does present     with a murmur on occasion and active precordium on     occasion.
No further indomethacin therapy has been given due     to a worsening IVH and a gastric perforation post Indocin     therapy.

A peripheral IV has been placed.
GI: The infant has had abdominal distention since birth with radiographs that initially were unremarkable.
