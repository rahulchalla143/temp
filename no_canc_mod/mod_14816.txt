She also exhibited some signs of congestive heart failure.
In the Emergency Department, she was noted to have EKG changes and elevated cardiac troponin levels, and was started on heparin, Nitroglycerin, aspirin and beta blockers.
However, at this time it was noted that she had a urinary tract infection, so her catheterization was delayed.
She did undergo cardiac catheterization eventually on [**10-17**], and was found to have 90% left main occlusion, and a totally occluded right coronary artery.
She was ultimately transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] urgently for intra-aortic balloon pump placement due to the severity of her coronary artery disease and anticipation of operating room treatment with coronary artery bypass grafting with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in the year [**2174**].
Diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy.
Peripheral vascular disease.
10.Status post hysterectomy.
ALLERGIES:  The patient states multiple drug allergies as follows: 1.
10.Toprol causes hypotension.
11.Nifedipine causes hypotension.
12.Mirapex causes abdominal cramping.
13.Dalmane causes hives.
10.Amoxicillin chronically of an unknown dose for chronic urinary tract infection.
Her echocardiogram revealed moderate mitral regurgitation, and an ejection fraction of 20-30%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken directly to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for intra-aortic balloon placement and subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit for medical management over the next few days to optimize her for her coronary artery bypass graft.
She had a bit of metabolic acidosis overnight and was ultimately extubated the following day.
On postoperative day #1, she remained extubated and stable from a respiratory standpoint.
The [**Last Name (un) **] service has continued to follow the patient due to difficult management of blood glucose.
On postoperative day #6 noted to have some increasing difficulty ambulating, according to the patient because of her right [**Last Name 4241**] problem which she had preoperatively.
Podiatry service was consulted, and they saw the patient on [**10-26**], and they devised a foam dressing of some sort that was placed on her right foot in order to allow her to be more flexible with her weightbearing ability, and this was placed on [**10-27**], and the patient stated that it was a little bit easier for her to get around now with that in place on her foot.
The patient also on [**10-27**], postoperative day #7, was noted to have an isolated episode of complaining of not feeling well with profuse diaphoresis.
She had a few bibasilar crackles and otherwise her lungs were clear.
