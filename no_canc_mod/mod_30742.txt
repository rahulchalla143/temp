Coronary artery bypass grafting x3: Left internal mammary artery graft to left anterior descending, reverse saphenous vein graft to the marginal branch and the posterior descending artery  History of Present Illness: 82 year old male who has been followed for aortic stenosis since [**2098**] after an echo was performed for a murmur prior to his left total hip replacement.
Echo revealed moderate aortic stenosis with peak/mean gradient 62/38.
He noted a marked decrease in exercise tolerance with generalized fatigue.
He also complains of dyspnea on exertion.
He attributes some of these symptoms to fairly severe arthritis in his knees and hips.

There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline functional mitral stenosis due to mitral annular calcification (MVA-2.2 cm2) Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is trace valvular AI.
No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
He tolerated the operation and immediately post-operatively was admitted to the ICU intubated and sedated on propofol and on neo for BP support.
On POD#2 he developed rapid afib which was treated with IV Lopressor and amiodarone and he continued to require neo for blood pressure support.
Once on the stepdown floor he continued to have intermittent episodes of rapid afib and his beta blocker was titrated accordingly, rate control was difficult to achieve.
EP was consulted and he was also started on Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation.
