A trauma series was obtained which showed advanced degenerative changes at the C spine, multiple left sided rib fractures posteriorly including ribs 2 through 8, and a distal left clavicle fracture.
Subsequent films of the patient's lumbar and thoracic spine showed a compression deformity of L1 of uncertain age, severe degenerative changes and an IVC filter in place.
