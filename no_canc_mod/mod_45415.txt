On [**10-23**], the patient was transferred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9456**] service for coronary artery bypass grafting after his care on the Medical service.
His prior cardiac catheterization on [**10-21**] showed severe three vessel disease with a 40% left main distal stenosis, 70% LAD stenosis, 60% OM stenosis with diffuse distal in his circumflex and then total occlusion after the first OM and a totally occluded right coronary artery.
It was also noted at that time that his right internal iliac artery is totally occluded and the left iliac system had moderate diffuse disease.
The left renal artery was single and a mid vessel 90% stenosis was noted in the left renal artery.
Of note, no left ventriculogram was shot also at cardiac catheterization due to his renal insufficiency.
Colon cancer status post hemicolectomy in [**2175**].
Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy.
Remote history of hepatitis B.
Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Occluded severe bilateral iliac disease.
Left renal artery stenosis.
Cardiac Surgery consult was done by Dr.[**Name (NI) 979**] team on [**10-22**], who noted his fall from a ladder earlier in the month with a fractured left clavicle and left rib fractures.
At home, he had desaturated, brought to an outside hospital Emergency Room and he had acute shortness of breath.
He came in with pneumonia and a positive CPK.
While in the hospital, the patient had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
His carotid ultrasound also showed that his right internal carotid was occluded with a 40-60% left internal carotid stenosis.
ALLERGIES:  Patient had no drug allergies.
He was also seen with a preoperative evaluation by Physical Therapy and continued to be followed by Psychiatry for some confusion as noted in the previous discharge summary.
He continued to be followed also by Neurology given his risk with severe bilateral carotid disease.
Preoperative EKG on the 23rd showed inferior T-wave changes that were nonspecific.
On postoperative day one, patient had no events overnight.
On postoperative day two, again he had no events overnight.
On postoperative day three, he desatted very briefly to 88, but then improved with increased oxygen therapy.
He had decreased breath sounds at both bases, but otherwise his examination was unremarkable.
He had some periods of confusion and agitation.
On postoperative day four, he had some bilateral rhonchi.
Patient continued to work with rehab, however, he did drop his blood pressure to the 70s and 80s supine throughout the day on the 4th, and so no ambulation was attempted at that time given the instability of his blood pressure.
Neurology examined him again and noted a homonomous inferior quadrant autopsia on the left, but results were being weighted both the EEG and the MRA.
He remained mildly confused on the 6th.
He had no ectopy and his blood pressure was stable, and his incisions were clean, dry, and intact, and he was transferred back out to the floor on the 8th off all drips.
He had no further confusion.
He had no complaints of pain and was oriented.

Final results for the CT of the head that was performed on [**10-28**] showed no intracranial pathology including no signs of intracranial hemorrhage.
Status post prostate cancer with prostatectomy.
Status post colon cancer with colectomy.
Status post fractured left clavicle and left rib fractures.
Status post rhabdomyolysis from fracture injuries.
Bilateral severe carotid stenosis.
Left renal artery stenosis.
