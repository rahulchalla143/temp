She was transferred to the ICU where she was warmed, her bradycardia resolved and she was weaned from levophed.
OSH course complicated by iatrogenic PTX s/p chest tube, ARF likely [**12-23**] rhabdo (CK peak 11,000) requring HD, and failed extubation req re-intubation.

Fevers/leukocytosis - Over the weekend of [**9-21**], pt noted to have rise in wbc and low grade temp.
The patient did not have any further leukocytosis for 4 days prior to discharge and was without low grade fevers for over 5 days prior to discharge.
MS change likely multi-factorial including delirium [**12-23**] recent DKA, infection, ICU course and also ?
Overall, the patient has had dramatic improvement in her mental status, although she has some residual deficits.
She currently needs some help with daily activities.
Hypoxia - Resolved.
Pt had both effusions and vent assoc pna.
She also has some left lower lobe collapse which was evaluated by pulmonary and they recommended conservative management.
Hx of ARF - resolved and likely [**12-23**] rhabdo as CPK 11K on admission.
Hx of fungal UTI - s/p tx w fluconazole, last UCX NGTD 6.
Acute pancreatitis - Per records from here, on admission at OSH, pt's lipase was in [**2105**] range.
MRCP ordered and revealed evidence of pancreas divisum or a dominant dorsal duct an nondistended pancreatic duct.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] did mention that there is an association between new onset diabetes and pancreatic adeno within 2 year frame.
MRCP does not show any mass, which is re-assuring but if repeat CT shows persistent LAD (see below), concern will be higher.
Hx of Crohn's - no reports of abd pain or diarrhea here.
Hx of atrial fibrillation - in setting of acute illness.
Pt had TTE and CTA of chest which were neg for structural hrt dz and neg for PE respectively.
Had BS in 1400 on admission likely stress response from acute pancreatitis.
On [**8-9**], Gen [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted for biopsy but they declined stating that she is high risk for OR as she was recovering from VAP and that LAD was likely [**12-23**] infection.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] will determine whether he wants to perform repeat CT scan in f/u appointment.
Radiologists here thought that the LAD was not concrening for malignancy and did not recommend reimaging.
