The patient had experienced about 45 minutes of chest pain while driving on the day of admission.
It was substernal, associated with diaphoresis, and associated as well with nausea and vomiting.
The patient presented to an outside hospital where his chest pain continued.
Also, the patient began to feel a little bit dizzy and become unconscious.
He had a ventricular fibrillation arrest.
At the outside hospital he was shocked once, and the patient became conscious again after about one minute.
The patient had described his pain as being about [**6-2**].
He denies orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and said he has not had any chest pain for the last seven years.
He also denied shortness of breath.
[**Name (NI) **] also can walk about four flights of stairs without a problem.
The patient has a history of angina since [**2151**].
First, he experienced exertional stable angina from [**2151**] until [**2156**] which was medically managed until it became unstable in [**2157-3-24**].
On the second catheterization, he had a left circumflex lesion of 90% which was angioplastied.
He remained chest pain free until [**2157-6-23**].
An 80% lesion to the posterior descending artery was also angioplastied, and a 90% lesion to the left circumflex was also angioplastied.
The patient then remained symptom free until [**2157-9-23**] when he had chest pain again.
At that time he had an exercise tolerance test during which he walked for 11 minutes with 0.5-mm ST depressions and 70% of maximum heart rate achieved.
He had an  other catheterization with a left main of 30%, left anterior descending artery 90% which was treated with angioplasty.
He also had a jailed diagonal which was treated with angioplasty with a 20% residual lesion.
He had a left circumflex which was 60% occluded, and a posterior descending artery which was 40% to 50% occluded.
In [**2158-2-21**], again the patient had an exercise stress test with thallium.
He was taken to the catheterization laboratory again with a left main of 20%, mid left anterior descending artery 80% which had angioplasty, and a second diagonal lesion of 90% which was also angioplastied.
The patient has had no further catheterizations or chest pain since that time until his catheterization during this admission.
Coronary artery disease, status post multiple catheterizations.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

Neck revealed he had no jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No evidence of edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute with 1-mm ST depressions in V2 through V5, T wave inversions in aVL, T wave elevation in III which was a change from his last electrocardiogram here in [**2158-2-21**].
He had a normal axis and early R wave progression.
His proximal left anterior descending artery had diffuse disease.
His mid left anterior descending artery and diagonal were normal.
He had a mid left circumflex lesion which was a discrete 90% lesion which was stented.
He had diffuse disease in his first obtuse marginal, and his right coronary artery had diffuse disease throughout.
The mid right coronary artery lesion of about 40% and right posterior descending artery of about 40%.
The patient was also seen by Nutrition for a nutritional consultation.
Coronary artery disease, status post stent to the left circumflex artery.
