DR. [**First Name (STitle) 7210**] [**Name (STitle) 7211**] [**Doctor Last Name 7205**] DR.

Since the previous examination, there has been improvement in bibasilar opacities consistent with improving pneumonia.
A focal ovoid opacity in the right mid lung is consistent with the patient's known pneumatocele/pulmonary contusion at this location.
The right internal jugular venous access catheter has been removed.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: 1) Improving bibasilar pulmonary opacities consistent with improving pneumonia.
2) Increased conspicuity of patient's known pulmonary contusion/pneumatocele, right mid lung.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW EXAMINATION: An oral and pharyngeal swallowing video fluoroscopy study was performed in collaboration with the speech and language pathology division.
Various consistencies of barium including thin liquid, nectar thickened liquid, puree and a half cookie coated with barium were administered.
FINDINGS: The oral phase was notable for mild oral residue and slight impairment in bolus formation.
There is no significant premature spillover.
Palatal elevation, laryngeal elevation and epiglottic deflection were within functional limits.
There was moderate impairment in laryngeal valve closure.
There was intermittent trace penetration before and after the swallow with sips of thin liquid.
There was no spontaneous cough, and a cued cough did not clear the airway.
IMPRESSION: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia with penetration and episodes of silent aspiration.
Marked interval improvement in right basilar opacity likely reflects a combination of decreasing small right pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Residual heterogeneous opacities within both lung bases are likely due to superimposed infection and possibly residual contusion.
Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
intubated due to hypoxia tacypnea.
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:  Right lung is largely collapsed explaining rightward mediastinal shift.
There is also at least a small right pleural effusion.
Thickening of the right paratracheal stripe could be due to paramediastinal hemothorax, but mediastinal hematoma cannot be excluded.
Heterogeneous opacification in the left lung is probably combination of aspiration and hemorrhage due to contusion or laceration.
There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
COMPARISON: No previous studies.
According to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**] in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient has a puncture wound overlying this location, and the lucency may be related to soft tissue gas.

No paraspinal or epidural hematoma is identified.
Lung windows demonstrate a right-sided chest tube with multiple bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left, likely pulmonary contusions.
IMPRESSION:  Multiple right-sided posterior rib and thoracic vertebral ransverse process fractures, as described above.

No lumbar spine fracture or malalignment.
There is a large area of confluent consolidation containing air bronchgrams in the right upper lobe consistent with contusion given the history of trauma.

There is a right pneumothorax superiorly.
More inferiorly, predominantly in the superior segment region of the right lower lobe there is a large ,approx a 6.6 x 3.3 cm blood containing irregularly rounded multiseptated area of lucency that likely represents pulmonary laceration with possible evolving post-traumatic pseudocyst formation, surrounded by a large area of illdefined groundglass density.
No associated right pleural effusion/hemothorax.
In the left upper and lower lobes there are a scattered irregular focal densities, likely contusions.in addition in the the left upper and lower lobes there [**Last Name (un) **] large area of confluent consolidation which likely represent a combination of pulmonary contusions and possible superadded aspiration changes.
No definite left pleural effusion/hemothorax.
A tiny amount of high-density fluid within the right posterior mediastinum is most consistent with venous bleeding.
There is no active contrast extravasation.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection or periaortic hematoma.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver enhances normally without focal nodules or masses.
There is no evidence of liver laceration.
The gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, right kidney, and abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable.
Multiple low-density lesions are seen within the left kidney, which are too small to adequately characterize.
