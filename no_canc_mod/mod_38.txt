MR L SPINE SCAN  [**2134-2-27**] 10:09 PM IMPRESSION: Spinal stenosis noted at the level of L3-4 and L4-5 as discussed above.
Thickening and ill-definition of the right brachial plexus just lateral to the superior ribs and inferior to the subscapularis muscle immediately below the coracoid process, likely secondary to trauma.
No mass or hematoma impinging upon the nerves within the axilla or medially.
Humeral shaft fracture and hemorrhage within the subcoracoid bursa not completely evaluated on this study.
Cervical spine disc degeneration seen on cervical spine MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] thoracic injury seen on prior imaging of uncertain cause.
HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT  [**2134-2-16**] 5:46 PM THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT HAND: There is diffuse osseous demineralization.
There are degenerative changes with no definite fracture.
There are multiple rounded calcific bodies in the dorsal soft tissues that do not appear to be fracture fragments.
There is an enthesophyte at the posterior olecranon.
C-spine CT: There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture.
Bulky calcifications of the posterior longitudinal ligament are identified at the C2-4 levels, likely resulting in moderate spinal stenosis.
Multilevel degenerative changes are identified with disc space and osteophyte formation.
There is marked irregularity of the inferior endplate of T3 and superior endplate of T4 with impaction of these vertebral bodies onto each other and acute kyphotic angulation at this level.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cervical spine fracture.
Extensive degenerative changes as described above.
Head CT: FINDINGS:  There is hyperdensity along the left frontal vertex that is likely secondary to volume averaging.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major vascular territorial infarction.
Hypodensity in the periventricular cerebral white matter is consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
Small prior infarcts are identified in the right internal capsule basal ganglia and left external capsule.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Bilateral Hip films: Degenerative changes with no definite fracture.
CTA: Impression: 1. no PE 2. enlarged pulmonary arteries 3. lymphadenopathy in mediastinum some of which are calcified 4. calcified hilar lymph nodes 5. pulm lymph nodes along major and minor fissures bilaterally 6. fat density structures in liver and stomach .
EKG: afib/atach with no ST-T changes.
new TWI in III.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2134-2-27**] 2:39 pm URINE                              **FINAL REPORT [**2134-3-3**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2134-3-3**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
No intracranial bleed.
No hip fracture.
+ R humerus fracture.
CT of c-spine showed severe stenosis.
She was initially admitted to the medicine service for workup of syncope; neurology was consulted for a weak right arm following R humeral fracture and she was found to have a mixed central cord and Brown-Sequard syndrome and transferred to the neurology service for closer exam monitoring.
A med consult was obtained on [**2134-3-4**] for persistent hypoxia.
She was gently diuresed, and had serial ABG's which showed persistent hypercarbia.
Neuro: The patient could not recall the events surrounding the fall and sustained a spiral fracture to the right proximal humerus, displaced, and had bilateral arm weakness and numbness distally in all 4 extremities.
On exam she initially was found to have evidence of a central cord syndrome with weakness affecting arms more so than legs.
She also had evidence of a brown sequard given that weakness and proprioception are down on the right with an upgoing toe, and pin sensation is down on the left, sensory level of C4/T3 anteriorly on the left (where the two dermatomes meet at the top of the breast).
MRI of the C-spine was performed for the likelihood of acute spinal cord injury with above findings.
Read of MRI was: "Bulky ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2/3, C3/4, and C4/5 levels, more than the right, causing severe spinal canal stenosis.The cervical cord at those levels is deformed and compressed, demonstrating intrinsic T2 hyperintense signal.
There is also a fracture at the inferior endplate of C3 anteriorly."
She was placed in a hard cervical collar and pain was controlled with morphine and ibuprofen initially.
Orthopedics also followed her for the broken right humerus, and neurosurgery had initially been consulted in the ED when a head ct showed the question of a subdural hematoma (later proven to be artifactual).
Although the right arm remained weak and flaccid with just [**2-28**] finger flexors and trapezius/shoulder shrug [**2-28**] (initially thought just limited by pain versus multiple nerve injury), the left arm strength improved to deltoid [**3-31**], [**Hospital1 **]/tri both 4+ to 5-/5, and wrist and finger extensors 4+/5; finger flexors were also 4+/5.
The weekend of [**2-27**] on morning rounds, a mild right Horner's syndrome was noted which had not been picked up before on daily rounds.
This, along with the flaccid arm, was suggestive of root avulsion on the right (and associated plexopathy).
Her neurologic symptoms all gradually resolved during hospitalization.
[**Date Range 1957**]: Pt underwent R humerus ORIF and cervical laminectomy (report below), however pt post-op, the medicine service was consulted for hypoxia (pt required 50% shovel mask) and hypercarbia (pCO2 in high 50's).
She has a follow up appointment on [**3-18**] with [**Month/Year (2) **] to evaluate her fracture and decide whether her C-collar can be removed.
Hypoxia/hypercarbia: Pt had hx of severe pulm HTM, likely [**1-28**] PDA.
ABG showed mild CO2 retention, ?
Also likely had component of fluid overload, given recent surgery.
CTA on admission was negative for PE, and the suspicion for PE was fairly low post-op given that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement improved.
She was also noted to be hypercarbic during admission, but her respiratory status remained stable while on the medicine service.
The differential included vasovagal syncope versus new onset afib/atach versus mechanical given loss of consciousness.
Less likely include myocardial infarction/ischemia versus pulmonary embolism versus seizure.
Also less likely hypoglycemia given timing after meal although patinet on glyburide which is renally cleared in setting of increased creatinine.
The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes, echo showed no obvious severe valvular disease to explain ?syncopal event, though telemetry showed periodic tachyarrhythmia ?sinus tach vs afib.
She had no other significant tele events while in the hospital.
Elevated WBC and lactate at admission: unclear etiology, afebrile with negative UA and infectious workup at admission.
Musculoskeletal: initially, radiographic imaging was negative for fracture or bleed including right UE, hips bilaterally, c-spine and head.
Patient with known chronic low back pain and sciatica.
lasix initially held for renal failure but was restarted once she was clinically stable.
Renal: She has slight renal insufficiency at admission and was given gentle IVF.
She complained of RLE pain one day, and u/s was ordered to r/o dvt - this study was negative.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81-year-old woman who sustained a fall and has a displaced right proximal humerus fracture.
She also has a spine injury and this has been operated on by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1966**].
Given the displacement of her fracture and that she is having pain and not tolerating nonoperative treatment, we decided to proceed with intramedullary nailing.
A 3 cm incision was made over the proximal humerus and the deltoid was split.
The fracture was held reduced and the guide wire passed into the distal humerus.
