Neuro: left sided hemiparesis s/p CVA   Pertinent Results:  Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the medical service for failure to thrive, dehydration and multiple electrolyte abnormalities.
On HD 2 he required transfer to the intensive care unit for hypotension [**2-9**] atrial fibrillation with RVR.
In the MICU he required intubation for respiratory distress secondary to septic shock.
His MICU course was complicated by acute renal failure, continued paroxysmal atrial fibrillation despite cardioversion, ventilator associated pneumonia, sepsis, and extensive fluid overload likely secondary to EF 15-20% and repeated need for fluid boluses for hypotension.
Despite multiple attempts at diuresis and treatment of his pneumonia, he remained ventilator dependent in the MICU for ~ 30 days.
Given poor prognosis and in accordance with what the family felt his wishes were, his family made the decision to switch to comfort measures only.
