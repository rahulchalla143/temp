Admission Date:  [**2185-8-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-8-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-10-29**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital 212**] MEDICAL SERVICE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old lady, with a history of Crohn's disease, transferred from an outside hospital for work-up and treatment of severe GI bleed following colonoscopy.
The patient was admitted on [**2185-8-9**] to outside hospital for profuse diarrhea after starting Creon two weeks prior.
The patient was treated with IV steroids, pancrease and cholestyramine for pancreatic insufficiency and bile stone malabsorption.
On [**8-16**], she underwent colonoscopy to the neoterminal ileum notable for anastomotic opening slightly tight and friable lesions which were biopsied.
Following the procedure, the patient developed hypotension, decreased hematocrit, and an increased INR.
Emergent colonoscopy showed old blood, but no active hemorrhage.
The patient experienced respiratory distress while in the ambulance and was intubated and given 80 mg lasix.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Crohn's disease:  Last colonoscopy in [**9-/2182**] showed no active disease.
6) Coronary artery disease.
7) Left superficial femoral vein DVT.
9) History of lower GI bleeding.
11) History of congestive heart failure.
Her daughter lives in [**State 350**] and has been involved with her care.
Her cardiac examination revealed tachycardia without any murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Abdominal exam was notable for multiple abdominal scars.
Her extremity exam revealed no edema.
EKG dated [**8-9**] from the outside hospital was notable for T wave inversions in leads III and AVF.
Chest x-ray was notable for left lower collapse and consolidation and small bilateral pleural effusions.
In summary, this is a 77-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, status post right hemicolectomy, status post coil embolization for massive lower GI bleed, who is now transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for management of lower GI bleed.
1) LOWER GI BLEED:  The patient had a massive lower GI bleed following colonoscopy and biopsy of various lesions within her colon.
This bleeding was stopped primarily via embolization of the third branch of the SMA.
In the Medical ICU, she was volume resuscitated with several units of packed red blood cells and IV fluids.
Over the course of her MICU stay, her GI bleeding slowly waned over the period of several days.
There was no evidence of occult bleeding by checking daily hematocrits which remained stable until her discharge.
The thought was that the patient had suffered an ischemic event to her heart leading to decreased systolic function.
Over the course of her ICU stay, she developed chest x-ray findings consistent with heart failure, as well as clinical exam findings which included elevated jugular venous pressure, lower extremity edema, and bilateral dullness to percussion at the lung bases.
She was also monitored for fluid loss by daily weights and daily in's and out's.
3) PNEUMONIA:  In the ICU, she was found to have sputum positive for Klebsiella.
There was also a suspicious retrocardiac opacity on chest x-ray.
She was started on Levofloxacin and Zosyn initially until culture results revealed pansensitive Klebsiella in the sputum, at which point Zosyn was discontinued.
A bedside swallowing study revealed aspiration of thin and nectar-like liquids.
ENT consultation revealed right vocal cord paresis with unclear etiology.
A head and neck CT was performed to rule out any stroke or mass compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
Following the procedure, there was a small amount of bright blood refluxing from the nasogastric tube which cleared several hours later.
This was felt to be likely due to a small amount of postprocedural gastric bleeding.
5) CROHN'S DISEASE:  The patient has a longstanding history of Crohn's disease and is status post right hemicolectomy and small bowel resection.
During her course here, she has not undergone any obvious manifestations of any ongoing Crohn's flare.
7) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  During her stay in the Medical ICU, her creatinine was found to be elevated over the first two days in the ICU with a peak at 1.4.
This was thought to be due to prerenal causes.
The patient underwent angiogram to better image the lesion which was followed by a CT angiogram.
9) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient has apparently experienced an ischemic event to her heart.
While in the Medical ICU, laboratory tests revealed an elevation of her troponin levels to a maximum of 0.44, evidenced when she arrived to the floor she was given a Persantine MIBI test to evaluate for any ischemic myocardium.
This test revealed: 1) Moderate partially reversible defects of the distal anterior apex and inferolateral walls of the heart; 2) Mild transient ischemic dilatation; 3) Hypokinesis of the apex and septum with global EF calculated to be 49%.
It was determined that the likely cause of her congestive heart failure was secondary to an ischemic insult to her heart.
2) Congestive heart failure.
4) Coronary artery disease.
5) Paretic right vocal cord.
6) Middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
7) Crohn's disease.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1) prednisone 35 mg po qd 2) Levofloxacin 500 mg po q 24 h until [**2185-8-31**] 3) lisinopril 5 mg po qd--hold for systolic blood pressure of less than 95 4) carvedilol 6.25 mg po twice a day 5) Creon 10, 2 capsules po four times a day 6) pantoprazole 40 mg po q 12 h 7) cholestyramine 4 gm po twice a day 8) venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg po qd 9) Insulin sliding scale 10) acetaminophen 325-650 mg po q 4-6 h prn fever 11) heparin 5,000 U subcutaneously q 12 h 12) Vitamin D 400 U NG qd 13) multivitamin qd, 1,000.
Furthermore, she should be in contact with her primary care physician or her cardiologist for medical treatment of her coronary artery disease and associated congestive heart failure.
The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] of otolaryngology for follow-up of her vocal cord paresis.
