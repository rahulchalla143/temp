Approximately seven months prior to admission, the patient developed malaise, episodic subjective tactile fevers, drenching night sweats, shaking chills, and a 2-pound weight loss over a 4-month period.
He took six to eight ibuprofen per day for symptomatic relief.
He experienced approximately two week cycles of feeling poorly associated with feeling better.
He denies any photophobia or visual changes.
He reports mild dry eyes, mild peripheral edema, and increased burping.
Over the past four weeks prior to admission he developed the onset of progressive fatigue, malaise, and dyspnea in the absence of cough, more frequent fevers, dry mouth, and worsening dysphagia with dry foods.
He developed a pruritic rash over his thighs, abdomen, and arms which was worse at night and lasted approximately one week.
[**Name2 (NI) **] reports dry heaves approximately five days prior to admission.
He denies any nausea, abdominal pain, chest pain, diarrhea, or constipation.
His symptoms progressed to the point which, on the day prior to admission, he sought medical attention at [**Hospital3 15174**].
He was found to have elevated liver function tests with a total bilirubin of 7.5, ALT of 105, AST of 106, and alkaline phosphatase of 325.
Positive antinuclear antibody with titer of 1:1380 in a speckled pattern.
Elevated prostate-specific antigen of approximately 5.4 in [**2134-10-9**] and [**2135-2-8**].
A biopsy in [**2134-9-8**] demonstrated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.
A subsequent biopsy in [**2135-2-8**] demonstrated chronic inflammation only.
q.d., Viagra as needed, Advil as needed, multivitamin, vitamin E.  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
His mother has osteoporosis but is otherwise in good health.
There was a 1.5-cm lymph node in the cervical chain on the right side and small posterior cervical lymph node on the right side.
There was some small cervical chain lymph nodes on the left side.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The right upper quadrant was tenderness to palpation.
There was no rebound or guarding.
There were bilateral tender lymph nodes on the right axilla.
The extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
There was diffuse macular rash on the chest, arms, and abdomen.
A blood smear demonstrated microspherocytes, larger basophilic stippled cells, anisocytosis with minimal poikilocytosis.
There were numerous plasmacytoid cells and large atypical cells as well.
There was a paucity of platelets with giant formed platelets seen.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   He was initially admitted to the Medicine Service for further management and workup for possible leukemia or lymphoma.
He was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for one day and then was subsequently transferred to the Bone Marrow Transplant Service as a diagnosis of leukemia was lymphoma was continued to be worked up.
The bone marrow biopsy demonstrated a markedly hypercellular marrow for his age group with lymphoplasmacytic hyperplasia with scattered large immunoblasts.
Diagnostic features of a lymphoproliferative disorder were not seen.
The immunopotentiating demonstrated no phenotypic evidence of leukemia or lymphoma.
Mr. [**Known lastname 41769**] was a difficult cross match in the blood bank and had evidence of regular antibodies.
He underwent radiologic screening to evaluate for evidence of leukemia or lymphoma.
A liver and gallbladder ultrasound demonstrated evidence of a simple hepatic cyst with no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
There was splenomegaly present.
A CT of the torso demonstrated bilateral extensive cervical, axillary, anterior mediastinal, and precordial lymphadenopathy of which the largest lymph nodes were in the left axilla.
The spleen was markedly enlarged and contained numerous wedge-shaped regions of hypoattenuation and calcific fossae.
There were multiple small lymph nodes in the abdomen around the pancreatic tail, superior mesenteric artery, and in the retroperitoneum.
There was no evidence of bony destruction.
A CT of the neck to evaluate his cervical lymph nodes demonstrated abnormal parotid glands which were slightly enlarged within an irregular cystic pattern, question representative of Mikulicz syndrome.
He underwent an excisional biopsy of a right axillary lymph node.
No definitive morphologic immuno definitive features of the lymph node or proliferative disorder were seen.
RHEUMATOLOGY:  He had a Rheumatology evaluation for the possibility that these symptoms were all related to a rheumatologic disorder.
The differential diagnosis included lupus, [**Doctor Last Name 3501**] syndrome, a viral infection, lymphoproliferate disorder, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
A rheumatologic series of tests were ordered to further determine the possible nature of his symptoms.
There was no evidence of glomerulonephritis in sever urinalyses.
Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative.
A SPEP demonstrated evidence of a polyclonal hypogammaglobinemia with no evidence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin.
A UPEP demonstrated some albumin, but no evidence of a Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] protein.
These results were evidence of an infection with [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus at an indeterminate time in the past.
A Monospot test for acute [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus infection was negative.
A rapid plasma reagin test for syphilis was nonreactive.
Cultures of the right axillary lymph node were negative for evidence of aerobic bacterial infection, anaerobic bacterial infection, or mycobacterial, or fungal infection.
A test for anti-RNP antibody was positive.
The Rheumatology Service was unable to come up with a unifying diagnoses for all of these findings at the time of discharge.
DERMATOLOGY:  Due to his rash and the possibility that this represented a cutaneous manifestation of his systemic disease, he had a Dermatology consultation.
Their impression was that although he had evidence of a background-benign livedo reticularis on his inner thighs, it was not to a degree suggestive of vasculopathy.
Their impression was that his cutaneous findings were most consistent with a viral exanthem.
Despite workup as an inpatient, at the time of discharge, no unifying diagnosis could be found for the constellation of symptoms, signs, and laboratory abnormalities in Mr. [**Known lastname 41769**].
