Admission Date:  [**2182-2-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2182-2-9**]   Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of critical AS, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, tachy-brady syndrome, who presented to the Emergency Room with chest pain.
In the ED, the blood pressure was noted to be elevated at 230-270 systolic.
The patient was then noted to have ST segments in V4 through V6 and substernal chest pain started after eating.
The patient reports an episode of similar pain months ago.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
There was slow upstroke and positive murmur bilaterally.
Cardiac:  Regular rate with a harsh 3/4 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper and lower sternal border.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
White blood cell count 11.6, hematocrit 31.2, platelets 264,000, 92.8% neutrophils, no bands.
A chest x-ray, AP portable, revealed questionable focal infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was with critical AS, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, presenting with substernal chest pain.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course has been complicated, while awaiting cardiac catheterization to evaluate valve for possible coronary artery disease, by an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
During the same time, the patient also developed a fever and an elevated white count and it was felt that this episode was due to urosepsis.
Given persistent supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension, the patient was transferred to the CCU.
Her urinary cultures subsequently grew out E. coli and her antibiotics were adjusted.
The patient did convert back into atrial fibrillation and did have some pauses noted on telemetry.
Critical aortic stenosis.
Tachy-brady syndrome.
Atrial fibrillation.
