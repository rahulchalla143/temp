EMS was called and administered Narcan on arrival with with minimal improvement.
EKG without peaked T waves, ST dep in lateral leads, old q waves in inferior leads.
CT head neg but could not exclude mild cerebral edema due to motion artifact.
CXR with question of RML infiltrate, and as there was concern for meningitis given his AMS, he was given vancomycin 1gm, ceftriaxone 2gm.
CXR without obvious infiltrate but question of R paratracheal stripe.
Patient was given tylenol 650mg pr and abx coverage broadened to metronidazole 500mg IV and cefepime for pseudomonal coverage.
Review of OSH records shows that pt was admitted from [**Date range (1) 85837**] for LLE cellulitis and hematoma d/t trauma from fall; no acute fractures.
During that hospital course, he did have a work-up for abdominal pain.
CT abd ruled out pancreatitis with an abnormal duodenal finding; EGD showed severe duodenitis and small esophageal varices.
There were concerns about drug-seeking behavior although pt was discharged with 30 tabs of oxycodone due to recent trauma.

Diffuse T wave flattening is more prominent on this tracing.
- [**2198-3-30**] CXR portable: SINGLE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Retrocardiac opacity, new since one day prior, most likely represents atelectasis and less likely pneumonia.
Also new is a small left pleural effusion.
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
Fullness of central vascular markings is suggestive of mild volume overload or cardiac decompensation.
There is no pneumothorax.
New left lower lobe atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.
New small left pleural effusion.
Mild volume overload versus cardiac decompensation.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No larger pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
The pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis has mostly resolved.
No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged absence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
No visualization of pleural effusions.
Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises the possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or pleural effusion.
Diffuse bilateral subacute ischemic changes consistent with a global anoxic brain injury.
Sinus and mastoid disease as described above, the activity of which is to be determined clinically.
Old left frontal lobe infarction.
------  Brief Hospital Course: 51 yo man with a h/o diabetes mellitus II, polysubstance abuse (alcohol and heroin), HCV, cirrhosis, small esophageal varices, duodenitis/gastritis presenting with unresponsiveness.
# Unresponsiveness, most likely from anoxic brain injury: The patient was found unresponsive, intubated at OSH ED for airway protection.
There was concern for intoxication given finding of needles but tox screens negative.
Given IV drug use, concern that pt may have endocarditis with embolic showering, though TTE negative and no acute intracranial event seen on OSH CT head.
Metabolic reasons for unresponsiveness included hepatic encephalopathy, hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and low-grade uremia which were all treated.
Neurology consulted on the patient and diagnosed him with anoxic brain injury likely due to hypotension and later confirmed through a MRI.
# Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation for inability to protect his airway secondary to his unresponsiveness.
He was continued on pressure support ventilation and was extubated without difficulty.
# Seizure disorder: The patient was found to have a subclinical seizure disorder on EEG, most likely secondary to his anoxic brain injury.
# E. coli pneumonia: The patient presented with fever and was initially broadly covered with vancomycin, cefepime, acyclovir and flagyl.
# E. coli urinary tract infection: The patient was found to have a E. coli UTI which was treated with 7 days of IV cefepime.
# Acute renal failure: The patient presented with a Cr to 4.9 (baseline unknown).
Nephrology felt that it was most likely due to acute tubular necrosis (secondary to pre-renal from hypoperfusion).
Rhado (CKs elevated on admission) might have also played a role.
# Upper GI bleed: The patient was noted to have black tarry, guaiac positive stools.
His EGD report from OSH was obtained which showed small esophageal varices and gastritis/duodenitis.
Per his OG tube, he did not have active hematemesis.
Since he did not have any evidence of blood per OG tube, it was concluded that he did not have a brisk bleed and his initial bleed was likely due to his gastritis/duodenitis.
# Hypernatremia: The patient presented with hypernatremia, likely due to decreased PO intake.
The patient was started on free water to treat his deficit.
He was continued on maintainence fluids of D5 [**12-9**] normal saline for poor PO intake.
# Type II Diabetes mellitus: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.
His home glipizide was held and he was started on an insulin drip with tubefeeds due to hyperglycemia.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient presented with an anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate.
Toxic ingestion on differential but serum tox negative and renal consult felt that the AG metabolic acidosis was unlikely.
With IV hydration, improved renal function and treatment of underlying issues, his anion gap metabolic acidosis improved.
He did not receive any benzodiazepine doses for alcohol withdrawal and he is out of the window for any withdrawal symptoms.
# Coronary artery disease with demand ischemia: At OSH, CK, CK-MB, and trop all elevated; EKG with ST depressions.
Here, CK remains elevated but trop improving with resolution of ST depressions.
Possible that CK elevation may also reflect muscle breakdown as may have been nonresponsive for up to 2 days before being found.
Echo without any wall motion abnormalities and normal left ventricular EF>55%.
# Cirrhosis: The patient has hepatic cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy and small gastric varices.
The etiology of his cirrhosis is presumably hepatitis C and alcohol.
Initially his transaminases were elevated, likely due to liver hypoperfusion, but continued to trend downward.
He has evidence of synthetic dynsfunction, though not compensated.
Further details pertaining to his liver disease were not available during this hospitalization.
# Coagulopathy: The patient was noted to have an INR elevated to 3.0.
His continued elevated INR is likely due to his underlying cirrhosis.
Pt also with anemia but DIC unlikely with nl fibrinogen.
# Hepatitis C: No current issues.
