Admission Date:  [**2164-9-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2164-9-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-5-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism in [**2159**], obstructive sleep apnea, as well as schizoaffective disorder, borderline personality disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder who was found to have decreased mental status at her group home.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient also reports cough productive of moderate sputum (which she describes as her chronic baseline).
Recurrent aspiration pneumonia; status post swallow study in [**2163-12-23**].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with pulmonary function tests from [**2164-5-21**].
Diabetes mellitus times seven years with peripheral neuropathy.
Chronic pain from chest wall.
Obstructive sleep apnea with home CPAP.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Urinary incontinence.
Borderline personality disorder.
Posttraumatic stress disorder.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was an obese female who was alert and conversant, in no apparent distress.
Chest revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
A systolic ejection murmur at the border, loud first heart sound.
The abdomen was soft, slightly tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, obese, normal active bowel sounds, and without masses.
Extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
A urine toxicology screen showed positive benzodiazepines, opiates, and amphetamines.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray was poor quality, but preliminarily read as bibasilar patches.
A CT angiogram was negative for evidence of pulmonary embolism.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 50-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with obstructive sleep apnea, recurrent aspiration, with an increase in narcotic use who presented with altered mental status, decreased respiratory rate and cough secondary to the MS Contin.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit overnight for monitoring of her respiratory status and mental status.
The patient was initially started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for a question aspiration pneumonia and given 125 mg of Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department for question chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
However, while in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's respiratory status and mental status improved to her baseline.
Given the improvement in her oxygen saturations and her mental status, her symptoms were attributed to the change from Percocet to MS Contin.
She did well in the Intensive Care Unit with oxygen saturations as described above without the need for antibiotics or steroids.
The patient was also prescribed CPAP at night; however, the patient was noncompliant and may benefit from its use at home given her obstructive sleep apnea.
PAIN CONTROL:  The patient continued to take Percocet without change in mental status.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Mental status changes and respiratory depression secondary to long-acting narcotic use.
