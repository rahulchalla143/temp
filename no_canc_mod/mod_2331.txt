Admission Date:  [**2102-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-10-3**]   Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 82 yo M w/ h/o IMI, DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, CHF with EF of 30%, and COPD who was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**Date range (1) 14447**] for SOB and was treated for COPD flare with steroids.
The next day (DOA) pt was again feeling SOB with PND, orthopnea, and abd pain and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt has h/o recent H.pylori infxn and was c/o black stools.
EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V3.
He was taken to the cath lab where coronaries showed no acute disease.
Pt became agitated and had decreased MS so was electively intubated.
IABP was inserted and sBP dropped to the 40's.
Dopamine and Levophed were started and sBP increased to the 110's.
Echo showed some AI, severity unclear.
Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease with remote IMI.
Mild organic brain syndrome/depression.
Social History: Notable for occasional alcohol.
A 100-pack-year history of tobacco, but quit.
Family History: Notable for a brother who died in his 50s from a MI, no diabetes, no pulmonary disease or cancer.
Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy.
No carotid bruits.
No wheezes or crackles Abd: S/ND.
3+ pitting edema to just above ankles.
There is perihilar haziness bilaterally and slight prominence of the upper zone pulmonary vasculature, consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
Allowing for this, there are probable bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Flattening of the hemidiaphragms and coarsened interstitial markings bilaterally, consistent with emphysematous change.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  revealed multi vessel coronary disease.
The LAD had serial 50% stenosis in the proximal and mid vessel.
Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated mean PCPW of 28mmhg.
Central aortic pressure was  elevated at 164/81.
Due to respiratory distress the patient was intubated during the procedure.
Shortly following insertion and intubation, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s.
This raised concern for AI so an echocardiogram was performed which revealed markedly depressed ejection fraction of ~20%.
The patient was sent to the CCU intubated, on dopamine and levophed for hemodynamic support.
Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 20 percent).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is a small tract extending from the right common femoral artery all the way to the skin likely representing the former catheter tract.
This tract is small and measures approximately 5 mm immediately under the skin.
This would be amenable to ultrasound guided embolization if clinically warranted.
There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right inguinal pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula   Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo M with CAD, CHF EF 30%, recent COPD exacerbation, diarrhea, F/C, H. pylori infxn who p/w SOB, cath without evidence of acute disease who developed subsequent hypotension, leukocytosis, and coffee-ground emesis.
CV: A. CAD: no evidence of acute lesions on cath (just chronic).
Repeat echo showed severe Left LV hypokinesis with EF of 20%.
The pt will remain on this for COPD until it is tapered by PCP as [**Name9 (PRE) 3782**] after lungs have improved.
E. R groin psuedoaneurysm: After the pt's catheterization the pt was found to have a small R groin pseudoaneurysm by U/S.
The pt still had a good deal of ecchmosis but no bruits.
Pulmonary: Pt was initially intubated due to respiratory distress.
Pressors were weaned and he was extubated without difficulty.
However, he still had wheezes and crackles.
COPD - continue nebs standing and inhalers.
Pt had been receiving steroids, but there was still concern for PNA vs. c.diff given h/o cough and diarrhea.
Sputum and stool samples came back negative, but CXR indicated a probable PNA and pt was covered empirically with Levo and Flagyl x 10 days to cover for possible aspiration as well as typical pneumonia.
He remained afebrile and WBC count trended down.
GI: In the ED the pt had presented with coffee grounds emesis x 1, but cleared with 300 cc lavage.
Pt had no more episodes of emesis after this and Hct remained stable, although stools were heme-occult positive.
Endo: Pt had BG's in the 300's throughout his hospitalization, which was likely due to steroid use, and sliding scale insulin was increased to accomodate this.
Zolpidem Tartrate 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
If shortness of breath increases significantly, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] right away.
Ask him to assess your lungs and to taper prednisone if COPD exacerbation is improved.
Also, diabetes management needs to be addressed, especially while you are on steroids.
Please arrange to have an EGD/colonoscopy due to recent GI bleed and H.pylori infection.
