Immediately after a fall at [**Hospital **] rehab one day prior to admission here, patient experienced increased back pain with radiation down her leg and more difficulty moving her right leg.
Evaluation at [**Hospital6 2561**] included an MRI which showed worsening L3-4 disc protrusion.
She also demonstrated some myoclonus/asterixis on exam and received some iv ativan (amount unclear).
Exam in the ED here notable for decreased rectal tone and decreased sensation in the medial thigh.
She had leg weakness more prominent on the right side, some decreased sensation on right leg in an L3-4 distribution, and absent DTRs in the RLE.
MRI revealed 1)Epidural hematoma extending from L2-L3 level to L4-L5 level resulting in marked mass effect on the thecal sac and as a result, compression of the nerve roots.
2) Moderate disc bulge at L4-L5 resulting in moderate stenosis of the spinal canal at that level.
3) Small disc herniation at L5-S1 level does not appear to cause significant spinal stenosis.
There are bilateral facet degenerative changes at these levels which resulted in severe left sided neural foraminal narrowing.
Pt underwent emergent L3 laminectomy/discectomy [**4-12**] given concern for cauda equina syndrome.
