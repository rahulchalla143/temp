HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old female who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for evaluation of potential revascularization.
She is a lady with medical history significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and prior tobacco use, who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital complaining of a several week history of epigastric burning.
This eventually proved to be a non Q wave myocardial infarction with initial CKs and troponin levels being unremarkable and then with a subsequent increase to CKs in the 400 range with a positive MB band and a troponin increased to 30.
Cardiac catheterization there revealed that she had three vessel disease and moderate left ventricular dysfunction.
Her catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in the left anterior descending and a 60% ostial stenosis in the first diagonal, a 90% lesion in the left circumflex and a 90% lesion in the OM1, a proximal occlusion of the right coronary artery with midvessel reconstitution and a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 30 to 35%.
Given her three vessel disease with left ventricular dysfunction in the face of her diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, she was felt to be an excellent candidate for potential revascularization and was sent to us for further evaluation.
Diabetes mellitus with retinopathy and nephropathy.
Hyperlipidemia with HLA-IIa.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Sulfa.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is noted to be a pleasant 60 year old female in no acute distress.
There is no jugular venous distention.
Her right groin is status post catheterization and has a slightly sanguinous discharge.
She was several kilograms positive postoperatively and had a good response to Lasix in attempt to have her diurese.
She was able to ascend stairs without any difficulty.
We do understand that she has diabetic nephropathy and will likely need to be restarted on these by her cardiologist in approximately one week.
She will need to have a potassium drawn after approximately two days at home.
Coronary artery disease with three vessel disease and diminished left ventricular function.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Hyperlipidemia with HLA-IIa.
