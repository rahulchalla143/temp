A cardiac catheterization was performed at that time which revealed a normal left main coronary artery, 99% stenosed proximal right coronary artery, 99% stenosed mid left anterior descending artery, normal circumflex, 85% stenosed first obtuse marginal, and a ramus with diffuse disease.
Mild-to-moderate diastolic dysfunction.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to CODEINE.
Physical examination revealed the patient's leg with the intra-aortic balloon pump which was slightly modeled was improving with warm feet and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.

The second time the patient was converted to sinus rhythm at 80 with frequent premature atrial contractions.
The patient was A-paced at 98; however, he still had some premature atrial contractions.
The patient had a positive sputum culture from [**12-26**] with gram-positive cocci in pairs and yeast; for which he was placed on the vancomycin.
