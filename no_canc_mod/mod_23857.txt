Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS:  [**2159-5-12**] 03:45PM   GLUCOSE-129* UREA N-29* CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-3.0* CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-13 [**2159-5-12**] 03:45PM   WBC-14.0* RBC-4.22 HGB-13.1 HCT-38.9 MCV-92 MCH-31.0 MCHC-33.6 RDW-14.0 [**2159-5-12**] 03:45PM   PT-11.9 PTT-21.1* INR(PT)-1.0  IMAGING: NC Head CT [**5-12**]: There is a 3cm Right temporal ICH with surrounding edema.
There is also a very small focus of extraxial(subarrachnoid) blood over the high right parietal convexity.
CTA HEad [**5-12**]: IMPRESSION: Dense atherosclerotic calcifications with a combination of soft plaques are demonstrated on the left carotid bifurcation with no significant stenosis.
A partially calcified thyroid nodule is noted on the right, correlation with thyroid ultrasound is recommended in a non-emergent basis, bilateral pleural scarring and bilateral emphysematous changes  CT Head [**5-13**]: 1.
Stable appearance to right temporal hemorrhage and edema.
Apparently new isodense crescentic density overlying the left convexity likely represents subdural blood products.
CT Head [**5-14**]: Right temporal intracranial hemorrhage redemonstrated and unchanged.
Trace subarachnoid blood within the left parietal lobe and the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle is also unchanged.
No new hemorrhage or mass effect   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the NSurg service for close observation.
On [**5-13**], her repeat Head CT showed no evidence of interval change.
She was seen by the pain consult service for her chronic back pain, who recommended Tylenol and a muscle relaxer PRN.
She was quite nauseated and dizzy with standing; zofran was given, which gave her good relief, and a fluid bolus helped with the orthostasis.
This revealed a trasnverse fracture of the distal bone.
She was seen by physical therapy who determined she met criteria for an acute rehab center.
