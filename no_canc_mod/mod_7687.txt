Admission Date:  [**2158-4-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2158-5-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2086-6-12**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year old female patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11493**], who has previously had two stents to the right coronary artery, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] initially for an outpatient cardiac catheterization as a result of a recent positive exercise tolerance test.
Congestive heart failure.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Anxiety disorder.
Catheterization revealed two vessel coronary artery disease, significantly decreased left ventricular function and pulmonary hypertension.
On [**2158-4-13**], the patient underwent a diagnostic angiogram secondary to 100 millimeter gradient and systolic blood pressure from the right to the left arm and she was found to have a totally occluded left subclavian artery.
On postoperative day one, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilator and was extubated, however, over the course of the next two days, the patient was noted to have decreasing urine output, decreasing cardiac output and requirement for inotropic support.
On [**2158-4-17**], postoperative day three, an echocardiogram was obtained which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%, decreased right ventricular function, 2+ mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
The following day the patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory to evaluate coronary artery disease and patency of saphenous vein grafts due to her continued need for inotropic support.
Catheterization revealed low cardiac output, revealed a 90% occlusion of her saphenous vein to the diagonal coronary artery graft as well as 80% left anterior descending lesion.
There was an attempt made to stent the saphenous vein to the diagonal graft, however, this resulted in dehiscence of the anastomosis as well as a free perforation into the left ventricle and pericardium.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed at that time due to hemodynamic instability.
The patient over the next week or so underwent a very slow wean of inotropic support.
On [**2158-4-24**], the patient went to the Electrophysiology Laboratory for placement of a DDD permanent pacemaker due to continued need for pacemaker support and need to suppress atrial fibrillation which was resulting in bradycardic rhythms.
On [**2158-5-10**], the patient had a PICC line for continued intravenous access placed due to finding of a positive catheter tip culture of her central line which revealed E. coli as well as Enterococcus which were pansensitive.
The patient has had no subsequent positive blood cultures and that line was discontinued.
The patient tolerated this procedure well and continued very slow wean from ventilator support over the next week or so.
On [**2158-5-15**], the patient received a neurology consultation due to generalized lethargy, decreased movement of all her extremities and her decreased responsiveness mentally.
It was their thought that the patient had generalized neuropathy and myopathy and the recommendation was to obtain an EMG which is scheduled to be done tomorrow, [**2158-5-18**].
The patient also underwent a left upper extremity ultrasound due to swelling of the left arm and this resulted in a negative study for deep vein thrombosis.
Central line which was discontinued on [**2158-5-9**], was positive for E. coli as well as Enterococcus.
All subsequent blood cultures have been negative with the exception of yeast in her sputum and urine from [**2158-5-2**].
Digoxin which is on hold currently due to elevated Digoxin level.
She also receives Collagenase Ointment with dressings applied to her sacral decubitus b.i.d.
Her physical examination today is as follows:  The patient is afebrile with stable vital signs.
She previously has had atrial fibrillation which has been suppressed with Procainamide and Digoxin.
The patient is lethargic at times.
Her Digoxin is on hold currently, and the patient has significant blood pressure discrepancy.
Her left arm is significantly lower than her right arm due to subclavian artery stenosis on the left.
Pulmonary examination - Her breath sounds are coarse bilaterally.
Her abdomen is obese and benign.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, status post stent to the graft with perforation and resultant emergency operation to repair the anastomosis.
Diabetes mellitus.
Generalized neuropathy and myopathy from prolonged hospitalization.
Atrial fibrillation with treatment resulting in bradycardia requiring DDD permanent pacemaker placement.
