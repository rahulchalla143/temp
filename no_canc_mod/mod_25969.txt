Admission Date:  [**2118-6-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-7-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-7-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**] Chief Complaint: jaundice and abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP with stent placement   History of Present Illness: 30 yo woman from [**Country 11150**] with history of treated TB (per pt) who presented to OSH with jaundice and abdominal pain, now transfered from OSH for concert for cholangitis and sepsis in the setting of liver cyst.
The pt was originally admitted to OSH on [**6-22**] for abdominal pain and jaundice.
CT scan during that admission showed intra and extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation with a large cystic component in the biliary duct and a suggestion of a choledochal cyst with associated infection/ inflammation.
On [**6-25**] the pt developed abdominal pain which was relieved with percocet.
On [**6-26**] the pt developed nausea and non-bloody emesis, and presented to OSH ED.
The pt's symptoms improved with supportive medications, but the pt was noted to have SBP's persistently low, sometimes in the 70's and was transfered to the OSH ICU.
During the admission from [**Date range (1) 89245**], the pt was noted to have poor U/O, with only 2L out despite 11L in during her length of stay.
The pt was initially started on ertapenem and flagyl for presumed cholangitis and pancreatitis, but then it was determined that ertapenem would provide adequate coverage and flagyl was stopped.
The pt was kept NPO, and did have an episode of hypoglycemia in the 40's that responded to an amp of D50.
Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: Admission PE:  General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Thin, soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, liver edge palpable, no HSM GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, trace bilat LE edema, pitting Neuro: Speech fluent, A+Ox3, 5/5 strength in bilat upper and lower extremities.
Diffuse irregular intra- and extrahepatic biliary dilation,with dominant massively dilated biliary structure encompassing the majority of the right hepatic lobe.
This is felt most likely to represent diffuse choledochal cyst formation (Todani Type [**Doctor First Name 690**]).
Postinfectious biliary dilation is felt less likely due to lack of stricturing and lack of intraductal stones.
Appearance is not typical of echinococcal disease (as questioned).
Diffuse peribiliary enhancement consistent with superinfection/cholangitis, and probable chronic right portal venous compression or occlusion with collateralization.
However, short interval follow up after treatment and resolution of symptoms (within 3 months) is recommended to ensure resolution of enhancement about the cyst, in order to exclude an adjacent infiltrative mass.
Perihepatic and subdiaphragmatic free fluid that could relate to inflammatory or infectious change or prior cyst rupture into the perihepatic space.
Additional left sided intrahepatic biliary dilation and wall enhancement.
Extensive stones and sludge throughout the extrahepatic and right intrahepatic biliary system.
1 cm biliary stricture noted in the right hepatic duct.
Proximal to this was severe dilation with debris inside consistent with patient's known biliary dilation/cyst.
Extraction of significant amount of stones/debris, although extensive debris remains in the right intrahepatic bile ducts at the end of the procedure.
Findings most consistent with oriental cholangiohepatitis.
PFI: Given limitations in comparing cross modalities, persisting cystic structure in the right kidney with heterogeneous echogenic material within it, similar in size to prior MR, and draining into a dilated bile duct.
[**7-1**] CXR: Volume loss left upper lobe probably due to old lung infection, but mass effect is present.
[**6-30**] Bile duct brushing cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Extensive findings consistent with prior tuberculose exposure.
No evidence of echinococcal infestation of lungs or mediastinum.
Several noncalcified pulmonary nodules, most likely consistent with noncalcified granulomas.

# Choledochal/hepatic cyst: DDx included echinococcus, amebic, or other parasitic cyst vs simple cyst vs. abscess vs. tumor.
Parasitic cyst was felt to be most likely due to eosinophilia and recent immigration from [**Country 11150**].
Serologies for echinococcus was positive at the outside hospital, multiple serologies at [**Hospital1 18**] were sent which confirmed echinococcus positivity.
Albendazole was started empirically at the outside hospital prior to her transfer due to concern for echinoccal cyst and possible spillage leading to hypotension.
# Cholangitis- ERCP was consulted, as was hepatobiliary surgery and infectious disease.She underwent an ERCP on [**6-30**] and stones and sludge were removed.
She received empiric treatment with cipro, flagyl given concern for cholangitis/bacterial infection.
Her symptoms of nausea and abdominal pain improved.
She will complete a 2 week course of cipro/flagyl per ERCP recommendations, given the duration of her obstruction and the presence of the cyst.
#Hypotension:  Pt was hypotensive on admission, however this resolved with fluids and remained stable with careful monitoring throughout her stay in the ICU.
This may have been due to cholangitis/bacterial infection.
However, given the possibility of an echinoccocal cyst, there was initial concern for anaphylaxis.
Disp:*24 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Choledochal/hepatic cyst Cholangitis Hypotension Eosinophilia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with abdominal pain and were found to have blockage in your bile duct, this was opened up and stented with drainage of gallstones and sludge.
You were also found to have a large fluid filled cyst pushing on your liver and liver veins; this cyst which communicates with/connects to the bile duct system.
