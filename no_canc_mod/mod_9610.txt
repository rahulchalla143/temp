Admission Date:  [**2198-7-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2198-7-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2129-2-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and transferred for potential cardiac catheterization.
Acute myocardial infarction.
Atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion.
Left lower lobe pseudomonal pneumonia.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Acute renal failure.
Urinary tract infection.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He is a 69-year-old man with COPD dependent on oxygen at home and steroids, question type 2 diabetes, question insulin dependent.
He was transferred from the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with hypotension, new ST elevations in the inferior leads.
He was found unresponsive and dehydrated with blood sugar in the 30's.
He was intubated and treated for right middle lobe, right lower lobe pneumonia.
He was noted to have a new intermittent left bundle branch block on [**6-27**].
He was found to have MRSA in his sputum and was treated with Vancomycin and Unasyn and then was discharged to a rehab unit, [**Hospital1 **], on [**6-27**].
However, he was noted to have dark stool and a hematocrit around 25.
He was found on EKG to have an intermittent left bundle branch block with a white blood cell count of 12.4 and no reported fevers.
However, chest x-ray was negative but leukocyte esterase and many bacteria were found on the urinalysis.
On [**2198-7-14**], in the morning the patient was noted to have chest pain, systolic blood pressure to the 70's with new ST elevations in 2, 3, and AVF.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for COPD on home O2 and chronic Prednisone, type 2 diabetes mellitus, question of insulin dependent,  his reason for starting on insulin was unclear.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
On admission had no chest pain or shortness of breath, no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and no complaints.
There was tenderness at the site of the subclavian tunneled catheter.
Lungs were consistent with coarse breath sounds at the bases.
The patient had distant heart sounds, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
He had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
His rectal exam showed guaiac positive.
Urinalysis was positive, nitrite negative, leukocyte esterase, 5 reds, 14 white blood cells and moderate bacteria.
EKG on [**6-27**] found a left bundle branch block pacing at 100.
On [**7-13**] this showed sinus rhythm at 78, normal axis, anterior Q's in V1 through V2, no ST elevations in V4 or the right sided leads.
On [**7-14**] there was a left bundle branch block at [**Street Address(2) 28717**] elevations in the inferior leads.
Chest x-ray showed no CHF, question of cardiomegaly, right upper lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates  HOSPITAL COURSE:  He had a central venous line placed, a right four lumen catheter was put in and in addition: 1.
Cardiovascular: A) Coronary artery disease:  His CPK again were found to have ruling in for myocardial infarction.
He was evaluated and the EKG was consistent with an anterior myocardial infarction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include a severe septal and anterior hypokinesis, right ventricular chamber size and wall motion were normal.
The aortic root was moderately dilated, the aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened, there was 1+ mitral regurgitation seen.
There was no pericardial effusion.
A TEE was done on [**7-19**], it was done for two reasons: 1) To find out if the patient had bacteremia, whether there was any evidence of endocarditis subsequent to increasing white count and the TEE was negative for endocarditis.
The patient still continued to have episodes of low blood pressure almost daily.
He was weaned down to mask but then had difficulty coming off secondary to anxiety.
Then he developed a pseudomonal pneumonia and his secretions increased considerably.
He has a history of chronic steroid needs and so he arrived with 20 mg of Prednisone q d, was weaned down to 50 mg po q day and it can eventually be weaned down further but he was left at 50 mg upon discharge.
An arterial line was placed and then had to be removed after admission because of positive blood cultures.
An A line was replaced on [**7-26**] secondary to several blood gases because the patient had not been tolerating 18 hours of trach mask very well.
The A line, of course, was discontinued upon discharge with no complications.
Renal:  The patient went into acute renal failure in the setting of hypotension on [**7-23**] which resolved with hydration.
There were no other renal issues.
It was a renal protective mode.
GI:  The patient came with guaiac positive stools, was not pursued by colonoscopy.
The patient ceased to have guaiac positive stools within the three days of admission and resolved afterwards and the patient did not have a problem even after he was gotten on a therapeutic level of Warfarin.
ID:  On [**7-14**] the patient had urine with Serratia which was treated with Levofloxacin for three days.
In between that, he went into acute renal failure so his Vancomycin was changed from q 12 hours to dosing by Vanco levels below 15.
The patient will complete the course on [**7-28**], however, because of his renal function, the dose on the 21st was sufficient.
The patient also had sputum on [**7-14**] with pseudomonas, first thought to be colonized, then a week later after being treated for his MRSA bacteremia was still found to have an elevated white cell count.
The sensitivities had shown the pseudomonas effectiveness by Ceftazidime and virtually no other antibiotic.
On [**7-17**] the patient had a blood culture showing coag negative staff and elevated white blood cell count.
The TTE and TEE were both negative for endocarditis.
On [**7-19**] the patient had four bottles of blood culture sent and no growth to date has been from them and he has had no blood cultures positive since then.
He has not spiked a fever since then.
A C. diff toxin was done and he was positive for C. diff.
The patient was found on the 19th to have yeast in his urine and so his Foley catheter was changed.
CT abdomen on [**7-23**] showed bilateral pleural effusions, multiple colonic diverticula without signs of diverticulitis and degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine as prescribed in the full report.
The CT was done to find additional signs of infection and that was eventually found to be due to C. diff and the patient's white count went up to the 20's and then started to trend down again once being treated with the PO Metronidazole for his C. diff.
The patient had a chest x-ray on [**7-26**] which showed a left retrocardiac collapse/consolidation, improved appearance of CHF with bilateral small pleural effusions.
Again, the patient had a chest x-ray in the middle of his course which showed a pseudomonal pneumonia in the left lower lobe.
He had elevated blood glucose levels which led to an insulin drip for a period of time until he was titrated down to normal levels and then started on NPH insulin twice a day, 18 units subcu and then completed with a regular insulin sliding scale and when his NPH level should be titrated up or down depending on his fingersticks which are measured q 6 hours until he is stable.
Psychiatric:  The patient remained very anxious and that actually impaired his weaning.
The patient's left subclavian has no complications and can be removed after the final dose of his Ceftazidime on [**7-28**].
He was originally put on 5 mg, that was found to be too high secondary to his INR going up, then 4 mg q h.s.
