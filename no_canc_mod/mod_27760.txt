X-rays were taken and he was found to have a left midshaft femur fracture.
Past Medical History: CAD - severe, inoperable CAD (s/p cath, no stents); ischemic CM EF 28% in [**2167**] Admission [**2169-6-30**] for cardiac Arrest CKD (unknown etiology, ?
baseline Cr 2.7) HTN sacral decubitus ulcer h/o UTI [**3-4**] (MDR enterobacter, h/o MRSA in urine) s/p indwelling foley ([**2167**]) [**2-1**] sacral decubitus schizophrenia (not active since in 20s) paraparesis (progressive over many years, unknown etiology) AFib (on outpatient coumadin) Hypercholesterolemia Horseshoe kidney AAA  Social History: Patient is currently a resident at [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital **]care Center.
Acute displaced and angulated fracture of the distal left femur.
Old fracture of the distal tibia and fibula.
Diffuse demineralization.
Very distended loops of colon and some distended loops of small bowel, secondary to marked fecal impaction.
Focal linear lucencies along the distal colon and a small triangular area of gas in the left lower quadrant, not definitely localizable to either small or large bowel.
No definite free intraperitoneal air is identified, and the linear lucencies most likely represent air around impacted stool.
However, if the patient has any localizable symptoms such as abdominal pain to raise suspicion for bowel pathology or pneumatosis, CT should be performed for further evaluation.
FEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT  [**2171-6-19**] HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT; FEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT IMPRESSION: Obliquely oriented and mildly comminuted fracture of the distal left femoral diaphysis with decreased angulation and persistent displacement.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2171-6-19**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
FEMORAL VASCULAR US LEFT PORT  [**2171-6-21**] IMPRESSION: Large left groin hematoma without evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
Left groin hematoma with intraluminal active extravasation from left femoral arterial puncture.
Bilateral dependent consolidation in the upper and lower lung fields, concerning for aspiration.
Acute rib fractures of the right anterior two through six ribs with a suggestion of minimal underlying contusion.
Rectum largely distended with stool, which was also present on study from [**2169-6-30**].
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Pelvic horseshoe kidney with delayed excretion of contrast, consistent with renal impairment.
Mild intra-abdominal ascites.
Stage IV ulcer in the left buttock extending to the left ischial tuberosity.
ECHO Study Date of [**2171-6-21**] IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Since the previous tracing of [**2171-6-18**] atrial premature beats are present, QRS complexes have narrowed somewhat, the Q-T interval is prolonged and there is a voltage decreased seen throughout the electrocardiogram.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2171-6-26**] IMPRESSION: Overall no significant change since [**2169-7-7**].
Chronic right frontal lobe infarct and moderate brain atrophy identified.
Soft tissue changes are seen in both mastoid air cells and in the maxillary sinuses.
No acute infarcts are identified.
MRA could not be performed as patient was unable to continue.
No evidence of pancreatitis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
3-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Severe fecal loading of the sigmoid colon.
Decubitus ulcer extending to the left inferior pubic ramus with cortical irregularity and increased sclerosis consistent with osteomyelitis.
Region of lenticular soft tissue attenuation insinuating within the fascia of the left medial thigh.
This may be secondary to postoperative infectious or inflammatory etiologies.
Cholelithiasis; no definite evidence of choledocholithiasis or acute cholecystitis.
Infrarenal 3.2 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
He was seen by his PCP for operative clearance.
A KUB was done to evaluated the mass in his abdomen, which showed large amounts a stool and chronic constipation.
On [**2171-6-19**] he was brought to the operating room for fixation of his left femur fracture.
On POD#2 he was found unresponsive at approximately 7 am and a "code blue" was called.
