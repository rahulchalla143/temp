There is mild vasogenic edema and resultant asymmetry and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
There is no midline shift.
Age-appropriate involutional atrophy and no hydrocephalus.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION:  Large intraparenchymal hematoma centered in the left basal ganglia with additional large amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage within the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe sulci.
The differential would include hypertensive hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke.
NCHCT [**2192-1-13**] at 10:11 am: In comparison with the prior study, again a large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage is visualized as well as the subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the left basal ganglia and left frontal, parietal and temporal lobes.
In the interim, there is evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage with hyperdense fluid levels layering in both occipital ventricular horns.
The core of the hematoma is more conspicuous and larger occupying the right basal ganglia, there is also evidence of midline shifting larger mass effect producing effacement of the left lateral ventricle.
The perimesencephalic cisterns remain patent; however, the pattern of edema appears slightly larger on the left temporal lobe.
New hyperdense areas of hemorrhage are noted in the subependymal region and left caudate nuclei.
The orbits, the mastoid air cells and the paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  In comparison with the prior study, there is evidence of enlargement of the pattern of hemorrhage involving the left basal ganglia; there is also increase in the pattern of vasogenic edema and mass effect with 4 mm of midline shifting to the right.
There is also evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage involving both occipital ventricular horns as described above.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There is left basilar atelectasis, but no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
No consolidation or CHF.
Brief Hospital Course: Given the severity of the hemorrhage and the need for intubation for airway protection, the patient was admitted to the neurologic ICU for further evaluation and management.
On examination on rounds the following morning, the patient showed minimal responsiveness to noxious, even as the propofol had been turned off for nearly 30 minutes.
He had a right hemiplegia and bilateral upgoing toes.
Given concern for expanding hemorrhage with shift and herniation, a repeat CT of the head was performed, which revealed evidence of enlargement of the pattern of hemorrhage involving the left basal ganglia; there was also increase in the pattern of vasogenic edema and mass effect with 4 mm of midline shifting to the right.
There was also evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage involving both occipital ventricular horns.
The Neurology and Neurosurgery services met with the patient's family and discussed the patient's very poor prognosis and extremely limited chances for any kind of meaningful recovery.
