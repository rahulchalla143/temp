Right moderate hydronephrosis and hydroureter with enhancement of the wall of the right ureter and an apparent distal ureteral mass or stone as well as urinary bladder wall thickening.
4.3-cm right lower quadrant cystic structure inseparable from the appendix and the cecum and adjacent loops of bowel, may represent a GI duplication cyst or adnexal cyst.
Pelvic ultrasound suggested on a nonemergent basis if this cystic structure has not been previously characterized and the right ovary has not been previously resected.
Cholelithiasis and dilatation of the common bile duct up to 9 mm is slightly above upper limit of normal for patient's stated age.
Severe atherosclerotic disease, right renal stent, and possible 3.0 x 1.4 cm aneurysm of the right common femoral artery.
Sclerotic appearance with trabecular thickening of the left iliac bone, most compatible with Paget's disease.

Pyelonephritis : Patient found to have R hydronephrosis on her admitting CT abdomen.
Cause of her hydronephrosis will be further evaluated by urology.
Acute delirium: Patient's lethargy on admission likely reflected delirium in setting of UTI.
Of note, she has a history of labile blood pressures during dialysis sessions.
Hypoxia: Patient had 4L O2 requirement on admission, no evidence of consolidation her chest imaging.
Possibilities included fluid overload and hypoventilation given her abdominal discomfort.
She did not require intubation or noninvasive ventilation.

You had a urinary tract infection that spread to your kidneys.
A CT showed a blockage in your urinary system so a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by interventional radiology.

Your infection is being treated with an antibiotic.
