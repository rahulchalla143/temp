Admission Date:  [**2118-1-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-2-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-6-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: PLASTIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5667**] Chief Complaint: Motor vehicle accident  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L subclavian central line .
[**1-28**] - exploratory laparotomy, I&D Left open fibula fracture/LLE four compartment fasciotomies, vac placement, closed reduction left hip dislocation, xploration of peroneal nerve, Non fixation treatment of fibula fracture .
Intubated at OSH for mental status.
Given 2L NS at OSH for SBP 90 and 2u PRBC during transfer with return of SBP to 100.
Also with L hip dislocation unable to be reduced at OSH.
L open fib fracture reduced at OSH with return of distal pulses.
Arriving intubated, hypotensive and tachycardic.
Abd: equivocal FAST with questionable fluid in morrisons [**Hospital 42265**].
Ext: L open fibular fracture with large open skin defect.
No evidence of traumatic injury in the chest.
Possible acetabular fracture.
CT Head: No evidence of fracture or intracranial hemorrhage.
Somewhat indistinct [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation raises the possibility of diffuse axonal injury/shear injury.
NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW:  There is a linear lucency in the lesser [**Doctor First Name 362**] o sphenoid on the lft side ([**3-10**]), which can be a vascular groove, appearing more prominent due to rotated position or linear minimally displaced fracture.
CT C-spine: IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or malalignment.
Relocation of the left hip with probable small fracture of the posterior roof of the left acetabulum.
Patchy opacity in the right middle lobe and hazy centrilobular nodularity within the left upper lobe anteriorly most consistent with pneumonia.
Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Short segment nonopacification of the anterior tibial artery at the level of a comminuted distal fibular fracture, compatible with post-traumatic arterial injury, possibly dissection.
Small pseudoaneurysm with associated extravasation of a very small vessel medial to the tibial shaft.
Comminuted fibular fractures with a large open soft tissue defect.
Digital images of the left ankle (AP) shows a fracture of the distal shaft of the fibula, approximately 10 cm above the ankle joint.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal right ventricular cavity size with free wall hypokinesis c/w possible contusion.
Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
No definite valvular dysfunction.
CT sinus: IMPRESSION: No fracture.
The previously identified linear lucency in the lesser [**Doctor First Name 362**] likely represents a vascular groove.
In the trauma bay, he was found to be hypotensive despite 2L of fluid and 2u PRBC before arrival.
FAST exam was equivocal with questionable blood in [**Location (un) 6813**] [**Last Name (LF) 42265**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy which was negative for injury.
Subsequently, orthopedics performed a closed reduction of his hip dislocation as well as a irrigation and debridement of the open fibular fracture with four compartment fasciotomies and peroneal nerve exploration.
The Left acetabular fracture was determined to be non-operative.
Patient was managed on a bicarb drip given his significantly elevated CPK.
Also on [**1-29**], an ECHO demonstrated an area of free wall motion abnormality consistent with possible cardiac contusion, however, he remained hemodynamically stable.
He experienced some delerium post-op and was managed on a CIWA scale for possible ETOH withdrawal.
Antimicrobial coverage for his leg wound was initially covered by vancomycin and was transitioned to cefazolin on [**1-31**].
On [**2-3**] plastic surgery took the patient back to the OR for a repeat washout of his wound with I&D.
His abdominal staples were removed on [**2-7**] and the wound was clean, dry and intact.
On [**2-10**] the pt returned to the OR for improved coverage of his leg wound with a medial gastrocnemius flap covered with a split thickness skin graft measuring 35 x 15 cm.
At this time, xeroform dressing, kerlix and ACE wrap covered the wound and he remained in an AFO boot.
He began ambulating with physical therapy [**2-17**] with restrictions of no weight bearing.
He remained non weight bearing but allowed to ambulate with crutches or walker, with knee immobilizer in place.
PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*100 ML(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: JML  in [**Hospital1 1562**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p motor vehicle crash Open fibular fracture LLE compartment syndrome left hip dislocation with posterior wall acetabular fracture Degloving injury left medial tibia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were treated in the hospital after a motor vehicle accident.
You had an exploratory operation of your abdomen which showed no injury, and you sustained an open fracture to your leg that was cleaned and repaired with multiple surgeries by both orthopedic and plastic surgeons.
Please call your doctor or return to the ED for any fevers >101.5, increased pain, nausea/vomiting, any redness or drainage from the wound or any numbness, weakness or tingling in your leg or any other symptom that should worry you.
You will be prescribed pain medication, please do not drive or operate heavy machinery while on this medication due to the fact these medications may cause drowsiness or somnolence.
When ambulating, use a walker or crutches with your left leg in a knee immobilizer.
Dangle protocol - dangle your left leg for a period of 30 min four times per day for two days.
