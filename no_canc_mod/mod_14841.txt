HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58 year old female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, family history of coronary artery disease, mitral regurgitation, who presents from an outside hospital with waxing substernal chest pressure since 4:45 p.m. on [**2147-7-8**].
The patient was in her usual state of health until the evening of admission when after some dyspepsia she had a sudden onset of ten out of ten substernal chest pressure without radiation with diaphoresis and mild shortness of breath.
She then had resolution of her symptoms to zero out of ten after the second dose of lytics.
Her electrocardiogram showed ST elevations anteriorly as well as some ectopy and a questionable junctional rhythm after reperfusion with the lytic therapy.
At the [**Hospital1 69**], her electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in leads V1 through V4 as well as I and aVL.
The catheterization showed:  1) Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery was long but had no obstructions.
The mid left anterior descending had an 80% tubular lesion with TIMI-3 flow.
A small D2 at the lesion site had TIMI-2 flow.
The left circumflex and right coronary artery had no significant stenoses.
2)  Resting hemodynamics showed normal pulmonary and central aortic pressures with mildly elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
3)  Left ventriculography showed anterior hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 49%.
There was no mitral regurgitation.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow.
Hypercholesterolemia with an increased HDL fraction, numbers unknown at present.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Right elbow fracture.
Minimal exercise.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of myocardial infarction at age 55.
In general, the patient is a pleasant female lying on stretcher, appears stated age, in no apparent distress.
Gross auditory sensation intact.
No oropharyngeal lesions.
Cardiovascular is regular rate, II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border without radiation, no jugular venous distention, no rubs, clicks or gallops, nondisplaced point of maximal impulse, no carotid bruits.
No crackles, no wheezes.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
No abdominal bruits.
Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis and radial pulses bilaterally.
Chest x-ray from the outside hospital showed no cardiopulmonary processes, no cardiomegaly, no infiltrates.
The patient remained asymptomatic and her oxygen saturation was at 99% in room air.
On the day of discharge, the patient's electrocardiographic changes had for the most part resolved with some persistent T wave inversions in leads V2 and V3.
She was being discharged home with instructions to go to the nearest Emergency Department with any chest discomfort, shortness of breath or palpitations.
She also was advised to have an exercise stress test as well as echocardiogram within the month.
Take one every five minutes for chest pain up to a total of three pills.
