HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year old Hispanic male with a history of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 31%, status post CVA with residual left sided weakness, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital6 8866**] on [**12-12**] following a month long admission for head and neck bilateral dissection of laryngeal cancer and total laryngectomy and trach placement.
He presents with progressive cough and fatigue per family.
His [**Hospital6 8866**] course was also notable for being discharged on Flagyl, levofloxacin and Keflex for a two week course and complicated by pharyngocutaneous fistula as well as Mobitz type I arrhythmia.
He was sent to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and one day prior to admission he was noted to be in respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 30 to 32 and minimally responsive to albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post CVA with left sided weakness.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 31%.
Head and neck cancer status post total neck dissection and total laryngectomy with subsequent trach placement.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes shortness of breath.
Anicteric sclerae.
Well healed surgical scars with no fluctuance of discharge.
Lungs clear to auscultation on left anterior laterally, decreased breath sounds with occasional crackles on right.
Abdominal exam soft, distended, percussive, decreased bowel sounds, no suprapubic tenderness.
Extremities warm, no ulcers, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Urinalysis was positive for nitrites, 500 glucose, 0 to 2 white blood cells, occasional bacteria, no yeast.
Chest x-ray revealed diffuse right infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia, also possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
EKG #1 revealed tachycardia at 122, no P waves seen, new right bundle branch block with T wave inversions in V1 through V5, Q waves in V2 through V5.
EKG #2 revealed sinus tachycardia at 106, normal axis, old ST depressions in V5 through V6, T wave inversion in V4, old Qs in V3 and V4 with resolved right bundle branch block.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted directly to the medical intensive care unit for control of his respiratory distress and hypotension.
Patient was initially started on vancomycin, ceftazidine and clindamycin for broad coverage.
It was felt that this was due to his pneumonia coupled with demand ischemia.
Telemetry again demonstrated Mobitz type I block with occasional PVCs.
Glucose control.
The patient was noted to have fluctuating hyper and hypoglycemia which eventually stabilized on a regimen of NPH 20 units q.a.m.
He is to have a barium upper GI series which will be performed at [**Hospital6 8866**] for further evaluation of his swallowing.
Acute respiratory distress secondary to mucus plugging.
Laryngeal cancer status post laryngectomy.
