HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year-old man with a history of depression and anxiety who was in his usual health until about 6:00 p.m. on [**2193-12-16**].
There was no witnessed fall according to his son.
He was taken to the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital Emergency Room where a CT of the spine was concerning for a C2 fracture and he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for stabilization.
He was given Solu-Medrol at 30 mg per kilogram intravenous a 10:30 p.m.  At the [**Hospital1 346**] he was admitted to the Trauma Service for presumed fall, however, with complete history of the event there was no head trauma and no loss of consciousness.
Further examination showed no evidence of C2 fracture.
While awaiting further evaluation Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] had a rapid heart rate with a supraventricular rhythm and cardiology was consulted.
Prostate cancer some six years ago treated with hormones.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General, well developed, well nourished man in no acute distress.
Head and neck C collar in place, clear dentures.
No murmurs or JVD.
There is no gag.
Sensory grimaces and withdraws to pain in all extremities.
STUDIES:  CT of the head with C spine revealing no fracture and the parenchyma is grossly intact.
MR imaging reveals a few small and bilateral diffusion slowing in the frontal, parietal and occipital areas consistent with infarction.
However, subsequent evaluation of the electrocardiogram reveals that he had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia, which converted to normal sinus rhythm with the addition of Amiodarone.
Evaluation for his strokes revealed multiple infarctions as noted above consistent with a water shed distribution infarction perhaps in the setting of a rapid ventricular rate.
Evaluation of his carotid arteries with ultrasound revealed no evidence of significant disease in the cervical potions of the bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries.
MR of the cervical spine shows no soft tissue disease and no evidence of fracture.
He was noted initially to have a right hemiparesis and a right facial droop.
Subsequently he followed simple commands and his aphagia steadily improved.
His right hemiparesis improved markedly and now he has only moderate weakness of the right upper extremity with mild weakness in his right legs.
He tolerated this procedure well without complications.
We anticipate as Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] continues to improve clinically from a neurologic perspective he will be able to swallow and therefore it would not be unreasonable to reevaluate his swallowing in one to two months time and consider the removal of the PEG tube.
We note that while in house Mr. [**Known lastname 46901**] had some evidence of pneumonia and therefore he was started on a fourteen day course of Levofloxacin.
He also had cellulitis on his right arm and therefore was started on the first generation of cephalosporin initially in the intravenous form and then changed to po.
Keflex 500 mg po q 6 hours for cellulitis for eight more days.
A hemoglobin A1C revealed that he had a level of 13 suggesting underlying diabetes mellitus.
