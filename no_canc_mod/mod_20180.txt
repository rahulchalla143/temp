Admission Date:  [**2137-3-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-4-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-7-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: All allergies / adverse drug reactions previously recorded have been deleted  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 54898**] is a 64F with a history of chronic lung disease of unclear etiology who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 956**] [**2137**] with dyspnea and hypoxia and was also admitted with respiratory arrest in [**2136-8-5**] requiring intubation.
bronciectasis) at [**University/College **] Presbyterian where she was seen in [**2128**] and treated as an outpatient with antibiotics (two episodes of heavy mucous production).
She was then relatively symptom-free for several years and does not feel that she has had baseline respiratory problems.
Since [**Name2 (NI) 216**] when she was admitted with acute respiratory distress (?
allergic reaction), she has had problems with her breathing that have not gone all the way away.
She states that she notices SOB with climbing stairs and activity as well as with sleeping.
She was admitted in [**Month (only) 956**] with hypoxia and cough, and since discharge has felt her breathing has been poor.
Her cough is occasionally productive of thick yellow or brown mucous, though for the past two days it has been more dry than usual and she has also noticed flecks of blood (no grossly bloody sputum).
She has chest pain worse with coughing or deep inspiration.
She was also evaluated by the ENT team for question of vocal cord dysfunction, though no abnormalities were noted.
In [**2136-8-5**], she had a separate admission for respiratory arrest attributed to allergic reaction/anaphylaxis, though it was questionable whether she actually took the medication (never identified, possibly [**Year (4 digits) 54897**]) that the reaction was attributed to.
She was treated for a likely anaphylactic reaction with epipen, h2 blocker, and benadryl.
Has chronic sinusitis with rhinorrhea.
Has orthopnea (breathes poorly at night laying flat) but no PND.

FINDINGS: No consolidation or edema is noted.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
IMPRESSION: Stable chest x-ray examination with no acute pulmonary process.
Multiple patchy ground-glass opacities of various sizes, nonspecific.
Minimal atelectasis or small focal consolidation in the the right upper lobe.
Recommend short-term three-month followup to ensure resolution and assess stability.
Small sub-7 mm solid nodules, unchanged since [**2133-3-9**].
Interval decrease of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Small hiatal hernia with lower esophageal wall thickening, could represent reflux esophagitis.
If no prior workup has been performed, recommend followup with non-emergent endoscopic exam.
Mild esophageal dysmotility.
No evidence of reflux.
[**2137-4-3**], ECHO, Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Residual barium is seen in the colon.
**IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: 64 F with unclear underlying lung disease presenting with acute worsening of chronic respiratory distress and cough; noted to be hyopxic on arrival to ED.
Initially admitted to the MICU where she received antibiotics and steroids and hypoxia improved to requirement of 3L by NC; she was called out to the general medical floor [**2137-3-31**].
Pneumonia considered, but patient was afebrile on admission and CXR without focal consolidation.
Reflux esophagitis and aspiration investigated with video swallow and barium swallow.
CT chest concerning for ground-glass opacities.
Eosinophilic pneumonitis was considered, especially in the context of elevated eosinophils on differential and elevated IgE (>[**2126**]).
Her lung exam was notable for poor air movement throughout admission, but air movement continued to improve with incentive spirometer, cough suppression, and steroids.
# Cough: Patient with dry/chronic cough, but cough was her biggest complaint, and also contributed substantially to her shortness of breath.
# Chest pain: Likely secondary to chronic cough.
Chest pain was controlled with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, and Oxycodone.
# Loss to follow up: Patient has been set up with multiple follow up appointments in the past that she never attended.

You returned to the hospital because of increased difficulty breathing, and cough with chest pain.
You were initially admitted to the ICU, but your breathing was better after starting antibiotics and steroids, so you were transferred to the floor.
On the floor, your cough was better controlled with anti-cough medications, and your oxygen requirement decreased over a few days.
At the time of discharge, your cough was much improved, you had good levels of oxygen in your blood, and your chest pain was slightly better.
You have MULTIPLE changes to your medications.
**Changes to your cough/breathing medications: -STOP Robitussin -START Guaifenesin with codein every 4-6 hours as needed, but DO NOT DRIVE OR OPERATE MACHINERY AFTER TAKING THIS MEDICATION (it can make you drowsy) -START Benzonatate three times a day to help suppress your cough -START Guaifenesin tablets twice a day to help suppress your cough -START Prednisone 50mg daily until you see the pulmonologist -START Montelukast daily until you see your pulmonologist -START Bactrim daily to help prevent a specific type of pneumonia from developing; this medication only needs to be continued while you are on steroids (prednisone)  **Changes to you pain medications -START Tylenol every 4-6 hours as needed for pain -START Ibuprofen as needed for pain -START oxycodone as needed for pain  **Changes to other medications -START docusate for constipation; a side effect of opioid medications is constipation, and this medication can help treat this side effect -START senna for constipation -START omeprazole for prevention of acid reflux  We spoke with multiple physicians, and we think that right now, you don't need additional Levaquin.
