T12 transpedicular decompression of burst fracture and     spinal cord compression.
Posterolateral arthrodesis T10-L2.
History of Present Illness: 78 y/o Chinese male with ESRD, HTN, Afib, recently in a nursing home after found to have T12 compression fracture, presents from his nursing home with lethargy and weakness with fever on [**2112-12-3**].
Pt presented to ED with fever and hypotension, and was found to have bandemia of 17% with no clear source of infection.
He was initially empirically treated broadly with Ceftazadime and vancomycin which was transitioned to unasyn and vancomycin on admission to the ICU with the addition of steroids given septic clinical picture.
Blood cx on [**12-3**] grew pansensative E. coli with no clear source as UA was clear, CXR revealed no infiltrate and line site looked clean.
Antibiotics were weaned to Unasyn alone given only e. coli grew in the blood cultures and follow-up cultures have been negative with bandemia and fever resolved.
Pt had a mildly elevated Alk phos and GGT on admission so RUQ US was obtained to look for a source of the GNR bactermia but there were no signs of biliary obstruction or cholecystitis.
CT abd/pelvis to r/o abdominal process as source of GNR bacteremia was obtained which revealed ?
Repeat imaging then demonstrated ?transverse and left sided colitis could not be excluded, thus colitis may represent his source of blood seeding.
During his course on the floor, he was found to have a right common femoral DVT.
He was transiently on heparin gtt, but developed guaiac + stools and hematocrit drop requiring transfusions with prbc x2.
Records from [**Hospital1 336**] reveal that he has a h/o GI bleed from likely AVM source in past.
78 year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation recently in a nursing home because of a T12 compression fracture, presenting from his nursing home with lethargy and weakness, decreased appetite for several days with temperature to 101. .
Head CT which showed a "hyperdense convexity along the right frontal lobe measuring 3 mm thick which most likely represents a small acute subdural hemorrhage."
Felt to be no neurosurgical issue, transferred to MICU for further medical care.
2/2 blood culture bottles from admission grew gram-negative rods.
The source of the bacteremia was unclear.
Chest X-ray was negative for infection.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the patient had elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT and showed no acute abdnormalities.
End-stage renal disease on dialysis (MoWeFr) via left-sided AV fistula 2.
Hypertension 3.
Atrial fibrillation 4.
Hypothyroidism 5.
Anemia 6.
Recent T12 compression fracture  Social History: The patient is living at [**Hospital **] Health Center nursing home after recent T12 fracture.
HEENT:  anicteric, mucous membranes dry CHEST:  CTA b/l HEART:  RRR nl s1, s2, II/VI SEM at LUSB ABD:  +BS, soft, NT, ND, no guarding or rebound EXT:  no edema, L arm AV fistula NEURO:  CN II-XII intact, moves all extremities with 5/5 strength.
Pertinent Results: LABS: Lactate 2.7 to 1.1 PT: 15.4 PTT: 40.4 INR: 1.4 WBC 6.7 N:68 Band:17 L:11 M:4 E:0 Bas:0 HCT 29 PLT 163 CRP: 112.7 ALT: 51 AST: 91 AP: 229 Tbili: 2.0 Alb: 2.4 [**Doctor First Name **]: 18 Lip: 9 Anion Gap: 12 BUN 14 Cr 4.5  ECG: NSR at 63 with PR prolongation, nl axis, no Q waves, no LVH, no ST changes.
RUQ U/S: (wet read) Mild CBD dilatation to 7 mm (4mm is normal).
No u/s evidence of cholecystitis.
No ascites in RUQ.
Hyperdense convexity along the right frontal lobe measuring 3 mm thick which most likely represents a small acute subdural hemorrhage.
No evidence for mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Follow up head CT is recommended to document interval change in [**6-9**] hours, or sooner if the patient's mental status changes.
Heavy atherosclerotic calcifications in the intracranial vasculature as described above.
FINDINGS:  The evaluation of abdominal organs and major vessels are limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
There is large amount of free air throughout the upper abdomen and pelvis, measuring approximately [**3-21**] [**Doctor Last Name **], new since prior study.
There is no area with concentrated high-density oral fluid-fluid level.
Again note is made of multiple hypodense lesions in bilateral lobes of the liver, measuring up to 1.6 cm in the right lobe, some of them abutting the liver surface.
Evaluation of these lesions is limited.
There is no definite intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
Gallbladder is unremarkable without evidence of calcification.
The evaluation of small and large bowel is limited without oral contrast.
There is no significant dilatation or obstruction.
The assessment of the wall thickening is difficult due to surrounding ascites.
There is no bowel dilatation.
There is no significant lymphadenopathy.
In the visualized portion of the lung bases, note is made of bilateral pleural effusion with collapse of the parenchyma, somewhat increased since prior study.
There is no suspicious mass or nodule in the visualized portion of the lung.
New large amount of ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis, measuring up to 20 [**Doctor Last Name **], without evidence of concentration of high-density oral fluid-fluid levels.
Given the Hounsfield unit, this is probably a simple fluid, however, in the setting of anemia, hemorrhage component or abdominal bleed cannot be totally excluded especially given that ascites is new.
Limited study without intravenous contrast or oral contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Multiple low-dense lesions in bilateral lobes of the liver, overall unchanged since prior study, some of which are abutting the peripheral portion of the liver.
Interval posterior thoracolumbar fixation from T10-L2 with compression fracture of T12 with subcutaneous small fluid.
Increased bilateral pleural effusion with collapsed lung in the visualized portion of lung bases.
[**2112-12-30**] Colonoscopy: Mucosa: Diffuse abnormal vascularity with no bleeding was noted in the cecum and proximal ascending colon.
These findings are compatible with angioectasias and the diffuse angioectasias extending from the cecum into the first [**2-4**] folds of proximal ascending colon.
There was no active bleeding, but the process was too diffuse to be treated endoscopically.
Localized scarring, mild ulceration, friability and mild erythema with no bleeding were noted in the distal rectum.
Impression: Abnormal vascularity in the cecum and proximal ascending colon compatible with angioectasias Scarring, mild ulceration, friability and mild erythema in the distal rectum compatible with previous proctitis (biopsy) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum .
He may have some rectal bleeding after the biopsies.
Definitive therapy would be a right hemi-colectomy   Brief Hospital Course: 78 year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presented with fever and gram-negative rod bacteremia.
# Early Sepsis.
2/2 blood culture bottles from admission grew gram-negative rods.
The source of the bacteremia was unclear.
Chest X-ray was negative for infection.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the patient had elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT and showed no acute abdnormalities.
# DVT: Right common femoral DVT was visualized [**12-8**] on imaging.
IVC filter was placed [**12-10**] as patient could not tolerate heparin secondary to GI bleeding.
In the future, heparin, coumadin, and other anticoagulants should be avoided if possible to avoid GI bleeding.
# Recent T12 Fracture.
Neurosurgery was consulted on this admission - MRI T10-S2 showed spinal cord narrowing, edema.
Neurosurgery continued to followup patient and the followup L-spine film showed post-operative changes.
# GI bleed: The patient had GI bleeding [**12-9**] which was felt likely secondary to cecal AVM seen on [**Hospital1 336**] colonoscopy [**11-7**].
At this time his anticoagulaion for DVT (heparin) was stopped, an IVC filter was placed, and he was transfused 2 u PRBCs.
He was stable without bleeding until [**12-29**], when he again passed bright red blood and clots.
He was prepped and scoped at this time with the finding of diffuse AVM at cecum and proximal colon (see note).
No active bleeding was seen.
# End-stage renal disease.
# Liver cysts/ascites: HIs abdominal CT during his stay showed persistent and stable liver hypodensities consistent w/ liver cysts or hamartoma.
Not likely to be hepatocellular cancer as his AFP was negative.
He denies prior known history of hepatitis or alcohol history.
In addition, a CT scan on [**12-26**] demonstrated new accumulation of ascites, which similarly should be evaluated by liver specialist.
# Hypothyroidism.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient had unexplained thrombocytopenia that developed during his hospital stay.
He had negative antibody screen for heparin induced thrombocytopenia and no clear medication precipitants.
Patient is not on anticoagulation given history of GI bleed.
# Head CT. Pt had head CT which showed a "hyperdense convexity along the right frontal lobe measuring 3 mm thick which most likely represents a small acute subdural hemorrhage."
No subdural hematoma."
# FEN: Cardiac heart healthy pureed diet.
Given left arm fistula, patient has blood pressure measurements on leg.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
