Active Issues This Admission:  # Right ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy on [**2198-7-24**]: Pt originally admitted for elective urologic laser lithotripsy and stent due to recurrent renal stones.
The procedure had no complications and stones were removed.
Pt had a postive UA but culture with NGTD.
Uncertain if fever [**2-1**] to instrumentation.
She remained afebrile throughout remaineder of adission.
# Pulmomary Emboli.
On POD #3, overnight the patient felt like her heart was "racing", but was without pain or SOB, with increased systolic blood pressures to 150s and tachycardia to 110s.
A stat EKG was obtained which revealed sinus tachycardia.
A repeat CXR again revealed no pneumonia.
Patient became progressively hypoxic and CTA showed PE.
Hypoxia subsequently improved.
Transfer to Medcine: It was determined that the patient has multiple comorbidities in the setting of acute hypoxia and will be transfered to the medicine service on [**2198-7-26**].
Patient found to have ST changes in the inferior and lateral leads taken to the cath lab found to have 90% occlusion in OM1 with angioplasty and DES successfully implanted.
Also found a proximal LAD occlusion of 70% with no intervention as not thought to be the culprit.
On the floor she had episodes of throat "burning" she had repeat EKGs which showed T wave inversions in inferior and lateral leads c/w area reperfused with DES (OM).
A repeat catheterization did not show any new blockages and good flow through remaining arteries, no intervention.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Pt developed shortness of breath while on cardiology service which improved with diuresis.
Echocardiogram showed evidence of anterolateral-inferolateral wall motion abnormalities with LVEF of 40-50%.
No previous echo available for comparison and no previous history of heart failure or ACS.
She continued to appear volume overloaded on exam and put on standing lasix.
It is also likely that her subsegmental PE also contributed to her shortness of breath.
[**Last Name (un) **] most likely  pre-renal secondary to CHF and decreased CO.
# Hyperlipidemia Continued Atorvastatin 80 mg daily .
Pt will be a poor candidate for insulin because of her dementia and will need to be stable on an oral regimen that will likely require [**2-2**] medicines.
Nitroglycerin SL 0.3 mg SL PRN chest pain may repeat up to 2 times at 10 minute intervals, call 911 if chest pain does not resolve after 2 tabs 18.
GlipiZIDE 5 mg PO BID Please uptitrate if blood sugars cont to be high 21. guanFACINE *NF* 2 mg Oral hs 22. solifenacin *NF* 10 mg Oral daily   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 1687**] - [**Location (un) 745**]  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation myocardial infarction Hypertension Diabetes mellitus type 2, poorly controlled S/P right uteroscopy with laser lithotripsy Pulmonary embolus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a urological procedure which was complicated by kidney failure that has resolved, a small pulmonary embolus and a heart attack.
A cardiac catheterization showed blockages in your heart arteries and a drug eluting stent was placed in one of them.
You had some chest pain after the heart attack and another cardiac catheterization was performed that did not show any new blockages and there was no further intervention.
Your heart is weaker after the heart attack and you will need to take some new medicines to make your heart stronger.
