There is also a small amount of temporal and parietal apparent intraparenchymal hyperdensity consistent with parenchymal hemorrhage or SAH in deep sulci and fissures.
There is a new hypodense subdural collection over the left frontotemporal lobes with a maximal thickness of approximately 7 mm consistent with subdural hematoma or hygroma.
There is a marked amount of soft tissue swelling overlying the left upper orbit, without evidence of intraorbital abnormality or orbital deformity.
There is no evidence of fracture.
The paranasal sinuses demonstrate mild ethmoid thickening.
Scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left temporal and parietal lobes, with possible intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of fracture.
New left hypodense subdural hematoma versus hygroma measuring 7 mm in thickness.
Resolution of right subdural collection.
Moderate amount of soft tissue swelling overlying the subcutaneous soft tissues of the left orbit.

CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: THe lungs demonstrate scattered atelectesis and are otherwise clear.
There is no central or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Scattered mediastinal nodes do not meet CT size criteria for enlargement.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
There is a well- circumscribed, heterogeneous 2.7 x 2.3 cm mass in the upper pole of the left kidney measuring between 30 and 80 Hounsfield units, concerning for neoplastic process.
There is no free fluid or free air.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Bone windows demonstrate no fracture or malalignment.
No CT evidence of acute trauma.
Heterogeneous mass in the left kidney is concerning for neoplastic process, although the differential diagnosis includes hemorrhage.
Fatty changes in the liver.
Mediastinal caliber is unchanged since [**5-6**] when a chest CT showed no significant abnormality.
