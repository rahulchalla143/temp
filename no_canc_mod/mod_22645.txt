History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 61512**] is a 82 year old gentleman with symptomatic coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.
In [**2198-7-3**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] deemed him to be too high risk for surgery due to extensive aortic calcification.
Due to recurrent symptoms, he underwent repeat cardiac cathterization in [**2199-1-2**] which revealed left main disease with an instent restenosis of ramus.
Given his severe aortic stenosis and left main lesion, he was deemed too high risk for percutaneous intervention.
After extensive discussion with the patient and his family, he agreed to proceed with high risk surgery.

[**2199-2-8**] Intraop TEE: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic root and ascending aorta have focal calcifications.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is significant mitral annular calcification.
There is prolapse of the anterior mitral leaflet with a posteriorly directly MR jet with coanda effect.
At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small paravalvular leak which improved with protamine administration.
LV systolic function appeared severely depressed immediately after separation from bypass and slowly improved with administration of inotropes.
There is moderate to severe MR.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
[**2199-2-15**] Postop Portable TTE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation was treated with Amiodarone and beta-blocker.
Prolonged conversion pauses and tachy-brady syndrome became apparant.
Anticoagulation was initiated with Coumadin secondary to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
Coumadin 1 mg Tablet Sig: Dose for goal INR of 2.0-2.5 Tablets PO once a day: dose today 1 mg only;all further dosing per rehab provider;Goal INR is 2.0-2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
