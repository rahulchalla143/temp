Stay was complicated by fever and hypotension and change in mental status which required MICU stay requring pressors and was covered with Zosyn and Vanco although no source ever found, and thought to be due to neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for rehab on [**9-8**] and was doing well until [**9-22**] when he was noticed to have left eye ptosis and altered mental status.
CT head was negative and LP showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and he was admitted to Neuro and treted with acyclovir and ceftriaxone.
Pt admitted to MICU on [**9-24**] for becoming unresponsive thought to be multifactorial including hypoglycemia, meds, meningitis.
Pt also developed LLL infiltrate and was treated with clindamycin.
Pt was intubated due to inability to protect airway.
MRI negative and EEG suggestive of encephalopathy but pt remained unresponsive off sedation but awoke on [**10-4**] and extubated on [**10-8**].
Follow up MRI and CT negative, and change in mental status thought due to microvascular brain stem infarction.

AMS/Coma: Upon admission, the patient had altered mental status with a left CNIII palsy and a right CNVI palsy.
A septic meningitis was discovered, but the etiology was not discovered (a broad diagnosis for this was considered, including vasculitis, Sarcoidosis, metastatic cancer and various infectious etiologies; CSF for various infections along with cytologies were lost in transit to lab - however, stroke was thought to better explain his symptom complex per Neurology and thus a repeat lumbar puncture was not pursued).
Thus, he was diagnosed with an idiopathic meningoencephalitis.
However, microinfarctions of his brainstem were believed to be large contributing factor despite a normal MRI.
Of note, there was an intial concern for epileptic activity, but this was dismissed by Neurology and the Dilantin commenced on admission was not continued.
Although he tolerated pressure support ventilation after he regained function after coma, he had intermittent apnea episodes.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] was considered (but his respiratory tracings were not consistent with this) as well as more ominous pattern of brainstem dysfunctioning.
An ECG did not show a prolonged QT interval.
The etiology was likely secondary to EPO deficiency.
ESRD: He was followed by the Renal team and had hemodialysis three times per week.
R ORIF: The patient had a [**12-25**] year old external fixation device on his right tibia for an old tibal fracture.
Given his recent antibiotics, and high-risk state, he was treated empirically with Flagyl for a seven day course.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 63715**] has been on coumadin 5 mg QHS for history of RIJ clot, DVT, PE, with a very labile response.
It has been low in the past, but recently has normalized to 100-200.
It is very important that he follow up with his PCP on [**Name Initial (PRE) **] regular basis to monitor his chronic medical conditions.
