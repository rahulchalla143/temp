Urine Legionella Negative [**2115-6-25**] Urine Culture negative [**2115-6-25**] Blood cultures [**2115-7-6**] Pending   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2115-7-5**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Native beats appear to have a wide QRS complex with secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Morphology of the paced QRS complex is different in leads V1-V2, with now upright R waves rather than RS complex - question markedly different electrode placement versus interval change in location of the ventricular pacing lead.
CXR [**2115-6-20**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No acute rib fracture.
No acute fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative disease with disc bulge at C5-C6 resulting in moderate canal narrowing.
In the setting of canal narrowing, correlation with clinical symptoms is recommended and cervical spine MR can be obtained if cord injury is suspected  CT Head [**2115-6-20**] Preliminary Report !!
No acute intracranial process.
Right periorbital hematoma with intact globe and no postseptal extension.
X-Ray Pelvis [**2115-6-20**] No fracture or malalignment.
CT Angiography [**2115-6-21**]: No pulmonary embolism  Nodular consolidation in the middle lobe.
Large right and minimal left pleural effusion.
Persistent left SVC with abandoned left chest leads coursing through it and terminating into the right ventricle.
Multi-lead right chest wall device with each lead coursing through the right SVC and terminating one into the right atrium, right ventricle, and epicardial lead to the left ventricle.
Wedge compression fracture involving more than 50% of the height of D8 vertebra causing kyphotic deformity.
No gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
Right pleural effusion.
Right lower pole kidney simple cyst, slightly increased in size.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) with akinesis of the mid to apical septum, lateral hypokinesis/akinesis, apical akinesis, and anterior hypokinesis/akinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mildly depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2115-7-1**]: Video Swallow Study FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There was gross aspiration with nectar liquids.
Moderate residue was seen at the valleculae with honey-thick and pureed consistencies without gross aspiration or penetration.
IMPRESSION: Gross aspiration of nectar-thick liquids.
CT SCAN Abdomen and Pelvis with Contrast [**2115-7-9**]: The lung bases are notable for a large right and moderate left pleural effusion, with expected overlying atelectasis.
Cardiac pacing wires are visualized as is coronary arterial calcification.
The stomach, duodenum are unremarkable, specifically with no evidence of enteric tube.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast in a symmetric fashion and note is made of a large right renal cyst.
The gallbladder is moderately distended with mild mural thickening.
There is a small volume of ascites in the upper abdomen and no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
Vascular structures reveal atherosclerotic calcification.
There is moderate diffuse anasarca.
A trace amount of free fluid is present in the pelvis.
There is no free gas in the pelvis.
There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS FINDINGS: There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic osseous lesion.
Degenerative changes are present in the lower lumbar spine.
Large right and moderate left pleural effusions, anasarca, and small amount of ascites.
In this context, and without free gas, the ascites is most likely related to the generalized volume status of the patient as opposed to leaking enteric contents although the latter is difficult to entirely exclude.
Atherosclerotic disease.
Slight wall thickening could be explained by fluid overload (also suggesting by other findings) but if there are any acute symptoms which may related to gallbladder pathology, ultrasound could be given consideration.
Brief Hospital Course: 72M with a history of VF arrest s/p AICD placement in [**2102**], Afib, DM, COPD, CHF, and HTN found down in his bedroom today after unknown down time, last seen 24 hours prior.
Upon arriving to the floor, patient had positive orthostatics, and was extremely weak.
The electrophysiology team was consulted to interrogate the pacemaker and did not find any episodes of AICD firing or V-tach.
CT angio [**2115-6-21**] ruled out Pulmonary embolism.
On the early morning of the [**6-23**], 3rd hospital day, the patient was found to have hemodynamicaly unstable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with SBP in the 80s and HR in the 140s.
On tele, patient had many episodes of "pacer not capturing" but with pacing spikes, likely secondary to PVCs.
Stat echo did not show pericardial effusion, but did demonstrate increased TR, MR, Pulmonary arterial HTN and Low EF (was 15% on [**4-27**]).
Patient also had a witnessed aspiration event and had a new finding of expiratory stridor.
Stat CXR showed increasing right plural effusion/ pulmonary edema.
On the morning of [**2115-6-25**], the paient aspirated, and developed respiratory distress.
#DYSPHAGIA/ASPIRATION PNA: Following the aspiration event and self extubation, the patient was evaluated by speech and swallow, and failed the evaluation.
Attempts were made to keep the tract open, including placing a sterile foley, however these were to no avail.
Patient tolerated the insult remarkably well, with only one episode of temperature to 100.2, but with an otherwise benign abdominal exam.
#ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Pt with metabolic encephalopathy on admission.
#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH INR OF 1.5 EVOLVING INTO AFIB WITH RVR DURING HOSPITALIZATION:  Patient was admitted in atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
Morning of [**2115-6-22**] underlying atrial fibrillation developed a rapid ventricular response with HR peaks in the 140s and resultant SBP in the 80s.
On tele, as amiodarone was held for NPO status, patient had continued episodes of non-sustained Vtach, but these were stable.
#TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Nodular consolidation in the middle lobe.
He will likely benefit from intensive swallowing therapy.
2. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
4. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
PICC Care Please care for PICC per instutional protocol   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary:  Atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, aspiration pneumonia, altered mental status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malnutrition, self discontinuation of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, Stage 2 Decubitus ulcer Secondary: Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
The likely cause of your fall was a rapid heart rate from your atrial fibrillation.
You were stabilized on the medicine floor, were transported to the CCU (a higher level of care) following an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and brought back to the medicine floor for further stabilization.
We looked for concerning causes of loss of consciousness including a pulmonary embolism, as well as interrogating your pacemaker for an episode of unstable heart rates, but the studies were negative.
START Furosemide START insulin per sliding scale START Ipratropium nebs START Metoprolol Tartrate START Aspirin START Digoxin START Albuterol START Enoxaparin  Given your swallowing dysfunction and the restrictions with your oral intake, all of your oral medications are currently being held.
