Left lower lobe opacities which may represent atelectasis, but the possibility of infection is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
Mild congestive heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: # Altered Mental Status: This patient was felt to have altered mental status on the day of admission by his VNA.
The patient had no signs of infection and his head CT was negative for mass or bleed.
There was a question of an opacity on portable chest x-ray, but f/u PA and lateral films were more suggestive of atelectasis than infection and the patient had no clinical evidence of infection.
MI was considered a possible explanation as well, but the patient ruled out during his ED course with negative cardiac enzymes.
In addition, the patient's hypotension with SBP ~70 was considered another likely contributor to his altered mental status.
# Hypotension: This patient presented with hypotension (SBP ~70).
Furthermore, the patient was taking in poor PO intake and was likely dehydrated; this was supported by the fact that his BP rose nicely with IVF.
MI and tamponade were considered, but the patient ruled out in the ED and had a bedside u/s negative for tamponade in the ED.
He was followed on telemetry and did not show evidence of a new arrythmia.
# Tachycardia: The patient had difficulty with tachycardia during this admission and had heart rates in the 110's and 120's at times.
These were held for low blood pressure < 100 or heart rate < 50. .
# Trigeminal Neuralgia: The patient was admitted with severe right facial pain from his trigeminal neuralgia.
The patient was continued on his 800 mg/day of tegretol without neurontin and percocet and his pain improved dramatically on the first day.
The neurontin and percocet were discontinued due to mental status changes on admission.
