The mother's medical history is notable for hypothyroidism and she was treated with Levothyroxine during her pregnancy.
The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the day prior to delivery when the mother experienced premature rupture of membranes.
The premature rupture of membranes occurred 27 hours prior to delivery.
There was no intrapartum fever or concern for chorioamnionitis.
She was vigorous and required only bulb suctioning and routine care.
Skin: Warm and dry, mild jaundice.
No rashes or lesions.
Eyes with red reflexes bilaterally.
No distention.
She had rare episodes of apnea and bradycardia but none for the 5 days prior to discharge.
No murmurs have been noted.
She has fed preemie Enfamil formula or breast milk.
Infectious disease:  Due to her prematurity and the unknown group beta strep status of her mother, this infant was evaluated for sepsis.
Gastrointestinal: This infant required treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
The mildly elevated bilirubin level is consistent with breast milk jaundice.
Neurologic: This infant has maintained a normal neurologic examination during admission and there were no neurologic concerns at the time of discharge.
No medications.
This infant     was observed in her car seat for 90 minutes without any     episodes of bradycardia or oxygen desaturations.
State newborn screens were sent on [**1-22**] and [**2152-2-2**]     with no notification of abnormal results to date.
Immunizations recommended:      Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from      [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the      following four criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32      weeks; (2) Born between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with two      of the following:  Day care during RSV season, a smoker      in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway      abnormalities or school age siblings; (3) chronic lung      disease or (4) hemodynamically significant congenital      heart disease.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the      child's life, immunization against influenza is      recommended for household contacts and out-of-home      caregivers.
The      American Academy of Pediatrics recommends initial      vaccination of preterm infants at or following discharge      from the hospital if they are clinically stable or at      least 6 weeks but fewer than 12 weeks of age.
Suspicion for sepsis ruled out.
