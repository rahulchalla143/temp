Admission Date:  [**2178-9-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-9-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status, abdominal pain.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right IJ line placement and removal PICC line placement and removal Intubation with mechanical ventilation Blood and platelet transfusion   History of Present Illness: This patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman, Chinese-speaking only (specific dialect of a small region), also with baseline dementia, who presents via EMS with chief complaint of several days abdominal pain and worsening mental status at home.
Eventually could no longer get out of bed, then stopped eating and became fore unresponsive.
EMS found the patient to be hypotensive and started her on dopamine en route to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Labs otherwise notable for hypernatremia to 163 with creatinine of 1.4 from baseline 0.7 to 0.8.
Trauma surgery was consulted in ED given concern of ischemic bowel.
Patient then underwent CTAP that showed RLL pna versus aspiration with bilateral effusion.
Although there was severe celiac, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] stenosis there was no complete occlusion and no evidence of bowel ischemia.
There was nonspecific anal and rectal wall thickening.
She was given 10 mg vitamin K for the elevated INR.
She was started on norepinephrine and intubated for airway protection given concern of altered mental status and aspiration on CT scan.
In the intensive care unit, exam notable for cold distal extremities.

Precordial T wave inversions in leads V1-V3 are suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
Electrocardiogram ([**2178-9-14**]): Atrial fibrillation.
Compared to the previous tracing T wave changes in the precordial leads are similar.
Isodense left frontal subdural collection measuring up to 8 mm is again compatible with subacute to chronic subdural hematoma.
No hyperdense component to suggest superimposed acute hemorrhage.
Also again noted are left posterior temporal/parietal encephalomalacia reflecting chronic infarct, changes secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic disease, mild atrophy and ethmoid mucosal sinus disease.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2178-9-14**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure(PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+]tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.).
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-10-1**], biventricular hypokinesis is now present and the severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation have increased.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right.
Left lower lobe atelectasis.
Right lower lobe pneumonia or aspiration.
1.3cm focal ground-glass opacity in the periphery of the right upper lobe is nonspecific and may be related to the right lower lobe process.
Cardiomegaly, severely atherosclerotic aorta and iliac vessels with intramural thrombus.
Apparent linear densities in the thoracic aorta likely represent contrast mixing with unopacified blood.
There is no definite evidence of aortic dissection.
No evidence of bowel obstruction or bowel wall thickening to suggest bowel ischemia.
The celiac axis, SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] appear patent, however, stenosis at the proximal portion of these vessels may be severe (please note that this study is not dedicated for evaluation of intra-abdominal arteries).
Mild thickening of the anal and rectal wall with mild presacral edema is nonspecific.
7-mm hypodense lesion in the neck of the pancreas.
Followup MRI can be obtained for further evaluation if clinically warranted.
New T7 vertebral body compression fracture and progression of L2 vertebral body fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain, worsening mental status, found to be hypothermic and hypotensive in ED, initially intubated on pressors and treated empirically for urosepsis/aspiration pneumonia.
# Hypotension/PNA/UTI: consider in differential diagnosis sepsis (urinary source, pneumonia, GI source), hypovolemia, bleeding (GI source given guaiac positive stool), cardiogenic (given elevated biomarkers and EKG changes).
Patient with positive UA and abdominal pain with evidence of possible aspiration pneumonia on CTAP; thus infection seemed most likely to be the cause for her hypotension.
# Hypothermia: likely from underlying infection.
Other considerations include environmental exposure, hypothyroid (myxedema) or adrenal insufficiency.
Her hypothermia improved with treatment of the urinary tract infection.
Patient underwent CTAP in ED that showed severe atherosclerotic disease in the celiac, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] although no definite complete occlusion.
There was mild rectal and anal wall thickening that was nonspecific, without evidence of bowel ischemia.
# Respiratory status: she was intubated in the emergency room for airway protection in the setting of altered mental status and evidence of aspiration on CT.
There was also concern of pulmonary edema because of all the blood products that she had received.
When she improved hemodynamically and her infection was treated, she was extubated without complication on the first hospital day.
# EKG changes, positive tropinin: likely demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis and profound anemia.
The EKGs were reviewed by the cardiology fellow, who recommended trending the troponin and no intervention.
# Altered mental status: this was thought to be multifactorial.
Pt had a subacute subdural hematoma, which may have been causing her subacute decline at home.
It is likely that she had either a CVA vs hypoperfusion brain injuries in the setting of her hypotension.
# Anemia, thromobcytopenia, and elevated INR: Pt appeared to have DIC (secondary to sepsis or profound hypothermia), and may have an underlying myelodysplastic process.
Her anemia appeared to be a combination of likely GI losses since stool was guaiac positive and hemolysis.
Pt had some schistocytes on the peripheral smear.
# Hypernatremia, acute kidney injury: her hypernatremia was likely related to dehydration and decreased po intake in the setting of hypotonic insensible losses The hypernatremia was initially corrected.
Her acute renal failure was likely prerenal, it corrected with IVF and tx of UTI.
# Vertebral compression fractures: CTAP at admission showed new T7 vertebral body compression fracture and progression of L2 vertebral body fracture.
This may have been contributing to the abdominal pain with which she presented.
Due to her multiorgan failure and general malnutrition (alb 1.8) pt has a very poor prognosis.
Especially due to her poor mental status state.
The next day she removed her PICC, and did not want to have a PIV placed, so IVF were stopped.
