Admission Date:  [**2141-2-23**]       Death Date:  [**2141-2-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-6-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 25288**] is a 76-year-old gentleman, with a history of prior coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2126**] with subsequent stenting, and a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of approximately 25%.
His medical history also includes carotid disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco history, ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] of CT surgery for consideration of redo coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement.
He had no chest pain, or dyspnea, but the picture also included significant limb claudication bilaterally.
Status post prostate cancer with radiation therapy.
GERD with peptic ulcer disease and a history of H. pylori.
GI bleed secondary to an AV malformation.
11.Chronic renal insufficiency.
EXAM:  He was alert and oriented, in no apparent distress.
He was neurologically intact with no JVD or bruits, but a cardiac murmur from his aortic valve transmitted to bilateral carotid arteries.
He had a grade III-IV/VI systolic ejection murmur.
He had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
He had well-healed midline scars.
Chest x-ray showed no significant process.
In addition, the patient also had an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue valve.
He was in sinus bradycardia in the 50s, with a blood pressure of 110/45, PA pressures 42/29, with an index of 2.1.
The RVAD flow was at a 5 liters with a VAD rate of 67, and the patient remained in stable condition but critically ill with multiple drug support, on the RVAD, and the intra-aortic balloon pump.
The patient was seen by the renal fellow on the [**2-24**], as the patient had become hypotension and oliguric over that 24-hour period prior to being seen by renal.
They were asked to consult for volume management, noting his baseline creatinine of 1.718 was now 2.2.
A chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.
They made recommendations for renal medication.
The patient was also seen by the renal attending who again agreed with dosing the medications according to CVVH, and noted the alkalosis that was going on at the time.
Creatinine, however, began to rise significantly and went from 2.0-3.2, as the patient remained in acute renal failure.
The patient continued going in and out of atrial fibrillation.
Also on the 17, the patient developed third degree AV block with some atrial rhythm, but fluctuated between sinus and atrial fibrillation.
The patient very early in the morning at 1:00 am on [**2-26**] was seen by general surgery on consult for evaluation of continuing decrease in urine output, increasing acidosis.
pH continued to worsen and got as low as 7.20 with a base excess of -8, and a lactate of 15.
General surgery was consulted for the possibility of an abdominal process going on, as the AST had also begun to rise.
General surgery noted and assessed appropriately the critical illness of this patient, and that the abdominal process and worsening acidosis may have been due to a global ischemia with possibility that this could produce small areas of ischemic gut.
AST 898, ALT 235, and a worsening lactic acidosis with a severely elevated lactate.
The patient also was in third degree AV block, and was using the pacing wire placed by electrophysiology.
The patient was clearly critically ill and unstable with a very poor prognosis.
At approximately 11:00 am, the patient experienced a progressive drop in his blood pressure with wide complex tachycardia, worsening acidosis, and anuria.
He had some runs of V-tach which deteriorated into ventricular fibrillation despite constant boluses of epinephrine, calcium, bicarb, and upward titration of his pressors and inotropes.
Cardiogenic shock.
Severe peripheral vascular disease, status post right carotid endarterectomy, and status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
15.Status post prostate cancer with radiation therapy.
16.Gastroesophageal reflux disease with peptic ulcer.
17.Gastrointestinal bleed secondary to arteriovenous malformation.
20.Chronic renal insufficiency.
