CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from [**Hospital6 8972**] for right foot gangrene and MRSA sepsis with seating of left wrist and a left ventricular thrombus.
Urinalysis was positive for nitrites with 11-20 white blood cells, 0-2 red blood cells and many bacteria with tract protein.
Initial chest x-ray showed left lower lobe pneumonia.
The final read of the chest x-ray showed chronic changes.
The patient's right foot was managed with local wound care.
His left wrist was tapped and grew gram positive cocci consistent with MRSA septic arthritis.
Atenolol was discontinued due to bradycardia.
Pacemaker was not placed due to MRSA bacteremia and because the patient was not hemodynamically stable.
From [**7-4**] to [**7-7**] his bradycardia continued without improvement.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained for evaluation endocarditis and was notable for a large left ventricular thrombus, a decreased EF equal to 15-20% with globally decreased systolic function, moderate pulmonary hypertension, thickening of aortic valve, trace mitral, aortic, and tricuspid insufficiency.
Furthermore, the patient was noted to have colonic distention on KUB consistent with an ileus.
There were also reports of bright red blood per rectum.
Hospital course at [**Hospital1 **] was further complicated by oliguric acute on chronic renal failure.
His renal function continued to deteriorate with a FENa less than 1, consistent with a prerenal azotemia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease with history of a non Q wave myocardial infarction on [**2146-5-31**].
2) Arteriosclerotic peripheral vascular disease, status post left BKA, status post right 4th and 5th toe amputation.
3) Type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin with retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy.
6) Question benign prostatic hypertrophy.
MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient medications: Lipitor 20 mg [**Hospital1 **], Allopurinol 100 mg q d, NPH 22 units q a.m., 16 units q h.s., Humalog 2 units q a.m., 8 units at dinner, Nitro patch 0.4 mg from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Nitro 0.4 mg sublingual prn, Celexa 40 mg q d, Flomax 0.4 mg q d, q h.s., Coumadin 2.5 mg q d, Colace 100 mg q d, Tylenol prn, Milk of Magnesia prn.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for cardiac disease.
Consults which were obtained during the patient's MICU stay include ID, renal, plastic, vascular and psychiatry.
Wrist films on [**2146-7-8**] showed no evidence of osteomyelitis, however, were positive for osteopenia.
Cardiac:  A PA catheter was placed on [**7-8**] for management of acute renal failure.
Furthermore, Dopamine drip was attempted to increase cardiac output and chronotropia, however, this caused his cardiac output to drop and SVR to increase and therefore was discontinued.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2146-7-8**] showed a right and left atrium mildly dilated, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular function is seriously depressed with a large left ventricular thrombus, severe global RV wall hypokinesis, tract AR, physiologic MR, 1+ TR, mild pulmonary hypertension, no echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
The patient had a slight troponin leak without EKG changes or elevations in CK MB.
Currently Aspirin was held given the risk of bleeding with pericarditis as well as patient being pre-op for surgery.
The patient had episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation and SVT, then returning to bradycardia in the 50's or 60's.
Pulmonary:  Mild pulmonary edema by physical exam, however, patient was maintaining good oxygenation.
GI:  The patient had a KUB on [**2146-7-8**] which showed colonic ileus.
Reglan was started, however, later discontinued due to prolonged QT intervals.
KUB on [**2146-7-12**] showed resolving dilated bowel loops.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**2146-7-9**] showed sludge in the gallbladder, however, no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall thickening or evidence of biliary obstruction.
Renal:  Hemodialysis was initiated on [**2146-7-9**] for uremic pericarditis.
The patient had a high phosphate level secondary to acute renal failure which was treated with calcium carbonate tid.
Urine was sent for urine sodium and creatinine and urine culture showing a prerenal picture.
His iron level is 57, TIBC is decreased at 146, TRF is decreased at 112, ferritin is 356, consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  Ectopy is decreased with increasing the potassium during the dialysis.
Abdomen soft, nontender, minimal distention, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities, 2+ pitting edema bilateral lower extremities, 2+ pitting edema in bilateral upper extremities and hands.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, admitted for MRSA bacteremia from primary infected gangrenous right foot.
Admission has been complicated by a septic left wrist, bradycardia, with tachycardic episodes, acute on chronic renal failure, uremic pericarditis and left ventricular thrombus.
The patient is currently awaiting MRI for further evaluation of his septic left wrist.
Due to the patient's critical condition and after consultation with anesthesia, it was seemed safer to proceed with the guillotine right BKA under MAC anesthesia and to proceed with AKA at a later date after some of the [**Hospital 228**] medical issues have resolved.
The patient's right upper extremity was found to be cool on [**2146-7-14**] and right upper extremity ultrasound was performed which ruled out an upper extremity DVT.
Cardiovascular:  The patient continued to have episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, alternating with relative bradycardia to the 50's and 60's.
The patient also was complaining of some vague upper back pain, therefore it was decided to rule the patient out for an aortic dissection.
Patient underwent CT with and without contrast of the chest with pretreatment of Mucomyst and which showed no evidence of aortic dissection due to the absence of an intimal flap in the face of fluid density surrounding the anterior mediastinum adjacent to the ascending aorta.
Calcified aorta of normal caliber; a small pericardial effusion along with small left and trace right pleural effusion; left lower lobe patchy coapts adjacent to the effusion posteriorly; small amount of free fluid in the abdomen surrounding the liver, spleen and tracking to the right lower quadrant.
Chest x-ray at the time showed no enlargement of mediastinum and a left basilar opacity.
The patient has been continually monitored with the Dinamap machine on the floor with no further issues with high blood pressure.
An abdominal ultrasound obtained on [**2146-7-14**] for evaluation of the biliary and urinary systems showed no signs of biliary or urinary obstruction and was positive only for gallbladder sludge.
It was noted by the blood bank that the patient had delayed transfusion reaction forming allo antibodies.
