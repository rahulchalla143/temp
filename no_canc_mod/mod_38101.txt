Admission Date:  [**2104-11-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2104-11-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2057-11-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is 46-year-old Spanish speaking male with a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease who on admission was postoperative day number 11, status post mitral valve replacement and aortic valve replacement after having been ruled out for infectious endocarditis.
His postoperative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation.
This was first noticed on postoperative day number one with rapid atrial fibrillation at 140 with left bundle branch block and the patient was started on amiodarone 400 mg po t.i.d.
The patient was then discharged to home five days prior to admission, and then three days prior to this admission, the patient presented to his primary care physician complaining of palpitations and was directed to decrease his amiodarone to 400 mg b.i.d.
For the next two days until the day of admission, the patient complained of feeling more lethargic and not himself.
The patient had recently been admitted on [**2104-10-8**] for fevers and endocarditis was suspected.
The patient was presumptively treated with antibiotics after being ruled out for endocarditis by blood cultures and echocardiography, the patient underwent aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement.
Catheterization results showed a calcific valvulopathy and rare growth of coag negative Staph from the aortic valve.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient complained of subjective fevers at night twice since his discharge on [**10-28**] without cough, headache, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and he denied noticing any blood and urine or stools.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Rheumatic heart disease diagnosed at age 15, status post aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement on [**2104-10-22**].
Echocardiogram Obtained [**2104-9-16**] in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] showed left ventricular function of 40-45% with diminished aortic and mitral valve areas.
ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.
Carotids had no bruits.
Abdomen exhibited normal active bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
His electrocardiogram on admission was sinus rate at 63, PR interval was prolonged, 280-312 ms, QRS 176 ms.  [**Name14 (STitle) **] 500 ms.  Axis was slightly left deviated at -33 with a left bundle branch block and marked left atrial enlargement.
Left ventricular ejection fraction of 50-55%, a dilated left ventricle, 2+ aortic regurgitation, 3+ mitral regurgitation, mild to moderate aortic stenosis, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for observation of his heart block and evaluation by the Electrophysiology Service.
For his cardiac issues number one was history of atrial fibrillation.
His other issue on admission was complaint of subjective fevers with a history of rheumatic heart disease and previously being ruled out for endocarditis, so, it was decided to obtain three sets of blood cultures 12 hours apart to again check for endocarditis which were negative throughout his stay.
He also received a transesophageal echocardiogram which was negative for valvular vegetations and negative for a valve leak.
Hematology:  During the hospitalization, the patient exhibited a hemolytic anemia with low haptoglobin, high LDH and a reticulocyte index that suggested an inadequate marrow response.
There was no perivalvular leak which could explain the hemolytic anemia and it is recommended that the patient's hematocrit be followed and his anemia worked up as an outpatient.
The patient also was found during this admission to have a right upper lobe friction rub.
By chest x-ray, there was no evidence of infiltrate or other abnormality and it was suggested that this patient has post pericardotomy syndrome with a pleural pericarditis that would explain the friction rub, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high C reactive protein and intermittent subjective fevers.
The patient was briefly treated with Motrin 800 mg times two doses which caused an elevation in his creatinine from 0.9 to 1.7.
Urinalysis was consistent with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs toxicity, positive for eosinophils.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also complicated by hematoma in the pacer pocket in the setting of heparin and Coumadin.
The hematoma was observed, immobilized with a pressure dressing and stabilized on [**11-11**] with an INR of 2.3.
The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm AV paced during  his hospital stay with no evidence of atrial fibrillation.
Post pericardotomy, pleural pericarditis syndrome.
3   Rheumatic heart disease, status post aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement.
