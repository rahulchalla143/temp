Admission Date:  [**2147-2-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2147-2-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2076-5-6**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARD [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old gentleman who was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2147-2-5**] with a one week history of increasing shortness of breath and generalized edema with associated symptoms of bilateral arm pain.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed left main severe three vessel coronary artery disease and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for coronary artery bypass grafting.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
History of rheumatic fever.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] preoperatively for his coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient underwent an ultrasound of the carotids which showed a 60% right internal carotid artery stenosis, an occluded left common and left internal carotid artery.
In the Operating Room, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed perioperatively due to the patient's low ejection fraction.
On the evening of postoperative day number three, the patient had a 42 beat run of ventricular tachycardia.
Recommendations were made to start the patient on low dose beta blocker and plans were made for an Electrophysiology Service study due to the patient's low ejection fraction and ventricular ectopy.
The patient had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 30%, dilated right and left atrium, moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, one to two plus mitral regurgitation and one to two plus tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit and continued without any further ventricular tachycardia.
The patient tolerated his low dose beta blocker, however, the patient occasionally had episodes of bradycardia with rates in the 30s to 40s while asleep.
The patient was asymptomatic from this.
The patient was taken to the Electrophysiology Laboratory for Electrophysiology studies which were negative for any inducible ventricular tachycardia.
In the evening of postoperative day number seven, while the patient was asleep, the patient was noted to have a period of bradycardia with an approximately 4.5 second pause.
Electrophysiology Service was again re-consulted and it was felt that the patient was asymptomatic and that the episodes were only happening while the patient was asleep and there was no further intervention required.
The patient continued on a heparin infusion for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.
By postoperative day number nine, the patient was cleared from Physical Therapy and was able to ambulate 500 feet and climb one flight of stairs without difficulty.
Of note, the patient had a TSH checked during his arrhythmia work-up.
Cardiovascular is irregularly irregular; no rub or murmur.
There is mild erythema; no drainage.
Lower extremity vein harvest site is clean, dry and intact; no erythema or drainage.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Postoperative ventricular tachycardia.
Postoperative bradycardia.
Congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension.
