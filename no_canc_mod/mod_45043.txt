There is a left basilar hazy opacity, likely reflects an underlying small effusion and atelectasis.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA.
No thrombus in the LAA.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
Small secundum ASD.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
A secundum type ASD is seen.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is calcification of the subvalvular apparatus.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae and calcified papillary muscle tips 7.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
It is well seated; there is good excursion of the leaflets; there is no paravalvular leak or aortic regurgitation.
The secundum atrial septal defect has been repaired but a much smaller leak seen across the interatrial septum and surgeon notified of the same with posititve bubble from right to left.
