Admission Date:  [**2138-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-12-1**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Lisinopril / Tetracycline / Proton Pump Inhibitors (Benzimidazole)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**] Chief Complaint: Gram Negative Rod Sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left IJ line, ART line  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84yo man with h/o DM, HTN, pacemaker, GERD and esophagitis who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital today after having rigors and with back pain after a fall last week.
of irregular heart beat, with BP initially 100/70s -->80s/60s, and WBC 1.0.
He was diagnosed with sepsis of unclear source and was treated with 2 L NS, a LIJ was placed, Neo was started for hypotension, and he was given Ceftazidime, Vancomycin, Metronidazole for broad coverage given fear of neutropenia.
He had no back or abdominal tenderness.
EKG showed a new Q in II as well as biphasic T waves and a troponin of 0.27.
He received a total of 3L of fluid to maintain his blood pressures, was later weaned from pressors and transferred to the general medicine floor for further management.
Past Medical History: pacemaker gastritis, esophagitis with esophageal ulcer HTN DM2 GERD BPH s/p TURP colon ca s/p colectomy and chemo [**2129**] DJD depression/anxiety nephrolithiasis spinal stenosis dysphagia - with recent negative workup by ENT, neuro, GI frequent UTIs dementia   Social History: lives at home with his wife of 64 years.

Imaging: [**2138-11-20**]: RUQ U/S: Mild gallbladder wall edema with multiple gallstones.
The gallbladder wall edema is a nonspecific finding that may be seen in the presence of cholecystitis, third spacing, or liver disease such as hepatitis, or pancreatitis among others.
[**2138-11-21**]: HIDA: Partial gallbladder filling, which is not consistent with acute cholecystitis.
Admission EKG: Sinus rhythm with possible ventricular pacing fusion complexes Borderline first degree A-V delay Left atrial abnormality Inferior infarct, age indeterminate Consider anterior myocardial infarction, age indeterminate ST-T wave abnormalities - cannot exclude in part ischemia Clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing available for comparison .
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Admission CXR: left lower lobe atelectasis .
[**2138-11-22**]: EKG: Atrial fibrillation with intermittent ventricular paced beats.
Non-specific T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2138-11-21**] ventriciular rate is slower, intermitent ventricular paced beats are present and further T wave abnormalities are seen.
[**2138-11-25**]: CXR: Improvement of previously described mostly unilateral pulmonary edema but bilateral pleural effusions remaining.
No new areas of parenchymal densities have developed  Brief Hospital Course: By problem: .
# Gram negative rod septicemia: Patient initially presented with leukocytosis and bandemia and later was found to have e. coli bacteremia in [**4-8**] blood cultures from the OSH.
Once speciation of the bacteria was known antibiotics were changed to meropenem.
Source of this infection is unclear, but likely either a UTI or GI source.
Initial ultrasound and LFTs seemed consistent with a biliary tree infection, though HIDA scan showed no signs of cholecystitis.
Given that the patient has a history of UTI's, it seems more likely that the patient had a urinary source.
The patient initially presented with hypotension requiring pressors, but was quickly weaned off.
His sensitivities from OSH were obtained and grew E. Coli pan-sensitive.
# Cards Vascular: Initially he had EKG changes (as above) and elevated troponin in face of flat CKs: Unable to compare troponin here to at OSH given different lab values.
- Echo was done to evaluate cardiac function and showed depressed cardiac function, but no signs of wall motion abnormality.
# Lower Extremity [**Name (NI) 70101**] Pt reports chronic [**Location (un) **] likely secondary to venous insufficiency.
# Thrombocytopenia- Patient had rapid drop in platelets.
However, smear was negative for schistocytes.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline appears to be 1.6 and patient returned to baseline quickly.
# Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia and we continued his home regimen.
We used lorazepam and olanzapine as needed for agitation.
# Diarrhea: The patient had diarrhea intermittently throughout the hospitalization.
# h/o esophagitis/gastritis and esophageal ulcers: pt has intolerance to PPIs.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every twelve (12) hours: Hold for sedation or RR<10.
