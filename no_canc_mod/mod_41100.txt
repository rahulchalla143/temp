Right bundle-branch block.
Non-specific ST segment changes in the inferolateral leads.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Bibasilar opacities which may be atelectasis; however, infection cannot be excluded.
Possible small left pleural effusion.
Severe tracheobronchomalacia with areas of complete collapse of the trachea as well as severe narrowing of the left and right main stem bronchi.
Complete obstruction of left lower lobe bronchus causing collapse of the left lower lobe, which is most likely chronic.
Consolidation at the right lower lobe with bronchiectasis which may be atelectasis vs. pneumonia or aspiration.
Nodule with halo of ground glass in the right lower lobe may be infectious in nature.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Large thyroid goiter arising from the left lobe of the thyroid causing focal mild compression on the trachea.
Brief Hospital Course: 89yo M PMHx bronchomalacia, Afib, recent OSH admission for PNA, who re-presented 1d after discharge w dyspnea and hypoxia requiring intubation, bronch and CT c/w bronchomalacia, e/o ongoing infection versus mucus plugging.
Active Issues =========================== # Tracheobronchomalacia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital 31145**] for hypoxic respiratory failure.
He was recently d/c'd from OSH where he was treated for a ?candidal pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
He then represented to OSH for hypoxic respiratory failure and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after intubation.
Upon admission to MICU, he had CXR showed possible bilateral pleural effusions, but pneumonia, especially in the retrocardiac space cannot be ruled out.
A bronchoscopy was performed which revealed airways that were convoluted with sputum and mucous plugs.
The patient was extubated on [**2101-9-6**] without complication.
A CT trachea was performed which showed severe tracheobronchomalacia with complete collapse of the trachea on expiration and severe narrowing of the mainstem bronchi; secretions in airways with complete obstruction of left lower lobe bronchus causing collapse of the left lower lobe, likely choronic; consolidation at right lower lobe which may be atelectasis, infectious or aspiration; multiple sub-centimeter nodules for which follow up in 3 months is required.
Pulmonology was consulted and PFTs during hospitalization did not illustrate reactive airway pattern or reversibility with bronchodilators.
Upon discharge, his symptoms greatly improved, with O2 saturation high 90s on RA with minimal coughing.
#Hospital acquired pneumonia: Evidence of RLL infiltrate on CT scan.
With his recent treatment for community acquired pneumonia at OSH.
#Dysphagia: pt complained of dysphagia for liquids/solids s/p extubation.
He had never had dsyphagia previously.
Speech and swallow evaluated him and believed it was secondary to tracheal irritation.
Most likely hypovolemia, possibly severe sepsis.
He was fluid responsive to only 2.5L of fluid recussitation.
ECHO revealed normal EF without significant valvular dysfunction and only small pericardial effusion.
# Hypothermia: Hypovolemia vs severe sepsis in setting of hypotension.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: thought to be most likely secondary to pre-renal as Cr trended down to 0.9 upon discharge with IVf.
He came in with supratherapeutic INR of 3.2, which was reversed with vitamin K in preparation for bronchoscopy.
#Elevated Lactic acid: Slight elevation at 2.4 thought to be secondary to hypovolemia which improved with IVF.
Transional Issues: =========================== - Pulmonary nodules in RLL will need to be followed up in 3 months by CT. - Mr. [**Known lastname **] had supratherapeutic INR upon admission.
Mucinex *NF* (guaiFENesin) 1,200 mg Oral [**Hospital1 **] Reason for Ordering: requiring mucolytics RX *Mucinex 1,200 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth twice a day Disp #*60 Tablet Refills:*0 9.
You were also being treated with a pneumonia with 3 antibiotics.
