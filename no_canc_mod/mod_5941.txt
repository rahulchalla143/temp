Admission Date:  [**2153-4-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-1-20**]    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 86 year old man with a history of laryngeal cancer status post radiation, who initially was admitted to the Plastics Service on [**4-13**], after increased secretions from an oral cutaneous fistula as 20 and [**4-5**] with a history of bleeding from an oral cutaneous fistula on his left neck which was approximately 7 by 8 centimeters in size, and at that time, a skin flap was placed.
Laryngeal cancer status post laryngectomy in [**2149**].
Coronary artery disease.
Subdural hemorrhage noted incidentally on CT scan of the head in [**2153-2-19**].
ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known history of any allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   As noted, the patient was admitted on [**4-13**] for increased secretions from the oral cutaneous fistula.
Pulmonary was consulted at that time and they felt that he likely had an aspiration pneumonitis and hypoxia with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Also, it was felt at that time that he might have some possible congestive heart failure and he was diuresed as well.
On [**4-22**], the patient was seen by Surgery for severe acute bleeding from his tracheostomy site.
On [**2153-4-24**], there were no signs of acute bleeding from his fistula sites and Plastics as well as Surgery were following him.
The plan was to discuss with Interventional Radiology the possible angiography with wound blockage of the carotid with or without embolization.
A family meeting with the Intensive Care Unit Team occurred and the family elected for a conservative approach which included no angiography or no surgical repair at the time.
The family is aware of the risks of not anti-coagulating including the risk of stroke, given that the patient has an aortic valve replacement.
In addition, for the patient's bleeding at that time, it was a self-limited bleed requiring multiple units, however, there was still felt to be a high risk of the patient to rebleed.
Also of note, the patient has been noted to be in atrial fibrillation.
He became bradycardic when treated with a beta blocker per report.
The patient also had a CT scan of the chest which showed moderate pleural effusions as well as interstitial lung disease.
During the patient's course in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was diuresed for mild congestive heart failure.
The patient had hypertension treated with Captopril as well.
There was a concern for a possible recurrence of the patient's Pseudomonas tracheobronchitis.
Sputum was sent which had four plus Gram negative rods and was treated with a ten day course of Ceftazidime for the Pseudomonas tracheobronchitis.
In addition, the patient had a thoracentesis for the pleural effusion on his left side; 1.8 liters were removed and the pleural fluid was consistent with a transudative fluid.
The patient also had been on Captopril for hypertension and the Captopril was held for systolic blood pressures in the 90s.
During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, the patient was noted to have had a decrease in his hematocrit which required approximately four units of blood over a period of about four days.
The patient also had guaiac positive stools.
The patient also had an episode of acute renal failure with creatinine rising from his baseline of approximately 0.7 to 3.2.
It was felt that the renal failure that he was experiencing was acute renal failure secondary to hypoperfusion causing acute tubular necrosis.
The renal failure is resolving.
The patient also was seen by Psychiatry for agitation and depression.
Psychiatry felt that the agitation may be secondary to delirium and the decision was made at that time to decrease the patient's Paxil dose.
The patient, in addition, had a bronchoscopy on [**2153-5-22**], for an episode of bleeding mentioned earlier at that time.
Normal mucosa was noted with clots in the left base and a left lower lung basilar segment.
Attempts to clear it were unsuccessful so could not exclude endobronchial lesion distal to the clot.
Also of note, please note that the patient's Captopril doses had been held while the patient had been in acute renal failure.
In summary, this is an 85 year old male with a history of laryngeal cancer with a oral cutaneous fistula with bleeding from the fistula.
