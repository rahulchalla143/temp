Admission Date:  [**2110-1-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2110-1-10**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presented with two hours of retrosternal chest pain, nausea, and mild shortness of breath.
The patient had no prior history of these symptoms.
She presented to the Emergency Department on [**Hospital3 4298**] and was found to have an electrocardiogram with questionable ST elevations.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 346**], and en route by helicopter had pain which increased to [**8-15**] and improved with 200 mcg of Fentanyl and 4 mg of Lopressor.
No known diabetes or coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck examination revealed jugular venous pulsation approximately 7 cm.
No third heart sound or fourth heart sound.
There was a soft holosystolic murmur at the apex.
Extremity examination revealed the patient had no edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy, 1-mm ST elevations in leads III and aVF.
There were 3-mm ST depressions in leads I and V2.
There were 2-mm ST depressions in lead V3.
Right-sided and posterior leads revealed no ST elevations in V3 to V4 and V3 and V4; respectively.
There was mild pulmonary venous congestion.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Coronary artery disease: The cardiac catheterization revealed the following; (1) left anterior descending artery with a proximal calcified 70% lesion; (2) left circumflex with mid thrombotic 60% lesion; and, (3) right coronary artery with minimal disease.
The patient had percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting of culprit 60% left circumflex lesion and was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further monitoring.
The patient did well following her procedure and remained chest pain free throughout her stay.
She was to have an outpatient stress test to evaluate the need for future intervention on the 70% proximal left anterior descending artery lesion.
(b)  Pump:  The patient was not known to have prior left ventricular dysfunction.
There were no wall motion abnormalities, with 1+ aortic regurgitation and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient remained in a normal sinus rhythm without any evidence of ventricular ectopy.
The patient was chest pain free and without a supplemental oxygen requirement.
Coronary artery disease with inferoposterior myocardial infarction; status post percutaneous coronary intervention of left circumflex lesion.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
