Mild biliary excretion of prior IV contrast is also noted.
There is an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, measuring 4.0 x 3.9 cm TV, AP that previously measured 3.5 x 3.3 cm.
There is hyperdense material surrounding the abdominal aortic aneurysm with Hounsfield attenuation values of approximately 50 (similar to blood in the aorta) that does not demonstrate enhancement on post- contrast images.
There is mild stranding in the retroperitoneum.
There is no active extravasation of IV contrast from the aorta.
There are multiple sigmoid diverticula with probable muscular hypertrophy of the sigmoid colon.
There is no pericolonic stranding.
There is no intra-abdominal free air.
Bone windows demonstrate extensive endplate degenerative changes at L4-L5 with vacuum disc phenomenon and multiple Schmorl's nodes.
Interval increase in size in the abdominal aortic aneurysm with new nonenhancing, hyperdense material surrounding the abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Findings are concerning for slow leak / contained rupture.
[**2145-10-31**] 9:59 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  FINDINGS: There is relative stability of the right hydropneumothorax with a relatively large fluid component in the base and very very small air component at the apex.
There has been no significant interval change noted in the course or position of a right internal jugular approach, central line.
There is subtle worsening opacity of the right lung base with slight obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and blunting of the costophrenic angle.
These findings suggest a small right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
Interval development of a small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
