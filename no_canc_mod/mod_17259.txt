He returned to the [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital where his course was marked by the development of pancreatitis, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, and progressive abdominal distention.
He had interval imaging of the abdomen, as summarized below, which showed necrotizing pancreatitis, and he was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, unknown complications.
Osteoarthritis and leg cramps treated with quinine and a [**Doctor Last Name **]-II inhibitor.
There was no carotid bruit.
There was no thyromegaly.
NODES:  There was no anterior cervical, posterior cervical, supra or infraclavicular, axillary or inguinal adenopathy.
There was no S3, S4, murmurs, rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Distended, decreased bowel sounds, tympanitic with percussion splash, but no shifting dullness.
He was too heavily sedated to assess for tenderness.
There was reducible umbilical hernia.
Scrotal edema was also appreciated.
BACK:  Not assessed initially; however, there were no skin lesions appreciated throughout his hospital course.
EXTREMITIES:  There was no rash, clubbing, or cyanosis.
There was +2 edema in the lower extremities from the toes to the midcalves, and from the fingertips to the midforearms.
There was no evidence of ischemia, injury or infarction.
Chest x-ray from [**11-29**]:  Hazy bibasilar densities, left greater than right, both with pleural effusions.
Abdominal ultrasound on [**11-24**]:  Showed multiple gallstones without evidence of ductal dilation.
Abdominal CT from [**11-24**]:  Showed bibasilar pulmonary densities, likely reflecting scarring or atelectasis.
There was cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
There was no abscess or free air identified.
Aggressive volume resuscitation was required, and at its peak the patient was 35 kg positive (He went from 101 at baseline to 137.).
However, he had persistent fevers and several episodes of hypotension, culminating in oliguria and ultimately anuria.
He was started on continuous venovenous hemofiltration, largely to remove the third space fluid that had accumulated in his resuscitation, but also to provide some clearance of metabolites.
His CVVHF was complicated by repeated clotting of the filter, as well as episodes of hypotension following large volume removal.
He was also hypotensive, hypoxic and slightly hypercarbic.
3) TYPE 2 DIABETES:  The patient's glycemia was controlled adequately with continuous insulin infusion with the dose depending on the presence or absence of total parenteral nutrition administration.
She specifically stated that he does not want a gastrostomy or tracheostomy.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, unknown complications.
Osteoarthritis and leg cramps treated with quinine and a [**Doctor Last Name **]-II inhibitor.
