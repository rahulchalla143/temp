Admission Date:  [**2190-9-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2190-10-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2113-3-5**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Plastic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old female with a past medical history significant for squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth with T2 N0 staging, status post interstitial catheter placement in [**2188-7-18**] for brachy therapy for recurrent cancer, status post resection, now presenting with postoperative osteoradionecrosis of the mandible which had previously been treated with 30 sessions with hyperbaric oxygen.
However, the patient was still left with a large defect which was initially closed with a inferior based FAMM flap; but ultimately the patient developed a right pathologic mandibular fracture with osteonecrosis of the right mandible.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past Medical History significant for hypothyroidism and reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination, she was afebrile with stable vital signs.
The remainder of the physical examination was notable for a shift of the mandibular midline secondary to loss of support of the right mandibular body with a large separation of the fracture region with concomitant buckle and facial swelling overlying the area.
She was monitored in the initial 24-hour period with every two hour flap checks by Cook catheter for venous pulsations as well as arterial Doppler flows.
Her postoperative Intensive Care Unit stay was complicated by post surgical anemia as well as Pseudomonas pneumonia without clinical evidence; requiring treatment with ciprofloxacin.
During her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was maintained in a flat position to prevent development of fistula as gravity would pull the saliva to the back of her throat, and a flat position opposed to the floor of her mouth in an upright or partially upright position.
She also had a swallow study obtained just prior to her discharge; the results of which indicated poor oral transit with aspiration; however, there was no evidence of fistula.
