No ascites is seen.
IMPRESSION: Status post cholecystectomy without evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
CHEST X-RAY (PORTABLE AP) ([**2166-10-22**]):  FINDINGS: Bibasal atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
There is volume overload seen as vascular engorgement and mild interstitial prominence, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small to moderate.
The right lower lobe consolidation with air bronchogram is noted, may represent atelectasis, but infectious process would be another possibility, close followup is required.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient initially presented to the emergency room for evaluation of his severe epigastric/abdominal pain, where laboratory values were consistent with recurrent pancreatitis.
He was admitted overnight to the Surgical ICU under the care of the West 2a surgical team on telemetry monitoring given his persistent sinus tachydardia.
The patient was begun on aggressvie fluid recuscitation (receiving over 7 liters in fluid boluses in the first 24 hours), made NPO/bowel rest, and his pain was managed with Dilaudid.
On the first hospital day he remained in sinus tachycardia but asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
His pain improved and urine output was good.
By hospital day 2 his heart rate had improved and decreased from the 140's to the low 100's - sinus rhythm - and his pain was reported to be improved.
On exam the patient was noted to have some crackles in his lung fields bilaterally, and due to concern for possible fluid-overload or pulmonary edema, IV fluids were discontinued and a chest X-ray was obtained.
The chest X-ray did demonstrate some evidence of fluid overload and mild bilateral pleural effusions, however he continued to have good oxygen saturation and diuresed well.
The patient did well on the floors with no acute events.
On hospital day 3 the patient was begun on a clear liquid diet which he tolerated well without any nausa or vomiting.
At the time of discharge his pain was well controlled on oral medications, he had a completely benign abdominal exam, was tolerating PO, voiding well, had normal bowel movements, ambulating independently, and was in all respects stable.
The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in one month's time following discharge, during which time he will also undergo a Secretin MRCP for further evaluation of his pancreatic dysfunction.
