Admission Date:  [**2120-3-15**]       Discharge Date: [**2120-3-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2075-2-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45 year old female patient with a history of bipolar disease and idiopathic tachycardia who was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] from [**Hospital6 19155**] where she presented with left lower quadrant and left flank pain, nausea and thrombocytopenia.
The patient initially presented to the outside hospital with a three day history of [**Location (un) 2452**] urine and loose [**Location (un) 2452**] stools with a more recent development of a lower extremity rash.
In addition, the patient noted fatigue with increasing dyspnea on exertion over the last three to six weeks.
She also endorsed a one day history of nausea with a development of crampy searing left lower quadrant and flank pain associated with [**Location (un) 2452**] loose stools.
She also denied any epistaxis or bleeding gums.
At the outside hospital, the patient's laboratory data was notable for a platelet count of 7, INR 1.2, and large blood on a urinalysis.
An abdominal computerized tomography scan was performed which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis, no renal stones and a cyst in the right kidney.
Bipolar disorder.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.
No family history of hematologic disorders.
General:  The patient is in mild distress, lying on her back.
Dry mucous membranes.
Neck:  No evidence of supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Mild tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant.
No evidence of hepatosplenomegaly, no rebound tenderness or guarding.
Extremities:  There are petechiae evident on the patient's lower extremities bilaterally, right more than left, no evidence of edema or cyanosis.
Back:  Scattered petechiae, no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Urinalysis:  Red, protein over 300, trace glucose, moderate bilirubin, red blood cells over 50, white blood cells [**3-1**], few bacteria.
She was admitted to the General Medicine Service with a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
A hematology and transfusion medicine consult was obtained and the patient was initiated on plasmapheresis for idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
The patient had stool cultures sent which were negative for Escherichia coli and Shigella.
Her heme studies were consistent with a hemolytic anemia in addition to her thrombocytopenia.
The patient underwent five cycles of plasmapheresis which were uncomplicated and her platelet count eventually increased to 244.
The first 45 minutes of the patient's pheresis were uneventful but the patient subsequently began to cough continuously and became acutely short of breath.
A Code Blue was called and the patient became more uncomfortable appearing with expiratory grunting and paradoxical movements.
The patient was urgently transported to the Emergency Department where she was intubated for respiratory failure.
In addition, her other markers of hemolytic anemia including LDH, total bilirubin and haptoglobin improved.
Respiratory failure - As noted earlier, the patient became acutely short of breath with expiratory grunting and paradoxical breathing patterns during her seventh plasmapheresis and was urgently transferred to the Emergency Department where she was intubated.
The etiology of the patient's respiratory failure was considered likely secondary to Trali with adult respiratory distress syndrome.
The patient was initiated on pressure control ventilation with several recruitment maneuvers and was paralyzed due to continuous difficulty oxygenating and ventilating.
The patient was continued on unprotected ventilation for adult respiratory distress syndrome.
With large volume diuresis with CVVH the patient's respiratory status improved dramatically and at the time of dictation, the patient is tolerating pressure support, ventilation of [**5-1**] and oxygenating quite well.
Septic shock - The patient was noted on transfer to the MICU to be in septic shock requiring pressors and large fluid boluses.
The etiology of the patient's septic shock is not entirely clear at this time but is considered likely secondary to her transfusion-related acute lung injury associated with a massive cytokine release.
She received a even day course of steroids for relative adrenal insufficiency.
The patient was noted to have an elevated lactate on admission to the MICU likely secondary to hypoperfusion of tissues.
Her lactate level and metabolic acidosis improved through her extended stay in the MICU and she had an improving white blood cell count with increased bandemia.
This computerized tomography scan revealed no nidus of infection.
There became a concern for sinusitis, given the use of nasal packing for epistaxis and evidence of fluid on her head computerized tomography scan.
At the time of dictation the patient has been afebrile for over 72 hours.
Acute renal failure - The patient was admitted to the General Medical Service with a creatinine of 1.2, felt likely secondary to her thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
The Renal Consult Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the etiology of the patient's acute renal failure was considered likely from hypotension given her severe septic shock.
Over the course of her stay in the MICU the patient has had modest improvement in her creatinine and a gradual increase in her urine output.
The patient's acid base status was consistent with metabolic acidosis, likely secondary from septic shock as well as a metabolic alkalosis that was considered likely secondary to large infusions of bicarbonate in her CVVH dialysate.
The patient had no electrocardiogram changes and this was considered likely cardiac enzyme leak in the setting of demand ischemia.
As noted earlier, the patient was acutely hypotensive in septic shock and was placed on Levophed and Vasopressin for maintenance of her blood pressures.
Gastrointestinal - In the setting of the patient's septic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome, her liver enzymes became elevated.
The patient was placed on a calcium gluconate drip with frequent ionized calcium checks given the citrate in her plasmapheresis and multiple blood transfusions.
