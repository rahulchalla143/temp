2) Consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the lingula and right upper lobe may represent pneumonia.
Irregular right lower lobe consolidative opacity is also noted.
Follow-up examination after treatment should be considered within three months to assess for change or resolution.
4) Calcified pleural plaques suggesting prior asbestos exposure.
2) Probable mild failure.

His exam in the ED was notable for diffuse expiratory wheezes.
