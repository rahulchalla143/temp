He was also sent for CTA given hypotension and mild tachycardia.

However, this is less likely given incongruity with clinical findings.
No new areas of consolidation seen.
[**1-2**] CXR: Previously reported right basilar opacities are improving with minimal residual infrahilar opacities remaining with associated bronchial wall thickening and mild volume loss.
New peribronchiolar opacities have developed in the left retrocardiac region and may represent acute aspiration, atelectasis, or an early focus of pneumonia.
Prominence of the hila appear unchanged, possibly due to prominent pulmonary vasculature, but standard PA and lateral radiographs would be helpful prior to discharge for more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
There is mild unfolding of the ascending aorta.
There is patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region and to a lesser extent in the lingula.
There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
IMPRESSION: Patchy opacity right infrahilar region worse than on [**2160-1-1**], consistent with pneumonia.
Patchy opacity also in the left lingular region, probably unchanged allowing for technique.
Please note that followup to resolution is recommended to exclude a neoplastic or other chronic infiltrate.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 79627**] is a 63 yo M with history of COPD (2L home O2 at night), schizophrenia, pulmonary hypertension admitted to MICU with progressively worsening dyspnea.
On the floor he remained hypoxic but reporting he was at baseline.
# Respiratory distress: Most likely [**3-10**] COPD exacerbation; initial ABG relatively similar to his baseline, second overnight with slight worsening.
CXR equivocal for worsening pneumonia.
Significant worsening of leukocytosis on admission which is improving off ABx.
Was on azithromycin initially but switching to levofloxacin 750mg PO daily D1 [**2160-1-4**] for worsening R perihilar opacity on interval CXR concerning for PNA.
Goal O2 sats were 90-93% given COPD and baseline retention.
# Leukocytosis - significantly elevated to 38.4 on admission from 15 on [**2159-12-25**] at time of discharge.
Possibly [**3-10**] to steroids, also consider infection with most likely sources being recurrence of pneumonia vs C.diff given recent antibiotics.
Given CXR on [**2160-1-3**] concerning for PNA switched to levofloxacin.
# Schizophrenia: stable.
# Tobacco abuse - readressed importance of tobacco cessation in preventing progression of COPD and helping to decrease future infections/hospitalizations.
