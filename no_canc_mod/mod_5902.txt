Pt had previously been hospitalized at [**Hospital6 6689**] numerous times for Crohn's colitis and resultant diarrhea, deyhydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
Pt's most recent admission at [**Location (un) **] was for Klebsiella urosepsis, which responded well to Levoflox and IVF.
During the admission, she was clinically thought to have a vesicular-sigmoid fistula, although this was not demonstrated on CT scan.
According to OSH records, pt may also have had feculent material which drained from a foley cath.
Due to pt's complicated clinical course (including recent MI), she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her presumed vesicular-sigmoid fistula.
Enterovesicular fistula 3. h/o recent Klebsiella UTI, c/b sepsis 4.
Anteroseptal MI resulting in cardiogenic shock - [**2104-5-21**], recent Persantine MIBI shows small-to-moderate inferolateral reversible defect.
Bipolar Disorder 6. h/o c diff, now with c diff toxin negative x2 but persistent diarrhea, s/p tx with flagyl 7. h/o VRE 8. h/o MRSA 9.
Family History: No family history of Crohn's disease.
Positive family history for heart and vascular disease: mother died of MI in her 80s, father died of MI at 58, and her grandmother died of stroke.
HEENT: PERRL Cardio: RRR, nl S1S2, no m/r/g Resp: mild rhonchi BL Abd: soft, mild diffuse tenderness, no rebound/guarding, +BS.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
LVEF 55% Based on [**2094**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Incidental small right pleural effusion.
[**2104-6-30**] SIGMOIDOSCOPY: Opening consistent with fistula was visualized in the distal portion of the rectum, erythema in distal descending colon compatible with indeterminate colitis.
Descending colon mucosal biopsy: Focal architectural distortion and Paneth cells, suggestive of chronic inactive colitis.
No granulomas or dysplasia.
There is a filling defect in the left common femoral vein most likely representing a thrombosis.
Recommend left lower extremity ultrasound to better characterize.
There is an airspace opacity in the right middle lobe most likely consistent with pneumonia.
There is symmetric thickening of the wall of the sigmoid colon with pockets of diverticula without stranding of the surrounding fat and without abscess formation.
Patient has a known diagnosis of Crohn's but given only the sigmoid involvement and lack of asymmetry and skip lesions, diverticulitis should also be considered.
Severe left convex scoliosis of the lumbar spine.
LOWER EXTREMITY U/S [**2104-7-17**]: The left common femoral vein demonstrates intraluminal thrombus and is not completely compressible, although it is patent.
This finding is consistent with short-segment, nonocclusive thrombus of the proximal left common femoral vein that does not extend into the superficial femoral vein.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-6-30**], no major change is evident.
No fracture identified.
No fracture or dislocation demonstrated.
ECHO	Study Date of [**2104-7-28**] Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small (~3mm) somewhat mobile echodensity on the left ventricular side near the coaptation of the aortic valve leaflets.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
Delayed anterior precordial R wave progression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2104-7-22**] no diagnostic change.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 64 year old female with a history of Crohn's colitis who was transferred from [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital after she was observed to have stool discharging from the vagina.
Pt had previously been hospitalized at [**Hospital6 6689**] numerous times for Crohn's colitis and resultant diarrhea, deyhydration, and electrolyte abnormalities.
Pt's most recent admission at [**Location (un) **] was for Klebsiella urosepsis, which responded well to Levoflox and IVF.
During the admission, she was clinically thought to have a vaginal/sigmoid fistula, although this was not demonstrated on CT scan.
According to OSH records, pt may also have had feculent material which drained from a foley cath.
Due to pt's complicated clinical course (including recent MI), she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her presumed vaginal/sigmoid fistula.
Shortly after admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the pt had episode of hypotension with BP 60/doppler.
She denied SOB or CP at that time.
She was transferred on night of admission to the ICU and was given approx 2L of NS, with SBP remaining in the 70's to 80's.
Shortly after starting levophed, she experienced [**3-31**] chest pressure and experienced increased ectopy on telemetry.
There were no EKG changes.
Pt's chest pressure resolved, however she became tachy to 120's and remained hypotensive.
She was briefly back on the floor on [**7-6**] but was quickly returned to the ICU for persistent hypotension.
She then had episodes of bradycardia with HR in the 40s o/n that were asymptomatic.
To look for possible abscess around her fistula, the pt underwent a Abd/pelvic CT scan on [**7-9**] that did not show any evidence for abscess, but a DVT in her LLE was found incidentally.
Her Vancomycin was discontinued a few days later with the idea that she had completed a two-week course since her admission and there were no recent positive blood cultures to indicate its use.
Two days later she again became hypotensive and tachycardia on with no improvement after 2.5 L of fluid resuscitation.
Blood cultures taken during this episode of tachycardia and hypotension subsequently grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus and coag-positive staph, and sepsis vs. adrenal insufficiency were suspected to be the precipitation factor.
A TTE was performed on [**7-15**] to evaluate her for endocarditis in the setting of MRSA and VRE bacteremia but showed no evidence of valve vegetation.
She also consented to doppler ultrasound of her lower extremities at this time which revealed a partial thrombus in her left common femoral vein; the heparin gtt was continued.
In light of new sensitivities for enterococcus organism and drug rash suspected to be due to vancomycin, ID approved the initiation of daptomycin for staph areus and enterococcus coverage.
Flagyl was continued for coverage of enteric bacteria secondary to vesicular-colonic fistual and potential for urosepsis.
Once back on the regular floor on [**7-20**], her BP remained stable with intermittent periods of hypotension and tachycardia.
Surgery evaluated patient for repair of rectovaginal fistula but was not able to go intially due to concern about nutritional status, given low albumin level.
ID was consulted for underlying VRE and MRSA bacteremic sepsis as cause of her hypotension despite being on multiple broad-coverage antibiotics, including daptomycin, flagyl, and levoquin.
She is being transferred back to medicine for management of her bacteremia, cardiovascular and nutritional status.
Below is a list of her medical problems with management plan prior to discharge: .
# Bacteremia: hypotension, tachycardia Positive blood cultures from [**7-15**] have grown VRE/MRSA; suspected sepsis as cause of hypotensive episodes.
TTE on [**7-15**] showed no evidence of valve vegetation.
In light of new sensitivities for enterococcus organism and drug rash suspected to be due to vancomycin, placed on daptomycin for MRSA and VRE.
On flagyl for coverage of enteric bacteria secondary to vesicular-colonic fistual and potential for urosepsis.
She remained afebrile with normal WBC count.
Concerned remained high for endocarditis since patient had unchecked VRE in blood prior to surgery which may also be contributing to hypotension in setting of sepsis.
Her current antiobiotic course would provide coverage of VRE or MRSA as source of valvular vegetations.
- Close monitoring of BP, patient remained normotensive post-op - Antibiotic course: -- Levo/Flagyl x 2 weeks from surgery [**7-23**], on day 10 -- Dapto X 6 weeks after central line was taken out, on day 5 - Central line tip culture no growth to date .
# Crohn's colitis: Patient found to have fistula in distal portion of rectal wall.
Patient is POD #11 s/p ileostomy which has had adequate output, without obstruction and minimal drainage from fistula.
# DVT: Filling defect in left femoral vein found incidentally on CT pelvis.
Doppler u/s reveals partial non-occlusive thrombus in left common femoral vein.
Left upper extremity ultrasound to evaluate for clot was negative which decreased concern for HIT and checking heparin dependent antibody was not clinically indicated given normal platelet counts.
Patient was advised to keep left arm elevated on pillow and over the next couple of days, the swelling in left arm decreased considerably, suggesting it was due to venous stasis since she has limited range of motion in left arm compared to right.
# CAD, s/p recent MI at OSH : After reevaluating reports from outside hospital, it appears that patient sustained a small infoerolateral ischemic event, now with preserved EF documented on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and again on [**7-18**] TTE.
Patient had episoses of tachycardia in 130s [**1-24**] volume depletion,  remained hypotensive with increased HR despite fluid resuscitation.
Pt had adequate UOP lessening cocnern for volume overload.
BP stabilized after starting stress dose steroids prior to surgery and she has remained normotensive post-op.
- Continued on home meds ASA, lipitor discontinued due to elevated LFTs - Beta-blocker was continued throughout her hospitalization, and lisinopril was restarted on discharge .
# Adrenal insufficiency: [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.
It may have been contributing to her persistent hypotension with SBP in 90s before surgery.
She was placed on calcium and vitamin D therapies as corticosteroids can accelerate bone loss and decrease serum calcium levels.
# Bipolar d/o: Continue outpatient regimen of VPA and Risperdal.
# Stage 1 sacral decubitus ulcers: Should be treated daily by wound care .
Persistent anemia also a cause of tachycardia, as it may lead to high output cardiac failure.
Iron studies indicated anemia of chronic disease.
