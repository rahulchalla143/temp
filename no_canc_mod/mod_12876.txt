Admission Date:  [**2196-2-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-2-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-7-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Left upper abdominal pain and chest pain for 2 days.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 41447**] is a 79 year-old male with a past medical history significant for HTN and ruptured AAA status post AAA repair 6 years ago, transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with a concern over for possible type B aortic dissection.
He presented to the OSH on [**2196-2-13**] at night with a 2-day history of left upper abdominal pain, initially low-grade, then severe to 13/10 on the day of presentation, sharp, non-radiating.
He denies any associated N/V, no SOB, no worsening LH or dizziness (per patient, he experiences chronic LH and dizziness symptoms).
No back pain.
At the OSH, a CTPA was negative for PE, but revealed a ?
Past Medical History: History of ruptured AAA, status post AAA repair 6 years ago Hypertension Spinal stenosis, status post laminectomy C4-C5 Gastroesophageal reflux disease History of CVA  Social History: He admits to occasional EtOH.
Family History: Positive for CAD  Physical Exam: Physical examination on admission to CCU.
No carotid bruit.
Diffuse expiratory wheezes, no crackles.
No murmur or rub.
Abdomen soft and non-tender.
No pedal edema.
Relevant data in hospital:  [**2196-2-15**] CT CHEST W/IV CONTRAST: Diffuse emphysematous changes are noted throughout the lungs.
No lung mass is identified.
No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
No adenopathy.
Prostatic calcifications are seen.
Thoracic aorta is markedly tortuous.
There is thickening of the posterolateral aortic wall in the areas of penetrating ulcer, which are thickened to approximately 1 cm.
Unfortunately, since a noncontrast CT scan of the chest was not performed prior to contrast administration, acute hematoma vs. chronic thrombus cannot be distinguished.
No evidence of intimal flap within the thoracic aorta.
This may be related to relatively less contrast within the anterior abdominal aorta at the level of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] origin.
Synthetic graft material is seen within the distal aorta, extending into the origins of both common iliac arteries.
Shortly beyond the prosthetic graft limbs within the common iliac arteries, there is aneurysmal dilatation of the common iliac arteries.
The internal and external iliac arteries are patent, however, examination for subtle abnormalities within these vessels is limited due to relatively poor opacification of the distal abdominal aorta and iliac vessels.
No evidence of periaortic fluid or hematoma.
A small amount of wall thickening is seen within the distal abdominal aorta, suggestive of thrombus.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious bony lesions.
Degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic and lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: 1) Penetrating ulcers within the distal descending thoracic aorta.
Slight wall thickening within the distal thoracic aorta may represent chronic thrombus, however, acute hematoma is less likely.
No intimal flap identified.
2) Post surgical changes within the abdominal aorta, with large iliac artery aneurysms as described.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year-old male with a history of HTN and AAA rupture s/p AAA repair 6 years prior to admission, who presented to an OSH with c/o abdominal pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given concern for possible thoracic aortic dissection.
1) R/O aortic dissection: The OSH CT was reviewed on admission with the radiology resident, with a differential diagnosis of descending thoracic aortic dissection versus hematoma.
A repeat CTA was performed on [**2196-2-15**], which revealed penetrating ulcers within the distal descending thoracic aorta, with slight wall thickening felt to possibly represent a thrombus versus hematoma, but without evidence of dissection.
He remained pain free in the CCU, and was transitioned to oral medications with Metoprolol and Captopril, both titrated up to meet goal blood pressure parameters.
Long-term risk factor management was also addressed.
A CT chest revealed no infiltrate, but was significant for diffuse emphysematous changes.
