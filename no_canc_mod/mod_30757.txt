Brief Hospital Course: 49 yom with HCV, Seizure disorder [**2-4**] head trauma from MVA at age 12, EtOH dependance s/p seizures and DT's, hx of Pancreatitis, hx of Gastritis who presents s/p hematemesis this morning.
# Seizure:  Initially thought to be EtOH related, however EtOH level 225 on admission so EtOH seizure seems unlikely.
Patient had a recent fall 2 days PTA and had stitches in his left forehead.
Given seizure, a CT Head was done to r/o intrancranial bleed and was negative for any acute intracranial process.
Patient has a history of seizure disorder [**2-4**] head trauma and takes dilantin and phenobarbital for this condition.
Dilantin level was subtherapeutic on admission which seems to be the more likely cause of his seizure.
# Hematemesis:  Patient presented with complaint of several episodes of hematemesis the morning of and night prior to admission.
# HCV:  not on any medications currently  # Dispo: Patient has historically had poor compliance with follow-up as an outpatient.
Your dilantin level was low and we think that this contributed to you having a seizure.
The bleeding was probably caused by repetitive vomiting due to alcohol use.
If you have bloody bowel movements, vomit blood, feel light headed or dizzy, develop abdominal pain which does not go away, develop chest pain or shortness or breath, or with any other concerns, you should call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
