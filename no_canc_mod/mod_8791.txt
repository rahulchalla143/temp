Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2197-10-23**] Right below knee amputation Intubation and mechanical ventilation Placement of left radial arterial line Direct Current Cardioversion  History of Present Illness: 65M with multiple medical problems s/p L SFA to AT bypass on [**7-24**] that failed and thrombectomy of the graft at that time, which was also unsuccessful, requiring multiple toe amputations and most recently a left BKA now presenting from nursing home Academy Manor with worsening ischemia and non-healing wounds on the RLE.
Apparently he was being treated with Vancomycin 750 q36hrs for his wound infections, but that was most recently switched to Linezolid as wound cultures came back with Vanc resistent enterococcus, as well as Morganella Morganii sp and Klebsiella.

Patient reports frequent admissions for HF and dependence on lasix.
He has been chronically on oxygen, 2-3L for approximately 2 months, which has not been weaned secondary to frequent hospitalizations.

Images: [**2197-11-3**] R LE US - no abscess [**2197-10-27**] UE LENI- No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right arm.
[**2197-10-27**] CT HEAD - No intracranial hemorrhage or other acute intracranial abnormality.
[**2197-10-19**] R LE art ext (rest) study - There is significant outflow arterial insufficiency at the level of the distal popliteal or proximal tibial artery.
Bony margin, no diagnostic abnormality recognized.
EEG: ([**11-22**]): This is an abnormal video EEG study due to periodic generalized sharp and slow wave discharges with bifrontal predominance at 1-1.5 Hz frequency.
These findings are suggestive of cortical irritability and potential for epileptogenesis.
However, no electrographic seizures were seen during this recording.
Brief views of the background rhythm show a disorganized mixed theta/delta activity consistent with a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
No areas of focal slowing were seen in this recording although encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
([**11-17**]): This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
No electrographic seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
The background was very slow throughout the day's recording suggestive of a severe encephalopathy.
([**11-16**]):  This is an abnormal video EEG study because of initial continuous periodic epileptiform discharges at 1.5-2 Hz consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
After 7 p.m., there were no further definite electrographic seizures but periodic discharges occasionally recurred in brief runs at frequencies less than 1 Hz.
Interictal background activity showed severe diffuse slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies consistent with a severe diffuse encephalopathy  ([**11-13**]): This 24 hour video EEG telemetry demonstrated generalized and bifrontal, spike and sharp wave discharges that evolved into periods of sustained, rhythmic discharges, consistent with an underlying non-convulsive status epilepticus.
There were no apparent clinical manisfestations on video associated with the status epilepticus.
MRI Head: No acute intracranial abnormality present.
Pooled nasopharyngeal secretions and under-pneumatized mastoid air cells bilaterally.
His course has since been complicated by a. fib with RVR s/p DCCVx1, hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure on [**10-27**], prompting intubation and pressor support, as well as status epilepticus.
Post-operatively, in the PACU, the patient had hypotension 96/40, with minimal oozing from wound; the patient recieved fluids and was transfused packed red cells, eventually started on Neo drip, with stabilization of BP, and was transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 VICU with Neo drip.
He was also started Hydromorphone IV for breakthrough pain.
His Tmax was 101.0, and his R LE wound swab grew Pseduomonas.
TTE was obtained without new focal wall motion abnormality.
He triggered for ongoing oliguria and increasing somnolence.
He was placed on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ABG was drawn (7.05/81/43 @ 4AM); he was re-started on neo gtt, and then intubated for respiratory distress (no O2 sats in chart, time 04:46AM on [**10-27**]).
Course in MICU # Mental Status: Throughout the MICU course patient unresponsive thought to be secondary to anoxic brain injury.
Found to be in non convulsive Status epilepticus which eventually resolved with AED however no improvement in mental status.
MRI or LP without etiology for mental status changes.
Eventually patient made CMO given extremely poor medical prognosis and very little hope of meaningful improvement in mental status.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Although the details of the decompensation are unclear, the patient had a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission--he has no known history of COPD or OSA, but likely due to hypoventilation, and resultant respiratory acidosis, caused by the necrotizing myopathy.
His ABG (7.05/81/43) during the initial event was consistent with hypoventilation--likely contributors include myopathy (?
His CXR and exam were additionally consistent with volume overload, without frank evidence of pneumonia.
Although the pt was extubated on [**10-29**], he had to be re-intubated on [**11-1**] for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure (ABG 7.14/78/56/28).
Neurology consultation was obtained, who recommended a 5 day course of IVIG, as this had alleviated the patient's muscle weakness in the past and facilitated extubation.
# Hypotension - The patient had several episodes of hypotension while admitted, including post-operatively, in the setting of A.fib w. RVR, after diuresis, and while being treated with AEDs for status epilepticus (see below).
He had no evidence of frank sepsis (lactate 0.7 and stable, leukocytosis improved initially without antibiotics, LFTs WNL, afebrile), although his right LE showed erythema and warmth c/w cellulitis as well as purulent drainage from the surgical wound.
A wound culture grew Pseudomononas with sensitivities as noted above.
The pt's most prolonged period of hypotension occurred in the setting of AED titration (with Keppra, Dilantin, and Phenobarb).
He was also started on stress-dose steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr), given concern for hypoadrenalism [**12-19**] chronic steroid use.
During the weekend of [**11-15**], the pt was noted to have  myoclonic jerks of his extremities.
Given this, an EEG was obtained, which showed runs of rhythmic activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures (see report above).
CSF protein electrophoresis showed no oligoclonal banding.
However prior to permanent HD line placement the patient was made CMO given very poor prognosis and likely anoxic brain injury and unlikely return of meaningful mental status.
# Acute renal failure: The pt had rising Cr (peak 1.6 on [**11-11**]) and decreasing urine output over [**11-7**] to [**11-11**].
Urine lytes showed FeNa = 2, which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and also muddy brown casts in urine.
# PVD s/p R BKA, distant L BKA - His right LE wound cxr grew Pseudomonas ([**10-28**]), resistant to Meropenem, sensitive to Cefepime.
# Atrial fibrillation - After transfer to the MICU, his rate controlled with amiodarone 200mg Qd s/p amiodarone loading (IV loading, then 400mg x 7 days) and metoprolol 12.5mg TID.
# CAD - Continue aspirin, plavix.
# Systolic CHF: Held diuresis now given hypotension s/p diuresis with lasix on [**11-2**].
