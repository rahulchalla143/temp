Admission Date:  [**2103-6-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2103-6-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2034-3-18**]     Sex:  M  Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and renal cell carcinoma status post left nephrectomy, transferred from [**Hospital3 15174**] for further management of a right adrenal hemorrhage.
The patient was visiting his son in central [**State 350**] and developed the sudden onset of right flank pain on the morning of [**6-23**], with radiation to his epigastrium.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed a right adrenal hemorrhage.
The patient was noted to be in congestive heart failure with decreased oxygen saturation and edema on chest x-ray.
The congestive heart failure was presumed to be secondary to high volume blood products resuscitation.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2092**].
Obstructive sleep apnea not on C-PAP.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair in [**2090**], complicated by an abdominal wall hernia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Thoracic aortic aneurysm.
Low back pain.
Renal cell carcinoma status post left nephrectomy in [**2090**].
Atrial fibrillation with a history of transient ischemic attacks on Coumadin.
ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.
In general, he was an alert, mildly dyspneic gentleman in no acute distress.
His neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or any visible jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination:  He had a regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs.
On respiratory examination, he had diffuse expiratory wheezing bilaterally.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
His extremities were warm without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
He was noted to have non-specific T wave inversions laterally in V2 through V6, unchanged from the prior cardiogram [**2103-6-23**].
Chest x-ray revealed no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
He was noted to have findings consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as a questionable mediastinal widening secondary to a vascular structure.
He had a renal ultrasound which revealed a right kidney mildly enlarged but with normal echo texture.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair, and renal cell carcinoma status post left nephrectomy, who presents with a right adrenal hemorrhage in the setting of an INR of 2.3.
His hospital course up to this point has been notable for persistent malignant hypertension necessitating a Nipride drip and multiple oral agents.
Furthermore, he did not have any evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
One possibility on our differential was that the patient may have a tumor which resulted in the adrenal hemorrhage.
He subsequently had an MRI of his abdomen to evaluate for possible mass abutting the adrenal gland.
The MRI revealed a focal collection consistent with the previously noted hemorrhage.
At this time, we remain uncertain about the cause of his adrenal hemorrhage.
The patient tolerated this regimen well without any difficulties.
We performed an MRA of the patient's renal arteries in order to evaluate for potential secondary cause of malignant hypertension.
The patient was found to have a 70% renal artery stenosis on the right side.
However, given his recent hemorrhage, he is not currently a candidate for the anti-coagulation necessary for this procedure, therefore, we will control his blood pressure with oral agents and he will follow as an outpatient for further management of his renal artery stenosis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient was noted to be dyspneic with limited ambulation.
He tolerated the Prednisone quite well and had a marked improvement in his respiratory status.
Cardiovascular:  With regards to his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the patient was noted to be in sinus rhythm during his hospital stay.
Vascular:  during his stay, the patient was noted to have an asymmetric lower extremity edema, left greater than right.
He had a lower extremity ultrasound which revealed dilatation of the right common femoral artery to 2.4 cm with an atheromatous plaque within.
Right adrenal hemorrhage.
Right renal artery stenosis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair.
Thoracic aortic aneurysm.
