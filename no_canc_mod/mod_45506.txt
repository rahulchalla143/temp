She did have diarrhea for a few days following discontinuation of the antibiotics.
This raised the possibility of renal artery stenosis given the patient's underlying peripheral vascular disease.
Pulmonary - On chest x-ray the patient was noted to have findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
Because she was taking in so little free water, she developed hypernatremia with sodiums in the mid 150s.
The bedside evaluation showed significant oropharyngeal dysphagia with difficulty transporting and swallowing pureed food.
There was concern for probable aspiration with thin liquids.
A video swallow evaluation done on [**11-15**] disclosed severe oral and mild pharyngeal dysphagia with functional swallowing ability for nectar thick liquids and pureed foods.
If nutritional supplements are given the Nutrition Service suggests [**Last Name (un) 8395**] pudding since this liquid does not thicken well.
ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 consistent with an aneurysm.
There were anterior Q waves in V1 through V3 as well as left axis deviation and left atrial enlargement.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include septal and inferior lateral akinesis and apical akinesis, dyskinesis.
In addition a large neural left ventricular thrombus is present.
There is moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation.
There moderate to severe 3+ tricuspid regurgitation.
There was no pericardial effusion.
For the patient's congestive heart failure she was diuresed aggressively with 80 intravenous Lasix b.i.d.
Her hypertension has been managed with Lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
C.  Rhythm, the patient has a history of nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia.
D.  Anticoagulation, as noted above the patient was found to have a left ventricular mural thrombus.
Cardiology was consulted regarding management of the left ventricular thrombus and it was recommended that the patient be anticoagulated for life, her goal INR is 2 to 3.
Psyche - The patient was noted to be depressed and anxious during much of her hospital stay.
Pain control - The patient complains of headache and back pain.
Neurological - As mentioned above, the patient has complained of headaches.
Head computerized tomography scan was done on [**11-19**] and did not disclose evidence of intracranial bleeds.
The patient is Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate.
Hypertension 2.
Coronary artery disease, Status post myocardial infarction, catheterization in [**2147-9-19**] resulting in stenting of the left anterior descending and left circumflex.
Nonsustained supraventricular tachycardias, status post placement of implantable cardioverter defibrillator 5.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20% 6.
Left ventricular mural thrombus 7.  h/o esophageal stricture, status post dilatation in past 8.
Hypercholesterolemia 9.
Depression 10.
Cholecystitis  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Patient is anticoagulated with Coumadin due to left ventricular mural thrombus.
Ideally this would be 6 months post myocardial infarction.
