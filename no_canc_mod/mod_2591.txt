In [**Name (NI) **], pt received morphine 4mg with good relief of pain; however, she became hypotensive with BP down to 81/48 - up to 99/70 with fluid bolus.
FAST exam showed small pericardial effusion with good 4 chamber motion.
No evidence of tamponade physiology.
Mitral valve prolapse with severe mitral regurgitation - s/p MV repair and annuloplasty [**2150-6-1**] with 28 mm band - s/p secundum ASD closure on [**2150-6-1**] 2.
Mild pulmonary hypertension 3.
Hypertension 4. diverticulitis s/p sigmoid resection 5. s/p appy 6. anxiety / depression 7.
Father died of MI at age 50.
Physical Exam: VS: T 97.8, BP 103/68, HR 113, RR 27, O2 100% on 4L NC Gen: WDWN middle aged female in mild distress due to pain.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Chest: midline sternotomy site, appears well-healed, no paradoxical chest motion.
Resp: mild bibasilar crackles, no wheezes or rhonchi.
mild tachypnea with shallow breaths.
Abd: +BS, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.

2+ distal pulses Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is a moderate-sized new pericardial effusion.
There are also prominent superior mediastinal lymph nodes which were not present on previous study.
Infection in the region of the sternal decissence cannot be excluded.
No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection identified.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated relaxation atelectasis, more prominent on the left.
Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, slightly decreased on the left.
[**7-20**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is a small to moderate sized inferolateral pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo F s/p MVR, ASD closure [**6-1**] presenting with severe sharp substernal CP, SOB, and brief episode of light-headedness.
The patient had a CTA chest performed to rule out PE and dissection, notable for sternal dehiscence, moderate pericardial effusion and fat stranding with lymphadenopathy.
EKG with diffuse PR depressions and ST elevations.
Pt's presentation felt to be consistent with post-pericardiotomy syndrome.
On hospital day #2, the pt became febrile to a temperature of 101.2.
CXR showed atelectasis at the lung bases; CXR, UA and urine culture, and blood cultures were nonsuggestive of infection.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for the possibility of infection secondary to sternal dehiscence; however, the CT team felt that there was no clinical evidence to support this.
The patient was monitored on telemetry for the duration of the hospital stay with no significant events.
