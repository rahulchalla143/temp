Admission Date:  [**2101-2-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-2-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Nsaids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**] Chief Complaint: Syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Temporary pacer wire placement [**2101-2-20**] Permanent pacer placement [**2101-2-21**]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, with history of CHF (EF 50%), hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, SSS, HTN, and COPD, who presented to the ED s/p syncope.
The patient was being helped out of a chair in the morning of [**2-20**] when she became suddenly unresponsive, collapsed into the chair, and was noted to be cyanotic with protruding tongue and cold extremities.
She then had a second episode requiring sustained transcutaneous pacing, at which time the EP fellow was called for temporary pacer placement (patient still DNR/DNI but wanted a pacer).
Past Medical History: CHF (EF 50%) hypothyroidism atrial fibrillation SSS HTN COPD  Social History: [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident.
Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: VS:  98.9, 90, 140/83, RR 22, 96% on 4L Gen: Obese caucasian female, sedated HEENT: Surgical pupils, dry MM Neck: No JVD Lungs: CTA anteriorly CVS: RR, normal rate, no m/r/g Abd: NABS, soft, obese Extr: Moving all extremities, 1+ bipedal edema.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or lobar consolidation.
Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulders.
Echo [**2093-6-4**]:  LAE, LVH, mildly decreased LV, RV function, Mild AI, moderate MR, mild PA HTN.
CXR [**2-21**]:  A right internal jugular temporary pacing lead has been placed with the distal tip extending into the right ventricle.
This has a slightly more inferior position than the previous temporary pacing lead.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The lungs demonstrate very minimal patchy atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region and are otherwise clear.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
CXR [**2-22**]:  Interval replacement of right internal jugular pacer with left-sided permanent pacer.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of atrial fibrillation, SSS, CHF with EF 50%, HTN, COPD, who presented s/p syncope, with sinus arrest in ED.
1) SSS: Ms. [**Known lastname **] asystolic episode in the ED is likely also what caused her syncope earlier in the day, and likely secondary to her sick sinus.
She was transferred out of the CCU the following night, and subsequently spent one night on the floor without any hemodynamic instability.
The pacer intermittently paces, and on tele she frequently had premature atrial contractions with subsequent pauses, prompting the pacer to fire once or twice.
She had one episode of dizziness on the night before discharge at which time her blood pressure and heart rate were normal, and no events were recorded on telemetry.
Her coumadin was held during the admission for the procedures, and has been restarted on the day of discharge at 5 mg.  She will need frequent INR checks until her coumadin becomes therapeutic.
She also had some superficial abrasions just adjacent to the site of her pacer, and has therefore been started on a 10 day course of PO Keflex, of which she has 8 days left.
2) CHF:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] received 2 L NS during her ED course, initially for presumed dehydration causing syncope, and also for mild hypotension during the placement of the temporary pacer wire.
3) CAD:  No known hx of CAD, but EKG with QS in inferior leads as well as V1-V4 suggestive of old MIs (without true LBBB).
She has an ASA allergy, and it was not felt that her predicted life span warranted starting any new medications.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Syncope Sick sinus syndrome Asystole  Secondary: Atrial fibrillation Congestive heart failure Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Hypothyroidism Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good, stable.
