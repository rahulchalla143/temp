Patient reports she has been feeling ill for the past 2-3 days, however today became quite nauseous and vomiting 4 times, and had 4 episodes of profuse watery diarrhea.
A chest x-ray was done without evidence of pneumonia.

Of note, On [**10-20**], she left low extremity cellulitis, which she underwent Clindamycin 300 mg capsule q.i.d.
On [**11-16**], Lifewatch transmission around 1 am revealed atrial fibrillation with HRs in 70s-150s as well as monomorphic NSVT at rates of 130-150 up to 5 beats.
Patient notes awakening from sleep with symptoms of palpitations (fast, irregular heartbeat) but denied any chest pain, SOB, LH, dizziness, or other symptoms.
She had no had any symptoms of AF since [**7-/2117**] when she was admitted to the hospital for dehydration.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - Persistent atrial fibrillation, initially treated with disopyramide and subsequently with amiodarone, atenolol, and dofetilide all unsuccessful in restoring or maintaining sinus rhythm.
- Atypical atrial flutter developed after PVI status post successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in 10/[**2115**].
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, last MRI in [**2115**] showed hypertrophy confined to the distal third and true apex portions of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction greater than 70%.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Liver transplant [**2095**], [**1-20**] primary biliary cirrhosis (vs. atresia-- records contradict) Thyroid colloid cyst Stable Lung nodules Rosacea Retroperitoneal adenopathy Skin cancer Raynaud's syndrome Cellulitis of thumb and left lower extremity Keratosis on Left LE which has tract Hernia repair Portal shunt C-section   Social History: distant smoker; denies ETOH and IVDU; married with two sons; elementary school social worker  Family History: No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 7 cm, no carotid bruits appreciated CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
II/VI systolic murmur heard loudest at the axilla.
No thrills, lifts.
CTAB, mild crackles at basis.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits appreciated.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e; no femoral bruits on either side.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ PT by doppler Left: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ PT by doppler  Discharge exam: Unchanged from above except as below: GENERAL: A&Ox3, awake, NAD  Pertinent Results: Admission labs: [**2117-11-18**] 01:30AM BLOOD WBC-6.5 RBC-4.76 Hgb-14.5 Hct-44.2 MCV-93 MCH-30.4 MCHC-32.8 RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-88* [**2117-11-18**] 01:30AM BLOOD Neuts-89.1* Bands-0 Lymphs-8.4* Monos-2.0 Eos-0.2 Baso-0.3 [**2117-11-18**] 05:18AM BLOOD PT-37.1* PTT-44.4* INR(PT)-3.6* [**2117-11-18**] 01:30AM BLOOD Glucose-126* UreaN-19 Creat-0.7 Na-142 K-3.1* Cl-115* HCO3-19* AnGap-11 [**2117-11-18**] 05:18AM BLOOD ALT-19 AST-26 CK(CPK)-81 AlkPhos-70 TotBili-0.7 [**2117-11-18**] 01:30AM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01 proBNP-431* [**2117-11-18**] 05:18AM BLOOD CK-MB-3 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2117-11-18**] 01:30AM BLOOD Calcium-6.5* Phos-1.3*# Mg-1.1*  Imaging: -CXR ([**2117-11-18**]) - Moderate pulmonary edema, new from [**2116-9-21**] exam.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is isolated apical left ventricular hypertrophy as well ([**Last Name (un) 51827**] variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she went into Afib with RVR which was controlled with dilt and BB  #Atrial fibrillation - Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED at transfer, she was found to be in AFib with RVR.
The 4-5 liters of fluid she received prior to admission likely contributed to her AF due to atrial stretch.
This was thought to be caused by her tachyarrhythmia while she was in AF with RVR.
There was also initially concern for sepsis from a GI source given that she was complaining of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Finally, we also considered adrenal insufficiency in the setting of gastroenteritis as a potential cause given that she is on chronic prednisone.
#Diarrhea - She was thought to have a gastroenteritis with concern for sepsis, as mentioned above.
She continued to have diarrhea during admission and was mildly guaiac positive with no gross blood in stool.
This suggests a hemorrhagic GI infection such as Yersinia, Salmonella, of EHEC.
#Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - Pt has known diagnosis of HCM.
#S/p liver transplant - LFTs were at baseline and she did not have any RUQ pain at admission.
She was continued on her home doses of tacro/cellcept and was given stress dose steroids with a prednisone taper at discharge.
#Hypertension - She was hypotensive at admission and her home BP meds were held.
She may also be thrombocytopenic because of her liver transplant.
She had no evidence of bleeding during admission.
#Pump/coronaries - No history of CAD and she did not have any chest pain at presentation.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 101707**],  It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for low blood pressure and rapid heart rate.
You were in atrial fibrillation with a fast heart rate when you arrived.
Please make sure you are drinking enough liquid if you continue to have diarrhea after leaving the hospital.
