[**Age over 90 **]M anesthesiologist h/o CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 45%), pAF s/p pacemaker for tachy-brady syndrome, AS and MR, CRI, esophageal stricture s/p PEG, and recent PNA c/b C diff, transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] with abdominal pain [**1-9**] known CDiff colitis.
Three weeks prior to admission, pt had been diagnosed with PNA and treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate at OSH, after which he developed C. diff colitis, for which he was treated with vancomycin/metronidazole and then transferred to rehab.
Three days prior to admission, pt developed T 103.9, vomiting and was admitted to OSH, where CXR showed RLL PNA (recurrent vs persistent) with positive C. diff toxin.
Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] underwent a CT scan chest/abd/pelvis w/o contrast today which showed new ascites, cholelithiasis, B renal cysts, subcutaneous edema, an IM lipoma, and no obvious source of abdominal pain.
Of note, pt had been transfused 2 units PRBC given decreased hematocrit of 27 from baseline 32, in the setting of chronically guaiac-positive stools.
ROS: Positive for intermittent [**9-16**] abdominal pain.

# CHEST PORT.
LINE PLACEMENT  [**2139-8-1**] 3:20 PM The patient is status post sternotomy, with moderately severe cardiomegaly and a calcified aorta.
The hila appear prominent, suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
There is a focal opacity adjacent to the left hilum, of uncertain etiology or significance.
There is patchy opacity diffusely throughout the right lung -- at least some of this is thought to represent CHF, with superimposed more consolidative process.
There are bilateral right greater than left effusions.
No pneumothorax is detected.
There is probably fluid in the minor fissure, accounting for some of the opacity seen in the right lung.
A rounded loop linear density is seen adjacent to the right main stem bronchus.
No pneumothorax.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
# LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2139-8-1**] 8:55 AM RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: There are multiple layering gallstones.
The gallbladder is not distended and there is no wall edema or pericholecystic fluid.
The liver demonstrates no echotextural or focal abnormalities.
There are multiple cysts in the right kidney, the largest within the lower pole measuring 3.4 x 3.2 x 3.7 cm with a single thin septation.
There is a moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion and trace perihepatic ascites.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Moderate right-sided pleural effusion.
3.7-cm renal cyst with single septation.
# CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST, CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST [**2139-8-1**] 1:13 AM CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no axillary adenopathy.
Examination of soft tissue windows also demonstrates marked vascular calcifications involving the aortic arch as well as the descending thoracic aorta.
Impressive coronary artery calcifications are also present.
A moderate-large right-sided pleural effusion is present, as well as a small left-sided pleural effusion with some fluid loculated within the major fissure.
However, in conjunction with compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe, there are also some regions of air bronchograms, and narrowing of the more distal bronchi, suggesting superimposed infection/consolidation within these regions.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
Coarse calcifications are also seen within the spleen, consistent with granulomata.
Marked vascular calcifications of the splenic artery as well as the abdominal aorta are appreciated, without aneurysmal aortic change.
Multiple low-density lesions are seen arising from both kidneys, many of which have attenuation characteristics consistent with simple cysts, but others which are too small to accurately characterize.
It is unclear whether several punctate calcifications seen within the kidneys represent vascular calcifications or calcifications within the collecting systems.
Right adrenal gland appears unremarkable.
No abdominal adenopathy is appreciated.
No pelvic adenopathy or free fluid is appreciated.
Examination of osseous structures does not show lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy.
Old right-sided posterior T9 rib fracture is seen.
Diffuse subcutaneous edema is present throughout the entire body.
Coronally and sagittally reformatted images support these findings.
Large right-sided pleural effusion, with a combination of atelectasis and consolidation involving the right lower lobe.
Small left-sided pleural effusion, with loculated component within the major fissure.
Small amount of abdominal free fluid is present.

Adjacent consolidations are present, and may represent atelectasis versus infiltrates.
Again noted are coarse calcifications in the spleen.
Extensive vascular calcifications are present.
There is no small bowel loop dilation.
Contrast is seen in the loops of small and large bowel.
There is small amount of free fluid in the abdomen.

BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Diffuse edema is again present in the soft tissues.
No definite evidence of bowel pathology in this limited non-IV contrast enhanced study.
Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis; underlying infection is a possibility.
Cardiomegaly and extensive coronary and other arterial atherosclerosis.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-8-5**] 12:19 AM FINDINGS: Comparison to [**2139-8-4**] at 3:24 p.m.
There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.
There is opacification of the right lower lung, essentially unchanged compared to the previous exam, with pleural fluid tracking along the fissure and seen at the right lung base.
Underlying opacity of the lung reflects atelectasis and/or consolidation.
Trace atherosclerotic vascular calcification is seen.
No evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
Persistent opacification of the right lung compatible with a large right- sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis and/or consolidation.
Patchy retrocardiac opacity is slightly worse compared to the previous study and reflects underlying atelectasis and/or consolidation.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2139-8-6**] 1:44 PM PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 1:30 P.M.: There is no interval change from prior exams, after accounting for change in patient positioning.

# Abdominal pain: Pt's abdominal pain was considered likely secondary to C. diff colitis, given postive stool cultures and recent treatment with antibiotics, although CT abdomen and pelvis did not show evidence of overt bowel pathology.
DDx also included possible mesenteric ischemia given known low EF, but lactate levels were within normal limits.
Pt was initially given hydromorphone PCA without a basal rate, which was inadequate for pain control.
# ARF: Pt developed acute-on-chronic renal failure, given recent Cr baseline ~1.6.
Furosemide was held and pt initially was aggressively hydrated with NS boluses and a basal rate, with some improvement of Cr but no improvement of urine output.
Urine lytes demonstrated prerenal etiology, renal ultrasound demonstrated poor diastolic flow in bilateral renal arteries.
Echo demonstrated end-stage heart failure with significant mitral regurgitation, [**Name (NI) **] regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and L ventricular hypomobility, likely a significant factor in his low urine output.
# UTI: Pt's repeat urine culture was positive for yeast, and pt was started on fluconazole for treatment, until he was made [**Name (NI) 3225**], after which it was removed.
# R pleural effusion: Pt maintained O2sats in the mid-90s on 2L O2.
As pt had completed 14-day course of piperacillin-tazobactam, and was afebrile throughout this admission, pt's initial recurrent pneumonia was considered likely inactive.
# Esophageal stricture s/p PEG placement:  Pt was given meds through his PEG, although tube feeds were held for bowel rest.
# Paroxismal atrial fibrillation: Pt was monitored on telemetry given his h/o pacemaker placement for tachy-brady syndrome, until he was made [**Name (NI) 3225**], after which it was removed.
# Ischemic heart disease s/p CABG '[**18**]: Pt was continued on home regimen of carvedilol, until he was made [**Year (2 digits) 3225**], after which it was removed.
# Aortic stenosis: Echo demonstrated end-stage heart failure, with significant MR, TR, and AS, as well as LV hypomobility.
