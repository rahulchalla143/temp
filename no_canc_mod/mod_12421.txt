Of note, he had been discharged approximately 12 hours before from [**Hospital 487**] Hospital, where he had a 30 day admission for CHF exacerbation.
She reports that he was experiencing sever SOB and DOE, and that he was barely able to walk the length of the hallway without becoming SOB.
Exam showed bibasilar crackles, LE edema to knees and edema in arms.
Admitted to CCU for CHF exacerbation.
Per daughter, patient has not had chest pain.
He has dyspnea on exertion as well as orthopnea and ankle edema.
No syncope or presyncope Has no history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.
No recent fevers, chills, rigors, or sick contacts.
Past Medical History: hypertension hyperlipidemia CAD s/p CABG in [**2167**] ICD placement [**2179**] [**2-18**] VF arrest CHF (EF 20-30% on this admission) h/o of chronic A-fib on Coumadin h/o Colon ca with remote surgery and uptodate colon-ca screening Depression/anxiety/ mild dementia h/o of RBBB  Social History: Lives in Sunrise Senior [**Hospital3 400**] in [**Location (un) 16848**].
Family History: There is a + family history of premature coronary artery disease: brother died of MI at 38, dad died when pt was 17 (?
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Intermittent s3 with 3/6 holosystolic murmur at LLSB, soft diastolic murmur at LLSB, Distant heart sounds.
No rv heave Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
CHF with bilateral pleural effusions, worse than on [**2179-4-3**].
Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, pulmonary consolidation or combination of both.
[**2180-10-19**] EKG 7PM: Ventricular paced rhythm with wide QRS complexes.
Compared to the prior tracing of [**2179-5-19**] there is a marked diminution in QRS voltage.
10PM: Atrial fibrillation and increase in rate.
[**2180-10-20**] ECHO The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the interventricular septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Bilateral rectus sheath hematomas.
Small focal dissection of the infrarenal aorta.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, trace ascites.
Diffuse calcified granulomata involving the visualized aspects of the lungs.
Diffuse edema and venous distention consistent with the provided history of CHF.
CHF - Presented in decompensated heart failure with hypotension and respiratory distress.
His home CHF reg of carvedilol and lisinopril were held given his hypotension and ARF on presentation.
His repsiratory status improved throughout his stay and he was in compensated heart failure at the time of discharge.
# Rhythm - Has a ventricularly paced rhythm with paroxysmal a-fib.
In the ED here, the ICD reportedly fired again, but EP interrogation of the pacer revealed no VT/VF or discharges.
There were no episodes of VT during this hospitalization.
Of note, he was found to have bilateral rectus sheath hematomas on evalutation for palpable suprapubic mass, and for this reason anticoagulation was held during his stay.
Persistent Hypotension - Patient presented to ED hypotensive and was started on doapmine drip.
The most likely etiology for his hypotension was cardiogenic shock.
CAD - gave medical secondary prevention with ASA, statin, but initially held BB and ACE in setting of hypotension and renal failure.
Small troponin leak most consistent with CHF exacerbation.
EKGs with no obvious ischemia.
# Renal insufficiency - unclear baseline, diuresed to small creatinine bump (Cr 1.7).
# Dementia - continued aricept 5mg daily.
# Depression/Anxiety: appeared depressed and irritable throughout stay.
Coumadin should be restarted on resolution of rectus sheath hematoma.
Low NA+ cardiac diet!
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for itchiness.
Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for pruritis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 14468**] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Congestive Heart Failure .
Secondary: Coronary Artery Disease atrial fibrillation chronic renal insufficiency dementia  Discharge Condition: improved, normotensive, no respiratory distess   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted ot the hospital with an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure.
We gave you diuretics ("water pills") to remove the excess fluid that was causing your shortness of breath.
While you were here we also did a CT scan of your abdomen since we felt a mass there.
It turns out that the mass was a hematoma (bleed) in the wall of an abdominal muscle.
You have a heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, which puts you at an increased risk for having a stroke.
To prevent strokes, most patients with atrial fibrilliation take a blood thinning medicine called coumadin.
If you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain please call your doctor or go to the ER.
