Admission Date:  [**2136-7-31**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2069-7-20**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted on [**2136-7-31**] with a chief complaint of confusion.
The patient is a 66 year old female with a history of Lithium toxicity who presented with increasing confusion, lethargy and dehydration for the last five days.
The patient claims that on the day of admission she fell out of bed with increased confusion.
The patient had an episode of increased Lithium toxicity in [**2135-7-12**] with similar complaints.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history includes depression, hypothyroidism and chronic renal insufficiency.
Lithium  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol, no drug use, had a 30 pack year smoking and had no children.
Neck was supple, no lymphadenopathy was felt.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Skin had no evidence of any rashes.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram on admission had bradycardia with 46 rate per minute, old right bundle branch block compared with an electrocardiogram of [**2136-8-10**] which was the same.
Urinalysis had a trace protein and otherwise negative.
The night the patient was admitted the patient began developing some electrocardiogram changes including progression of loss of P waves near the right bundle branch block over serial electrocardiograms.
The patient then developed severe swelling of her vocal cords.
The patient had her ionized calcium monitored that went from 2.08 down to 1.65 on [**8-1**].
Cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain had no polys seen, no organisms.
Chest x-ray at that time also with elevated right hemidiaphragm.
Left ventricular function was 55%, ascending aorta was mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened, no aortic regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Precordium had a fat pad versus small effusion of question.
The patient remained somewhat hypotensive in the unit with heartrates in the bradycardiac range of 30s to 50s.
The patient had hypotensive episodes, was febrile and was with infiltrates versus effusion on chest x-ray with chronic renal insufficiency.
Endocrinology was consulted due to the patient's increased hypercalcemia as well as the patient's hypothyroidism.
It was felt that the increased calcium was probably due to the Lithium toxicity as well as the hypothyroidism.
The patient had multiple blood cultures which none ever having grown any organisms.
No stressor or any evidence of any infection was ever found.
The patient remained intubated in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit due to what they thought was pneumonia or sepsis like syndrome and hypertension and decreased respirations.
The patient was being transferred to the Medicine Service for further evaluation of her psychological issues which she developed while she was in the Intensive Care Unit, monitoring of her calcium and thyroid status and correction of hypernatremia with continuing monitoring of her blood pressure which had been stabilized.
Her pneumonia had resolved and no treatment was needed at that time.
From a Psychiatry standpoint, we obtained RPR which came back negative, and B12 and Folate were within normal limits.
An magnetic resonance imaging scan of her head was obtained which also was negative for any acute events or acute ischemia.
On [**2136-8-17**], it was noted on examination that she had some proximal weakness of her right upper extremity with 2/5 strength in the right upper extremity, abduction.
This was later attributed to brachyopathy secondary to just having her longstanding stay in the Intensive Care Unit.
Given her persistent low level hypernatremia, we obtained a urine osmolality on [**2136-8-16**] which revealed a urine osmolality of 176 and a urine sodium of 44.
Given her long history of Lithium use we attributed her hypernatremia thus to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus secondary to Lithium use.
On [**2136-8-20**] at approximately 7:45 AM the patient had a witnessed tonoclonic generalized seizure which lasted 2 to 3 minutes.
The patient never recovered to her pre-seizure mental status following the event.
Approximately one hour later she suffered another generalized tonoclonic seizure witnessed by the house officer and nursing staff.
The patient had a Foley catheter and the patient was afebrile at the time.
She was found to be confused and restless postictally and with only partial recovery of her mental status over the following hours.
Then there were no further events or seizure activity.
The etiology of her seizures was attempted to be found, however, all cultures were negative.
Chest x-ray was negative and given her old cerebrospinal fluid cultures being negative and a negative magnetic resonance imaging scan of her head several days prior to the event there was no clear etiology upon further workup.
But, given the fact that she had no recurrence of seizures and her electrolytes were stable at the time, it was concluded that it would be safe to discontinue any antiseizure medications.
Vital signs were stable and there were was no recurrence of seizure activity.
Her temperatures remained afebrile as well as her blood pressures remained relatively well at 130/80.
Urine osmolality and urine sodium continued to show the patient had some evidence of some nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
The patient was stable upon discharge with no further electrolyte abnormalities other than her mild hypothyroidism as well as her hypernatremia.
Albuterol/Atrovent metered dose inhaler, 2 puffs inhaled every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath 8.
Sepsis-like syndrome which needed some intubation 2.
Status post hypotension 3.
Respiratory distress 4.
Hypercalcemia which eventually was treated successfully which resulted in hypocalcemia which was then treated and calcium levels eucalcemic on discharge.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, probably secondary to her Lithium toxicity.
Chronic renal insufficiency 8.
New onset seizures which were initially treated with intravenous-loaded Dilantin, however, did not occur after the patient was stopped on that medication 9.
Hypothyroidism which was treated with Synthroid  FOLLOW UP CARE:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for further evaluation and workup.
