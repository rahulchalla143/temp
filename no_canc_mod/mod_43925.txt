There was also significant degree of bandemia on CBC.
He was also started on Flagyl for empiric coverage of C. diff.
The patient was noted to have mildly elevated but stable Troponins likely secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension/sepsis and CHF.
He also had evevated Lactate levels secondary to sepsis.
Due to worsening hypotension, aggressive resusitation with IVF was started, while watching closely for signs of pulmonary edema given severe AS and CHF.
CVP remained 0-1 cm H2O despite agressive fluid resuscitation, suggesting a profound vascular leak.
