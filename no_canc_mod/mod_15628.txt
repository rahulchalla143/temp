ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Motor vehicle collision with severe head injury.
She had a hypotensive episode of a systolic blood pressure down to 80 requiring four liters of Crystalloid and one unit of packed red blood cells.
A computer tomography scan of the head was performed at the outside hospital which demonstrated pneumocephalus with intracranial hemorrhage and occipital condyle fracture.
A computer tomography scan of the chest was also performed which showed no evidence of mediastinal pathology or pneumothorax.
A computer tomography scan of the pelvis had a small amount of left perinephric fluid collection and question of a small area of free air at the dome of the liver without evidence of splenic or hepatic injury.
ALLERGIES:   She had no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS:  She took no medications.
She had a scalp laceration; no facial lacerations.
Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence of crepitants.
Her abdomen was soft and obese.
Her arterial blood gas upon arrival demonstrated a pH of 7.35, pCO2 of 34, pO2 of 108, bicarbonate of 20 and a base excess of minus five.
A CT scan of her head was obtained after a ventriculostomy drain had been placed and that demonstrated the following: Acute thalamic parenchymal hemorrhage on the right with mass effect and a leftward trans-falcine herniation as well as diffuse areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage in multiple sulci of both cerebral hemispheres and along the tentorium.
There were also focal punctate areas of hemorrhage at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter interfaces, likely from diffuse axonal shear injury.
There was diffuse sulcal effacement.
There was a right occipital condyle fracture with multiple sphenoid fractures present from the base of the skull through the cella turcica.
There were bilateral temporal bone fractures through the mastoid air cells.
She had a DPL also performed in the Trauma Bay to rule out hollow viscus injury secondary to blunt force trauma.
At this point, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with the diagnosis of a motor vehicle collision with severe closed head injury.
She was admitted for intracranial pressure monitoring with ventriculostomy and treatment of this intracranial hypertension with Mannitol and sedation to maximize her cerebral perfusion pressure and minimize her ICP.
A pulmonary artery catheter was to be placed if close monitoring of her volume status would be required.
Given the fact that she had potential pulmonary contusions and a lung injury, she was to be kept with plateau pressures less than 30 on light protective ventilation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Prior to transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a CT scan of the cervical spine which demonstrated a fracture through the right transverse process, inferior facet and right lamina of C7 with extensive skull base fractures.
She was also started on Sucralfate for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
Given her posturing and ventriculostomy drainage, she was continued on Mannitol until her sodium was greater than 150 or her osmolarity was greater than 320.
She was continued on Mannitol and she was also started on Norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure such that her cerebral perfusion pressures would be greater than 70 in the face of elevated intracranial pressures.
The patient was continued on mechanical ventilation and was also started on vasopressin because she developed central diabetes insipidus with large amounts of extremely hyperosmolar urine.
She was begun on total parenteral nutrition for nutritional support.
She was continued on the Pentobarb coma for 24 hours but because her intracranial pressures remained elevated up to 40 to 50 despite burst suppression and a pentobarbital coma and continued therapy with Mannitol as well as vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressures, the pentobarbital was stopped.
The patient was, at this point, started on Zosyn as well because she developed fevers overnight with sputums that were growing Gram positive cocci and a concern for a pneumonia in the setting of pentobarbital coma.
She was continued on the vasopressin for her central diabetes insipidus and by SICU day number ten, an attempt was made to turn off the vasopressin with return of large amounts of urine, approximately 400 cc.
in 20 minutes, hence, reinstitution of her vasopressin for persistent central diabetes insipidus.
At this time, she had thoracic and lumbar spine films which demonstrated no evidence of fracture or dislocation of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
The patient was begun on tube feeds on SICU day number eleven and underwent a four vessel angiogram on SICU day number eleven to evaluate for cervical blood vessel injury from her trauma.
She was found to have a right internal carotid small dissection as well as a small right vertebral artery injury.
At this point, an MRI of her brain was obtained and the MRI demonstrated a moderate sized right thalamic hemorrhage with minimal mass effect and leftward shift of the normal midline structures, multiple bilateral tiny foci of susceptibility artifacts that suggest multiple small shear injuries and slight increased T2 signal within the pons of unclear etiology with flow present in all the major branches of the cerebral circulation.
The patient was fairly stable at this point without any progression or deterioration of her neurological examination.
These were without complication.
The patient subsequently was noted to be growing E. coli and methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus from her sputum and was started on antibiotics for this.
She tolerated this well and was doing fine until SICU day number 19, when she became tachycardic and moderately hypotensive and was pan cultured again for a fever and found to be growing Gram negative rods in her blood, for which she was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Her pupils are equal, round and reactive, going from 3 to 2 millimeters and she has weak withdrawal in both legs bilaterally as well as localization to noxious stimulus with her left extremity.
She is on a trache collar with coarse breath sounds.
She has a regular rate and rhythm; her abdomen is soft, nontender and nondistended.
From a Neurological standpoint, she is with a severe closed head injury.
She is stable from a cardiovascular standpoint requiring no pressors or any hemodynamic support.
From a genitourinary standpoint she is requiring subcutaneous desmopressins, 2 micrograms q. eight hours for her central diabetes insipidus.
She is also on aspirin for her carotid artery injury with microembolization.
Motor vehicle collision status post severe closed head injury.
Central diabetes insipidus.
Right internal carotid artery injury.
Right vertebral artery injury.
She will have to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Trauma Surgery.
