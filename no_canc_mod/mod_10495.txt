HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2134-4-26**], for angioplasty and stenting of the right coronary artery which was unsuccessful.
During that admission her course was complicated by a retroperitoneal bleed for which she underwent an emergent left femoral endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after an iliac stent was placed for acute leg ischemia followed by a large left retroperitoneal hematoma.
The patient was advised following cardiac catheterization that her significant coronary artery disease was not amenable to angioplasty and she was advised to have coronary bypass.
She was also known at that time to have left carotid stenosis of 80-99% with no symptoms of transient ischemia or stroke.
General:  A pleasant woman in no acute distress.
No murmurs or rubs.
No masses, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities with no edema.
Positive dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Well-healed scar of the left groin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, asthma, dyspepsia, arthritis, emphysema, carotid stenosis on the left 80-99% and on the right 30-80%.
Cardiac catheterization on [**4-24**] showed severe three vessel disease with an ejection fraction of 55%.
Incision with Steri-Strips.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema bilaterally.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting times two with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty stent of ramus.
Carotid disease status post right carotid endarterectomy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Diabetes mellitus.
