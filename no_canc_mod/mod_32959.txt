She was being worked up for chronic nausea, vomitting, and epigastric pain, for which she had a RUQ U/S on [**1-18**] which showed sludge in the gallbladder and a prominent pancreatic duct with a possible stricture in the head of the pancreas, and dilation of the common bile duct.
The ERCP showed a dilated common bile duct, ductal ectasia and evidence of mild chronic pancreatitis.
Unfortunately post procedure the patient developed acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Labs revealed an acute pancreatitis with [**Doctor First Name **]/lip of 2100/1500, respectively.
A CT scan revealed non-enhancement of the body and tail of the pancreas, consistent with necrosis.
She was treated with antibiotics, aggressive IVF, and a dilaudid PCA, but developed an O2 requirement, mild ARF, and a significant leukocytosis, though she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
+ long term hx of tobacco (but quit 3 years ago), rare EtOH, no illicits.
Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: Upon discharge Alert, Oriented, but quiet, NAD 98.7   94  140/80  97% RA EOMi, anicteric, no JVD CVL L chest RRR no m/r/g CTAB soft NT/ND + BS no c/c/e Neuro grossly intact  Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**3-9**] CT abd (on PACS from OSH); nonenhancing body/tail of pancreas, significant inflammation of pancreas, no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, small spleen, ?dilation pnacr duct, ?nonobstructive spenic vein thrombosis and moderate ascites.
[**3-9**] MRI abd OSH: [**3-14**] CT Abd/Pelvis: B/L pleural effusions,  Necrotizing pancreatitis involving greater than 50% of the pancreas.
Only the pancreatic head and a small amount of the pancreatic tail enhance normally, associated extensive peripancreatic fluid, without defined collection or gas.
Increased size of collateral vessels indicates compromised splenic vein flow., Bowel wall thickening of the sigmoid colon.
[**3-24**] RUE U/S no DVT [**3-25**] CT abd/pelvis: Persistent findings of severe necrotizing pancreatitis, with normal enhancement seen involving only a portion of the pancreatic head and tail, and interval development of peripheral enhancement of a large pancreatic bed fluid collection, which may represent abscess.
Persistent moderate left pleural effusion.
Decreased small right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: OPERATIONS DURING ADMISSION None  CONSULTATIONS DURING ADMISSION General Surgery MICU  PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES Severe, Necrotizing Post-ERCP Pancreatitis ARDS Acute Renal Failure Pancreatic pseudocyst formation (likely) Delerium in the setting of severe illness  BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE ***Please note that the patient was under the care of the MICU team (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with consultation from general surgery from [**2179-3-10**] - [**3-22**].
I am summarizing the entirety of her hospital course but she was directly under my care only from [**3-22**] - [**3-30**]***  [**3-10**] The hepato-biliary team was consulted by MICU team for help with management of severe necrotizing pancreatitis; the patient had been admitted from an OSH tfollowing ERCP with development of severe abdominal pain and shock.
CT and MRI at the OSH revealed a nonenhancing body/tail of pancreas consistent with > 50% necrosis, significant inflammation of pancreas, no intrahepatbiliary ductal dilatation, and a small spleen.
She underwent extensive fluid resucsitation with normal saline, and subsequently the patient developed hyperchloremic hypernatremic metabolic acidosis that resolved as below.
She was also intubated in the setting of respiratory distress in the setting of fluid resuscitation and her underlying severe necrotizing pancreatitis.
Diuresis was initiated as her blood pressure stabilized and her fluid requirements decreased.
Her antibiotics were discontinued given the lack of evidence for infected necrotizing pancreatitis.
Indeed, she did remain with a fever and leukocytosis to a height of 39, but this was attributed to pancreatic necrosis as her hemodynamics remained stable.
[**3-14**] She eventually did get the CT scan, which revealed B/L pleural effusions,  necrotizing pancreatitis involving greater than 50% of the pancreas.
Only the pancreatic head and a small amount of the pancreatic tail enhance normally, associated extensive peripancreatic fluid, without defined collection or gas.
Increased size of collateral vessels indicates compromised splenic vein flow., Bowel wall thickening of the sigmoid colon - all expected findings.
[**3-16**] The patient was weaned off sedation but, remained with a very poor mental status - initially quite unresponsive even off sedation as time passed - but she eventually improved to become oriented, interative, though remained with a much flatter affect compared to her prior mental status.
She was started on nebulizers for persistent wheezing and underwent a CXR that revealed a small effusion on the right.
She underwent a surveillance CT scan of her abd/pelvis that revealed persistent findings of severe necrotizing pancreatitis, with normal enhancement seen involving only a portion of the pancreatic head and tail, and interval development of peripheral enhancement of a large pancreatic bed fluid collection.
Persistent moderate left pleural effusion.
Decreased small right pleural effusion.
This is expected in the setting of her mental status, her poor volition, and her severe necrotizing pancreatitis.
The patient was also noted to develop diarrhea, which was negative for C. dif and attributed to pancreatic malapbsorption.
