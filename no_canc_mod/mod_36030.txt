Anteroseptal and apical AK/HK and inferior akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
1+ AR, 2+ MR  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted in respiratory failure secondary to influenza A infection.
She had troponin leak with normal CKMB, MB index attributed to demand ischemia.
Aspirin was not given because of history of allergies and beta-blocker was held secondary to hypotension.
She then developed dense retrocardiac opacity on CXR on [**12-13**] and was started on empiric treatment with Vancomycin and Levaquin for ventilator associated pneumonia.
Patient was very sensitive to sedation and her sedation was difficult to titrate due to either over sedation or agitation.
During one of the attempts to decrease sedation in order to prepare the patient for extubation she developed a wide complex tachycardia lasting several minutes that resolved spontaneously.
