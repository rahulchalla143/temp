She weaned to room air on her first day of life and remained without supplemental oxygen requirement or for the remainder of her hospitalization.
She did continue to have apnea and bradycardia which resolved with passage of time, but evaluation included cardiac and CNS etiologies as described below.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Though her oxygen requirement resolved quickly, she continued to have episodes of bradycardia associated with apnea.
Due to her term gestation, before attributing this bradycardia to dysmaturity, she had and EKG and cardiology consultation.
