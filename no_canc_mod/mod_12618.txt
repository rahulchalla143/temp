Admission Date:  [**2119-12-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-1-10**]   Service:  Cardiothoracic  CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85 year old male with known coronary artery disease and history of myocardial infarction in [**2089**] who presented to an outside hospital with a complaint of shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
He had computerized tomographic angiography which demonstrated no pulmonary embolus.
Dobutamine stress demonstrated large anterior apical inferior, posterior and lateral reversible defects.
Chest x-ray also done at the outside hospital showed right middle lobe infiltrates.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, right middle lobe infiltrates, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, gout, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, persistent elevated CPKs, hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency.
Coumadin 5 mg on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, 4 mg on Sunday and Thursday  ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to Codeine.
Neck, no lymphadenopathy and no jugulovenous distension.
S1 and S2 with systolic ejection murmur best heard in the lower sternal border, III/VI.
Groin, no bruits, no bleeding.
In summary the catheterization report showed normal left main with left anterior descending 80% occlusion, circumflex 70% occlusion and right coronary artery totally occluded.
In summary, the patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting at a later date following a complete workup including carotid dopplers, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram to assess left ventricular function as well as his mitral regurgitation and resolution of his right middle lobe infiltrates as well as diuresis prior to his surgery.
On [**12-20**], he experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
On [**12-23**] the patient complained of abdominal pain.
Following his complaint of abdominal pain he had decreasing level of consciousness followed by a cardiac arrest during which he had periods of asystole, lasting six to eight seconds.
He did rule in for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction following his cardiac arrest.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was further complicated by an episode of ventricular tachycardia during which the patient was pulseless.
The patient was shocked out of the ventricular tachycardia with 300 joules followed by ventricular pacing with the temporary wire he had in place.
The catheterization showed his left anterior descending to have an 80% occlusion with competitive flow distally, circumflex and obtuse marginal 1 to be 80% occluded and the right coronary artery to be 100% occluded with proximal filling via left to right collaterals.
The lesion was crossed and stented with no residual lesion.
For the next 48 hours the patient remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, monitoring his hemodynamic stability and his respiratory status.
Respiratory, diffuse rhonchi bilaterally, no rales.
Abdomen is soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm with 2 to 3+ edema and palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.
The patient does complain of pain in the right groin including the upper leg.
This pain was noted preoperatively.
He had bilateral groin ultrasounds which were negative for pseudoaneurysm.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times one with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending and status post angioplasty of the obtuse marginal.
Atrial fibrillation status post automatic implanted cardioverter defibrillator placement.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
