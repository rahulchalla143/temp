Admission Date:  [**2115-4-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2115-4-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2042-2-16**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  One week abdominal distention, weakness and shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year-old woman with a history of type B aortic dissection, abdominal aortic aneurysm, RCIA and [**Female First Name (un) **], aneurysm, renal artery stenosis and hepatitis B, cirrhosis who presents to [**Hospital1 1444**] from an Emergency Room in [**Hospital1 1474**].
The patient initially presented with a history of increasing shortness of breath, abdominal distention and fatigue at [**Hospital1 1474**].
The patient was placed on nitroprusside drip, po Labetalol 200 mg a day and was seen by the liver service who performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate for guaiac positive stools and hematocrit of 22.8 on presentation.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy also showed erosions consistent with portal hypertension.
was started with a goal blood pressure of decreased blood pressure given the dissection.
Type B aortic dissection.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm 5.5 cm.
Severe left renal stenosis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
+S4 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.
IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate or congestive heart failure.
Right upper lobe opacity.
CT of the pelvis from [**4-10**] showed dissection of lower thoracic abdominal aorta and right common iliac, infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm maximum diameter 5.5 by 5 cm.
Right common iliac aneurysm, left internal iliac aneurysm, severe left renal artery cirrhosis, cirrhosis of the liver, portal hypertension, varices.
Chest x-ray of [**2115-4-20**] showed a 1.1 cm pulmonary nodule right upper lobe, prominent tortuous aorta.
Shortness of breath:  Patient with no pneumonia on x-ray.
It was possible that her shortness of breath might be consistent to volume overload.
The impression was a right upper lobe lung nodule.
There was also an increase in patchy opacity at the right lung base.
The differential included atelectasis versus an evolving pneumonia.
There was also a small persistent, small right pleural effusion.
Hematology:  Patient with iron deficiency anemia, decreased iron.
Gastrointestinal:  Patient with a history of hepatitis B cirrhosis and increasing abdominal girth.
The etiology of cirrhosis with VNA/IGGA were sent.
On [**2115-4-21**] an abdominal ultrasound and diagnostic paracentesis was performed, which showed a small 3 cm pocket of ascites located within the right lower quadrant the patient in the sitting position.
The impression was a nodular liver consistent with the patient's known cirrhosis, patent flow to the liver, borderline enlarged spleen, mild ascites and abdominal portion of the aortic dissection seen in the dissection consistent with both CT and MR recently with correlation of the studies was suggested.
Kidney:  The patient developed acute renal dysfunction during her hospitalization.
The differential included drug induced ATN versus hypotension versus secondary to aortic dissection.
It was felt that it was likely due to hypotension.
The ultrasound showed color flow seen to both kidneys, but the wave form is parvus sitarist suggesting more proximal stenosis in both renal arteries.
There was no evidence of echogenic kidney seen with medical renal disease.
Nutrition:  Nutrition was provided with Boost and a cardiac healthy low protein diet.
Liver cirrhosis 2.
Renal failure.
