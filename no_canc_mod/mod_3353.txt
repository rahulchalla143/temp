Per the patient he had increased frequency of urination throughout the day yesterday.
This was without any burning with urination or malodorous, cloudy, or bloody urine.
He denied any inability to completely void or obstructive symptoms and reported that his increased urination had resolved as of yesterday morning.
Then, later in the evening of [**9-27**] he had increased shortness of [**Date Range 1440**] so he called EMS.
He denies any chest pain, fevers, chills, or night sweats.
No hemoptysis.
He reports no chest pain associated with this.
After 2 liters of fluid his SBP's improved to the 100's and his respiratory status improved dramatically after receiving supplementary O2, inhalers, and one dose of azithromycin.
Currently, he reports his breathing status is coming back to his baseline.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Notable for left sided groin pain that he reports has been going on for the last couple of days.
No [**Date Range **], hematochezia, hematemesis, or abdominal pain.
No dysuria or hematuria.
No weakness or dizziness though patient is not particularly physical active at baseline.
Severe COPD on 4 L O2 at home 2.
Steroid induced hyperglycemia 6.
Hypertension 7.
Hyperlipidemia 8.
Chronic low back pain after L1-2 laminectomy 9.
Left shoulder pain for several months 10.
Physical Exam: Vitals: Afebrile BP 115/80  HR 80  O2 100% on 2L Gnl: NAD, Alert and oriented x 3 HEENT: Anicteric, MMM CV: RRR, Normal S1 + S2, No murmurs, rubs or gallops Resp: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, No wheezes or crackles  Abd: +Distention, no appreciable fluid wave, +TTP, no guarding, no rebound, no discernable HSM Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema Neuro: AAOx3.
There is no focal airspace consolidation or effusion.

The aorta is markedly tortuous with vascular calcifications.
male with COPD, CAD, Hypertension, and Hyperlipidemia presenting with increased shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**] at home and found to be hypoxic.
#) Respiratory Distress/ COPD Exacerbation: Unclear precipitant, but he does report that his granddaughter who lives with himself and his wife had a cold last week and does have a dry cough.
Likely viral illness precipitating exacerbation of RAD/asthma component.
No pneumonia on CXR.
No swelling, JVD, or signs of heart failure.
Given dramatic improvement on measures implemented so far will continue to treat for COPD exacerbation and monitor.
Given lack of headache/fever/myalgias or any active viral prodrome did not feel inclined to test for flu at this time as minimal presentation in MA so far and very unlikely to be consistent with this.
After two days on the floor of continued nebulizer treatments, steroids and antibiotics he felt that his breathing had returned to his baseline and he felt that he was ready for discharge.
#) Hypotension: Patient had brisk response to fluids and appeared dry on presentation.
After fluid resuscitation his blood pressure stabilized and after transfer to the floor he had no further episodes of hypotension.
Given dehydration and hypotension, it was thought that there was a component of pre-renal but also concern for hypoperfusion due to the hypotension.
#) History of CAD: No signs of active ischemia on admission, but did have slight increase in troponins with normal CK's, likely due to strain in the setting of hypotension and decreased clearance with his acute renal failure.
COPD Exacerbation 2.
Acute Kidney Injury 3.
Hypotension Secondary: -History of Hypertension -CAD -Chronic Low Back Pain   Discharge Condition: At the time of discharge patient felt he was breathing at his baseline on 4LNC, afebrile, hypotension had resolved and he was considered medically stable for discharge.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with shortness of [**Hospital1 1440**], due to an exacerbation (worsening of your COPD).
We think that your breathing worsened because you likely got a mild viral infection, which caused you not to eat and drink much which made your blood pressure lower and kidney function worsen.
Physical therapy also worked with you, and felt like you were safe to go home.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have more trouble breathing, chest pain, fever/chills, are unable to eat or drink, have difficulty taking your medications or any other concerning symptoms.
