The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire interventricular septum, anterior free wall, inferior free wall, and apex.
The only segments of the left ventricle that are not akinetic or severely hypokinetic are the basal segments of the posterior and lateral walls.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-2-19**], left ventricular contractile function is markedly further decreased; mitral regurgitation is significantly increased.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**9-21**] %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-6-27**], LV systolic dysfunction remains severely depressed.
Left bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2170-2-26**] no definite change.
Left bundle-branch block.
Intermittent wide complex beats of different morphology that may be late-cycle ventricular premature beats versus possible changing pattern of intraventricular conduction delay showing left axis deviation.
Since the previous tracing of [**2170-6-27**] there is no significant change.
CXR on admission [**2170-6-19**]: Allowing for differences in patient positioning, large left and moderate right pleural effusions are not substantially changed.
Together with basilar atelectasis, there is obscuration of the heart borders.
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is not changed.
There is no pneumothorax.
CXR [**2170-6-26**]: Progression of venous congestion with moderately large bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 82F s/p NSTEMI [**2-/2170**] with stent to LAD who presented with worsening CHF, echo demonstrated significant worsening in LV function (LVEF 15%, most recent EF=20-25% [**6-27**]) and MR, s/p cardiac catheterization [**2170-6-21**] which revealed in-stent restenosis of proximal LAD and worsened atherosclerotic disease of left main stem.
Impella with stenting of LMA lesions on [**2170-6-22**].
Her post-catherization recovery had been complicated by [**Last Name (un) **], hypotension, and respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema.
She developed left limb ischemia likely secondary to contrast nephropathy in addition to hypotension and her condition progressivly deteriorated and she died on [**2170-6-30**] after being made for comfort measures only on [**6-29**].
# Systolic heart failure: Worsening SOB, increased pulmonary edema and bilateral pleurel effusions thought to be secondary to either worsening MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] cardiomyopathy on admission.
Echo on day of admission revealed diminished LVEF for 15% and moderate 3+ MR.  Cardiac cath on [**2170-6-21**] revealed 90% instent restenosis of the LAD stent as well as left main disease, and the patient underwent impella-supported PCI on [**2170-6-22**] with stenting of left main.
She was electively intubated for the procedure following an episode of hypoxia the night of [**2170-6-21**] in which she temporarily required a non-rebreather and CPAP to maintain O2 sats.
She later developed acute renal failure post-procedure with anuria likely due to a combination of low BP and contrast induced nephropathy requiring CVVH for which she was dependent.
She started heparin gtt ([**6-28**]) for both for her cardiac hypokinesis and any potential arterial embolism of her left leg after her INR decreased to subtherapeutic levels.
There was a question of whether her LAD stent had thrombosed, given significant worsening of LV function (EF 30-35% in [**2170-2-19**] to EF of 15% on admission [**6-19**]).
The patient underwent a cardiac cath on [**2170-6-21**] to evaluate her coronary arteries, which revealed 90% in-stent restenosis in the proximal LAD, worsened atheresclerotic disease of the left main (ostial 70% left main lesion), and complete occlusion of the RCA with the distal RCA perfused via collaterals.
She was electively intubated for the procedure after a brief episode of hypoxia the night prior to the cath.
She was placed on heaprin drip after her INR became subtherapeutic on [**6-28**].
# Acute Renal Failure: The patient's Cr trended up from 1.2 on admission to 3.0 on [**2170-6-24**].
Likely secondary to contrast nephropathy, as well as renal compromise in setting of hypotension.
Resipratory status greatly improved with removal of fluid by dialysis but she remained anuric and was initially due to have a permanent dialysis catheter placed but was too unstable to go for the procedure so CVVH was continued with her femoral dialysis line.
She developed progressive cardiovascular instability and she required furtehr inotropic support.
# Hypotension - BP was hypotensive on admission, likely multifactorial and secondary to diuresis, anti-hypertensives and poor CO.  SBP range generally 70s-90s with several SBP readings as low as 60s following administration of IV metoprolol which was held on most of the admission.
Her BP was also felt to be contributory to her acute renal failuer which occurred post-cath and was felt to be in combination with contrast-induced nephropathy following two catheterisations and a high contrast burden.
Norepinephrine was used intermittengly for blood pressure support and she was able initially to be weaned off this post-catheterisation however due to persistent severe hypotension on [**6-29**] this was restarted.
# Hyperlipidemia - She was continued on her home simvastatin until [**2170-6-28**], when it was stopped in setting of rising LFTs and elevated CK.
She was reviewed daily by vascular who felt no acute intervention was needed but recommended a heparin infusion which was commenced on [**6-28**].
Pulses in the feet were intermittently present on doppler in the right foot and absent on the left but this also varied as to being detectable.
She also had considerable [**Month/Year (2) **] limb pain requiring increasing levels of IV hydromorphoen with associated sedation.
We continued the warming blanket which seemed to help her leg appearance and potentially pain.
?Possibly caused by hypoperfusion because of the diminished cardiac output from her [**Month/Year (2) **] disease.
No signs of abdominal tenderness were seen on physical exam.
We discontinued her statin and restarted tylenol only after increasing lower extremity pain.
The patient had episodes of PVC?????
There was an episode of ?VT on [**6-28**] VT which EP felt rhythm more likely to be VT than SVT with aberrancy.
Arrhythmia could be due to [**Month/Year (2) **] ventricular tissue/reperfusion of injured ventricular tissue, or electrolyte imbalance.
She had no furtehr episodes of VT until her death on [**6-30**].
Admistered Nystatin swish and swallow which was administered by a tongue sponge.
# Leukocytosis- WBC trended down, after initially being elevated and patient was afebrile with no clinical signs of infection.
# Confirmation of death - Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2170-6-30**] Called to see patient at 0216.
No heart sounds or breath sounds auscultated.
