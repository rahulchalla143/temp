He had been followed for many years for episodes of chest discomfort and he was told that this was not cardiac in origin but most likely related to stress.
Stress testing in the past had always been negative for perfusion defects and symptoms but notable for EKG changes.
His chest discomfort had occurred several times a week and came and went periodically so he had another stress test done on [**3-31**] which showed EKG changes with ST depressions in V4 through V6 that did resolve.
There were no perfusion defects.
