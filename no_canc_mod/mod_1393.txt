There was no blood in the stool per the patient.
She denied vaginal bleeding, urinary symptoms, dysuria, recent travel or fevers.
In the Emergency Room, there was some question of whether the patient was having chest pain and in fact the patient was found to have a left bundle branch block with a tachycardia superimposed to the 140 range.
She received chest CT scan for a question of a pulmonary embolism and was sent initially to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for question of hypertensive crisis.
PPD positive.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Diabetes mellitus.
Transient ischemic attacks.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (asthma), home O2.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2121**], status post cholecystectomy.
History of pulmonary embolism in [**2127**]; recently on Coumadin for anti-coagulation.
History of what were evidently had been multiple myocardial infarctions.
In general, a moderately obese woman in respiratory distress.
There were no bruits appreciated.
No jugular venous distention was noted.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was softly distended with tenderness to palpation epigastrically and in the left lower quadrant.
The rectal examination was negative with no stool.
There is no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Extraocular movements did not show evidence for nystagmus.
There was some left conjunctival hemorrhage.

Chest x-ray on [**3-3**], was as follows:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
A chest CT scan performed on the same day showed no pulmonary embolus, left pleural and parenchymal calcifications and left lower lobe volume loss, i.e.
The head CT scan was performed on [**3-4**], with the following impression:  No intracranial hemorrhage, no evidence of skull fracture.
The patient's EKG was felt to represent tachycardia with left bundle branch block but without other pathology.
Secondary to concerns surrounding the additional history that the patient gave of a fall approximately three days prior to admission with racoon's eyes on examination, the patient was sent for a CT scan of the head to rule out intra-cranial bleeding or base of the skull fracture.
In the absence of evidence to suggest acute cardiac process, heparin was discontinued.
On [**3-4**], the patient was thought to be much improved with no significant abdominal tenderness and no Telemetry events overnight with a pulse in the 80s and systolic blood pressure in the 160s.
As the patient had formerly multiple times been evaluated for abdominal pain including mesenteric angiography and CT scan of the abdomen without a diagnosis being reached, the decision was made to discharge the patient home or appropriate outpatient follow-up with her outpatient provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
three times a day times ten days for presumed Proteus mirabilis urinary tract infection.
