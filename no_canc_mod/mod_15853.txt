Mother with a prior obstetric history of a primary cesarean section for pregnancy induced hypertension at 31 weeks.
No report of complications until the mother presented on the day of admission, complaining of headaches and blurred vision.
Other laboratory studies were suggestive of pregnancy induced hypertension.
Starting fetal monitoring showed minimal variability with decelerations.
Also noted decreased AFI.
Due to non reassuring fetal heart rate pattern, the decision was made to deliver infant by repeat cesarean section.
Blow-by oxygen was given, which progressed to C-Pap and elective intubation due to progressive respiratory distress.
This was a small appearing infant with respiratory distress.
Head with anterior fontanel open and flat, round, no molding.
Poor air entry bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
2+ femoral pulses.
No hepatosplenomegaly or other masses.
No sacral anomalies.
[**Known lastname 7568**] was started on diuretics on [**2105-1-19**] for management of persistent oxygen requirement and chronic lung disease.
[**Known lastname 7568**] was treated with caffeine citrate for management of apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
His last episode of apnea and bradycardia was last documented on [**2104-1-7**].
He also had a history of brief desats precipitated by feedings (last [**1-20**]) and by pacifier use (last [**2-2**]).
He has had no new events since.
An echocardiogram was performed on [**2104-12-29**] which demonstrated a small patent foramen ovale and minimal mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
He initially required a D-10 bolus for management of hypoglycemia which resolved quickly.
If weight falls from the 25% ile curve, do recommend increasing calories back to 24 calories/ounce.
On day of life six, the infant was started on Vancomycin and Gentamycin for increasing concerns of sepsis secondary to a shifted CBC.
Monitor weight gain.
Consider 24 calorie/ounce supplementation if weight gain insufficient.
With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the Fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Chronic lung disease.
Rule out sepsis with antibiotics.
Mild hyperbilirubinemia.
Apnea and bradycardia of prematurity, resolved.
Anemia of prematurity.
