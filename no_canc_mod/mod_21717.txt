Admission Date:  [**2127-2-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-2-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-4-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**] Chief Complaint: Intracranial hemorrhage.
History of Present Illness: Patient is a 75 year old woman with past medical history of hypertension who was in her usual state of health, doing work in kitchen around 11:30am on [**2127-2-14**] when she then told her husband that she was going to bed because of a headache.
Notes from [**Hospital1 **] indicated that she had "expressive aphasia, right hemiparesis, left gaze preference."
Patient went to CT scan at 2:00pm which showed left temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Hypertension 2.
Hypercholesterolinemia 3.
No history of coagulopathy, aneurysm.
Neck: Supple, no evidence of trauma.
No carotid bruits.
Neuro: Does open eyes to voice or noxious stimuli.
No blink to threat or oculocephalic reflex.
Motor/Sensory: Localizes noxious stimuli with left arm which moves [**2-22**].
Right arm and leg withdraws to noxious stimuli.
No evidence of acute cardipulmonary disease.
----- CT head [**2127-2-14**]: An ill-defined intraparenchymal area of hyperdensity is seen involving the left parietal and temporal lobe measuring approximately 8 cm at its greatest dimension with associated cytotoxic edema.
There is a small left frontal subdural hematoma.
Mass effect is seen towards the left lateral ventricles.
There is subfalcine herniation as well as transtentorial herniation.
Mild dilatation of the right lateral ventricle is noted.
IMPRESSION: Left parietal and temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage causing subfalcine and transtentorial herniation.
Small left frontal subdural hematoma.
----- CT head [**2127-2-15**]: There is again seen an area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left parietal and temporal lobes.
Stable appearance of small left frontal subdural hematoma.
The degree of associated edema with the left parietal and temporal lobes apepars stable.
There is stable falcine and transtentorial herniation, and stable compression of the left lateral ventricle.
The mild dilation of the right lateral ventricle is unchanged.
No new areas of loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation are identified to suggest an acute minor or major vascular territorial infarct.
IMPRESSION: Stable large left parietal and temporal intraparenchymal hemorhage with stable subfalcine and transtentorial herniation.
Stable small left frontal subdural hematoma.
----- CT head [**2127-2-16**]: There is significant motion artifact limiting the evaluation.
The size of the interparenchymal hemorrhage involving the left parietal and temporal lobes is somewhat larger, now measuring approximately 9.5 x 5.6 cm.
The left-sided frontal subdural hematoma is also slightly larger.
The degree of mass effect is greater than on the prior study with continued effacement of the left lateral [**Doctor Last Name 534**], and increased effacement of the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] with increased subfalcine herniation.
There is slightly increased hypodensity in the deep white matter of the right occipital parietal lobe of unclear significance which may represent edema.
There is slight new mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinuses, but the paranasal sinuses are otherwise clear.
IMPRESSION: Increased size of a left-sided intraparenchymal hematoma with increased subfalcine herniation toward the right.
-----  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 75 year old woman with past medical history of hypertension who presented with large left parieto-temporal hemorrhage.
Possibile etiologies of bleed were felt to include amyloid, mass, hypertension, and AVM.
Full medical management of her hemorrhage and supportive care ensued.
Dilantin 100 mg q8h was used for seizure prophylaxis.
Sedation was regular held, with examinations off of sedation showing compromised brainstem activity.
Patient was made do not resuscitate meaning no chest compressions per her family's wishes on [**2127-2-16**].
In the am on [**2127-2-17**], her pupils were fixed, no blink to threat, and no gag reflex.
Full medical management continued including use of Neosynephrine for blood pressure support and ventilator for respiratory support.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Left temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with subsequent edema and herniation resulting in death.
