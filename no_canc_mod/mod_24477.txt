[**11-20**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

#Amanita mushroom ingestion complicated by acute severe hepatitis: Patient presented with hepatitis due to ingestion of amanita mushrooms.
ERCP-guided nasobiliary tube placement was attempted on [**11-22**] but was unsuccessful due to technical and anatomic issues.
Hypertension: Patient reported a history of untreated hypertension.
While inpatient, she was hypertensive with SBP ranging from 140-170s.
She remained asymptomatic and was started on metoprolol and lisinopril with improvement in her hypertension.
#Chest pain - Seen in consultation by cardiology who recommended coronary CTA for preoperative evaluation should a transplant be required.
Would likely benefit from aspirin therapy and outpatient stress testing given report of frequent anginal symptoms.
