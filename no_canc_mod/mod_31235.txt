?osteomyelitis) now admitted for fever, shortness of breath and cough.
Patient went for bronchoscopy today for RLL collapse which showed severe tracheobronchomalacia on tidal respiration.
She was given nebs x1 with no improvement.
She also notes increasing shortness of breath.
She denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary symptoms(she does have minimal urine output), headahce, dizziness.
Past Medical History: - chronic R pleural effusion w/ RML, RLL collapse, tapped in [**7-29**] transudative (attempted tap x 3 without success, on fourth attempt were able to remove 200cc only) - on 2L oxygen at NH - CAD: cath [**11-26**] with 3VD, s/p cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to RCA.
- CHF: echo [**10-29**] show hyperdynamic EF, mild LVH - Atrial Fibrillation - Pulmonary HTN - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - DM2 - ESRD from contrast nephropathy post cardiac catheterization [**11-26**] on HD since [**12-28**] (baseline creatinine ([**2-24**]) - Severe lumbar spondylosis and spinal stenosis s/p laminectomy  in [**2110**] - Basal Cell Carcinoma - Osteomyelitis T5-T6 on suppressive vancomycin for 3 months ([**2113-4-13**] was day 1) - MRSA bacteremia from HD line infection - Admission [**Date range (1) 96974**] for MRSA sepsis.
At that time, the patient had back pain and their was concern for osteomyelitis.
Family History: Father died of CVA at 64yo.
Mother died of MI at 86yo.

Almost complete atelectasis of the right lung due to secretion in right main bronchi.
Longstanding loculated right pleural effusion with homogeneous pleural thickening, unchanged.
Steadily increasing mediastinal lymph nodes, and pleural thickening might have a benign explanation due to longstanding pleural effusion.
An indolent malignancy such as lymphoma cannot be excluded, justifying thoracentesis and cytologic cell-block examination.
The right pleural effusion again demonstrated with adjacent lung atelectasis, slightly increased comparing to the previous film.
No evidence of pneumothorax is present.
Cytology: Negative for malignant cells  Brief Hospital Course: 75yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF, HTN, chronic right sided effusion and R lung collapse, s/p bronch showing tracheobronchomalacia, transferred to MICU for acute exacerbation of hypoxia.
MICU COURSE: # Acute exacerbation of hypoxia - correctable w/ O2(baseline home O2 2L: initial DDX on admission included acute mucus plug, worsening pneumonia/pulmonary edema, worsening collapse, fever/high metabolic rate, PE.
She underwent a CT guided thoracentesis with pigtail placement which revealed a transudate.
There was a concern for trapped lung and not much improvement in her oxygenation.
# Longstanding loculated right pleural effusion with homogeneous pleural thickening w/ enlarging mediastinal [**Doctor First Name **] - As above pig tail placed under CT guidance but no relief.
# ESRD on HD QMWF: last HD [**11-28**].
# Anxiety:continued on citalopram, clonazepam # spinal stenosis: on morphine at baseline # PPX-PPI, pneumoboots # code- DNR/DNI.
