Recent echocardiogram revealed a decreased in left ventricular function and she was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an aortic valve replacement.
On [**2139-10-1**], she underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed normal coronary arteries, [**3-3**]+ aortic regurgitation, mild to moderate aortic stenosis and ejection fraction of 25%.
Recent congestive heart failure admission to an outside hospital.
Tylenol with Codeine two to four tablets per day as needed for chronic complaints of back pain.
The patient did have a preoperative positive urinalysis for which she was placed on three days of oral Ciprofloxacin prior to her surgical procedure.
Due to what appeared to be vegetations on the valve found in the operating room, an infectious disease consultation was obtained although the patient had no fever or elevation in white blood cell count.
There were recommendations for repeat blood culture as well as urine culture, and everything has subsequently come back negative with the exception of urine which was positive for diphtheroids.
She has had no hemodynamic complications whatsoever.
Cardiac examination is regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
She has no peripheral edema.
Target INR for this patient should be 2.5 to 3.0 for mechanical aortic valve.
This is for one week for empiric coverage of her previously discussed infectious disease issues as well as positive urinary tract infection.
