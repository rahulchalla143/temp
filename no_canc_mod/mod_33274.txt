Admission Date:  [**2179-8-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-7-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
History of Present Illness: 69M with a history of CHF/ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 10% 6/09, ESRD on HD, who presented to OSH with SOB on [**8-8**].
Of note the patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 83447**] with LUE/LLE edema and DVT was ruled out however they noted that he had a L sided pleural effusion and ?
He was d/c'ed on 5L of oxygen and when the VNA visited him he was still SOB on 4L of oxygen with cough and clear sputum production so he was taken to the ED and re-admitted.
At the OSH, a CT chest showed increase in the L pleural effusion, collapse of the L lung with obstruction of the L main stem bronchus, questionable endobronchial lesion vs mucous plug.
He also had a R pleural effusion, ascites, anasarca and a L ventricular aneurysm.
He was hemodialized 2.5L and a thoracentesis was performed removing 1L of pleural fluid which was negative for microorganisms.
A bronchoscopy was performed showing a L main stem mucous plug, abnormal endobronchial mucosa with external compression that was so severe they were unable to safely advance the bronchoscope.
They believed it was secondary to the LV aneurysm compressing the LMSB.
A BAL was performed showing oropharyngial flora and biopsies of the abnormal mucosa were sent to pathology.
LUE doppler was again repeated due to persistent LUE edema which was negative.
On [**8-13**], he had rigid bronchoscopy with IP.
Following the procedure he became hypotensive and was started on Levo and Epi gtt.
On bronchoscopy there was no endobronchial lesion seen however he did have extrinsic compression of LLL segments.
Balloon dilation was performed, and left chest tube placed which drained ~2.5L.
His ICU course has been complicated by inability to wean pressor support.
He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn given development of fevers [**8-13**] with plan for 8 day course per IP.
He continues to put out approximately 1 L of pleural fluid from the left pigtail catheter.
He continues to have dyspnea but endorses improvement since stenting by IP.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia,  - Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Atrial fibrillation on coumadin -ESRD on MWF HD in [**Hospital1 1559**], etiology of renal failure unclear  -Ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 5-10% -s/p PPM/ICD in [**2177**] -Type I DM -hypothyroidism -PAD with RLE amputation at mid-calf -HCV per report -OA -h/o GIB  Social History: Ex-smoker with a 7 pack year history, quit at age 40.
Sclera anicteric  EOMI NECK: Supple, RIJ in place, no JVD appreciable CARDIAC:  distant heart sounds RRR, no appreciable murmur LUNGS: Bilateral chest tubes in place, Resp were unlabored, no accessory muscle use.
bibasilar crackles.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, slightly distended, soft/reducible umbilical hernia, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: s/p BKA, LLE with venous stasis dermatitis, slight arterial ulceration over ventral aspect of toes, no evidence of acute infection, palpable left DP.
Complete atelectasis of the left lung with a low-density material within the left main bronchus that may represent secretions although correlation with bronchoscopy is recommended.
Severe cardiomegaly with left ventricular enlargement and left ventricular calcification also contribute to the atelectasis of the lung.
Bilateral pleural effusions, large.
Evidence of prior granulomatous exposure.
Asymmetric thickening of the left breast tissue that might represent hematoma versus extensive edema due to patient positioning.
The right pleural space has completely cleared, in the left pleural space moderate remnant pleural effusion is seen.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
ECHO [**2179-8-17**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 10%).
A large (2.6 x 2.1) echogenicity is seen in the left ventricle, adjacent to the lateral wall, consistent with thrombus.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Massively dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction and low cardiac output.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
CXR [**2179-8-20**]: The position of the multiple chest tubes and lines is essentially unchanged since the prior chest x-ray.
There is some atelectasis in the lower lobe present.
Pneumothorax is still present on the left side, essentially unchanged since the prior chest x-ray.
There is no right pneumothorax.
No right pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 83448**] is a 69 yo M with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 5-10%), L mainstem bronchus compression [**2-15**] LV enlargement s/p bronchoscopy,  ESRD on HD, course c/b post bronch hypotension and inability to wean pressor support.
Hospital Course: Acute on chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with EF 5-10%, exacerbation likely [**2-15**] combination of volume overload (up 30kg from dry weight) and positive pressure ventillation for rigid bronchoscopy.
He developed respiratory distress around midnight on [**8-21**] requiring a non-rebreather.
