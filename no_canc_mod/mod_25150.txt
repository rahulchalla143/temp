No definite new lung lesions.
No pneumothorax.
There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema present, note is made of patchy atelectasis in left lower lobe and lingula as well as a probable small left pleural effusion.
Left PICC terminating in the distal SVC without evidence of pneumothorax.
Continued bilateral pleural effusions and left basilar atelectasis  CARDIOLOGY: [**2165-3-18**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the basal to mid inferior wall .
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-19**], the overall LVEF is similar and the degree of mitral regurgitation appears slightly less.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include akinetic basal inferior which is also aneurysmal; mid and apical anteroseptal and anterior hypokinetic walls; basal inferoseptal hypokinetic wall.
Mitral valve: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no prolapsing or flail segments.
Evaluation by color flow doppler (vena contracta 4-5mm), pulmonary venous inflow (no systolic reversal or blunting of pulmonary veins of both sides), mitral annulus (30mm), dilated left atrium (4.7cm) and normal sized left ventricle in diastole (5.6 cm), a central regurgitant jet is visualized which is consistent with moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation under anesthesia and with provocative measures like trendelenburg position.
POSTBYPASS: Mild improvement in the wall motion abnormalities of the previously hypokinetic areas.
Mitral regurgitation is mild to moderate.
Ascending aorta looks okay without any evidence of dissection.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79 year old female who was admitted with unstable angina on [**2165-3-18**].
Cardiology was [**Date Range 4221**] upon admission for pre-operative planning and a preoperative echo was obtained.
She was continued on lasix and beta-blockade preoperatively but plavix (for her recent lower extremity bypass) was held.
Vascular surgery consultation was obtained given her recent bypass procedure and history of groin infection and she was started on pre-operative antibiotics.
[**Last Name (un) **] consultation was also obtained for assistance with blood sugar control.
She was extubated without complication early in her post-operative course but required re-intubation for respiratory compromise.
She had acute oliguric renal failure post-operatively which improved with hydration and diuretics.
She also had acute atrial fibrillation post-operatively which was treated with amiodarone; she did, however require cardioversion for unstable Afib on post-operative day 6.
She was started empirically on vancomycin and meropenum for leukocytosis post-operatively in the setting of her known groin infection, as per Infectious Disease department recommendations.
Of note, she developed what appeared to be a sternal wound infection vs partial dehiscence around one week post-operatively and vancomycin was continued.
After her first re-intubation she was again extubated on post-operative day 6 without complication.

Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
