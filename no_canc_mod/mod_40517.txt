His cirrhosis has been complicated by ascites requiring repeated LVP (past 7 months), encephelopathy, SBP and HRS.
During that admission, he was treated for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose/rifaximin, and SBP with 5 day course of ceftriaxone.
He has a history of diuretic refractory ascites, and required 2 paracenteses during the admission.
Was discharged off diuretics given worsening renal function and concern for electrolyte abnormalities.
Since discharge, the patient has noted increasing abdominal girth, weight gain, and worsening fatigue.
Patient mentions that the edema has been getting progressively worse for the past several weeks.
His labs at [**Hospital1 **] were notable for hyponatremia with Na 116, WBC 6.5, K 5.3, Cr 1.6, AST 36, ALT 35, Tbili 1.0, AP 212, TSH 3.98, Albumin 3.1, lactate 1.4.
Per report, ultrasound there did not show any evidence of fluid ammenable to paracentesis.
Recommended albumin if worsening renal failure, but as Cr 1.7 (which is near recent baseline), no albumin given.
Was admitted for further work-up and treatment of hyponatremia and cirrhosis.
He denies chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, nausea or lightheadness.

There is a marked decrease in the limb lead voltage while the precordial lead appearance is similar.
The axis is now leftward and the tracing is similar to that recorded on [**2137-6-14**] but there is variation in the precordial lead placement.
Mild elevation of velocity in distal TIPS stent to which attention can be paid on follow-up.
Moderate volume ascites.
[**2137-7-25**] MIBI stress test IMPRESSION: 1) Ascites 2) No evidence of focal myocardial perfusion defects.
[**2137-7-25**] Stress EKG (pharmacologic) IMPRESSION: No ischemic ECG changes.
No anginal type symptoms.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo M w/ NASH cirrhosis h/o SBP and TIPS with recent revision, refractory ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, who presented with lethargy and hyponatremia.
# Hyponatremia: Presented with lethargy, sodium of 114, concerning for an acute on chronic process, as his records indicate a baseline sodium level of 125-130.
- Continue to fluid restrict to 750cc/day, 2g Na restriction - Continue to hold diuretics for [**Last Name (un) **]  #Renal Failure: Acute on Chronic renal failure from baseline Cr of 1.4.
- Continue to hold diuretics - Continue midodrine 15mg TID PO - Follow up in transplant clinic as scheduled  # Cirrhosis: NASH cirrhosis s/p TIPS, cirrhosis complicated by HE, SBP, HRS,  MELD on transfer from MICU was 20, decreased to 15 at time of discharge.
AMS resovled, no asterixis at discharge - Varices: None on OSH EGD, not on nadolol - Ascites: Off diuretics for HRS, fluid and Na restriction; TIPS patent on US [**2137-7-21**] - Patient will follow up in transplant clinic  #Malabsorption: Severe nutritional deficiency as evidenced via physical appearance of cachexia, bitemporal wasting, and albumin of 3.1.
As pt has distorted anatomy due to roux-en-y gastric bypass, and will likely have recurrent large volume ascites, a PEG tube is not a viable option for tube feeds, so must use dobhoff.
Nutrition was consulted, patientn was on nepro tube feeds for hyperkalemia early in the admission, transitioned back to isosource prior to discharge as was normo-hypokalemic.
- Instructed to follow up closely with PCP for diabetes management  # Falls: Patient had right arm pain and edema, ecchymosis s/p fall in transit to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH.
No indwelling CVC to increase risk of upper extremity DVT, plainfilm of R should without fracture or dislocation.
Of note, patient also had a mechanical fall during this admission without loss of conciousness.
He did not recall hitting his head but the following day he was noted to have left eye scleral hemorrhage in addition to several new ecchymoses and lacerations.
Ophtomology consult was deferred as patient had normal EOM and no vision changes.
# Troponemia: Obtained for unclear reasons during MICU work up, Trop-T 0.18 to 0.25 in setting of worsening renal function however in patient with known CAD s/p CABG.
EKG with no ischemic changes from prior.
Patient without chest pain and without events on telemetry.
Nuclear stress testing for transplant work up did not show any evidence of ischemic changes.
