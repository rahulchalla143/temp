Admission Date:  [**2119-12-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-1-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cephalexin / Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**] Chief Complaint: lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: internal jugular line placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 69 year-old woman with a history of asthma, CAD, CHF (EF 10%), IDDM, CKD, discharged 1 week ago after an admission for cellulitis and hypercarbic respiratory failure, who now presents hypotension and acute on chronic kidney injury.
She had acute on chronic cellulitis and completed a 10 day course of vancomycin.
She also had hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
She was treated for a COPD exacerbation as well as volume overload and was extubated after two days.
She remained mildly hypoxic and was discharged to home on [**1-29**] L O2, having refused rehab.
A visiting nurse noted that she was unable to care for herself and so was admitted to rehab from home on [**12-14**].
Labs were notable for a troponin elevated to .45 and creatinine 2.4.
CXR did not demonstrate volume overload or infiltrate.
Cardiology was consulted with regard to the elevated troponin.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient complains of low back pain that is chronic for her.
She also has leg pain when moved.
Asthma 2.
CAD s/p CABG [**2112**] 3.
Congestive heart failure with EF 10-15% on TTE [**11/2119**] 4.
Atrial fibrillation on coumadin 5.
Morbid obesity 7. stage III chronic kidney disease 8.
Vitamin D deficiency 9. chronic peripheral edema 10. h/o blood in stool 11. hypercholesterolemia 12. lower extremity cellulitis   Social History: Lives independently with husband.
HEENT: no apparent lesions in OP Neck: obese, difficult to assess JVD Lungs: distant breath sounds, faint crackles at bases barely audible Heart: regular, no murmurs appreciated, sternal defect with palpable heart tones Abdomen: Obese, soft, nondistended, positive bowel sounds Ext: 2+ bilateral partially pitting edema.
Bilateral lower legs with woody changes, areas of denuded skin, minimal serous drainage, appear much improved compared to prior admission Neuro: oriented to self and year, not place.

# Hypotension: Given [**Last Name (un) **], hyponatremia, hypotension, and good response to 4 L IVF in the ED, this may have been simply related to volume depletion and an aggressive heart failure regimen.
However, the following morning her WBC was elevated so vancomycin and zosyn were started.
# Shortness of breath:  Patient with increased work of breathing on the second hospital day.
ABGs showed hypoxia and hypercarbia.
She was also diuresed, with improvement in shortness of breath.
She was initially maintained on torsemide 20 mg daily with IV lasix 40 mg prn volume overload.
She remained stable on 1-3L NC with no respiratory distress during her hospital stay.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Baseline creatinine per records obtained at last hospitalization ~1.5, which was what it was on discharge a week ago.
Given concominant mild hyponatremia, hypotension, this may be simply due to volume depletion.
Urine electrolytes showed a prerenal etiology.
# Elevated troponin: Troponin .45.
It does seem likely that she has had some cardiac ischemia, probably in the setting of poor coronary perfusion secondary to systemic hypotension.
# Hyponatremia: likely secondary to volume depletion.
# CHF: EF 10%:  Metoprolol, ACEI, torsemide held in the setting of hypotension but were restarted at lower-than-home-doses.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled and anticoagulated on admission.
Was subtherapeutic INR after having warfarin held at rehab for several days (for INR 5 on [**12-15**]).
INR was then found to be supratherapeutic and warfarin was held.
No evidence of bleeding or clots on exam.
