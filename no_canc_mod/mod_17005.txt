She had an EGD on the evening of admission and found to have broccoli impaction.
As the propofol sedation was weaned off, the patient became increasingly agitated and self extubated herself.
The scope was able to be passed through the site of retained food to the stomach with moderate difficulty.
Informed consent was obtained from the patient's son for an open repair of her esophageal perforation which the patient tolerated well and was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.
However, she required reintubation for repiratory decompensation and hypotension on post-op day 2.
To evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism, the patient had a CT scan which showed a 8 x 12 mm thrombus in the left atrial appendage.
The patient also developed a MRSA pneumonia and was started on Vancomycin for this.
From a neurologic standpoint, the patient continued to have delirium throughout her hospital course, being unresponsive to commands and minimally active.
EEG showed encephalopathy and MRI/MRA of the head was essentially normal with no infarctions shown.
If there is improvement in the patient's decreased mental status, progression would likely be very slow and the hope is having the patient placed in a rehab facility would help with her mental status.
The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation was managed with beta blockers and anticoagulation.
