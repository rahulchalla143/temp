He subsequently developed severe pulmonary edema and hypoxia requiring MICU stay.
He was discharged last week, but then 2 days ago developed SOB again, was hypertensive and tachycardic, and was readmitted to ICU service.
Cardiology was consulted for lateral ST elevations and concern for another STEMI, but they did not think this was likely at this time.

CXR [**2187-1-9**]: AP chest compared to [**1-1**] and 26 shows subsequent improvement in diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which had worsened between [**1-1**] and [**1-8**].
The progression is consistent with improvement in pulmonary edema although mild cardiomegaly is stable throughout and there is no particular mediastinal vascular engorgement.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged since [**12-27**].
No pneumothorax.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with mid to apical anteroseptal and anterior akinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Venograms demonstrating extensive fibrin sheath around the right IJ tunneled dialysis catheter at the level of the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
Sinus rhythm.
Lateral ST-T changes offer additional evidence of ischemia Since previous tracing of [**2187-1-9**], anterior ST segment elevation and T wave inversion less prominent.
Brief Hospital Course: # Respiratory Distress: Two days prior to admission, the patient was discharged s/p anterior STEMI complicated by severe pulmonary edema and hypoxia, treated in the MICU with aggressive hemodialysis which improved oxygenation.
The patient then presented again with shortness of breath.
He was found to be hypertensive and tachycardic, so was readmitted to the ICU.
After transfer from MICU, the patient was free of respiratory distress and was satting in the 90's on room air.
His SOB was thought to be secondary to fluid overload, although underlying etiology unclear as multiple echocardiograms have not shown dramatic change in cardiac function.
There was initially some concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; however HCT was stable and he responds so acutely to hemodialysis an and fluid removal.
Of note, blood pressures increased to 190's systolic or higher during episodes of gastroparesis.
HTN during these episodes responded well to pain control and, if necessary, nitropaste.
This was thought to be related dietary indiscretion as an outpatient in the setting of ESRD requiring HD.
# STEMI: cards evaluated pt in MICU and felt that patient did not have a new STEMI; persistent STE at this time were thought to be residual.
# Gastroparesis: The patient suffers severe gastroparesis as a result of his diabetes.
It is thought that the severe pain precipitates a hypertensive crisis which, if untreated, might contribute to shortness of breath and flash pulmonary edema.
The patient was maintained on PRN ativan/dilaudid for pain control.
When gastroparesis episodes were refractory, the frequency of his PRN's were increased and blood pressure was monitored and controlled.
Of note, the patient may still have severe nausea/vomiting when NPO or clears.
The patient has a long history of developing bactermia after completion of an extended course of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia.
Blood culture drawn from HD catheter on [**1-8**] grew out vancomycin sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococcus.
The patient was assumed to have isolated bacteremia.
However, the patient does have a longstanding systolic murmur as well as repeated bacteremias with a variety of organisms.
While bacterial endocarditis is theoreticaly possible, bacterial endocarditis was not thought to be the cause of his bacteremia because CN-SA rarely causes endocarditis, the patient's bacteremias are caused by different organisms (Strep, Staph, Klebsiella, etc.
# End-stage renal disease: The patient was maintained on his outpatient HD regiman with additional sessions to control fluid overload.
The patient makes very little urine at baseline.
# Anemia: Anemia studies were suggestive of borderline iron deficiency anemia, with a marginally elevated ferritin.
The patient ate a cardiac diabetic salt restricted diet when able to tolerate PO's.
Subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
# Access: Hemodialysis catheter.

Secondary diagnosis: End stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis Diabetes mellitus Hypertension with autonomic dysfunction Gastroparesis Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure Myocardial infarction   Discharge Condition: Stable, statting will on room air, eating a clear liquid diet.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were severely short of breath and pulmonary edema, likely the result of multiple factors including fluid overload.
You were found to have a bacterial infection in your blood cause by the organism staphylococcus.
The source of the infection is not known.
During your hospitalization, you were also treated for your other medical conditions including renal failure, hypertension, diabetes, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, history of heart attack, and severe abdominal pain.
Your electrocardiogram showed abnormalities that were thought to be related to your recent heart attack and not a new heart attack.
You should return to the hospital if you have a recurrence of your symptoms, shortness of breath, chest pain, severe abdominal pain, swelling, high blood pressure, fever, chills, lightheadedness or any other concerning symptoms.
