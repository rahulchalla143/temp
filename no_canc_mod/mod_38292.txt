History of Present Illness: 52M with prior MI [**70**] years ago sp angioplasty, DM, [**Hospital 33210**] transferred from [**Location (un) **] with concern for NSTEMI Trop 2.26) and heart failure.
Patient notes SOB for one month, cough productive of dark green sputum, recently started on Zpak and prednisone as outpatient without significant improvement in symptoms.
Notes increased lower extremity edema over last few weeks and orthopnea.
two days prior to admission noted acute increase in his symptoms of shortness of breath.
Also noted chest pressure, no pain, that did not radiate.
Pt states that this chest pressure is very different from his MI [**70**] years ago - that pain presented with neck, jaw, and back pain rather than vague chest pressure for 2 days.
Treated for CHF and acute coronary syndrome and evaluated for cardaic surgery.
Past Medical History:   -  Myocardial Infarction 16 years ago, no stents, one vessel angioplasty -  Diabetes non insulin dependent diagnosed 2.5 years ago -  Chronic Low Back Pain/Sciatica -  Surgery on testicles due to injury several years ago  Social History: - Tobacco history: smoke 1 ppd for 30 years, cut back last month, now [**12-26**] cigarettes per day, none for past couple of days - ETOH: occasional drinking on the weekend - Illicit drugs: None  Family History: - No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Diminished BS at bilateral bases with crackles, dullness to percussion bilateral bases.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: warm, dry, no hair on lower extremities, 2+ PT pulses SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
TTE [**2166-1-4**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypo/akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and anterolateral and apical walls.
There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 30 %).
Right ventricular cavity size is mildly increased.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional and global systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LAD had a proximal 70% stenosis, diffuse mid disease up to 90%, and an apical subtotal occlusion.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left-sided filling pressures with LVEDP 33mmHg.
Transfered from OSH with concern for given conern for congestive heart failure, ?
Pt found to have flat cardiac enzymes and in DKA.
Ketones in urine here with anion gap elevated suggested DKA.
Nutrition was consulted for diabetic education.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] had no known prior history of CHF, and presented with symptoms concerning for new onset CHF given orthopnea, worsening dyspnea on exertion, elevated BNP, crackles on exam, and CXR consistent with volume overload.
Unclear precipitating event of myocarditis vs. MI a month prior when symptoms began.
TTE as above demonstrated EF 30% and global hypokinesis.
He presented with vague pressure in setting of worsening dyspnea of several weeks, and did not appear to be ACS.
He went for cardiac cath, which showed diffuse disease of RCA and LAD.
