The infant was delivered by cesarean section for a non reassuring fetal heart rate.
At the time of delivery the mother was noted to have a discolored area near her labia.
It was thought to be due to trauma from shaving 1-2 days prior to delivery but herpes cultures and antibodies were sent.
There was no history of previous HSV infection.
On [**2162-1-1**], the cultures from mom's vaginal lesions returned positive for HSV- 2 and the infant was evaluated at that time.
The heart rate was regular without murmur and pulses were 2+ and symmetrical.
The abdomen was soft, nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.
The infant was delivered by C-section, but 2 hours after rupture of membranes and after labor.
Given the significant risk of perinatal transmission with primary HSV infection, the infant was evaluated for HSV and treated with acyclovir x7 days.
