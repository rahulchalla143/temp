Small right pleural effusion.
5) Mild enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Liver Doppler findings consistent with right heart failure/triscuspid regurgitation.

[**4-4**] ECHO: Conclusions: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 yo F with DM II, HTN, ESRD on HD, who presented with shortness of breath, found to have new onset atrial fibrillation, cardiac ascites, course complicated by persistent bleeding in the setting of attempted [**Numeric Identifier **] in preparation for cardioversion, requiring transfer to the MICU.
On the floor patient underwent an abdominal CT scan which showed moderate ascites as well as hepatomegaly.
She also underwent abdominal ultrasound as well as paracentesis with 800cc of fluid removed, and ultimately it was thought that her ascites was c/w cardiac ascites.
She also had new onset atrial fibrillation, and patient was started on a heparin gtt with the plan for TEE and subsequent cardioversion.
However, after TEE was performed, she had not yet been dialyzed and it was thought that cardioversion would not be successful in the setting of volume overload.
Cardioversion was postponed, and course was then complicated by continuous oozing and bleeding, both from her nares as well as paracentesis site.
Paracentesis site again started to ooze, and it was difficult to control bleeding on the floor.
Trauma surgery was consulted for persistent bleed, and it was determined that she should no longer continue on a heparin gtt.
Heparin had not been supratherapeutic during this time, however, she had been bleeding almost persistently despite this.
She was transfused one more unit of pRBCs with an appropriate stabilization of her hematocrit.
# Bleeding: Initially patient was started on a heparin gtt and Coumadin, was on ASA 325mg.
Paracentesis site bleeding was initially tamponaded and controlled with topical thrombin, but in the setting of being on heparin gtt, bleeding has persisted, requiring compression for >30minutes and dDAVP to control bleeding.
# Atrial fibrillation: No prior hx of AFib, prior EKG interpreted as ?
Pt is at risk for developing AF in setting of stretched R atrium and ECG is consistent with that.
Moderate to severe contrast echo seen in atrium, representing likely very poor flow state, high risk for thrombus formation.
There are also complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
However, unable to anticoagulate given high risk of bleeding.
For rate control she is on metoprolol XL and verapamil SR.  She had an episode of tachycardia to the 140s during dialysis, likely due to the fact that she was due for rate controlling medications.
# Ascites: Patient is s/p paracentesis, ascitic fluid consistent with portal hypertension from cardiac etiology.
Abdominal ultrasound also c/w liver enlargement from RHF, normal flow on dopplers.
Fluid cytology negative for malignancy.
Appreciate hepatology recommendations who also agree that ascites is most likely from cardiac etiology.
# Diabetes Mellitus, type 2, well controlled: Glyburide discontinued on admission, given renal failure.
She had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia during her admission and required a D10 gtt.
Likely hepatic impairment of gluconeogenesis as well as impaired renal clearance are likely playing a role.
# ESRD on HD: Renal failure likely secondary to DM and HTN.
# Hypertension: Previously on regimen of labetalol, lisinopril, nifedipine, hydralazine, clonidine, and isosorbide.
No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
No evidence of new coronary event, troponin at baseline.
DFA for influenza was negative.
Continue dialysis for volume overload.
