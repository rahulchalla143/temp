STUDIES:  CXR [**2158-5-23**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Minimal subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base.
Small simple hepatic cyst.
Likely a scant trace of ascites in the perihepatic space; however, the amount is insufficient for paracentesis.
There is mild central intrahepatic biliary dilatation; however, the extrahepatic common bile duct is normal in size.
EGD [**2158-5-24**]: No esophageal varices seen.
Multiple erosions in the stomach body compatible with erosive gastritis Ulcer in the pre-pyloric region Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  KUB [**2158-5-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
No obstruction or free air.
Linear atelectasis in the left lung base.
Diffusely dilated small and large bowel with no transition point; limited progression of oral contrast; rectal tube in place - clinical correlation for patency may be considered.
Homogeneously enhancing pancreas and no signs of complications of pancreatitis.
Focal region of dilated biliary ducts in the left lobe of the liver of unclear clinical significance; perihepatic ascites and portosystemic umbilical shunt suggest a degree of portal hypertension.
No acute intracranial process.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 56 yo woman with hx ESLD, known varices, now presenting with abd pain, found to have melanotic stools, anemia and hypotension concerning for upper GIB.
Pt had EGD done which showed erosive gastritis and ulcer in the pre-pyloric region but no varices.
Her course was complicated by encephalopathy attributed to hepatic encephalopathy [**12-21**] bleed.
Resolved on admission without further episodes.
She was also given FFP and Vitamin K for elevated INR.
Her home diuretics were held in the ICU given bleed and concern for hypotension.
She had hyponatremia and they were held on discharge, however they should be restarted when sodium is normal to help combat ascites.
RUQ u/s showed patent vasculature and trace ascites, making SBP unlikely.
She had no focal neurologic findings.
Alcohol withdrawal was considered; however, given last reported drink > 1month ago this was thought to be unlikely.
CT head was obtained, which also showed no acute process, but did show bifrontal atrophy.
Abdominal pain: Most likely [**12-21**] known ulcer as discussed above.
Pt continued to have discomfort, and KUB showed possible ileus but no SBO.
Given increasing confusion, CT abdominal pelvis was done, which showed no acute change.
Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, likely in setting of recent stress from GIB vs. EtOH withdrawal vs. pain vs. PE.
Pt had some pain, likely from ulcer as discussed above.
No pulm sxs to suggest PE in addition to good O2 sats.
Pt appeared dry, and tachycardia improved with fluid resuscitation and albumin.
C3, C4 were mildly low and cryoglobulin was negative.
# Hyponatremia: mild, likely due to ESLD.
# Hypernatremia: [**12-21**] decreased access to free water in the MICU.
# Eczema: pt had erythematous macular rash on upper extremities.
Dermatology was consulted, and thought this was eczematous dermitis with overlying areas of purpura/ecchymosis due to low platelets.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Heritage Manor  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Upper GI bleed Ulcers H pylori infection  Secondary: Cirrhosis Alcohol abuse   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a bleed from your GI tract.
An endoscopy showed ulcers and an infection called H pylori which led to your bleed.
You were confused because of a build up of toxins due to your liver disease.
