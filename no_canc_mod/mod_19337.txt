Also, the abdomen is poorly penetrated, probably due to body habitus and overlying bowel gas.
A small amount of free fluid is seen in the abdomen, but not enough to tap.
Hepatic vessels are not well seen, probably due to poor penetration.
Right kidney measures 13.4 cm and is without evidence of hydronephrosis.
RENAL US: normal kidneys, small-mod ascites ABD MRI: Fatty infiltration of the liver, with a diffusely abnormal background appearance.
No focal hepatic lesions are seen.Splenomegaly.Gastroesophageal varices.
CXR: elevation of R hemidiaphragm   Brief Hospital Course:  52M with DM, HTN, admitted w/ acute onset jaundice in setting of history of EtOH abuse.
Transferred to the MICU for continued GI bleed, epistaxis, encephalopathy and nursing concerns.
* Hepatitis: Most likely alcoholic hepatitis, viral serologies were negative.
Hospital course was complicated by encephalopathy, persistent GI bleeding, and acute renal failure (likely hepato-renal syndrome), and he was treatd with octreotide, midodrine, and albumin.
MRCP showed esophageal varices, fatty infiltration.
Finally, a liver ultrasound did not reveal any evidence of obstruction or cholecystitis.
* Encephalopathy: Secondary to severe liver disease.
* GI Bleed: Pt had been having GI bleed several days prior to admission, and continued to have bloody stools following admission.
Endoscopy was deferred for high INR, then deferred given concern for respiratory failure requiring likely terminal intubation (contrary to the wishes to the patient).
An MRI did reveal gastroesophageal varices.
Goals of care were evaluated with patients family in setting of progressive disease and poor prognosis and he was made comfort measures only.
