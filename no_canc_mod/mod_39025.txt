Admission Date:  [**2131-11-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-12-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-10-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Atenolol / Ms Contin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 66 year-old man with a history of COPD, AAA, and HTN, recently discharged on [**2131-10-12**] after presenting with strep pneumonia requiring intubation, who presents with worsening dyspnea and is admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.
He was in his USOH until three days ago when he developed a cough productive of yellow/green sputum, dyspnea, and pleuritic left chest pain.
His symptoms progressively worsened and he presented to the ED for evaluation.
Exam was notable for the absence of wheezes and a CXR was read as interval improvement in previously present bibasilar infiltrates.
He was also complaining of pleuritic left chest pain.
He was given ceftriaxone/azithro, albuterol/atrovent nebs, solumedrol 125 and placed on CPAP for tachypnea and concern that he was tiring.
Past Medical History: COPD, admission to [**Hospital1 2177**] with COPD exacerbation last winter.
AAA HTN Hyperlipidemia Gout Osteoporosis, history of L1 burst fracture on chronic opioids for pain relief, l3 compresion fracture   Social History: History of EtOH abuse with beer, no history of illicit drug use.
HEENT: No conjunctival pallor, no scleral jaundice, PERRLA, EOMI, OP clear, no cervical LAD, no palpable thyroid nodules.
No hepatomegaly, No splenomegaly.
No abd bruits.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2131-11-30**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
CXR [**11-27**] IMPRESSION: Marked interval improvement in previous pattern of patchy bibasilar opacities.
Minimal residual linear opacities within the left mid lung field may represent the residual of prior infection.
No new areas of focal consolidation seen.
Severe emphysema.
Recent pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since [**2129**], most recently [**11-27**] and 6:  Coarse interstitial abnormality in the left lower lung has worsened accompanied by increase in small left pleural effusion and hypervascularity of the left lung.
The patient has severe emphysema, which is likely to make an otherwise easily recognizable process difficult to diagnose.
There is also coarsening of bronchiectasis and scarring in the right lung apex, which has progressed since [**11-27**].
Rather than ascribing this to a second concurrent infection such as tuberculosis, it could be another focus of asymmetric pulmonary edema.
CHEST X-RAY [**12-2**]  HISTORY: Short of breath, possible volume overload or pneumonia.
The lungs are hyperexpanded consistent with COPD as before.
There is scattered parenchymal scarring as demonstrated previously most pronounced in the upper lobes.
Coarse interstitial markings are again noted on the left.
There is no new, focal infiltrate.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in coarse interstitial markings in the lower left lung.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Aortic valve sclerosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year-old man with emphysema, AAA, HTN, and recent PNA who presented with dyspnea.
Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, with CHF exacerbation and exacerbation of severe COPD: Dyspnea in the context of leukocytosis and recent severe pneumonia requiring intubation initially felt to be hospital acquired pneumonia and he was treated for this.
Chest xray was read as possible asymmetric pulmonary edema, and a BNP was sent and it was elevated at around 2550.
An ECHO showed preserved systolic function.
Congestive heart failure, with preserved systolic function This diagnosis was discussed with the echocardiographer.
There is no indication for ace inhibitor or beta blocker.
Chronic lower back pain: continued percocet prn  His code status was full  Medications on Admission: 1.

Disp:*22 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Emphysema Congestive heart failure with preserved systolic function  Secondary: AAA   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**],  You were admitted because you felt short of breath.
You did not have a pneumonia again, but you did have extra fluid in the blood vessels in your lungs.
