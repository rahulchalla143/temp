Maternal history significant for CREST Syndrome/variant SLE (lupus) with leukocytoclastic vasculitis and Raynaud's.
Other medications included Prilosec and prenatal vitamins.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Normocephalic with a 2 cm incision noted above the right pinna.
2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen soft with active bowel sounds.

This oxygen requirement quickly resolved and he has been in room air since with O2 saturatons >95%.
The official EKG and ECHO reports will be included in the fax.
The ECHO on [**2180-5-22**] revealed: patent foramen ovale with left to right flow, small aortic valve annulus, unobstructed left ventricular outflow tract, trace aortic regurgitation, large patent ductus arteriosus with bidirectional flow, and possible coarctation with a small aortic isthmus (though could not be completely assessed in the presence of a large PDA).
ECHO on [**2180-5-23**]: very mild narrowing of the isthmus, no posterior [**Last Name (un) 67468**], no obstruction; small to moderate PDA with bidirectional flow; good biventricular function.
ECHO on [**2180-5-25**]: small PDA with bidirectional flow, no arch obstruction, right ventricular hypertension, and good left ventricular systolic function.
The infant continues to have a murmur and his baseline heart rate is 60-80.
The intent was to block any remaining maternal autoantibodies that had crossed the placenta and remained in the infant's circulation.
DERMATOLOGY: The infant had an approximately 2 cm laceration above the right pinna experienced during the Cesarean section.
No report of abnormal results to date.
