at home with rigors, as well as nausea and vomiting.
The patient noticed redness and swelling of the left lower extremity which started the night prior to admission.
He denied cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or abdominal pain.
Diabetes since age 11.
Coronary artery disease status post bypass in [**2126-8-27**].
Left foot metatarsal amputation in [**2127**].
Congestive heart failure.
Dry mucous membranes.
No jugular venous distention.
No murmurs appreciated.
Old CABG scar.
Back:  No CVA tenderness.
Abdomen:  Distended, soft, no tenderness to palpation.
Right lower quadrant scar (kidney transplant).
No erythema or swelling.
Left lower extremity foot partially amputated at the metatarsals.
Positive tenderness to palpation.
He had chronic dry left heel ulcer.
Ultrasound of the lower extremities negative.
Shortly thereafter, the patient developed delirium and the patient's white blood cell count continued to climb to 30,000, and he was clinically worsening.
He developed worsening renal function and increase in transaminases as well.
Blood tests showed elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen consistent with sepsis.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room with Vascular Surgery on [**2133-10-5**], for exploration and debridement.
CT of the leg did not demonstrate any abscess but the study was done without contrast due to renal impairment.
MRI was unable to be performed given that the patient had a surgical clip in the ethmoid sinus.
A LE Ultrasound was done which did not any focal fluid collections and a gallium scan was also done which confirmed these findings.
Surgical culture eventually grew Oxacillin resistant staph aureus.
He was afebrile for the remainder of his hospital course.
Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's creatinine began to trend up on admission and peaked at 4.0.
This was in the setting of sepsis from the leg infection but with careful fluid management and supportive treatment, his creatinine improved back to 2.0 on [**2133-10-12**] close to his baseline.
The patient initially had his immunosuppressants held except for the Prednisone given that he had an acute infection.
On transfer to the floor, the patient Lantus dose was increased to 54, and his Humalog Insulin sliding scale was tightened with improvement and control of his blood sugars.
Herpes labialis:  The patient had herpes lesions around his mouth, and given his immunocompromised state, he was started on Acyclovir for a 14-day course.
Delirium:  The patient's delirium was attributed to a combination of uremia and infection and had improved to near baseline at the time of discharge.
Elevated LFTs:  The patient had transaminases which elevated to the low 1000s after going to the Operating Room.
This was thought to be either due to shock liver secondary to hypertension or possible secondary to his anesthetic when he went to the Operating Room.
The LFTs continued to trend down throughout his hospital course without specific intervention.
Acute on chronic renal failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
Status post renal transplant.
History of severe peripheral vascular disease with      multiple amputations.
DIET:  Diabetic renal diet.
