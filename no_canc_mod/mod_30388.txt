Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Physical Exam: VS: T 100.2, BP 127/74, HR 111, RR 30, O2 98% on NRB, wt 78.5 kg  Gen: Older male in mild respiratory distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Bilateral crackles [**11-20**] way up, decreased breath sounds at L lower lung base.
NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Petechial rash on lower extremities.
Possible inferior myocardial infarction, age undetermined.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-6-9**] P waves are now visible, right bundle-branch block has resolved and the rate has increased somewhat.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2133-7-6**] at 3:43:34 PM There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The degrees of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation are similar.
ECG Study Date of [**2133-7-14**]  2:33:46 PM Atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm with left bundle-branch block pattern.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-7-13**] there is now one hundred percent atrial sensing and ventricular pacing.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 83 yo M with ESRD on HD (MWF), h/o a fib and PAT, baseline AV conduction delay, CAD, moderate MR, moderate AS who presented with acute shortness of breath on [**7-5**] and found to be in CHF.
# Pump/Acute Congestive heart failure: The patient appeared to have acute on chronic congestive heart failure with EF of 35% on last ECHO from [**5-26**].
He was clinically volume-overloaded on exam and CXR on presentation was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
It was felt that these symptoms were from his elevated blood pressure and prolonged tachycardia.
Given his volume overloaded status, the patient underwent urgent hemodialysis with marked improvement on exam as well as his oxygen requirements.
# Rhythm/Atrial Tachycardia: The patient and was known to have a history of atrial fibrillation with RVR as well as paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and he presented with a HR of 117.
The patient's home Coumadin regimen was held to prepare for the procedure and the patient underwent the ablation and pacer implantation without complications on [**7-13**].
# Valves: The patient had a history of Moderate (2+) MR, moderate AS, mild AI.
A repeat ECHO this admission showed little change in valvular disease.
# ESRD on HD:  The patient initially underwent several rounds of dialysis within the first 3 days of admission after which he resumed his normal 3 day per week hemodialysis schedule.
# Low grade fever: The patient presented with a cough and low grade fever of 100.2.
He otherwise denied any recent symptoms of infection.
He was noted to have a mild leukocytosis with neutrophil predominate.
Chest xray was without obvious infiltrate.
Urine analysis/culture were notable only for urine cultures positive for >3 species of bacteria, consistent with contamination.
Other than his initial presentation, the patient was afebrile throughout his hospitalization.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check your INR on Friday [**7-17**] and call results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], office: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 98045**], secretary [**Doctor First Name **]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 1468**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute on Chronic systolic Heart Failure Hypertension Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial tachycardia  Secondary: End Stage Renal disease on hemodialysis Fever   Discharge Condition: Patient is in good condition.
You had a very fast heart rate (atrial tachycardia), which we believe is the cause of your acute congestive heart failure.
You experienced hypertension during this hospital stay, which required a nitroglycerin drip and aggressive dialysis to remove fluid.
We started you on tylenol, extra strength, for pain at the pacer site.
Please return to the ED or your healthcare provider immediately if you experience increased shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, excessive fatigue, chills, fevers, swelling of your legs or feet, or difficulty lying flat.
Avoid extreme movements of your right arm such as reaching for objects or tucking your shirt in.
