Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
No new fluid collections or abscesses seen.
No free air or extraluminal oral contrast noted.
Limited evaluation of the stomach and pancreas due to patient motion.
Bulky pancreatic head with coarse calcifications, compatible with known chronic pancreatitis.
Large amount of fluid at the distal esophagus raises risk for aspiration.
Persistent moderate to severe intrahepatic biliary dilatation and interval increase in caliber of the proximal extrahepatic bile duct following removal of a prior biliary stents, with persistent obstruction of the CBD at the level of the pancreatic head.
Persistent moderate right hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter with site of ureteral caliber change at the level of the prior psoas abscesses.
Two surgical drains terminating within right psoas abscesses, which have decreased in size since [**2182-8-28**], and no longer demonstrate rim enhancement.
Neighboring hyperdense material likely reflects injected contrast from prior evaluation of the drains.

Moderate right hydronephrosis.
No acute intracranial process; however, please note that portions of the brain are suboptimally evaluated due to motion artifact.

Contrast from prior drain injection remains in both intra- and extra-luminal position, with contrast now seen in the rectum.
Gaseous dilatation of small and large bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels most compatible with ileus.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient well known for Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was transferred from OSH to the General Surgical Service for evaluation of acute UGIB and altered mental status.
On admission patient's HCT was 23.4, the patient underwent CT abdomen which showed no new collections, EGD showed friable necrotic tissue in fundus of stomach, possible gastric varices.
The patient was intubated and sedated s/t altered mental status.
On HD # 2, repeat EGD was stable, no active bleeding was detected, and patient received 2 units of pRBC.
Neurology was consulted and recommended head CT was negative for intracranial pathology.
Acute mental status change was thought to be secondary to multifactorial encephalopathy due to severe sepsis, uremia and abrupt discontinue of Methadone.
The had several episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia and Cardiology was consulted.
TTE revealed preserved biventricular systolic function and change in cardiac rate was secondary to increased vagal tone.
The patient was started on TPN for nutritional support.
On HD # 5 patient was transferred on the floor on TPN and clears, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, maintenance Methadone PO and IV Dilaudid for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received IV Dilaudid with good effect and adequate pain control.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
Patient's WBC started to improve on HD # 2, and he was afebrile after starting of antibiotics.
The patient's abscess culture came back positive for PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA and ID was called for consult.
Fistulogram of the right psoas abscess was positive for psoas drain-enteric fistula.
During this time patient remained afebrile with WBC within normal limits.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely; he received total 4 units of RBC during hospitalization.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Upper GI bleed with evidence of severe esophagitis 2.
Hepatic Encephalopathy 4.
Sinus Bradycardia 5.
Severe esophagitis and portal hypertensive gastropathy 6.
Psoas-enteric fistula   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you experience the following: *You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
