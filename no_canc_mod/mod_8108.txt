Admission Date:  [**2138-8-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2138-8-18**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old male transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital status post cardiac catheterization on the morning of admission for possible left circumflex intervention.
His cardiac history is as follows: In [**2126**] he had a coronary artery bypass graft with an SVG to PDA and SVG to diagonal graft.
From [**2126**] to [**2135**] the patient states that he has had three other cardiac catheterizations but denies the knowledge of having any intervention.
The patient complains of several months worth of substernal chest pain increasing in severity and frequency over the past few weeks.
The test was stopped due to dyspnea on exertion and EKG revealed non diagnostic ST changes, however, Cardiolite demonstrated a probable reversible defect involving the anteroseptal wall, apex and partial inferior wall.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] with a sheath in for a left circumflex intervention.
His coronary artery disease risk factors include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Tobacco and diabetes mellitus.
The patient has had subsequent polyp removals without complication, diabetes mellitus, diet controlled after significant weight loss, sleep apnea using bi-pap at home, radiculopathy, obesity, migraine headaches.
No history of TIA, CVA or melena/GI bleed.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  During his cardiac catheterization on the day of admission, there was a complication involving the PTCA/stent of OM causing jailing of his AV groove, left circumflex with loss of dissection of his lower OM.
Post procedure the patient experienced persistent chest pain, hypotension to the 60's/30's and was noted to have hematocrit drop from 44 to 34.9.
The patient had CT of abdomen and pelvis showing mild to moderate hematoma and no retroperitoneal bleed.
Patient also had several episodes of bradycardia requiring Atropine.
He was transferred to the CCU on [**8-13**] for further management of his chest pain, hypotension and decreased hematocrit.
The patient ruled in for an MI by enzymes, likely secondary to include OM/jailed AV groove, left circumflex with positive CKs which peaked at 763/45 on [**8-13**].
He continued to have mild to moderate pain intermittently on [**8-13**] and [**8-14**] without EKG changes in response to sublingual Nitroglycerin.
The patient's episodes of hypotension responded well to 4-6 liters of IV fluids on [**8-12**] to [**8-13**], as well as two units of packed red blood cells.
This was thought to be secondary to difference in blood pressure cuff measurements between the floor and CCU as his blood pressure was not as low when measured in the CCU after.
The patient had a bedside echo on [**8-12**] which was notable for a limited view of left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, no obvious effusion but could not rule out possible effusion, no tamponade was noted.
An official TTE on [**8-13**] showed post echo density consistent with pericardial effusion hematoma, etc.
The patient's initial hematocrit drop of 10 points may have reflected blood loss from two catheterizations and dilution after 4-6 liters of fluid resuscitation, however, he received two units of packed red blood cells on the morning of [**8-13**] and his hematocrit was checked [**Hospital1 **], remaining fairly stable.
The patient complained of increasing right groin pain and was found to have a right groin bruit on exam.
Ultrasound was done on [**8-14**] revealing a 5 by 3 bilobed pseudoaneurysm with a narrow neck associated with the right common femoral artery.
Coronary artery disease, status post PTCA stent of the upper pole of the OM, complicated by dissection and loss of the lower pull of the OM and jailing of the AV groove left circumflex.
Right femoral pseudoaneurysm status post successful thrombin injection.
Diabetes mellitus.
