Admission Date:  [**2167-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-10-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-10-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Slurred speech then unresponsiveness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG Tube placement [**10-2**] Tracheostomy, trach mask  [**10-2**]   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 67 year old man with hypertension, prior MI, on Coumadin, who developed slurred speech this AM.
c/o headache upon arrival to the [**Hospital3 **] ED.
Head CT revealed large R intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Past Medical History: - MI (10 years ago) - s/p cardiac arrest (in setting of MI) - Hypercholesterolemia - Hypertension  Social History: Was living with his wife prior to hospitalization.
eye movements not tested w/Doll's eye maneuver d/t presence of cervical collar.
+corneal reflexes bilaterally.
Unable to assess for facial droop d/t intubation and tape over face.
CN: tracks visually, opens eyes, left visual field cut (no blink to threat), perrlB, left facial droop Motor: right arm and leg with increased tone, but moving spontaneously with good hand grasp and resistance.
DTRs: [**Name2 (NI) 19912**] throughout arms and legs (crossed adductors in legs), no clonus.
Pertinent Results: [**2167-9-28**] PT 21.4 INR 3.14 PTT 36.8 Serum tox neg  HEAD CT [**2167-9-28**] - Large R basal ganglia/frontal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma (3.7x7.8) w/associated edema and moderate (1.1cm) midline shift leftward.
Large R intraventricular hematoma and small L intraventricular hematoma  [**2167-9-29**] - Slight worsening surrounding cytotoxic edema surrounding the R frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Worsening intraventricular hemorrhage.
[**2167-10-1**] - stable  EEG [**2167-10-7**] - Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features  BILATERAL LE ULTRASOUND [**2167-10-5**] - Occlusive superficial venous thrombosis w/in R greater saphenous vein extending to 1 cm from the junction with the common femoral vein.
Non-occlusive superficial venous thrombosis of the L lesser saphenous vein  [**2167-10-15**] - Interval resolution of thrombus w/in L lesser saphenous vein.
Occlusive thrombus w/in the R greater saphenous vein, now extending into the R common femoral vein.
No valvular mass or vegetation seen.
Mild AR, trivial TR.
Right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is approximately stable in size.
The degree of mass effect is approximately unchanged.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old man on Coumadin with very large R basal ganglia hemorrhage (>100cc) with intraventricular extension.
Hypertension (in the setting of elevated INR) is the most likely etiology of the hemorrhage given the patient's history and the location of the bleed.
Additional possibilities include AVM, aneurysm, or mass lesion.
Neuro - Increased intracranial pressure was initially managed with hyperventilation and Mannitol.
After approximately three weeks since admission, the patient began to have signs of improvement of neurological status.
Transitioned to Metoprolol, Diltiazem was added for improved rate control of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The week of [**10-19**], he had increased heart rate with low blood pressures, and was unable to tolerate these antihypertensives.
ID - At the time of admission, Pt was being treated with Keflex for a LLE cellulitis.
Extensive fever workup (in conjunction with consulting ID service) included multiple negative blood, urine and sputum cultures, negative Cdiff, negative chest/abd/pelvis CT, and negative echocardiogram (no vegetations).
One out of >10 blood cultures  grew two colonies of coag negative staph at >24hours, thought to represent a contaminated specimen.
Fever resolved on [**10-15**], exact source of fever remained unclear.
However, he then had a repeat fever on [**10-16**], and had positive lower extremity ultrasounds for clot in the femoral vein.
ID was involved and suggested discontinuing all antibiotics when he had low-grade temperatures.
This was felt to be likely related to "central fever," with his intracranial damage.
This was significant for some uptake at the trach site, which could be consistent with the presence of granulation tissue from placement in late [**Month (only) **].
This was not considered his fever source, thus the source was considered to be "central fever," which can occur in patients with significant head injury.
If infection is suspected, other markers should be used for workup-- ie, increased secretions or cough, low O2 sats, diarrhea, hematuria, etc.
Superficial LE thrombi, now with non-occlusive thrombus in the R common femoral vein.
On [**10-16**], lower extremity ultrasounds were performed to look for lower ext DVTs and initially found superficial clot only.
Repeat scan 10 days later showed extension of the right superficial saphenous clot into the common femoral(non-occlusive).
C-spine imaging negative for fracture, but patient must be awake and able to answer "yes" or "no" to pain in order for his c-spine to be cleared.
Endo - Normoglycemia maintained with insulin sliding scale as an inpatient.
CN: tracks visually, opens eyes, left visual field cut (no blink to threat), perrlB, left facial droop Motor: right arm and leg with increased tone, but moving spontaneously with good hand grasp and resistance.
DTRs: [**Name2 (NI) 19912**] throughout arms and legs (crossed adductors in legs), no clonus.
Discharge Instructions: Patient has had a large intraparenchymal bleed, with improving neurological function but still with major deficits.
Coumadin was initially held but restarted when he had a venous thrombus in the leg; the goal INR should be 1.5-2.5 and no higher.
