On ROS on presentation, c/o some mild increased SOB from baseline, but otherwise denied CP/pressure, orthopnea/PND, nausea, headache, dizziness, orthopnea/PND, fevers/chills, any other complaints.
She had been electively intubated for procedure given h/o sleep apnea, obesity, and likely inability to lie flat to tolerate procedure.

IMPRESSION: Moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: This 76-year old female with known aortic stenosis recently discharged after median sternotomy for possible AVR presented with new onset aflutter, receiving ablation which induced complete heart block with subsequent pacemaker placement.
Rhythm - Patient had atrial flutter with a heart rate in the 130's on presentation and was placed on amiodorone, PO metoprolol, diltiazem gtt, and heparin gtt.
Patient had a catherization for ablation of the atrial flutter with His-ventricular delay, which prompted pacer placement.
Pulmonary - Patient was electively intubated for procedure [**7-3**], given elevated respirator risk with h/o OSA and inability to lie flat with sheath post-procedure.
After arrival to the floor, patient showed signs of fluid overload, which prompted gentle diuresis.
Pump - Patient has mitral and aortic valve disease, presenting with volume overload, which prompted active diuresis and likely contributed to inability to wean from ventilator initially.
Advised patient avoid nsaid use for concern for fluid accumulation.
Hypertension - Patient's medication list showed patient was on norvasc and prazosin prior to admit.
Aortic aneurysm - Patient was noted to have aortic aneurysm on recent surgery.
Lisinopril was started qd for optimal control, but with caution given aortic stenosis.
