HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 59-year-old African American male with severe hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with abdominal pain and pruritus.
Work-up at that time revealed an amylase at 207, a lipase at 342, and an abdominal ultrasound showing a hyperechoic pancreas.
Patient's abdominal pain decreased quickly and was weaned off morphine sulfate and the patient was also treated for hypertension with a blood pressure of 230/100 by increasing his clonidine.
The patient developed worsening abdominal pain and also became very weak.
He denies any nausea or vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath.
Patient presented to the [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2184-1-29**] in the afternoon with complaints of abdominal pain and pruritus.
Patient was afebrile, normotensive, but mildly tachypneic.
Laboratories revealed worsening renal failure with a BUN and a creatinine of 125/11.3, and diabetic ketoacidosis.
Upon arrival, the patient complained of [**11-19**] midsternal chest pain and also complained of mid abdominal, epigastric pain.
He denied any shortness of breath, but did have nausea and did vomit bright red, maroonish blood in the ambulance.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus since [**2150**].
Peptic ulcer disease.
Degenerative joint disease at the left hip.
Prostate cancer, diagnosed in [**2177**], status post prostatectomy, left pyelonephritis secondary to abscesses.
Progressive renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 7.0.
Elevated PTH.
Bilateral carotid calcification.
Father passed away from lung cancer at age 73.
One brother with coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, the patient is a large, younger than his stated age, appearing African American male in no acute distress.
Neck:  Supple, jugular venous pressure at 6 cm.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic with 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla.
Gastrointestinal:  Positive bowel sounds, tender in the mid and right middle quadrant.
Extremities:  2+ pitting edema at the left ankle, trace edema on the right.
Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm with ST elevations in V1 to V3 approximately 1 mm.
ST depression in V4 through V6 approximately 3 mm.
Electrocardiogram number two revealed normal sinus rhythm with resolution of ST changes.
Chest x-ray:  Cardiomegaly without effusions.
No pulmonary infiltrates.
Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The patient was admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis.
The patient did have an episode of hypoglycemia with a fingerstick of 21 on [**2184-2-5**], after the patient received his morning insulin dose, without having eaten breakfast.
Ischemia:  The patient had intermittent episodes of chest pain during his hospital stay.
Patient noted to have ST depressions in V4 through V6.
Patient was taken to cardiac catheterization on [**2184-2-2**], however, the cardiac catheterization had to be cancelled secondary to the patient being unable to tolerate the procedure because of pain from his spinal stenosis.
Patient, therefore, underwent a Persantine MIBI on [**2184-2-6**] which revealed a normal study with an ejection fraction of 50% and no perfusion defects.
Patient did not have any further episodes of chest pain from [**2-4**] onward.
Hypertension:  As noted above, the patient's blood pressure remained elevated during his hospital stay and was a [**Last Name **] problem.
Patient's hypertension also was helped with hemodialysis.
Patient did not have any further episodes of hematemesis or melena during his hospital stay and the patient's hematocrit remained stable after his initial transfusion.
It was thought that the oozing was secondary to uremic platelet dysfunction and DDAVP was given with success in stopping the oozing.
In addition, the patient had a PICC line placed in his left arm for intravenous access since the patient had poor peripheral access.
At the time of the PICC placement, it was noted under fluoroscopy that the patient had a left subclavian occlusion with multiple collaterals.
Despite the presence of the occlusion, a PICC line was still inserted given that the patient had absolutely no intravenous access elsewhere.
The PICC line, however, was pulled on [**2184-2-6**] result of the patient having increasing left arm swelling after the placement of the PICC line.
The patient tolerated hemodialysis well and the Renal Service is discussing with the family future options for peritoneal Dialysis and hemodialysis via an AV fistula.
The patient should follow-up in Transplant Surgery Clinic for re-evaluation of these procedures.
Infectious Disease:  Patient was noted to have [**2-14**] blood cultures positive for corynebacteria and Peptostreptococcus.
It was thought that these positive blood cultures were likely secondary to contamination.
