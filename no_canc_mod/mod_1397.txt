The patient had an Echo in [**2183**] significant for mild to moderate aortic stenosis.
He denies loss of consciousness or head trauma with these episodes.
He has had no chest pain/shortness of breath/nausea/vomiting/diaphoresis.
He has noticed swelling in his lower extremities over the past 1.5 weeks.
He reports that his abdominal girth has been present for several years and is stable.
He denies blood but notes that his stool has been lighter in color than normal.
Past Medical History: 1.Aortic stenosis - Echo [**2183**]: EF>65%, ao valve area 1.2 cm2, gradient of 30, mild concentric LVH, no resting LV outflow obstruction, mild TR, mild to mod AS 3.HTN 4.Aspiration PNA 5.Dysphagia s/p PEG, now removed 6.PUD ??????

Left carotid bruit.
+ fluid wave.
Small liver span.
Unable to assess for splenomegaly.
EXT: Symmetric pitting edema to the thighs.
Ascites The patient displayed a tense abdomen.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed a large amount of ascites and a small nodular liver suggestive of cirrhosis.
A diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis was performed and 5L of ascitic fluid were removed.
Following the procedure, the patient continued to drain a large amount of clear ascitic fluid from the site.
These findings were considered suggestive of portal hypertension.
The etiology of the elevated lymphocyte count is unclear but concerning.
The patient had a second diagnostic paracentesis when he developed a change in mental status and elevated white count.
Cell counts were not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Cirrhosis The cause of the patient's cirrhosis is unknown.
Viral hepatitis serologies were negative.
The patient exhibited episodes of disorientation, and an ammonia level returned elevated.
Ischemic colitis An abdominal CT was suggestive of mesenteric ischemia.
Portal vein thrombosis He continued to reaccumulate ascites despite paracentesis and diuretic therapy, so an abdominal ultrasound was repeated.
This was significant for partial portal vein thrombosis.
An EGD was significant for portal gastropathy but revealed no esophageal varices.
However, given the patient's high risk of bleeding, including his history of several falls and his portal gastropathy, anticoagulation was held.
Aortic Stenosis The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed only mildly worsened aortic stenosis.
His physical exam on admission was suggestive of left and right sided heart failure and improved with diuresis.
R/O MI An EKG was significant for NSR, LVH, and ST depressions laterally.
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
Elevated BUN, Cr, K+ The patient's comprimised renal function was likely due to a combination of intravascular volume depletion and CHF-induced prerenal disease.
Left carotid bruit It was unclear if this is a true bruit or a radiation or his heart murmur.
Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition The patient was admitted with a sodium restricted diabetic diet.
After the development of ischemic colitis and portal vein thrombosis, he was placed on a low-protein, low-sodium, low-residue diet.
Return to the emergency department if you develop fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, or other new or worrisome symptoms.
