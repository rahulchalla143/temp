She has had multiple past admissions for CHF, PNA and/or asthma exacerbations but has never been intubated (except for surgeries) or admitted to the ICU.
She initially presented to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital ED where she was dyspneic and hypoxic.
She reported worsening dyspnea at home over the past 3-4 [**Known lastname **] as well as fevers and cough productive of whitish sputum.
Of note, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 882**] records, home VNA had measured low SBPs and had asked her to hold her blood pressure medications during this time (past 3-4days) as well as her lasix due to elevated creatinine.
She denies chest pain, chills, or GI discomfort.
At [**Hospital1 882**], she was treated for CHF exacerbation as BNP was 5400 with 60mg IV lasix as well as COPD exacerbation with 60mg PO prednisone, 750mg levofloxacin and 1 round of duonebs.
Her exam was notable for b/l wheeze and b/l LE edema.
Repeat CXR c/w findings of moderate CHF and volume overload.
She was started on CPAP in the ED, given another 40mg IV lasix, duonebs x3 and 2g IV Mg. After being on CPAP mask for 1.5 hrs, she was still unable to take mask off due to respiratory difficulty.
An ABG was done but not processed due to labelling errors.

Minimal calcification of the aortic knob is present.
There is fullness of the hila bilaterally and mild indistinctness of the pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

Exclusion of left costophrenic angle.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 obese AAF w/ OSA on CPAP, asthma and dCHF here w/ dyspnea requiring CPAP, likely due to CHF exacerbation [**3-1**] viral URI.
DYSPNEA, influeza, acute diastolic CHF, COPD exacerbation: In the MICU the patient's dyspnea was felt to be multifactorial but primarily due to a CHF exacerbation in the setting of a viral illness (influenza swab positive) and being off of her home lasix for several [**Known lastname **].
An echo was ordered for further evaluation of her cardiac function.
Initially it was felt that a bacterial pneumonia and asthma/COPD exacerbation could be contributing to her dyspnea, so the patient received initial doses of levofloxacin and prednisone, but these were soon discontinued when it was clear that a viral etiology and CHF were the more likely precipitants.
The patient did remain wheezy on exam with little to no improvement after neb treatments, so it was felt that she had more of a cardiac than asthmatic wheeze.
Although she had a multifactorial etiology for her hypoxia (which initially included influenza and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure) it was felt that her viral illness tipped her into COPD exacerbation as well.
