Her issues during her hospital stay were as follows:  ID: The pt was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of endometritis v. intra-abdominal infection s/p chorioamnionitis and Cesarean section v. pyelonephritis.
General surgery and gynecologic oncology consults were obtained, and expectant management with percutaneous drainage of her absceses was agreed upon as a reasonable option.
She was transferred to the ICU on HD#2 when her clinical picture became suspicious for sepsis.
She underwent transvaginal drainage of one of her pelvic abscesses and her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl; she improved, and was called out of the ICU on HD#3.
She underwent percutaneous drainage of one abdominal fluid collection on HD#5, and another on HD#10.
She continued to have intermittently elevated temperatures and leukocytosis until HD#20 when she began spiking high fevers again despite continuation of her antibiotics.
Cardiac: The pt was tachycardic on admission, attributed to her infection and fever.
Her heart rate elevations correlated with temperature spikes.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**12-6**] was normal; a repeat obtained in the ICU after her surgery showed evidence of new RV dilatation and hypokinesis concerning for cardiomyopathy.
Pulmonary: The pt was ruled out for a PE in the ED upon admission.
CXR showed evidence of a developing PNA.
Her echocardiogram on [**12-17**] was concerning for PE and she underwent another CTA, which was negative.
The nephrology team was consulted, and the most likely etiology was presumed to be persistent infection/sepsis as well as IV contrast nephropathy.
She was managed conservatively until HD#2 when her clinical picture became suspicious for sepsis, and an NG tube was placed.
Heme: The pt was noted to have a coagulopathy on admission, etiology unclear in the setting of normal LFTs.
Her albumin was also noted to be low, raising the possibility of a nutritional deficiency as the inciting factor.
She received FFP prior to all surgical procedures and did not have problems with excessive bleeding.
Prior to her exploratory laparotomy, she had a transfusion reaction to the first unit of FFP she received.
She was medicated with antihistamines and her symptoms resolved; she was able to tolerate her second unit without difficulty.
