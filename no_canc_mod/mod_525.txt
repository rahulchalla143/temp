Admission Date:  [**2145-7-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-7-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-7-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R IJ - intubation -  History of Present Illness: 48M with h/o severe COPD (on 2-5L home O2), presenting to OSH with 2-3wk of increased SOB, with cough productive of yellow/white sputum, though per his wife, no clear fevers, chest pain, n/v, abd pain, diarrhea, rash, joint pains.
CXR c/w CHF, ECG showed sinus, no ste/std.
He was treated for CHF, and COPD flare with 120mg iv lasix x1 @ 17:35, duonebs, solumedrol 125mg iv x 1.
CXR with poor inspiratory effort, bilateral effusion, and interstitial markings c/w pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly.
ECG reveals nsr, non-specific t-wave changes.
He received CTX empirically for ?cellulitis/pna (levaquin avoided [**2-15**] coumadin dosing), and was admitted for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Past Medical History: - DM2 - on insulin - CHF - AVR in [**2134**] (metal valve, st. [**Male First Name (un) **], @ [**Hospital1 112**] x2) - cardiologist is [**Hospital3 **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5980**].
- COPD prescribed 2L NC at home, but for past 2 weeks on 5L NC.
- chronic venous stasis changes B LE.
- h/o schizophrenia, psychotic disorder.
HEENT: s/p left ear trauma, oozing from trauma site.
Neck: supple, unable to assess JVP 2/2 habitus, no LAD Lungs: bilateral coarse ronchi and crackles, minimal wheezing.
CV: regular rate, normal S1 + S2, no appreciable murmurs, rubs, gallops.
new echymotic region expanding over epigastrium.
bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding Ext: Warm, ?1+ pulses, 1+ edema to knees, chronic venous stasis changes, with multiple <1cm areas of drainage, non-purulent, oozing blood.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position suggestive of right ventricular volume overload.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
?Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hyopokinesis.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define the severity of mitral regurgitation.
<b> LABS ON DISCHARGE ([**7-20**]) <b>  Chem 7 137  91  11  113   AGap=8 3.1  41  0.8  Ca: 8.6 Mg: 2.1 P: 2.6  CBC: 3.7 > 7.9 / 26.4 < 98  PT: 20.7  PTT: 65.5  INR: 1.9  ABG: 7.48 / 58 / 49 / 44 / 16  Iron: 20 calTIBC: 371 Ferritn: 97 TRF: 285  Brief Hospital Course: # Dyspnea - The patient's chief complaint on admission was dyspnea.
It was felt that this dyspnea was consistent with a CHF exacerbation.
Although, based on his lung exam with wheezing and rhonchi, it was felt that there was also a COPD component to the patient's dyspnea.
Over the course of his initial ICU stay, he was treated with IV solumedrol, nebs, and cepodoxime/azithromycin for COPD flare.
Around midnight of that day, he was noted to have increased agitation.
He was then noted to become hypoxic and tachypneic.
He was evaluated by the floor team and noted to have diffuse crackles without significant wheezing.
He was given lasix but remained tachypneic low oxygen sats.
A CXR revealed bilateral opacification consistent pulmonary edema or new LUL infiltrate.
Additionally, he was visibly oozing from his left face wound, his nose, and his lower extremity chronic venous stasis ulcers.
He was treated as a flash pulmonary edema case; he also completed a 7 day course of vanco/zosyn for possible hospital acquired pneumonia.
Finally, based on his anatomy and observing him at sleep in the morning, he also may have a component of obstructive sleep apnea which may contribute to his pulmonary problems.
# CHF - As stated above, when the patient was admitted, it was determined that some of his dyspnea was secondary to a CHF exacerbation.
Echo done on [**2145-7-7**] showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hyopokinesis, and moderate mitral regurgitation.
However, after his readmission to the ICU and intubation, he did have some episodes of hypotension.
Given the diastolic nature of his failure and no recent history of atrial fibrilation we decided to stop the patient's digoxin.
His diltiazem had also been discontinued at admission as he remained normotensive.
Diltiazem and lisinopril may need to be restarted if he returns to hypertensive state, particularly his lisinopril from which he would likely derive benefit both for CHF and renal protection.
# COPD - As stated above, on admission, it was also believed that some of the patient's dyspnea was associated with a COPD exacerbation component.
He was ronchorous and tight with wheezing on his initial MICU exam.
# Hyponatremia - The patient also presented with hyponatremia.
It was believed that this hyponatremia was secondary to fluid overload.
His hyponatremia had resolved by the third day of admission and remained stable across the remainder of his admission.
# Hypotension - After his readmission to the MICU and intubation, the patient had some problems with hypotension.
It was felt that this was most likely secondary to repeated sedation boluses.
Furthermore, the patient had some problems with bleeding from his oropharyngeal cavity after intubation.
# Oropharyngeal bleeding - As mentioned above, the patient had profuse bleeding during intubation.
This was felt to likely be oropharyngeal trauma in the setting a supratherapeutic PTT.
He also had dark maroon aspirated from his OG tube.
By the time of his discharge from the MICU, the patient had a low but stable hematocrit between 25 and 27 and without further signs of esophageal or oropharyngeal bleeding.
# Bleeding from wounds - Mr. [**Known lastname 5981**] had a scab on his right face that he sometimes compulsively picked at despite expressing a wish not to, and for some time needed constant bandage changes in the setting of heparin and coumadin.
Additionally, he had a central line pulled and the scab at this site was stable, he did not pick at it, and there was no further bleeding.
He also has chronic bleeding from his lower extremity wound, described below.
# Cytopenia - The patient remained thrombocytopenic across his entire admission, with platelet counts averaging approximately 90-100.
He also had a low white count, and was anemic.
The most likely explanation for this is that he was nutritionally and metabolically challenged by his acute illness episode and that it will take some time to rebuild his cell lines.
This should be followed as an outpatient and if it does not resolve as he continues to recover from his acute illness episode, he may warrant workup for hematologic problems.
# Anticoagulation - Because of his mechanical aortic valve, the patient has a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
On admission, he had a supratherapeutic INR and his coumadin was held.
# DM - The patient was put on sliding scale insulin while he was in the hospital.
# Lower Extremity Skin Changes - The patient had skin changes in his lower extremities that were consisent with chronic venous changes.
Additionally, he has a wound on his left cheek that bled frequently.
Dressing changes and wound care were provided by his nurses.
# H/o Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorder - Throughout his ICU course, the patient had several incidents of wanted to leave AMA.
However, the patient's trazodone dose was held at half its original amount secondary to sedation.
The patient continued to be somnolent and was therefore discharged on this lower dose (300mg) of trazadone, which might be increased if he continues to have sleep problems.

While you were in the hospital we stopped some of your medications.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency department if you experience any of the following: increased shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing up blood, vomiting blood, bloody stool, bloody urine, severe headache, loss of consciousness, or any other concerning symptoms.
Please also return to the emergency department if you experience bleeding from any part of your body that lasts more than 5 minutes or involves the loss of significant amounts (more than a few teaspoons) or blood.
