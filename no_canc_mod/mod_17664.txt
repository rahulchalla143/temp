He was found to be unresponsive on the scene and posturing.
He received a CT of the head which showed a large right-sided subdural hemorrhage with some subarachnoid hemorrhage as well.
There was obliteration of the adjacent sulfi with mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
There was some soft tissue hemorrhage seen in the posterior region of the brain and there was an air fluid level noted in the right maxillary sinus.
Due to the patient's severely depressed [**Location (un) 2611**] coma score, minimal responsiveness, and the significant CT head findings, he was emergently taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a craniotomy.
The patient did not meet apnea [**Doctor Last Name **] protocol nor did he ever have a cerebral profusion scan to show that he had evidence of brain death.
However, follow-up CT postoperatively showed evidence of uncal herniation.
He did have a gag reflex and was intermittently having spontaneously respiratory efforts.
Due to blood pressure control with intravenous drips and serial CT scans, after extensive discussions with the family, ultimately the decision for withdrawal of care was decided upon by the family once the patient demonstrated no obvious neurological recovery.
The remainder of the patient's radiographic surveys and laboratory tests are of little importance given the severity of his primary brain injury.
He did not appear to have any other obvious traumatic injury.
