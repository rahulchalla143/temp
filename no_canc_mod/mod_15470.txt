She has had no cardiovascular instability since her ligation.
However, she does have a remaining vibratory systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur which is most consistent with a Still's murmur.
She was transitioned to conventional ventilation on [**2180-4-27**] after her chest x-ray was reflective of patchy atelectasis and inhomogeneity which might be better treated with conventional ventilation.
She is currently on Chlorthiazide which was started approximately three days ago and has already resulted in a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.
Her most recent chest x-ray was actually improved versus her previous chest x-rays with less chronic lung changes and much less inhomogeneity without signs of atelectasis.
Her pressures had been increased by 1 on the positive end-airway pressure and 1 on the positive end-expiratory pressure approximately two days ago secondary to a picture of frequent desaturations.
She had undergone several courses of indomethacin therapy and had not attained any significant volume at feedings secondary to her persistent patent ductus arteriosus.
She has no spits.
Of note, her stools have been recently slightly heme-positive and she has a small anal fissure.
HEMATOLOGIC AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  At the time of her patent ductus arteriosus ligation, baby girl [**Name (NI) 49775**] was completing a 14-day course of amphotericin B as well as ceftazidime secondary to a probable pneumonia with a tracheal aspirate which grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans as well as Morganella morganii.
She remained off of antibiotics until [**2180-4-28**] when she started a 7-day course of oxacillin and gentamicin secondary to a tracheal aspirate which had grown out gram-negative rods as well as gram-positive cocci.
The organisms were ultimately identified as Staphylococcus aureus as well as Morganella morganii again.
Of note, [**Known lastname **] had thermal lability overnight from [**5-4**] to [**2180-5-5**] in which her temperature was as high as 102 and then was as low as 97 while out of her isolette.
It was felt by her care team that her temperature lability was secondary environmental factors, and she has had no further episodes of thermal lability and is currently thermal stable in her isolette.
She is currently being watched closely for further signs or symptoms of sepsis and will be started on antibiotics if necessary.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  As noted, baby [**Name (NI) 49775**] had two ultrasounds on day of life four and day of life nine; both of which were without signs of intraventricular hemorrhage.
She has had a follow-up head ultrasound on [**2180-4-18**] which was also normal; without signs of intracranial hemorrhage, and another head ultrasound is planned on day of life 60.
She has also had an initial eye examination which was obtained on day of life 39 and was reflective of immature retinae bilaterally.
We will continue to make every effort to keep her parents informed of her clinical progress.
