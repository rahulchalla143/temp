Admission Date:  [**2181-11-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-9-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central line placement  History of Present Illness: 77 y.o.
male with HTN, diabetes, COPD on home O2 s/p admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (3) 107406**] for MRSA PNA and COPD requiring intubation and trach placement on [**2181-10-22**] now presents from rehab facility with progressive hypoxia and somnolence.
HTN 2.
COPD on home O2 PFTs [**9-5**]: "FVC:moderately to severely reduced.
Flow-Volume Loop: Marked expiratory coving and reduced volume excursion.
Impression: Marked obstructive ventilatory defect.
The patient's son states, "my dad would be happy just to sit an watch a ball game, even with trach and PEG"   Family History: [**Name (NI) 1094**] father died of bleeding complications from PUD.
No fhx of cad or lung disease.
Opens eye to pain, but not to deep sternal rub or voice.
No spontaneous nystagmus.
No murmurs Pulm: Rales at bases b/l.
Decreased breath sounds throughout.
No obvious pain with palpation.
male with COPD on home O2 now s/p trach/PEG [**10-22**] during admission for MRSA PNA presented from rehab with progessive hypoxemia x 1 week and acute renal failure.
An Echo with bubble study was performed to assess for shunt showed no shunt.
With concern for PE lower extremity ultrasounds were performed and were negative.
However as he continued to be hypoxic he was started on Heparin drip for possible PE given new RV dilation and Pulm HTN on Echo [**2181-11-12**].
Heparin also continued for AFib and Left IJ clot.
CTA was not performed due to renal failure.
On [**11-26**] had increased secretions around trach site but not so much from suctioning; continued pulmonary toilet.
He also required antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia.
On [**12-6**] he passed away from cardiovascular collapse after requiring four pressors with no blood pressure response.
Secondary issues Hypercapnic Resp Failure - likely has high pCO2 at baseline given severe COPD.
pCO2 was maintained in the 50's with a strategy of permissive hypercapnea.
He was treated with steroids given his underlying COPD.
He grew GPC in his sputum [**11-24**] with acute worsening including fever and hypotension.
On [**11-26**] sources of infection likely MRSA VAP or peri-trachostomy abscess/tracheobronchitis.
He was briefly in tigarcillin and gent for history of acinitobacter in his sputum however this was discontinued when he grew MRSA.
On [**12-5**] his pressor requirement increased dramatically, he was maxed out on four pressors at the time of his death.
Acid-Base: On [**11-26**] he had a metabolic acidosis with anion gap; lactate was only 1.6 but BUN 130's.
Thus it was felt his metabolic acidosis was from uremia.
He later had dialysis via a right femoral catheter however there were difficulties with flow.
Anemia - He had several drops in his HCT, unclear if dilutional or acute blood loss, he was guiaic positive on multiple occasions.
Delta MS - He was noted to be less interactive, likely due to sepsis.
Head CT only c/w atrophy and small vessel ischemia, old.
Attempts to wean this off by starting SC long acting insulin were not successful, likely due to poor SC absorption.
