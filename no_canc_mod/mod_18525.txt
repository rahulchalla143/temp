Admission Date:  [**2120-10-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-11-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**] Chief Complaint: tx from OSH with resp failure and left hum fracture.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation x 2  History of Present Illness: This is a pleasant 83 year-old woman with history of htn, hypothyroidism, parox afib, hip fracture 4 years ago and s/p b/l mastectomy for breast cancer transferred from [**Hospital3 12594**] after fracturing her left humerus on [**9-28**] s/p ORIF, anemia-guiaic positive requiring transfusion-neg egd-(esophagitis and gastroparesis), no colonoscopy done due to instability, with d/c to rehab on [**10-3**], then re-admitted [**10-4**] with resp distress, initially thought [**3-6**] pneumonia, placed on broad spectrum abx, spiked fever on [**10-5**], ICU stay without intubation, but [**3-6**] high o2 requirement serial CT's done and revealed interstitial fibrosis and b/l ground glass opacities.
Has been afebrile since [**10-5**], on zosyn/vanc until [**10-11**], switched to levoquin at that time.
Because of CT findings, diff expanded to possible amio toxicity (for afib on for years w/o previous problems), pulm fibrosis, alv proteionisis, fat embolism and steroids were started.
She reports no fevers over past few days, stable largely non-productive cough.
.. She feels comfortable, has some pain in left arm which is better after iv pain meds.
No other sign complaints at this time.
Past Medical History: hypertension hypothyroidism paf ?ischemic coronary disease by records (only 1 note--no details) hip fracture 4 years ago s/p b/l mastectomy for breast cancer, on tamoxifen.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS:  Temp:  99.4   BP:  130 /62   HR:66   RR:  93% on non-rebreather, desats to low-mid 80's on 5liters  O2sat  general: Non-rebreather, speaks in full sentences, not significantly tachypneic or working hard to breath, discomfort [**3-6**] to left humeral fracture HEENT: PERLLA, EOMI, anicteric, no scleral icterus, no sinus tenderness, MMM, op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules lungs: mild inspiratory crackles at the right mid lung field, o/w no wheezes or rhonchi, moving air well heart: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, II/VI SEM at RUSB without radiation, rubs or gallops appreciated abdomen: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly extremities: no cyanosis, clubbing or edema skin/nails: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters neuro: AAOx3.
IMAGING: Chest CT [**2120-10-13**]: ground glass opacities with upper lobe predominance, septal thickening, associated pleural effusions, small mediastinal lymphadenopathy, dilated esophagus, cardiomegaly .
Comminuted left humeral head fracture, not transfixed by the large indwelling pins.
Small fracture fragments within the shoulder joint.
Diffuse abnormalities within the left lung worrisome for infectious/inflammatory process.
Diffuse ground glass opacities with traction bronchiectasis consistent with the diagnosis of ARDS, with associated organizing fibrosis.
Although the etiology of ARDS is uncertain, hyperdensity of the liver raises the concern for drug reaction from amiodarone toxicity as a potential cause of ARDS.
Increasing dense consolidation in the right upper lobe and medial right lower lobe, which could represent superimposed acute infection.
Increasing bilateral pleural effusions with a moderate-to-severe right pleural effusion and a moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
Since the prior study, there has been improvement in the right lower lobe and left perihilar opacities, although there is persistent opacity in the lateral aspect of the left mid lung.
Most likely this represents a degree of infiltrate superimposed on increased interstitial markings consistent with CHF.
IMPRESSION: Overall, there has been a slight improvement in the degree of pulmonary opacities bilaterally.
Underlying interstitial process remains essentially unchanged.
Bronchial washings: Rare atypical epithelial cells, numerous neutrophils and bacteria.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
MICROBIOLOGY: c diff neg x 3, toxin B: pending VRE UTI by cx [**2120-11-7**] [**2120-11-2**]: mod MRSA in sputum pl fld [**2120-10-26**]: rare MRSA BAL [**10-14**] and [**2120-10-25**]: HSV 1, 10-100K MRSA   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: This is an 83 year-old woman with history of htn, hypothyroidism, paf who suffered humeral fracture on [**9-28**] s/p ORIF at [**Hospital6 19155**] which failed.
Patient was sent to rehab [**10-3**] but returned the following day with hypoxic respiratory failure and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She suffered progressive respiratory failure and was eventually made CMO and passed.
# Fever/ID: Was not spiking fevers during first week of hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] while off of antibiotics.
Pneumonia not thought to be bacterial, initially.
We treated given we had no other diagnosis.
- Gave fluconazole for [**Month/Year (2) 1065**] uti (x2days =[**2034-10-19**]) - Pt extuabed [**10-21**], but had further resp distress and vomiting, possible aspiration.
new PNA vs C diff (toxin B pending) .
- extubated [**10-21**] but not doing well on 100% face mask, decompensation due to derecruitment.
CXR consistent with aspiration vs derecruitment.
- Chest CT showed worsening of parenchyma but also bilateral effusions.
Second bronch performed but cx negative.
Chest tube placed 9/23-4 overnight for pneumo post bronch or due to coughing against tube.
- PTX resolved and CT d/c - subsequent sputum cx grew out MRSA, patient tx w/ course of vancomycin and was again ready for extubation - d/w patient and family led to decision to change code status to DNR/DNI - following extubation, patient again began to fail, presumably due to CHF and likely aspiration - d/w family and patient led to decision to change plan of care to CMO - patient started on morphine gtt and was stable o/n off lasix gtt w/ permissive po's - in the AM, family requested d/c 100% NRB and patient expired w/in approximately 15 minutes from respiratory arrest .
# Diarrhea: C diff neg x 3.
Possibly related to antibx or catharsis from gib.
# CV: a) ischemia: no clear h/o ischemic disease.
b) pump: unclear history, otherwise initially appeared euvolemic to dry, chf possible contribution to hypoxia, ground glass opacities and positive proBNP.
Developed fluid overload in setting of possible ARF.
c) rhythm: h/o paroxysmal AF, not currenly on anti-coag given recent guiac positive stools with HCT drop at OSH.
# Anemia: - OSH EGD [**10-1**] showed esophagitis - PPI increased to [**Hospital1 **] when patient developed black stools - colonoscopy deferred given respiratory status and relatively stable hct - patient continued to have guiac positive and occasionally black stools and was supported w/ transfusions until made CMO .
# depression/anxiety: continue paxil (dose decreased while on linezolid to decrease r/o serotonin syndrome) # h/o breast cancer: continue tamoxifen # hypothyrodism: continue synthroid.
# Thrombotic prophylaxis: Patient should be on coumadin for afib, lovenox for fracture but given concern for GI bleeding, unstable crits at OSH, thus, these medications were held.
