PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He did receive bilateral laryngotomies at [**Hospital6 1129**] prior to the hyperbaric treatment.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  He was afebrile at 99.8, heart rate was 99, his blood pressure was hypotensive at 78/43, and his oxygen saturation was 90 percent.
Lungs revealed he had bilateral coarse breath sounds.
His back revealed abrasions over the lower part of his back that appeared to be rug rash from when he was dragged out of the fire.
He had no clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or any gross deformities of his legs and arms.
His CK was elevated at 14.3, with a MB fraction of only 1, and troponin was 0.03.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95189**] was determined to have severe cardiovascular and respiratory distress following this fire.
He responded well to fluid treatment of his hypovolemic shock, and he was gradually weaned off the ventilator.
He did develop a ventilator associated pneumonia with Xanthomonas multocida prior to being weaned off the ventilator.
A swallow study prior to discharge revealed slight aspiration, and he was continued on tube feedings via a postpyloric feeding tube when he was discharged to rehabilitation on [**10-3**].
He did have hypertension and    tachycardia over the latter half of his stay which was    controlled with oral labetalol and hydralazine.
On [**9-19**], a bronchoscopy    was performed which revealed mucosal injury as well as    carbonaceous secretions.
Later he developed a ventilator    associated pneumonia with associated effusions.

He    did have a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus    positive nasal swab.
In addition,    his cervical spine and thoracic spine and lumbar spine    were cleared radiologically.
He is being discharged on labetalol, hydralazine, Lovenox, regular insulin sliding scale, and Roxicet pain elixir.
