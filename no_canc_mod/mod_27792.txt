Admission Date: [**2105-6-6**]        Discharge Date: [**2105-6-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2024-9-26**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   CONTINUATION: On the day of admission, the patient underwent CT scan and right upper quadrant ultrasound which revealed the following: CT scan revealed a complex fluid collection about 10 x 4 cm with an enhancing wall and multiple foci of air which was seen immediately anterior to the pancreas and was concerning for an infected pseudocyst.
He was also noted to have a large right sided pleural effusion.
Blood cultures revealed negative results, but the PICC line catheter tip which was cultured revealed positive cultures with coagulase negative staph.
On hospital day 3, the patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for exploratory laparotomy and debridement of this visible pancreatic abscess at the body and tail of the pancreas.
The patient was hypotensive and oliguric in the immediate postoperative period.
Eventually he became pressor dependent on Norepinephrine and he was also noted to have new onset atrial fibrillation during this time.
In the course of his hemodynamic instability and pressor dependence, he developed acute renal failure and the team consulted the nephrology service for assistance in managing this renal failure.
On hospital day 6, it was felt that his large right pleural effusion was interfering with his ability to breathe on his own.
So this pleural effusion was drained by tube thoracostomy and was left to drainage.
Trophic tube feeds were begun on hospital day 8, and the patient tolerated these without problems.
Also on hospital day #8, infectious disease service consultation was obtained to assist in managing the patient's pancreatitis abscess, line sepsis, in the face of his hemodynamic instability.
An echocardiogram was performed during the course of the patient's intensive care unit stay which revealed a greater than 55% left ventricular ejection fraction.
By hospital day 12, his abdominal wound was noted to be weeping and quite friable.
The wound was opened and packed to alleviate some of the breakdown and promote healing.
Cultures of his open abdominal wound revealed pseudomonas and, for this, the patient was treated with acetic acid dressing soaks.
On [**6-21**], the patient was alert and oriented and was off sedation and his atrial fibrillation and flutter had been restored to a regular rate and rhythm.
By [**6-25**], the patient had made several improvements.
In the afternoon of [**6-28**], a code blue was called on the patient because of respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability.
Severe and sudden decompensation of the patient was thought to be due to a massive catastrophic event such as a pulmonary embolus or a massive myocardial infarction.
The patient was maximized on pressors and inotropic agents, but eventually was found to have become asystolic on telemetry.
As part of his workup, a bedside echocardiogram was performed which showed a massively dilated right ventricle which was consistent with the diagnosis of a massive pulmonary embolus.
Acute pancreatitis.
Pancreatic abscess.
Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
Blood loss anemia.
Massive pulmonary embolus.
Acute renal failure.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
