Admission Date:  [**2161-3-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2161-3-12**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old former smoker with hypertension but no other significant past medical history who presented to an outside hospital on [**3-7**] with months of increasing dyspnea on exertion.
The patient also complained of approximately two days of intermittent left arm pain and throat tightness.
The patient reported that on the morning of her admission to the outside hospital she woke up in a cold sweat with the left arm pain and chest tightness and was brought to the Emergency Department.
At the outside hospital, the patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction by enzymes with a reported peak troponin I of 17.
Electrocardiograms at the outside hospital reportedly with ST depressions in leads II, III, aVF, and V4 to V6.
Cardiac catheterization on [**3-9**] showed multivessel disease including an 80% left main stenosis, tight stenosis at the first diagonal with competitive flow, large ramus, but no significant disease in the left circumflex, and 70% mid right coronary artery, and 70% posterior descending artery origin stenosis.
On admission to the Coronary Care Unit the patient had no complaints and denied any shortness of breath, arm symptoms, chest pain, or throat symptoms.
The patient was in good spirits and had no complaints.
ALLERGIES:  Reportedly allergic to PENICILLIN (with unknown reaction, but the patient denies an anaphylactic reaction or any breathing compromise as far as she knows).
Physical examination was notable for a small excoriation in the upper drip with dried blood.
No jugular venous distention.
No murmurs were appreciated.
Guaiac-negative stool times one.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, left anterior fascicular block, old T wave inversion in aVL, and less than 1-mm ST depressions in V5 and V6.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is an 85-year-old female ex-smoker with hypertension but no other significant past medical history who presented to an outside hospital on [**3-7**] with worsening dyspnea on exertion and days of left arm pain and throat tightness and ruled in by enzymes at the outside hospital.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for catheterization which showed multivessel disease as outlined above.
The patient refused a coronary artery bypass graft, and status post stent times three on [**3-9**].
The patient with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction at the outside hospital.
The patient underwent catheterization (as mentioned above) which she tolerated well without known complications.
The patient had no episodes of anginal symptoms such as her left arm pain or neck tightness throughout the remainder of her hospital stay.
(b)  PUMP ISSUES:  The patient without known congestive heart failure; however, she reportedly may have flashed at the outside hospital which responded to Lasix.
(c)  RHYTHM ISSUES:  The patient had a bradycardic arrest in the Catheterization Laboratory likely related to increased vagal tone during manipulation of her coronaries.
The patient was in a normal sinus rhythm throughout the remainder of her hospital stay without any significant events on telemetry.
MELENA ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have three to four episodes of melanic stools in the Coronary Care Unit which were grossly guaiac-positive.
The patient did report that she had a nose bleed that dripped into the back of her throat for approximately two days; beginning approximately two days prior to the cardiac catheterization.
The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on [**3-11**] which showed gastritis of the stomach without any visible ulcerations.
The patient's melanotic stools were therefore thought to be due to a combination of her nose bleeds and some minimal oozing from her gastritis.
The patient did not have any further episodes of melanic stools.
HYPONATREMIA ISSUES:  The patient became slightly hyponatremic while in the Coronary Care Unit likely due to being on one-half normal saline and free water intake.
Coronary artery disease; status post catheterization times two with stent placement.
