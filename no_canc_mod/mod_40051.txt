Her labs in both hospitals are notable for intracellular dehydration with what appears to be a "contraction alkalosis" (hypernatremic, hypokalemic, hyperHCO3/~alkalotic), and for possible UTI (dirty UA).
The patient is currently an unreliable historian -- confused and inattentive and tangential, prone to rambling about unrelated topics, interspersed with appropriate information.
That course was started after an ICU/intubation crisis that occurred after she had her gallbladder removed at an OSH.
Six months ago, she developed LE weakness and SOB with extended walks and R>L eyelid drooping as before, so her Neurologist restarted her Mestinon at 60mg q4h.
Her daughter says she was weak and had difficulty walking to the bathroom, with her neck slumped forward.
She slumped over before she made it to the toilet, and had an episode of incontinence on the floor.
At the OSH today, her daughter says the pt said there was a bug or spider crawling up the IV tubing towards her, which clearly was not there.
Review of Systems: negative except as above; difficult to obtain thorough ROS due to tangential/inattentive patient.
No pain or paresthesias currently.
HTN 2.
Pt endorses history of recurrent UTI and outpatient abx from PCP for this; details are unclear   Social History: Lives alone with brother in [**Name2 (NI) **] above her.
Thinned short white hair.
No scleral icterus.
No lesions noted in oropharynx.
Neck: Slumped forward, but supple, with no meningismus.
Non-labored breathing, mildly tachypneic at times.
Pitting edema up to knees bilaterally (pt unsure how new this is).
Skin: no gross rashes or lesions noted.
Speech was mildly slurred.
There were no paraphasic errors.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect or ideomotor apraxia; the patient was able to reproduce and recognize hammering a nail and brushing teeth with both hands.
Flattening of the Left NLF which her daughters agree is long-standing.
Accordingly asymmetric facial elevation with smile (R>lt).
-Motor exam: No drift.
No tremor or fasciculations were observed.
Normal muscle bulk and tone, no flaccidity, hypertonicity, or spasticity noted.

Patient had initially self-restarted pyridostigmine at 90mh qid herself 6 weeks prior after she had diffiuclty holding her head.
She saw her o/p neurologist and he decreased this to 15mg qid (had not been on since [**2145**]) due to conerns for overmedication.
Patient was initially admitted to the neurology floor and started on IVIg on [**10-13**] at 0.4g/kg on [**10-13**] however, ABG showed hypercarbia pCO2 81 and she was transferred to the ICU for a trial of BiPAP.
She had a low grade fever to 100.4F in the setting of her first IVIg dose.
On initial assessment in the ICU on [**10-14**], patient had reduced sniff and cough, significant neck flexion weakness, dysarthria, mild bilateral ptosis and bilateral facial weakness in addition to fixed mild proximal UE>LE weakness which was fatiguable and mild disorientation.
Patient passed swallow assessment and was started on a soft diet and CXR showed a left base opacity concerning for possible pneumonia although given clinical stability and that she had no stigmata of infection, was afebrile, additional antibiotics were held.
Immediately post intubation CXR showed R>L base opacities and in the setting of a fever to 101.1 she was started on IV meropenem and vancomycin for HAP.
She had a reaction to IVIg on [**10-15**] with tachycardia and hypotension and this settled after brief treatment with pressors.
She had no further episodes.
The patient remained clinically stable, did not appear septic and had no further fevers and given that all cultures were negative, antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-17**].
She had very poor tidal volumes on the ventilator and restarted pyridostigmine 30mg Q4H on [**10-17**] however this was stopped due to greatly increased oral secretions on [**10-21**].
She was started on steroids at prednisone 60mg qd on [**10-21**] due to continued poor tidal volumes and she had no untoward sequelae from this.
Patient had a frankly blody urine in her catheter which was felt to be trauimatic and resolved on changing her catheter.
Patient had transient hypotensive episodes with her plasmapheresis which improved with IV fluid boluses and latterly the decision was made to hold her metoprolol before plasmapheresis days which improved this.
She was aslo noted to have hypercalcemia to 11.4 and PTH was normal.
Endocrine were consulted and followed her calcium level and this was felt to be secondary to mild hyperparathyroidism in the setting of a calcium challenge following calcium gluconate infusion with plasmapheresis and this was stopped on further sessions and her calcium improved but did not normalise.
She slowly improved with better tidal volumes and pyridostimine was restarted at a lower dose [**10-23**] to augment respiratory function in preparation for extubation.
She did well on face tent following extubation and latterly was saturating well without oxygen although she still had oral secretions which were manageable by the patient.
We rechecked a CT Chest to look for thymoma which shows no infiltrates but the final read is pending.
We rechecked a UA and urine culture prior to discharge with the result thus far showing a contaminated sample not consistent with a UTI.
