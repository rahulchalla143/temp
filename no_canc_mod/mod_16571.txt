The patient's current illness began in [**Month (only) 958**], when she was admitted to OSH for PNA and UTI.
She was suffering from severe low back pain, worse than ever before.
She was seen at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**Month (only) 547**] and she was found to have L2 fracture concerning for pathologic fracture thus she underwent biopsy which showed reactive cells and no suggestion of malignancy.
She had a lot of pain from this procedure itself, and the pain did not improve afterwards.
When seen in neuromuscular clinic [**5-31**], she continued to have severe back pain radiating down the right leg superimposed on tingling/burning pain of both feet prior to the acute/subacute L2 fracture found in [**Month (only) 547**].
[**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 557**] repeated an MRI of the L spine and there was concern for infectious process.
The pt c/o pain at the R low back and hip that radiates both across to the L low back/hip and down both legs posteriorly to the toes.
The pain in sharp and can be worsened by bending down (ie to put on shoes) or lying flat.
Pain medications, such as Vicodin, have helped, but the lowest pain scale is [**6-19**] even with meds.

There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.
There are multiple T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in bilateral periventricular white matter and pons.
Visualized orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
There is mucosal thickening in the right sphenoid sinus.
NO acute intracranial abnormality.
T2/FLAIR hyperintensity seen in pons likely due to small vessel disease.
Although this may be seen with central pontine myelinolysis, pattern of signal changes favour small vessel ischemic disease.
MRI L-spine ([**6-7**]): FINDINGS:  There is a compression fracture at L2 and T12.
There appears to be some further height loss anteriorly at L2 compared to the prior examination.
There is increased signal within the intervening disc space at L1-L2.
There is also enhancement within the thecal sac at L1-L2 likely involving the nerve roots of the cauda equina.
There is moderate canal stenosis at this level.
A component of epidural enhancement at L1-L2 cannot be entirely excluded in view of the degree of canal stenosis at this level.
IMPRESSION: Little change compared to the prior examination except for increased height loss at L2 anteriorly.
Abnormal signal within the T12-L1 and L1-L2 disc spaces persist.
There is stable enhancement within and possibly surrounding the thecal sac at L1-L2 with at least moderate canal stenosis at this level.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the lumbar spine are stable compared to the previous examination.
Brief Hospital Course: 58 year-old right-handed woman with h/o DM, peripheral neuropathy and lumbosacral radiculopathy presents with low back and leg pain with MRI findings concerning for spinal infection.
Neuro exam is similar to prior recorded on [**5-31**] neuromuscular visit with bilateral IP weakness, and on admission had mild hip adductor and hamstring weakness which is at least partially limited by pain.
No bowel/bladder symptoms.
Elevated ESR/CRP raise concern for infectious etiology.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 12784**] with contrast given signs of cervical root/spine involvement on exam (finger flexors and infraspinatus weakness) shows mild spondylosis and patient placed in soft collar.
They felt L2 was unstable and scan consistent with ankylosing spondylitis with L2 fracture, not necessarily infection.
However patient is extremely high risk for surgery, both for infection, also for further fractures on prone positioning.
Recommend strict bed rest as patient's bones are very brittle and could result in shift of L2 fracture causing paralysis.
She was initially managed on the neurology service with bed rest and pain control.
Post-op she began suffering from altered mental status and there was concern for seizures.
She was loaded with Keppra and subsequently continued having events concerning for seizures and was given Vimpat.
The patient's pain was initially controlled with Dilaudid.
Her other medications were continued as follows: - Sleep/Anxiety - Alpraxolam 2 mg qhs and 0.5 TID prn - HTN - Metoprolol tartrate 25 TID, Lisinopril 2.5 - GERD - Omeprazole 20 - Asthma - Albuterol + Ipratropium PRN, Fluticasone-Salmeterol  On the day of transfer the patient was doing well.
