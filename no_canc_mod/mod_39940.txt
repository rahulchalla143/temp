There is no hydrocephalus.
Moderate mucosal thickening is seen involving the ethmoid air cells bilaterally.
Remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE: No fracture or subluxation is present.
Extensive degenerative changes are present with large anterior flowing osteophytes, consistent with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.
Additionally, there is kyphosis of the cervical spine centered at the C5 vertebral body, which demonstrates mild anterior wedging suggestive of a prior trauma to this region.
There is marked narrowing of the intervertebral disc spaces at all intervertebral levels, with severe narrowing of the spinal canal and neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally at all levels.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
Bilateral striated nephrograms with associated perinephric and proximal periureteral stranding highly suggestive of underlying pyelonephrosis versus renal cortical abscesses.
Bilateral fat containing inguinal hernias.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
No pleural abnormality.
No pneumothorax.
urine culture: enterococcus sensitive to vanc and ampicillin  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 64M with PMH notable for DM II (oral hypoglycemics) and hypertension p/w sepsis .
1) Sepsis: Pt found to have enterococcus in urine, so started on ampicillin and then switched to vancomycin for easier dosing with plan to discharge to home with VNA.
Pt defervesced and blood cultures remained no growth.
ARF secondary to prerenal azotemia with hypotension.
Now with baseline renal function and elevated blood sugars so restarted oral hypoglycemics (metformin and glyburide) at previous doses.
3) Fall: Pt had a fall prior to admit (when giving urine at PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**]) so got a head CT and c spine that were both negative for acute processes.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Roscommon  Discharge Diagnosis: Urosepsis secondary to enterococcus   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Continue full course of antibiotics (7 more days to make 14 days total).
