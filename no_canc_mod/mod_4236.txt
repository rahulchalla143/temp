Most recently admitted [**Date range (1) 22630**] with dyspnea and suboptimal stress test.
Cardiac catheterization revealed moderate MR and two vessel CAD.
He underwent a pericardectomy  only as he had severe constrictive pericarditis related to his esophageal radiation.
No nausea or vomiting before initial hemetemesis.
Over the evening he vomited ~5 times, once with "jellyfish" appearance.
Also with concurrent black stools (~5).
Last episode of hemetemesis was at 7am on day of admission.

HEENT: Mild conjuctival pallor; no icterus CV: Tachycardic; no murmurs.
Mild edema.
Studies: [**2133-3-25**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Increased right-sided pleural effusion and possible infiltrate in the right lower lung.
Interval decrease in left-sided pleural effusion compared to [**2133-3-12**].
[**2133-3-25**] Endoscopy - Findings: Esophagus:  Lumen: Evidence of a previous esophago-gastric anastomosis was seen at 23 cm from the incisors.
There was no visible bleeding site in the esophagus or at the esophageal gastric anastomosis.
Stomach:  Contents: Clotted blood was seen in the stomach body and antrum.
Duodenum:  Other normal to d3 with out a bleeding site found Impression: Previous esophago-gastric of the esophagus Blood in the stomach body and antrum Normal to d3 with out a bleeding site found The stomach was s shaped.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: If any questions or you need to schedule an [**Telephone/Fax (1) 682**] or email at [**University/College 21854**]  The patient's bleeding site could not be ascertained due to blood in the stomach.

# Upper GIB:  Pt had several episodes of hematemesis and was found to have HCT 22 at OSH.
GI scope upon arrival to ICU showed evidence of recent bleeding but no clear etiology and no active bleeding; no interventions were performed.
He continued to have melanotic stools with gradually decreasing hematocrit.
Eventually after several days of slowing decreasing hematocrit but no overt bleeding events, he udnerwent repeat EGD with no evidence of active bleeding.
# Acute blood loss anemia:  As above, [**2-9**] GI bleed which responded appropriately to blood tranfusion .
# Coronary artery disease:  Patient denied any chest pain though continued to have DOE.
Aspirin was scheduled to be restarted after discharge and patient will discuss with his primary cardiologist risks vs benefits of restarting plavix  # Tachycardia: Patient had persistent tachycardia despite adequate fluid and blood replacement.
After remaining hemodynamically stable with no evidence of re-bleed, he was restarted on metoprolol with heart rate stable around 100.
He diud have an episode of SVT as described above.
# Acute CHF: Patient developed decreasing oxygen saturations, worsening dyspnea and orthopnea after initial volume and blood resuscitation.
He has chronic bilateral pleural effusions that have not responded to diuresis and have required thoracentesis previously therefore it was decided to proceed with thoracentesis to improve oxygenation.
Pleural fluid was sent for cytology and was negative for evidence of malignant cells.
He was scheduled for outpatient appointment with interventional pulmonary to discuss utility of right-sided thoracentesis.
# History of esophageal cancer:  Presentation initially concerning for recurrence given that he initially presented with hematemesis.
No evidence of recurrence on repeat EGD.
Thoracentesis with negative cytology.

Blood counts stable with no evidence of active bleeding.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after an episode of vomiting blood.
You also some shortness of breath and low oxygen levels, likely related to the fluid in your lungs, so we did a procedure called a throacentesis to remove the fluid.
The following changes were made to your medications: 1) HOLD aspirin for 7 days then restart on [**4-8**] 2) STOP plavix and discuss with your cardiologist whether this should be restarted 3) INCREASE pantoprazole to 40mg twice daily 4) INCREASE lasix to 40mg twice daily for 5 days, then resume 40mg daily until you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] 5) INCREASE metoprolol to 50mg twice daily  Please return to the emergency department if you experience an episode of bleeding, either vomiting blood or defecating, black or tarry stools, shortness of breath or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
Please follow-up your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-9**] weeks for these results.
