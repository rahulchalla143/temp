In the ED, she was treated for her CP but was found to be in pulm edema and rapid afib.
Given her rapid afib, the patient was started on sotalol on [**8-4**], where she converted to sinus rythm on [**8-5**].
There were no reported shocks.
A R fem A-line was placed, as was a temp pacing wire for bradycardia.
Also of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2149-6-12**] for increased abd girth and SOB thought [**2-21**] CHF exacerbation.
She was also maintained on cytoxan for her renal transplant.
Past Medical History: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF: Echo [**2149-6-13**]: EF >55%, 1+ MR, severe pulm HTN, RV dilation c/w overload - Pulmonary HTN: R heart cath on [**6-19**] with pulmonary artery pressure 79/59 mm Hg.
Diagnosis is Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis/UIP per thoracotomy and lung biospy - Paroxysmal Afib with RVR with h/o conversion pauses to sinus.
On coumadin, recently started on sotalol - ESRD secondary to chronic pyelonephritis, s/p cadaveric kidney transplant on [**2143-11-12**] - Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Anemia-multifactorial, ACD, ESRD on EPO, Baseline hct 28-35 h/o rhabdomyolysis - Gout - Hypothyroidism  Cardiac Risk Factors: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension   Cardiac History: CABG: N/A  Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2140-10-21**]: 1.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrate mildly elevated right heart filling pressures.
The pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was 42mm Hg, with an elevated PVR of 200 dynes-sec/cm2.
Coronary arteriography demontrates no siginifcant disease, with mild luminal irregularities of the LAD.
Left ventriculography demonstrates moderate LV dysfunction with global hypokinesis.
There was moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation.
Family History: There is history of renal failure and hypertension in the family.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Diffuse crackles.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Ext: left UE fistula w/ bruit  Pertinent Results: [**2149-8-10**] 08:37PM   WBC-12.8*# RBC-3.48* HGB-11.8* HCT-37.0 MCV-106* MCH-34.0* MCHC-32.0 RDW-22.5*PLT COUNT-125* CALCIUM-10.5* PHOSPHATE-6.6*# MAGNESIUM-2.7* GLUCOSE-129* UREA N-107* CREAT-2.2* SODIUM-142 POTASSIUM-5.2* CHLORIDE-109* TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-16   LACTATE-2.6*   TYPE-ART PO2-74* PCO2-45 PH-7.32* TOTAL CO2-24 BASE XS--3  freeCa-1.44*  [**2149-8-10**] 08:37PM   CK-MB-35* cTropnT-1.40*   CK(CPK)-209*  [**2149-8-10**] CXR: Swan-Ganz catheter remains distally positioned with the tip projecting lateral to the right hilum, likely within a segmental branch of the right middle or right lower lobe artery.
Bilateral combined alveolar and interstitial opacities are again demonstrated.
Alveolar opacities improved on the left but worse on the right, likely due to rapidly shifting edema, although superimposed secondary process in the right lung such as hemorrhage or aspiration is also possible in the appropriate setting.
Small left pleural effusion is unchanged, but small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has increased.
Position of the PICC line and Swan-Ganz catheter have been communicated by telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20858**] by telephone on [**2149-8-10**]  [**2149-8-10**] CXR: Swan-Ganz catheter projects distal to the right hilar contour, likely within a proximal segmental vessel of the right middle or lower lobe.
Right PICC line courses medially within the left brachiocephalic vein with distal tip at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and left subclavian vein.
Bilateral combined alveolar and interstitial pattern, worse on the left than the right probably reflects pulmonary edema.
Small pleural effusions are present as well as preexisting right-sided pleural thickening.
[**2149-8-10**] ECG:Probable sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia and extensive baseline artifact.
ST-T wave changes anterolaterally consistent with ischemia.
Compared with the prior tracing of [**2149-6-19**] anterolateral ST-T wave changes are more prominent and QTc interval is shorter.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 F with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, PAF, severe pulm HTN and R heart failure, DM2, HTN, s/p renal xplant in [**2143**] presents from OSH after episode of CP/SOB and cardiac arrest on day of transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
Patient had episodes of maintaining blood pressure after epinephrine but then would become hypotensive and return to PEA when placed on ventilator.
Patient developed pink, frothy sputum from ET tube.
Beside echo with no evidence for tamponade.
CXR without sign of pneumothorax.
Labs drawn during the code without evidence of hypo/hyperkalemia.
Patient developed one episode of VFib and was shocked and one episode of atrial fibrillation and she was cardioverted.
Trial of inhaled NO to get pulm A pressures down failed secondary to systolic hypotension.
Trial of hemodialysis failed with systolic hypotension.
