IMAGING: [**2169-7-7**] LLE Doppler US: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT .
[**2169-7-7**] Portable CXR: There is interval development of left retrocardiac opacity that is worrisome for interval development of infectious process.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Focal, apparently nonocclusive filling defect in the main portal vein at the porta hepatis, with hepatopetal flow just proximal, with a velocity of 40 cm/sec.
This could represent nonocclusive thrombus, or could be artifact.
Moderate ascites.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
This is most likely related to peripheral intravenous catheter.
Paranasal sinus disease.
[**2169-7-8**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-8-19**], no major change.
[**2169-7-8**] RUQ U/S with doppler: pending  Brief Hospital Course: 42 year old man with ETOH cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status in the setting of cellulitis.
# Altered mental status: CT head neg for acute process.
No evidence of hypercarbia on VBG.
No meningismus on exam to raise concern for encephalitis or meningitis.
Most likely secondary to hyponatremia and encephalopathy in the setting of infection.
# LLE cellulitis: Pt was initially treated with vancomycin, however he had a bad reaction to the vancomycin (possibly red man's syndrome), and received solumedrol and benadryl, and was switched to IV clindamycin.
The patient remained afebrile with stable vitals and improving [**Last Name (LF) 84982**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was switched to PO clindamycin to complete a 7-day course.
Urine sodium <10, fractional excretion of urea 25%, c/w pre-renal physiology.
# Hyponatremia: Sodium was 125 on admission, likely secondary to cirrhosis.
# ETOH Cirrhosis: RUQ ultrasound without evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
# Painful left 2nd toe: Pt states that he had a recent fall and has since had pain in the second toe on the left foot.
Foot x-ray was negative for fracture.
