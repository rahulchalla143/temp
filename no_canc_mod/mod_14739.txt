CTA [**11-20**] - Markedly limited and poor inspiration No saddle PE.
Enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.
6 mm RUL nodule Old rib fractures  Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is right-to-left passage of microbubbles across the interatrial septum at rest c/w a secundum type atrial septal defect.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Right-to-left passage of microbubbles after intravenous injection c/w atrial septal defect.
stateed on admission that she chronically has poor 02 sats and has refused oxygen supplementation and Bipap for OSA in the past.
Her CXR showed no acute process.
Her initial ABG indicated hypercarbia and hypoxemia.
Her ABG on presentation to the ICU was still significant for hypercarbia, but with a improvement in hypoxemia.
She remained asymptomatic throughout.
for hypoxia also included pneumonia (CAP), narcotic- induced, obesity hypoventilation.
A PE was ruled out by CT-PA.  An TTE with bubble study was obtained which did show evidence of an atrial septal defect.
This was discussed with the cardiology consult team and it was felt that this was most likely a congenital defect and not solely responsible for the patient's hypoxia.
She had a slight fever and no leukocytosis and the patient's regular ID attending came to evaluate her and stateed that she felt the LE's looked the same or better than baseline and that further antibiotics were not warranted.
Her coverage was stopped and the patient remained afebrile for the rest of the hospitalization.
The urine culture showed only fecal contaminant.
