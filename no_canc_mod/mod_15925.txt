Pregnancy was complicated by preterm labor and cervical shortening.
Delivery room course was remarkable for an infant who emerged with some spontaneous effort but minimal respiratory effort.
The infant was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit due to prematurity.
In the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the infant was found to be grunting, flaring and retracting with an oxygen requirement and a clinical picture consistent with surfactant deficiency.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission, the infant was a normal appearing 34 week infant with tone and maturity and activity consistent with gestational age.
The skin was pink and clear, without rashes or petechiae.
There were bilateral red reflexes.
The chest examination revealed grunting, flaring, retracting infant with moderate degree of respiratory distress and inspiratory crackles noted.
Genitourinary examination revealed normal male infant with descended testicles.
The trunk and spine were straight without evidence of defect.
Extremities were well perfused and there was no evidence of a click on hip distraction.
The infant had normal tone and reflexes for gestational age.
This lasted for less than 24 hours, after which he was subsequently taken to room air with minimal difficulty and he has been on room air since that time.
There is no evidence of chronic lung disease and no supplemental oxygen requirement currently.
In terms of respiratory drive, [**Known lastname **] has exhibited no signs of apnea of prematurity and has never been on any methylxanthines.
initially for respiratory distress.
He has been on full feeds for over a week and has been tolerating these without problems.
He has been having very acceptable weight gain, taking either mother's milk or Enfamil 20.
He is voiding and stooling without difficulty.
This infant did require an         examination for prematurity since he was [**Month (only) **] above         34 weeks gestation and had a good weight.
(3) Chronic lung disease.
Before this age, the      family and other caregivers should be considered for      immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
