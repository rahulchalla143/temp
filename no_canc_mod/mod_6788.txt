An electrocardiogram was done that revealed ST elevations in the inferior leads.
The patient denied any previous myocardial infarction but states she was hospitalized once for congestive heart failure.
A transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2139-6-26**] demonstrated an ejection fraction of 65% with 1+ mitral regurgitation and delayed relaxation of left ventricular inflow.
She currently denies orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
She has used a walker for a number of years and currently gets short of breath with minimal exertion.
The obtuse marginal and left posterior descending artery demonstrated cutoffs consistent with embolism and spontaneous thrombolysis.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Urinary incontinence.
Congestive heart failure.
Left shoulder replacement.
T12-L2 arthrodesis with pedicle screw fixation.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family medical history was significant for mother who died of a myocardial infarction in her 80s.
In general, the patient was obese and talkative, in no apparent distress.
Extremities revealed 2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the knees.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram done on admission pain free revealed 2-mm to 3-mm ST elevations in the inferior lead with ST depressions in V2 through V4, aVL; all new compared to electrocardiogram dated [**2139-6-30**].
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 76-year-old female status post inferior myocardial infarction with spontaneous thrombolysis.
The Integrilin drip was stopped prematurely, approximately eight hours after staring, status post catheterization due to concern over bleeding from central venous site as well as a femoral sheath.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and showed a peak creatine phosphokinase at 7 a.m. after admission at 1306, CK/MB of 84, and an index of 6.4, with a troponin of greater than 50.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed on [**2140-7-10**] which showed an ejection fraction of 35%, hypokinesis of basal inferolateral walls consistent with systolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension.
(c)  Rate and Rhythm:  The patient had a 10-beat run of ventricular tachycardia on hospital day two; presumed due to reperfusion.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells during her hospital course for a hematocrit fall from a hematocrit of 31 with concern over excessive bleeding from central line sites.
No signs of hypothyroidism were noted during her hospital course.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  On hospital day four, the patient had four loose stools in the morning due to concern for Clostridium difficile toxin, an assay was sent which came back negative.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure.
