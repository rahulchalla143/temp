There is a midline frontal subgaleal hematoma noted.
The paranasal sinuses demonstrate diffuse sinus thickening in the ethmoid and bilateral maxillary sinuses.
Discontinuity of the right vertebral artery at the level of the C1 burst fracture, highly suspicious for acute dissection.
No evidence for active extravasation, pseudoaneurysm or associated hematoma.
Hypoplastic left vertebral artery, with no definite injury; the basilar artery opacifies to its summit.
Normal-appearing carotid arteries bilaterally without full evaluation of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
Known [**Location (un) 5621**] fractures at C1 and anterior distraction at C6-C7 with associated soft tissue abnormality, as previously characterized on dedicated cervical spine CT.  CT(Head): [**9-3**] IMPRESSION: New extensive, virtually holocerebellar infarction with associated severe cytotoxic edema extending into the cerebellar peduncles and dorsal brainstem.
There is resultant tonsillar and upward transtentorial herniation, with 4th ventricular effacement and ventricular enlargement consistent with acute obstructive hydrocephalus.
MRI/A(Head): [**9-3**] **Preliminary report* PFI: Massive acute infarction involving the cerebellum, medulla,  posterolateral pons, posterolateral midbrain, and small foci in the right occipital lobe.
Slightly decreased mass effect, status post suboccipital craniectomy.
Resolution of lateral and third ventricular dilatation, status post ventriculostomy.
Right vertebral dissection.
Diminished posterior cerebellar artery flow, likely related to posterior fossa edema.
Mildly diminished flow in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, likely due to hemodynamic factors and technical limitations.
CT C-Spine([**9-2**]): FINDINGS: There is underlying ankylosing spondylitis.
There is a burst fracture of C1 involving the bilateral anterior and posterior transverse processes ([**Location (un) 5621**] type).
A large epidural hematoma extends in the ventral canal.
There is marked asymmetric widening and distraction at C6-7 measuring 1.7 cm anteriorly and 9 mm posteriorly.
There is associated cord compression at this level.
Acute fracture through the anterior bridging osteophyte, ossified ALL, and disc at C6-7, with severe canal narrowing at this level; however, no evidence of cord contusion or epidural hematoma.
Poor demonstration of the known C1 burst fracture, better seen on concurrent CT. No evidence of cord contusion or compression at the C1-C2 level.
There is a 1.9 cm hyperdense fluid collection measuring 62 Hounsfield units, which may represent prominent matted lymph nodes or hematoma, unusual as an isolated injury.
Bibasilar aspiration or atelectesis.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department after sustaining a fall after witnessed seizure activity.
He was identified to have cervical spine fracture and instability, and it was thought he would be better managed by [**Hospital1 18**] for his injuries.
He was intubated at the OSH for airway protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management.
His C-spine CT revealed a C1 burst fracture as well as a C7 hyperflexion fracture.
His CTA revealed a possible right vertebral artery dissection and a hypotrophic left vertebral artery.
Anticoagulation was not initiated because the chest CT had revealed a mediastinal hematoma.
A right EVD was emergently placed and the patient rushed to the OR for a posterior fossa decompression.
While the surgery was uneventful, post operative CT and MRI scans revealed hyperintensity of the brain stem, suggestive of ischemia/infraction.
