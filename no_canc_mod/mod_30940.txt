#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure with hypoxemia/Obesity Hypoventilation/Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Before pt became altered she was able to communicate that she developed wheezing earlier in the day.
Her ABG showed Co2 retention and an A-a oxygen garadient.
The etiology of her respiratory failure was felt to be acute on chronic diastolic heart failure on top of her substrate of chronic lung disease due to asthma, obesity hypoventilation, and OSA.
Sh was diuresed 4L during admission without change in renal function or electrolytes and she was discharged to rehab off oxygen.
Given her recurrent admissions for respiratory failure and it may be worthwhile to be more aggressive with her outpatient heart failure diuretic regimen as there are few other options for preventing recurrent episodes of respiratory failure once adherence to night time BIPAP is maintained.
Patient was not felt to have pneumonia and was not treated with antibiotics.
#Chronic lower extremity edema/Lymphedema: She has a history of chronic lower extremity edema and recurrent cellulitis although as above it is unclear if all this edema is due to lymphedema vs. volume overload from heart failure.
She did have erythema in her lower extremities, particularly over the right shin which raised some concern for cellulitis.
She was started on vancomycin to cover her previously diagnosed strep bacteremia as well as potential new cellulitis as she reported difficulties with [**Month/Day (2) 26204**].
#Hyperkalemia: Patient was admitted with hyperkalemia which improved with Lasix.
# Anemia: microcytic, wide RDW and markedly low MCV.
Her low MCV and normal iron studies is suggestive of thalasemia or other hemoglobinopathy.
# Hypertension : She was initially started on her home medications.
However she remained significantly hypertensive so her metoprolol was switched to labetolol which improved her BP.
# Leg pain: Pt had chronic left leg pain from lymphedema.
She also complained of right leg pain.
Pain is likely from chronic lymphedema and swelling with potential neuropathic component as well.
Pain could also be due to cellulitis as patient's right shin looks mildly erythematous.
If pain continues, can consider initiating non-narcotic pain medications such as gabapentin, for neuropathic type pain in addition to standing tylenol.
2) Consider adding gabapentin to treat neuropathic-type pain, if pain is not improving with treatment of right leg cellulitis.
