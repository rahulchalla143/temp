Admission Date:  [**2177-8-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-9-1**]   Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Indapamide / Atenolol  Attending:[**Known firstname 922**] Chief Complaint: 84M s/p aorto-inomminate bypass with endocascular stents of the aortic arch/CABGx1 who was at rehab and had a VT arrest.
He is s/p aorto-inomminate bypass with endovascular stenting of the aortic arch and descending aorta/CABG x 1 (SVG->PDA) on [**2177-6-24**].
He was initially transferred to rehab on [**8-4**], but was readmitted with a pleural effusion.
He had a VT arrest at rehab and was transferred to an outside hospital ER where he had ACLS protocol with defibrillation.
Past Medical History: HTN Depression Syncope Vocal hoarseness with L vocal cord paralysis s/p sinus surgery s/p CABGx1, aortic stenting tracheostomy respiratory failure gastrostomy tube  Social History: Lives alone Cigs: 20 pk yr hx, quit 35 yrs.
VS: T:95.8  BP: 123/66  P: 67  O2 sat 100% on TV 450 IMV 18 PEEP 10 HEENT: NC/AT, pupils fixed and dilated 4-5mm, non-reactive, oropharynx benign Lungs: Clear to A+P CV: RRR without R/G/M, nl s1, s2 Abd: soft, nontender, g tube in place Ext: no C/C/E Neuro: non responsive to verbal or painful stimuli, myoclonic movements  Pertinent Results: [**2177-8-31**] 05:03AM BLOOD WBC-15.8* RBC-2.94* Hgb-8.7* Hct-25.9* MCV-88 MCH-29.5 MCHC-33.4 RDW-15.4 Plt Ct-317 [**2177-8-31**] 05:03AM BLOOD Glucose-114* UreaN-36* Creat-1.2 Na-137 K-3.6 Cl-98 HCO3-29 AnGap-14 RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2177-8-30**] 11:21 PM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  Reason: ?
Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the chest were obtained without and with IV contrast per non-gated chest pain protocol.
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There has been interval decrease in size of the large right-sided pleural effusion, which now is moderate in size.
Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities are seen throughout the lungs, likely representing pulmonary edema.
There has been interval development of opacity within the left lower lobe, which could represent aspiration pneumonia or atelectasis.
A saccular aneurysm is again noted along the aortic arch.
There is lack of IV contrast within the aorta secondary to bolus timing.
There are extensive coronary and aortic calcifications.
CTA CHEST:  There is no evidence of filling defects within the pulmonary arterial vasculature.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
As mentioned above, the aorta is unopacified secondary to bolus timing.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse bilateral opacities similar to prior study likely represent pulmonary edema.
Interval improvement of right-sided pleural effusion, now moderate in size.
Interval worsening of left lower lobe consolidation, representing either pneumonia, aspiration or atelectasis.
Due to unstable hemodynamics and ventricular dysrhythmias, he was maintained on Dopamine and Lidocaine drips.
He urgently underwent chest CTA to rule out pulmonary embolus and a head CT to rule out stroke.
The head CT found no evidence of infarction or hemorrhage, and he ruled out for PE by CT angiogram.
The CTA was however notable for interval worsening of a left lower lobe consolidation, representing either pneumonia, aspiration or atelectasis.
Given his VF arrest and likely oxygen deprivation, he continued to experienced generalized myoclonus.
The EEG showed generalized discharges and very little, if any normal background was seen.
Given his anoxic brain injury and grim prognosis, the family decided to withdraw support.
