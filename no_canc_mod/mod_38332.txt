Placement of nasogastric tube   History of Present Illness: 42 year-old woman with history of recurrent pancreatitis, polysubstance abuse (including alcohol and IV heroin) and hypertriglyceridemia who presented to OSH on [**2130-3-15**] with severe abdominal pain.
She was transferred for management of multi-organ failure in the setting of severe pancreatitis.
On note says the patient has been having abdominal pain for a few days.
He thinks she may have had some nausea and vomiting and potentially diarrhea because she was going to the bathroom frequently.
He does not think she has been particularly depressed lately and denies that she may have been suicidal or trying to overdose of pills or alcohol.
Her labs were notable for a hyponatremia to 127, nl BUN/Cr, WBC 7.3 and Hct was 41 on admission.
[**Last Name (un) **] criteria on admission was 0.
Overnight, she required high doses do dilaudid for pain control.
She developed hypoxia, worsening respiratory distress and was intubated at 6am on [**3-16**].
She became hypotensive and developed anuric [**Last Name (un) **] despite 5-6L of NS.
She has a metabolic acidosis with pH down to 7.09.  Review of Systems: Positive for abdominal pain, denies other pain, full ROS limited by intubation.
Last admission was [**8-/2129**] - Hypertension - Hypertriglyceridemia - Hyperlipidemia - History of Cesarean section - Obesity - Polysubstance abuse  Social History: Married with 2 children (3 yo and 5yo).
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, JVP flat RESP: CTA in all lung fields, no w/r/r.

No fluid collections.
No e/o necrosis.
no pseudocyst or abscess.
Also noted, low density mass in left ovary c/w ovarian cyst.
There is severe pancreatitis with areas of reduced enhancement in the head and neck which may represent early necrosis/ischemia.
High signal intensity peripancreatic fluid is present, either hemorrhagic fluid or fat necrosis.
Aberrant right hepatic duct arises from the mid CBD.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Extensive peripancreatic fat stranding and retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal fluid collections, stable since the prior study, and are consistent with acute pancreatitis.
No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Mild splenomegaly.
Stable bilateral simple pleural effusions with basal atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: SEVERE ACUTE PANCREATITIS WITH FORMING PSEUDOCYST AND ASSOCIATED PANCREATIC NECROSIS: the patient was initially septic with ARDS, she was in distributive shock and intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
She was treated also with bowel rest and meropenem for antibiotics.
She will follow up with general surgery in 3 weeks with a repeat CT scan of her abdomen with contrast, if her pseudocyst is fully formed Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] may perform surgery for symptomatic treatment of a large pseudocyst.
Her pancreatitis was likely related to ETOH use and possible contribution from hypertriglyceridemia.
THROMBOCYTOPENIA: hematology consulted ([**Name8 (MD) 22656**] MD) and the patient had a + antiplatelet antibody.
She had no clinical evidence of bleeding.
Given the likely need for her gemfibrozil in the future and given the liklihood that this was vancomycin induced; when her platelets normalize gemfibrozil should be reintroduced and plts should be monitored closely to see if she again develops thrombocytopenia.
She also is on chronic narcotics for pain related to chronic pancreatitis or other etiology.
On this admission she had a clear organic reason for pain with the severe necrotizing pancreatitis, she was treated with high doses of IV narcotics, she was weaned down to 7.5mg po oxycodone q4hrs.
Following her surgery we may be able to completely wean her off however she still has a tender abdomen related to her large forming pseudocyst.
This was discussed with her PCP and she has a narcotic contract with her PCP.
Acute kidney injury: Resolved with rehydration, peak Cr 3.8.
Peripancreatic fluid collection / pseudocyst 3.
Bacteremia / septicemia (coagulase negative staph) 4.
Hypertriglyceridemia 6.
Anemia 8.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with severe pancreatitis and required a long stay in the medical ICU.
