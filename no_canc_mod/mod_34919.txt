Acute C4 spinous process fracture.
Possible acute fracture of the superior posterior corner of C4.
Associated prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
Small ossific density anterior to the superior anterior corner of C4 may represent a fracture of indeterminant chronicity.
Edema in the prevertebral soft tissues from the craniocervical junction through C4.
Edema in the anterior longitudinal ligament at C4.
Grade 1 retrolisthesis at C5/6, without evidence of posterior longitudinal ligament edema or disruption.
Edema in the interspinous ligaments from C2/3 through C4/5.
No bone marrow edema in the vertebral body of C4.
However, small corner fractures, which are predominantly cortical, may not be associated with bone marrow edema.
Moderate spinal canal stenosis at C3/4 with deformation of the spinal cord and abnormal cord signal, which may represent mild edema or myelomalacia.
Moderate spinal canal stenosis at C4/5 and severe spinal canal stenosis at C5/6, with deformation of the spinal cord, but no cord signal abnormalities.
