Abdominal and pelvic free fluid, inhomogeneous enhancement of the liver and enlarged right atrium consistent with fluid overload, potentially contributing to patient's symptoms of anorexia as well as pain.
Moderate right-sided and small left-sided pleural effusions.
Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
[**2189-10-23**]: CXR: Mild congestive heart failure.
Probable bibasilar atelectasis.
[**2189-10-24**]: RUQ US: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound, with no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no cholelithiasis or son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo F with PMH CAD (LAD/RCA stents), gastric and duodenal ulcers, recently treated H pylori presenting with anemia (HCT 29->20) likely due to upper GI bleed, no evidence of active bleeding at this time.
She did have recent colonoscopy that showed diverticulosis but she has not had any blood per rectum so this is unlikely cause.
EGD did not reveal source for her bleeding and she was discharged with a stable Hct.
#Acute heart failure - with right sided volume overload on recent CT scan as evidenced by RA dilation/hepatic congestion and abdominal fluid.
Most likely [**3-16**] cardiac dysfunction in the setting of severe anemia in setting of known CAD.
No evidence of active myocaridal infarction, CE's were negative x3.
TTE showed moderate symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function, mild mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
#Acute renal failure - most likely [**3-16**] decreased renal perfusion in the setting of severe anemia and acute heart failure resulting in prerenal state.
No evidence of UTI on UA.
#CAD - Patient has h/o LAD and RCA stents several years ago, not on plavix.
No evidence of active ischemia.
EKG without evidence of acute ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative x3.
Her ASA was restarted (as above), but coumadin held given recent GI bleed.
#hyperlipidemia - Home dose atorvastatin was continued.
