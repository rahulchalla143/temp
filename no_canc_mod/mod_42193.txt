At OSH, he underwent pleurex catheter placement for his right pleural effusion in late [**2169-4-4**].
He also had episodes of lightheadedness during this time.
At ED, he had episodes of hypotension with SBP in 70s responsive to IVFs.
Labs were notable for Cr 1.7, worsening anemia with Hgb 9.7, Na 126, K 5.3.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible TIPs for more definitive management of his hepatic hydrothorax.

IMAGING: CXR [**5-31**]:  As compared to [**2169-5-20**], the extent of the right pleural effusion has substantially decreased.
However, the remaining amount of pleural fluid is visible on the right, the fluid partially extends into the minor fissure.
There are areas of minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Coarse liver echotexture and nodular contour, compatible with underlying cirrhosis.
No focal hepatic lesion is seen.
Large right pleural effusion with chest tube in place.
Chest CT [**6-2**]: With the exception of minimal peribronchovascular ground-glass opacity in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe, the lungs are clear.
There is a moderate-sized non-hemorrhagic pleural effusion which contains locules of gas, consistent with recent drainage, with adjacent atelectasis.
The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion, though there is marked coronary arterial calcification.
Subcarinal nodal conglomerate measures 1.4 cm.
There is a tiny hiatal hernia, and a large amount of fluid is seen within the stomach.
Wedge-shaped perfusion abnormality in segment VII is likely the result of altered hemodynamics from TIPS.
The liver surface is nodular, consistent with diagnosis of cirrhosis.
Portocaval and celiac axis lymphadenopathy is noted, measuring up to 1.3 cm.
There is multilevel degenerative change of the thoracic spine but no acute bony abnormality.
IMPRESSION:  Moderate sized right non-hemorrhagic pleural effusion with gas within it, consistent with recent drainage.
A small amount of ground-glass opacity in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe is nonspecific and is likely inflammatory.
Cirrhosis, trace ascites, and splenomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old man with crytogenic cirrhosis complicated by portal HTN, ascites, and right-sided hepatic hydrothorax presenting with hypotension.
# INFECTED PLEURAL FLUID: Initially presented with sepsis due to infected pleural fluid.
ID was consulted and he was started on vanc and zosyn until cultures showed pseudomonas sensitive to ciprofloxacin at which time he was narrowed on [**5-24**].
Pleural fluid culture from [**5-22**] grew GNRs in broth only so no changes were made to antibiotics.
There was a question as to whether this represented a real infection vs. colonization.
Although this may have been contamination from skin/bag, he was switched to linezolid anyways, as he had been having low grade temps on the vanc/cipro regimen.
# Hepatic hydrothorax: Pleural fluid from OSH grew multiple organisms as outlined above.
Goal was to reduce hepatic hydrothorax via TIPS, which was performed on [**5-29**] without complications.
Suspicion existed for continued infection of the pleural fluid with possibility of loculations, so pulmonary ultrasound was performed.
In outpatient setting, he will need regular CXR's to assess for recurrence of hydrothorax .
# Cirrhosis: Pt with cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by ascites and hepatic hydrothorax.
Patient underwent TIPS on [**5-29**] without complications.
He was monitored closely for development of hepatic encephalopathy.
# Anemia: stable, no acute changes this admission .
# Acute kidney injury: Cr was 1.7 on presentation to OSH, peaked at 2.0, and improved to 1.3 prior to transfer from MICU to the floor.
# HLD: Continued lovastatin.

There was concern for an infection in the fluid surrounding your lung.
You underwent a procedure called Transhepatic Intrajugular Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) to help reduce the amount of fluid around the lung.
