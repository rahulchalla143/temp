She states she started having a cough several months ago, with productive sptutum that recently changed from yellow to greenish.
She went to HD yesterday, but it needed to be cut short due to muscle cramps, which has occurs with her recent HD sessions.
She was had a CXR concerning for RLL PNA and was given levo 750mg and vanco 1g.
EKG showed sinus rhythm with RBBB which was unchanged.
She had an elevated trop (but at baseline) and was give ASA 325mg.
No pain or SOB.
ROS: negative except for HPI   Past Medical History: -SVC thrombis -Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, on coumadin for HD -Hypertension -End-stage renal disease on dialysis [**2-28**] sarcoid -sarcoidosis -epilepsy, last sz [**2182**] -chronic pancreatitis -secondary hyperparathyroidism -hyperlipidemia -anemia -angioectasias of the stomach and colon   Social History: Originally from [**State 622**].
She is currently on medical disability due to her multiple medical illnesses.
**FINAL REPORT [**2185-10-14**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2185-10-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
Increased opacity at the right lung base is concerning for pneumonia.
Scarring in the upper lungs is again noted and has been previously assessed on multiple prior CT scans.
Central pulmonary vessels appear slightly prominent, which may be secondary to mild fluid overload.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, suggestion of mild congestion.
Opacity at the right lung base concerning for pneumonia.
A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest (by bubble study); cannot distinguish between a patent foramen ovale vs an atrial septal defect on the basis of this study.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Moderate stenosis of the right subclavian vein.
Moderate stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein near the confluence with SVC.
Small amount of adherent fibrin around the portion of the left IJ venous catheter within the SVC.
Known interstitial disease not well evaluated by MR.   Brief Hospital Course: 50 y.o.
F with hx of sarcoid, ESRD, HTN, admitted with SOB with hypoxia in setting of fever concerning for PNA.
Hypoxia: Likely secondary to decresed RV function and worsening lung disease at baseline as well as contribution of volume overload given history of not being able to complete full HD sessions in the last few weeks.
Sepsis: On admission, the patient had high fever and elevated lactate of 2.9 with likely pneumonia on CXR in the RLL.
Melena: During HD session in ICU, pt became tachypnic, tachycardic and hypertensive.
She was initially treated with nebs and CXR did not show a change from prior.
GI did not decide to pursue endoscopy as this was likely due to known AVMs.
1 pRBC was transfused during hospitalization with some resolution of her tachycardia.
Per request of her nephrologist, MRV of SVC was performed, which showed no SVC syndrome but known occlusions in IJ.

You were found to have a pneumonia and too much fluid on your body.
You were treated with dialysis and antibiotics.
You also had bleeding in your intestines that was likely from your AV malformations.
This should be dosed at your dialysis center, last day on [**2185-10-19**] - You were started on levaquin for your pneumonia, please complete your antibiotic course, your last day should be on [**2185-10-19**] - Your prednisone dose was decreased to 15mg to reduce your risk of stomach bleeding - You were given an albuterol inhaler to use if you are short of breath while you have pneumonia.
Please take [**1-28**] puff inhaled every 4 hours if short of breath.
If you have blood in your stool or black tarry stools, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, worsening cough, or other concerning symptoms please seek medical attention or go to the ER.
