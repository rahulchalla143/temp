She had been doing pretty well but started to experience some exertional angina with associated diaphoresis.
On approximately [**10-6**], she was awakened from sleep with chest pain and took two sublingual nitroglycerin which gave her relief, several hours later when she got up the pain returned.
She was pain free after receiving aspirin, nitroglycerin paste, and Reglan.
An electrocardiogram had some minor nonspecific changes, but she had an additional episode of chest pain in the morning while washing up in the bathroom which was also relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction by serial enzymes and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for catheterization.
Coronary artery disease; status post percutaneous    transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2150**] and left    circumflex stent in [**2156**].
There were no murmurs.
Her extremities were warm and well perfused and without any edema or varicosities.
Her right femoral catheterization site had a dry sterile dressing without any evidence of hematoma.
She had 2 plus bilateral radial dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
RADIOLOGY:  A preoperative chest x-ray showed a mildly enlarged heart, but the lungs were clear and no active lung disease.
An electrocardiogram on [**10-8**] showed just sinus bradycardia at a rate of 60 with an ST segment elevation in the inferior leads and a small Q waves in the inferior leads suggestive of a prior inferior myocardial infarction of unknown age.
Left anterior descending 95 percent proximal lesion, circumflex proximally occluded, right coronary artery 60 percent distal lesion, right posterior descending artery occluded, and posterolateral branch had mild disease.
Ejection fraction was 60 percent with no mitral regurgitation in this right-dominant system.
He had a blood pressure of 91/47, in sinus tachycardia at 101, and saturating 95 percent on 4 liters.
Postoperative laboratories were as follows.
The patient did receive 1 amp of bicarbonate for some acidosis during the day and then was off the Neo- Synephrine drip on the second.
Her extremities were warm with 2 plus peripheral edema.
On postoperative day five, the patient had a little bit of dyspnea on exertion later in the day on postoperative day four but she said the symptoms were decreasing during the day.
She had a few bibasilar crackles bilaterally.
She still had 2 plus pedal edema bilaterally.
She received some Percocet tablets for incisional pain, as she had some tenderness over the upper half of the incision.
Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty    and left circumflex stenting.
