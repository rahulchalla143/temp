STUDIES [**2189-6-5**]   Pathology Tissue: left lower lobe .
[**2189-6-5**] POST-PROCEDURE CXR Left lung has a decreased volume with large areas of consolidations in the left lower lobe and mediastinal shift to the left side.
Multiple other tiny opacities in the right lung and mild bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe and right lower lung are present.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion on the right side.
All these findings are better evaluated on a chest CT dated [**2189-1-8**] which suggest multifocal consolidation and bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis likely from infection.
No pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Other findings including left lower lung consolidation, left lung volume loss, and multiple tiny opacities in the right lung are all unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax.
The left lung remains diminished in overall volume with air bronchograms and patchy opacity predominantly in the left mid and lower lung.
There are bullous changes at the left apex which are stable.
No pneumothorax is seen.
The right lung demonstrates some prominent interstitial markings suggestive of bronchiectasis but the appearance does not appear to be significantly changed since [**2189-6-5**].
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
Probable left pleural effusion versus chronic pleural thickening.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 82M w/hx of obstructive and restrictive lung disease, admitted after he developed hypoxia and tachycardia in the PACU after outpatient scheduled bronchoscopy, found to have LLL congestion.
HYPOXIA Pt underwent scheduled outpatient bronchoscopy and LLL lung biopsy for known pulmonary disease of unknown etiology documented on recent CT chest.
CXR showed LLL congestion (no pre-procedure CXR for comparison).
TACHYCARDIA Pt tachycardic in the PACU coincident w/onset of hypoxia.
Thought to be [**3-12**] respiratory distress plus significant albuterol received.
EKG not suggestive of acute cardiac issues.
COPD/BRONCHIECTASIS Continued home meds: combivent and advair.
No wheeze on exam.
HTN Normotensive.
Hyperlipidemia Continued home Simvastatin 20mg qHS.
Combivent 18-103 mcg/actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) Inhalation once a day as needed for cough.
You were admitted to the ICU overnight because of low oxygen after your bronchoscopy yesterday.
