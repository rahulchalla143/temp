Admission Date:  [**2171-1-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2171-1-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2105-4-22**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal insufficiency secondary to bilateral renal artery stenosis who presents from Spinal [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation for intractable hypertension.
He was seen at the [**Hospital1 69**] in the middle of [**2170-10-1**] after experiencing lower extremity paralysis at an outside hospital in the setting of an aggressive antihypertensive regimen.
Ultimately, it was discovered that his relative hypotension had resulted in significant end-organ damage including an anterior spinal artery infarct resulting in T11 paraplegia, acute renal failure, and a troponin leak.
It is believed that his hypertension is most likely secondary to his bilateral renal artery stenosis.
Because of this, he was transferred back to [**Hospital1 69**] for definitive treatment.
Given that aggressive blood pressure lowering has yielded catastrophic results in the past, it was decided to admit him to the Intensive Care Unit for invasive blood pressure monitoring and parenteral therapy.
On admission the patient denies chest pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, palpitations, bowel or bladder incontinence, lightheadedness, or headache.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in the setting of sudden hypotension.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post aortobifemoral bypass.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2, and bilateral renal artery stenosis as described above.
Anterior spinal artery infarct secondary to hypoperfusion in the setting of antihypertensive medications.
Recent hospitalization in [**2170-9-1**] for a right upper lobe pneumonia requiring intubation for one month, status post a long course of levofloxacin.
Clostridium difficile colitis.
Eosinophilic fasciitis, currently on prednisone, methotrexate, and leucovorin.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  This is a pleasant 65-year-old gentleman in no acute distress who was afebrile with a blood pressure of 186/74 by cuff, and 195/72 by arterial line.
He had no jugular venous distention.
His lungs were clear with no wheezes or rales.
His heart was regular in rate and rhythm with normal first heart sound and second heart sound, and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
His abdomen was benign except for multiple ecchymoses along his lower abdomen and guaiac-positive stool.
His extremities were significant for clubbing bilaterally.
He had 3+ pitting edema to his calves bilaterally.
There were no femoral bruits.
He had left ventricular hypertrophy with strained pattern.
He had a Q wave in III.
Echocardiogram from [**2170-10-25**], showed an ejection fraction of 45%, with mild left atrial dilatation, and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
He had resting regional wall motion abnormalities including akinesis of the basal and middle inferoposterior wall, and hypokinesis of the posterolateral wall.
He had moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation.
He had a single episode of chest pain associated with a systolic blood pressure of 220 while on the Nipride drip, so a nitroglycerin drip was added as well.
He had no electrocardiogram changes or enzyme leak associated with the chest pain.
He also had 3-vessel coronary artery disease with normal left main artery, moderately diseased left anterior descending artery, totally occluded middle left circumflex and proximal right coronary artery, with good collateral flow to the distal portions of both of those vessels.
He began having 5-minute episodes of slightly blurred vision, that were most likely due to his low blood pressure.
Of note, a urine culture revealed a Proteus urinary tract infection that was treated with three days of ceftriaxone.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  He was treated with a course of Flagyl for his Clostridium difficile colitis.
He had no diarrhea during his hospital stay, and his stool was negative for Clostridium difficile toxin times two.
He did have trace guaiac-positive stool on admission, and his hematocrit drifted down over the first few days in the hospital.
ENDOCRINE:  He was continued on his steroids, methotrexate, and leucovorin for his eosinophilic fasciitis.
LINES:  He had an arterial line initially for intensive blood pressure monitoring while on Nipride that was removed after his drips were stopped.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1 to 1.2.
Bilateral renal artery stenosis, status post left renal artery stenting.
Paraplegia secondary to anterior spinal artery infarct.
Eosinophilic fasciitis complicated by steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
