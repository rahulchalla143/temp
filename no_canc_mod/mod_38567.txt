Coronary artery bypass grafting x2 with reverse     saphenous vein graft to the posterior left ventricular     branch artery and the second diagonal artery.
History of Present Illness: 74 year old male with dyspnea and chest discomfort, now referred for a cardiac catheterization.
Had increasing shortness of breath since [**2152-1-12**].
Occasionally the he will experience chest pain with exertion and requires one nitroglycerin SL for relief.
These episodes of dyspnea and chest pain have increased since his follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] in [**2152-1-12**].

Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the lateral, anterolateral, and inferolateral walls.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic stenosis by Doppler however there is likely an element of pseudo-aortic stenosis.
Likely there is mild to moderate aortic stenosis.
There is trace aortic to mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricle also displays improved systolic performance with mild global hypokinesis with continued severe lateral, anterolateral, and inferolateral hypokinesis.
The aortic valve area has improved to 1.6 cm2 consistent with mild to moderate aortic stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Transferred in for cardiac evaluation, after presenting to outside hospital for chest pain and ruled in for non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
He underwent a cardiac Catheterization that revealed significant coronary disease and cardiac surgery was consulted.
Post cardiac catheterization he had an acute kidney injury with peak creatinine to 3.2.
See operative report for further details, of note he required bougie for intubation.
(see anesthesia report)  He received cefazolin and vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.
He was transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative management on levophed for hypotension and milirone for systolic failure.
Postoperative day one he was weaned and extubated without complications and milirone was slowly tapered off.
That night he had increasing oxygen requirements with volume overload and was treated with diuretics with no response.
Postoperative day two he was placed on non invasive ventilation for hypoxia with good response, renal was consulted for acute kidney failure and he was started on CVVH for volume overload.
He was restarted on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
12. warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: Dose for goal INR of 2.0-2.5 for atrial fibrillation Tablets PO ONCE (Once): Goal INR 2.0-2.5.
