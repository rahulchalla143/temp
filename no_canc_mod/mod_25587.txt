The niece noted some bleeding that appeared frothy coming from her mouth.
She was intubated for airway protection but vomited just prior to intubation so was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole for concern of an aspiration pneumonia.
HTN 2.
Depression 3.
She has no etoh/tobacco/ivda history.

The superior mediastinum is ill- defined in comparison to the previous examination, which may be due to technique.
No apical cap is identified.
[**9-18**] Head CT: No acute intracranial pathology identified.
Left ethmoid air cell opacification, likely due to intubation.
[**9-18**] Abdominal U/S: Shrunken echogenic nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
Moderate ascites.
[**9-21**] CXR: Mild interstitial edema has worsened following extubation.
Progressive mediastinal widening suggests vascular engorgement.
Peritoneal cytology neg for malignant cells.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 53 year old woman with HCV cirrhosis admitted for obtundation and intubated for airway protection.
# Confusion: The patient's confusion was considered to be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
NG lavage initially showed blood and clot, but cleared after approximately 750cc.
Paracentesis revealed no evidence of SBP.
There was no evidence of other infections, with negative blood and urine cultures and chest xray with no evidence of pneumonia.
Ultrasound ruled out hepatic or portal vein thrombosis.
The patient was intubated for airway protection and she was treated with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
Ciprofloxacin was started for SBP prophylaxis in the context of ascites fluid with total protein <1 as well as GI bleed.
# Intubation: At the time of admission, the patient was intubated for airway protection.
She had no signs of respiratory failure.
As her mental status improved, sedation was lightened and the patient was successfully extubated on the morning after admission.
There was initially some concern for an aspiration event as she vomited just prior to intubation, so levofloxacin and metronidazole were started.
However, there was no evidence of aspiration pneumonia and the patient remained afebrile and with a normal WBC count, so antibiotics were not continued.
# GI bleed: As above, there was some blood on NG lavage, but the patient remained hemodynamically stable and there was no evidence of ongoing significant bleed.
The patient was noted to have guaiac positive stool, and this was attributed to known gastric antral vascular ectasia that had been noted on previous EGD.
# Anemia: Likely secondary to blood loss from GI bleed/ooze and likely at least partly dilutional due to IV hydration.
#Cirrhosis: The patient has known HCV cirrhosis and is well-known to liver service, who followed her throughout her hospital course.
A large volume paracentesis was done, with 4.4L of ascites removed.
There was no evidence of SBP on paracentesis.
She had some mild nausea and discomfort post-procedure which quickly improved.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] discussed with the patient that she is not a candidate to transplant for various reasons, including likely lack of followup as she plans to return to the [**Country 13622**] Republic.
# ARF: The patient's creatinine was mildly increased at 1.4 on admission.
This was considered most likely pre-renal given a possible GI bleed and decreased PO intake.
There was some concern for hepatorenal syndrome, but this was considered less likely.
Urine output did not initially improve as much as the BP and creatinine did with fluids, but eventually it did recover as well, particularly after transfusions of PRBC were given (as above), which helped to replete intravascular volume status.
# Hypernatremia: The patient became mildly hypernatremic, with sodium peaking at 150 on hospital day 3 and then trending downward.
# Diarrhea: The patient had stable diarrhea that was most likely secondary to use of lactulose to treat and prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
This is likely secondary to severe liver disease.
Our plan was to transfuse for significant bleeding or procedures or for platelet level less than 10.

- You will take ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic to prevent infections in the fluid in your abdomen, once per week.
You may also take Cepacol lozenges for throat discomfort.
