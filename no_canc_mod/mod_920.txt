IMAGING: CXR Portable [**2126-3-5**]: The visualized lung fields show diffuse linear opacities consistent with known fibrotic disease.
No pleural effusions, frank consolidations or pneumothorax is present.
No acute intrathoracic process.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo m with hx of COPD, admitted with N/V/D and fever with tahcycardia and hypotension.
73 yo m with hx of COPD, admitted with N/V/D and fever consistent with viral gastroenteritis, as well as with tachycardia and hypotension secondary to hypovolemia.
# GI sx: Thought to represent a viral gasterenteritis.
Bacterial infection was felt to be less likely because the patient experienced large volume watery stools without blood.
Additionally, C difficile was felt to be unlikely because patient had no recent antibiotic use.
Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting resolved completely and the patient was advanced quickly from a diet of clear liquids to regular solid food.
He denied any GI symptoms at discharge.
# Hypotension/tachycardia: The patient was initially tachycardic and hypotensive, thought to be secondary to infection and hypovolemic state.
His labs were consistent with dehydration and his hemodynamics improved with IV fluid rehydration.
He was then transferred to the medicine floor, where he continued to maintain his systolic BP in the 90-120 range.
# Hypoxia: Pt has a history of COPD and bullous disease with multiple spontaneous pneumothoraces.
He remained asymptomatic at rest and with ambulation.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: At admission, patient's creatinine was elevated to 1.7, likely secondary to dehydration in the setting of viral gastroenteritis.
