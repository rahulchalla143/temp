HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Elective admission for a 54-year- old male with history of insulin-dependent diabetes x 20 years and urticaria, now to be evaluated for persistent urticaria with labile blood sugars x several months.
However, in [**2162-10-9**], he reports fairly abrupt onset of urticarial reactions he described as daily and co-relating with his insulin administration.
No shortness of breath/tongue swelling/wheezing during these episodes.
Recently has been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**] from Allergy, and started on Medrol, which resulted in elevated blood sugars.
The patient now being admitted for improved blood sugar control in the setting of steroids and management of urticaria to determine if remedies can be made to the question of insulin allergy.
No fevers/chills/nausea or vomiting.
No chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations.
No insect bites.
No detergents/cologne or clothing changes.
No abdominal pain.
Of note, urticaria is described as encompassing the whole body.
Insulin-dependent diabetes x 20 years.
CAD status post PCI in [**2162-5-9**] at outside hospital.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile at 97.8, blood pressure 126/72, pulse of 88, respiratory rate 20, and 97 percent on room air.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Extremities:  No edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Rashes/Urticaria:  The patient was initially admitted under the supervision of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**] from Allergy for further evaluation of the patient's urticarial skin reactions thought secondary to insulin.
Of note, these reactions usually were found to be with skin that was quite erythematous or raised, but without any signs of respiratory compromise - i.e., there was no laryngeal or tongue swelling or edema.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for further help and management of his diabetes given that his blood sugars are elevated in the setting of markedly elevated steroid requirements.
His reactions were somewhat unique for true insulin allergy, given the fact that there was no local reaction at the site where the syringe entered the skin.
Initially, there was also some question as to whether patient was truly a type 1 diabetic requiring insulin.
Records from outside hospitals did in fact show that he has a positive antiGAD antibody and negative C- peptide antibody, showing that in fact he was type 1 diabetes and would require insulin for treatment.
There ultimately was a trend towards moving patient towards shorter-acting insulins and even a, thought about possibly insulin pump.
Ultimately, after several days of continued reactions to largely longer-acting insulins, it was thought the next step would be to move the patient to the ICU for an insulin-desensitization trial.
He did travel to the ICU midway through his hospital course and underwent desensitization with a Regular insulin IV drip, which went without complications.
At this point, longer-acting insulins were held secondary to fear for potential angioedema type reaction.
Based upon these circumstances, it was decided to actually perform skin testing to once and for all determine if patient had true insulin allergy.
After having been abstaining from all antihistamines x 2 days and using Medrol at higher doses to mitigate urticarial reactions, patient underwent skin testing for various insulins.
The skin testing results showed that patient did not have an allergy to insulin after all.
If anything, there was question of potential allergy to Lente insulin.
At this point, it was felt that the reactions could be characterized as chronic idiopathic urticarial reactions.
The etiology of his urticaria at this point remains unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] is due to follow up with both the [**Hospital 9039**] Clinic and also with either his local diabetics or with the [**Hospital **] Clinic.
Diabetes:  As mentioned above, the patient initially admitted for question of an insulin allergy and for further assistance of management of diabetes in the setting of high-dose steroids.
As they imagined, the patient had quite labile blood sugars in the setting of increased steroids.
Ultimately he was found to be a type 1 diabetic based upon results of antiGAD antibodies and C-peptide antibodies.
Ultimately, it was felt that patient was not having allergic reactions to insulin, but rather his urticaria reactions were chronic and idiopathic.
He also may be discharged on Lantus and short-acting insulin.
Given the fact that he had Q-waves in his EKG, he was ruled out for MI, but he had no symptoms during his hospital course.
Transient hyperkalemia:  The patient had several episodes of hyperkalemia, asymptomatic, without ECG changes.
Type 1 diabetes status post insulin desensitization.
Coronary artery disease.
only for severe shortness    of breath or wheezing.
