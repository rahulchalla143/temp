He was diagnosed with AIDS on [**2106-5-18**] and found to have multiple CNS lesions.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**2106-6-10**] - [**2106-6-24**] and CNS lesions were treated as toxo empirically.
In terms of his HIV, he was diagnosed on [**2106-5-18**] when he was hospitalzed for cough and interstitial infiltrates on CXR.
On CT scan, there were diffuse ground glass opacities and infection was presumed, although no micro dx was made (AFB smears negative, legionella/mycoplasma negative).
Head CT revealed 1 cm lesion in the R thalamus and 2x2 cm lesion in R parietal lobe (no ring enhancement).
He was unable to get an MRI because of residual shrapnel.
A f/u head CT scan [**6-27**] revealed only slight improvement in R parietal ahd thalamic lesions, so he was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a 2nd opinion and further imaging and/or brain biopsy.
Past Medical History: # appendectomy # gun shot wounds in a robbery, w/ shrapnel in neck and L chest    Social History: Wife and 3 children live in [**Country 4194**] and are unaware of his diagnosis.
Family History: 12 siblings, 2 brothers in US - all healthy per report F 82 good health M died at 58 of liver cancer   Physical Exam: VS: T 99.6, BP 91/49, HR 58, RR 16, sats 100% on RA GEN: WDWN middle aged male in NAD.
HEENT: L pupil more sluggish than right, but both pupils are reactive.
Sclera anicteric.
OP with thick thrush all over tongue.
No LAD appreciated.
EXT: Warm, 2+ DP/radial pulses BL, no edema.
SKIN: 2 blackened lesions on right underside of his lower lip, nonbleeding.
No rash, but has large ecchymotic area on abdomen (at site of appy scar).
Also with small scattered hyperpigmented, flat macular lesions across lower aspect of his abdomen, R>L.
Pertinent Results: [**2106-7-21**] CT head results per radiology: Several hypodense lesions, small R anterior SDH resolving.
[**7-5**] and [**7-9**] EGD Esophagitis, appeared consistent with candidiasis.
Brief Hospital Course: This 40 year old gentleman recently diagnosed with AIDS was transferred from an outside hospital when new brain lesions were found in a workup for mental status changes.
He has had a complex course during which he was discovered to have CMV viremia, [**Female First Name (un) **]/HSV esophagitis leading to unstable upper GI bleed, pancytopenia, and a small SDH.
A possible cause of his mental status change was revealed when studies found him to have CMV viremia--the patient was started on valganciclovir with some improvment in mental status.
The EGD revealed severe erosive candidiasis--a few days later the patient developed hematemesis/upper GI bleed with hemodynamic instability (of note pt was pancytopenic in this setting).
Repeat endoscopy confirmed general bleeding from the inflammed upper GI mucosa-a biopsy revealed the presence of HSV.
The bleed resolved and pt transferred back to floor on [**7-11**]--pt had no further evidence of GI bleed.
His pancytopenia resolved and he showed no signs of immune reconstitution syndrome and by this time his mental status had normalized .
Serial head CTs revealed no change in the brain lesions.
There was revealed a small R sided a SDH which was resolving by time of discharge.
See below for individual summary of the many issues of this pt:  Neuro:  Pt was admitted to the hospital for work up of CNS lesions discovered after admission to an OSH for mental status changes.
He was empirically treated for toxoplasmosis, with little response.
Head CT on [**7-13**] revealed stable CNS lesions but a new small SDH; his neuro exam through his admission was notable for improving left-sided weakness.
Repeat head CT on [**7-22**] showed stable lesions and SDH.
GI:  Patient was also complaining of pain with swallowing.
He was one week into treatment with fluconazole, with no resolution of symptoms when admitted.
An EGD was performed on [**7-5**], which demonstrated severe erosive esophagitis consistent with candidiasis.
He had had an episode of hematemesis on [**7-8**].
He became hypotensive with a dropping HCT, and was transferred to the ICU on [**7-9**].
Repeat EGD on [**7-9**] showed blood and clots in the esophagus and GEJ, no lesions in the stomach or duodenum.
On discharge, he had much improved, mild odynophagia.
CMV - The patient was found to have CMV viremia.
HEME:  Over the course of his stay, the patient became pancytopenic.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**7-9**], which showed a hypocellular marrow, negative cultures, likely consistent with HIV infection vs medication side effect.
ENDO:  The patient had elevated FSBS on dexamethasone, for which he was covered with ISS.
Brain lesions of unknown etiology   Discharge Condition: Afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Very mild residual left-sided weakness and mild odynophagia.
You were admitted to the hospital for treatment of masses that were seen in your brain.
During your admission, you began vomiting with some blood, which after looking with a special camera were from a severe irritation in your stomach from HSV, a virus.
If you develop any more bloody vomiting, or have dizziness, blurry vision, weakness, nausea, or develop shortness of breath, chest pain or feel ill, please call your primary care doctor or come into the emergency room.
