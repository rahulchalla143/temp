On [**7-31**] he was brought to Operating Room by vascular surgery for serial arteriogram of the left lower extremity and balloon angioplasty of the proximal peroneal artery.
He was begun on beta blockers and then Cardizem was initiated after Amiodarone failed to control his atrial fibrillation.
He converted to sinus rhythm and Coumadin was resumed for the paroxysmal fibrillation and his peripheral vascular disease.
He was below his properative weight at discharge but there remained a moderate asmount of right stump edema which precluded the prosthesis from fitting.
The toe amputaion site was clean with a wound vac in place.
