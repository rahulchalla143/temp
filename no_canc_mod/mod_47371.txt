[**3-17**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Small right-sided pleural effusion.
[**3-23**] CXR: CONCLUSION: New right basal atelectasis or infiltrate.
Improving right basilar atelectasis.
Prominence of the right upper mediastinum again seen, possibly representing prominent vessels versus possible enlarged thyroid.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient required extra 3 days in the hospital because his oxygen saturations dropped to 60% on ambulation with physical therapy on Friday [**2179-3-19**].
Respiratory compromise appears to be from progression of COPD, complicated by PNA and moderate CHF with BNP of 1300s.
V/Q to evaluate for PE was considered but not done given his clinical improvement.
Encourage smoking cessation, continue nebs and pulmonary rehab.
# Paroxysmal afib: Pt with hx of PAF dating back to [**2174**] when he had his first documented episode of a fib while admitted for COPD exacerbation.
In [**2175**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] discontinued coumadin as he only had one episode of a fib, which was thought to be from combination of COPD and EtOH use.
Echo last month showed EF>70%, mild LVOT obtruction increased with valsalva, During current hospital course, pt has had intermittent episodes of tachycardia to 150s noted to be afib on telemetry.
# Mental status changes: Since [**2179-3-20**], the patient has been oriented x3, cooperative with the exam.
Ativan only prn, avoiding if possible because of respiratory effects.
PTH level elevated secondary to low calcium level.
# Anemia: Hct baseline 34-40, though at last admit was more in the low 30s.
TIBC was low suggesting ACD, likely [**3-12**] to renal failure.
