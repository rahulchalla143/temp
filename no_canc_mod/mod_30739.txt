Recently admitted to [**Hospital1 46**] from [**Date range (1) 98806**] for respiratory failure secondary to CHF and COPD exacerbation.
Patient with chronic exertional dyspnea with mild-moderate activity, minimally ambulatory, lives in a Nursing Home due to his medical comorbidities.
The staff at his NH noted that he was tachypneic (RR 28) and requiring additional oxygen supplementation.
On arrival, he was in mild respiratory distress and was found to have bibasilar crackles and a swollen ~4 inch fluctuant mass over the ICD implant that was erythematous, warm, and tender.
After explantation, there was continued oozing from the site and a drain was left in place.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
NECK: Supple without elevated JVP .

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
NECK: Supple without elevated JVP, Large EJ.
LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds over lower lung fields.
No crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi.
No femoral bruits.
The additional presence of pneumonia cannot be excluded .
(ECHO [**2170-7-28**]) The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the tricuspid or pulmonic valves.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 61M with history of CAD, MI, sCHF EF 15-20%, VFib arrest s/p ICD placement in [**2167**], COPD on 2L home O2, who presents from [**Hospital1 **] with MRSA bacteremia and ICD pocket infection.
# MRSA ICD INFECTION with Bacteremia: MRSA bacteremia found at OSH, Positive growth of Staph aureus from ICD pocket, blood cx negative since admission here.
He had a transient decrease in HCT with oozing around pocket, and was 26.7 on day of discharge.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Initially hypoxic beyond baseline (3L on admission, 2L at home) with bibasilar rales and bilateral effusions, JVP elevation, peripheral edema.
Likely due to iatrogenic causes in setting of MRSA bacteremia and initial presentation of sepsis.
His BPs were in the 80-90s on d/c but patient was asymptomatic with no orthostasis on exam.
In addition, he was able to ambulate with no lightheadedness, dizziness, SOB, or syncope.
# COPD: During this admissio patient was weaned to his home baseline oxygen requirement of 2L day and night.
No cough or increased sputum to suggest COPD exacerbation.
Hypoxia/dyspnea likely related to CHF as above.
# CAD / VFib arrest: Large MI in [**2167**] with IST and VFib arrest, s/p DESx3 to LAD.
Per report no further episodes of VFib or VTach.
# CKD: Reportedly with elevated Cr in the past (1.2 +) although during this admission patient discharged with Cr 0.8, and range was .8 - 1.0.
# TRANSITIONAL - Add Spironolactone as outpatient if SBP tolerates.
Torsemide 60 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 671**] HealthCare/Pediatric Center at [**Location (un) 3320**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Pocket Infection 2) Staph Coag positive bacteremia 3) Coronary artery disease 4) Acute on Chronic systolic congestive heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] due to fevers and elevated levels of blood cells that fight infection.
It was determined that your ICD(Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) was infected and we removed it to prevent the infection from getting worse.
