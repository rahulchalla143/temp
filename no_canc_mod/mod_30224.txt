This came on suddenly and was accompanied by low backpain, sore throat and one episode of vomiting.
He denied cough, new GI symptoms (baseline diarrhea),photophobia or neck stiffness.
His daughter had a fever and sore throat 3 days prior.
A UA was checked and negative for LE, nitrites and did show 0-5 WBCs and trace bacteria.
A CXR showed some increasing interstitial markings but no acute lung process.
A non-contrast CT of the abdomen showed a non-obstructing renal calculus, b/l perinephric stranding, mild colonic transmural thickening in the rectum and sigmoid and a ventral hernia without obstruction.
Shortly after admisssion to the OSH he became acutely hypotensive with SBPs in the 70s-90s and had a temp of 103.
During his stay at the OSH stool studies were checked on [**6-17**] and were negative for giardia, cryptosporidiuma and c.diff.
He had a left LE LENI that was negative for DVT but did show a 3.4 x 1.9 cm subcutaneous inguinal nodule possibly representing a LN or resolving hematoma.
He was seen by ID who was concerned for strep throat and a throat swab was obtained.
They were also concerned for cellulitis of the leg and possible lumbar spine abscess.
Because of the backpain and concern for ETOH withdrawal he was given serax, morphine and percocet.
Last evening he became somnolent with labored breathing and was transferred to the ICU.
He had profuse diarrhea at the time.
At 1 AM the anesthesia note states they were called to intubate the patient for acute respiratory distress.
Upon arrival here the patient was tachycardic and in significant respiratory distress with RR in the mid 40s, HR in the 120s-130s and sats 100% on the vent.
Past Medical History: - h/o MRSA cellulitis - Crohn's disease since [**2104**]; s/p ileocecectomy for psoas abscess and a fistula in [**2112**], postop course complicated by SBO, had another partial SBO in [**2119**].
- DVT/PE s/p IVC filter - Foot abscess s/p I&D (unclear when this was) - childhood asthma - ?HTN - OSA - s/p cholecystectomy [**2119**] - renal stones - [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome   Social History: The patient is married with 3 children and is a podiatrist.

Possible localizing sources include pharyngeal source, given recent sore throat; his back, retroperitoneum or sources with pain referred to these areas given recent backpain; his bowel, given h/o IBD; his bone given h/o previous osteomyelitis (possibly chronic oste involving foot wounds) and also his skin given recent LE cellulitis.
Workup revealed positive ASO titers and Beta-strep from LE wound.
CT of lower extremities showed evidence of osteomyelitic changes (could be chronic).
Other imaging limited by his size and mental status.
However, on the night that he died he became hemodynamically unstable, possibly in the setting of new infectious/ischemic process, requiring administration of vasopressors.
Suspicion of an intra-abdominal source as the primary cause of his rapid deterioration and eventual death was high.
Pt developed a distended abdomen shortly before his death.
He was not stable enough for imaging, and died before further evaluation could be undertaken.
Pt developed blown pupils bilaterally also suggesting possible intracranial process.
However, in severe sepsis pt's can reportedly develop such CNS changes as well.
2) Tachycardia: Pt had intermittent sinus tachycardia as well as atrial fibrillation.
Possibly due to infectious processes and hypovolemia.
He had a significant metabolic acidosis as well as probable sepsis.
Additionally, it appears he got some sedating medications and became somnolent and subsequently hypoxic.
CXR showed increased interstitial markings.
No clear signs of volume overload.
Pt was re-intubated twice during his MICU course, the last time being just prior to his death as his became unresponsive and developed hypoxic respiratory failure.
4) Renal insufficiency: Likely due to sepsis.
Unclear if reported thickening of sigmoid d/t Crohn's or infectious process.
6) H/o DVT s/p IVC filter: SC heparin for ppx .
7) Question of seizure: on night of admission, pt showed signs of possible seizure activity.
