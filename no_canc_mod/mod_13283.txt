She has a history of a connective tissue disorder, but this was ruled out as Marfan syndrome.
A CAT scan was performed at a local hospital, which revealed an ascending aortic dissection.
Of note, there was no aortic insufficiency, but one of the carotid arteries was occluded.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She had no overt neurological deficit.
Abdomen was soft and nontender.
She had no masses palpable.
Unfortunately, several hours after surgery, when she awoke, she was found to have right hemiplegia.
This demonstrated occlusive disease with a loss of flow signal at the left internal carotid artery involving the proximal left middle cerebral artery.
Bilateral supraclinoid carotid occlusive disease was present, more pronounced on the left.
There was diminished branching of the left middle cerebral artery.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable, but her neurological abnormality progressed.
She developed dilated pupils and decorticate posturing at approximately 6 a.m. on [**2109-9-13**].
Neurology continued to follow the patient closely, but there was progressive brain injury present.
Connective tissue disorder.
