He was recently admitted to OSH (2 weeks ago) with 5 day stay for presumed COPD exacerbation, ?pneumonia at that time.
Stayed in bed all day and had poor PO intake.
Wife reports slightly loose bowel movements.
Also c/o mild abdominal pain and seemed to have worsening breathing difficulties.
Mild cough.
Per wife, has depression but does not believe he would be at risk for OD of any type.
Pre-intubation developed hypotension and started on levophed.
Lab derangements include ARF, hyperkalemia, combined met/resp acidosis (7.16), transaminitis with hyperbilirubinemia.
CT abdomen without contrast performed and showed multifocal pneumonia, equivocal peripancreatic stranding (lipase normal).
Head CT done prior to transfer - no bleed seen.
Past Medical History: - COPD - HTN - Depression - History of bowel resection and anastamosis due to "kinking" 1.5 years ago - History of chronic back pain s/p surgery x3   Social History: - Tobacco:  Quit smoking 1 week ago.
Wife denies history of withdrawals.
No recent travel.
No unusual hobbies/exposures.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pupil 5mm and very slightly reactive (4-4.5).
Neck: supple, obese, IJ line in place, difficult to otherwise appreciate JVP, no LAD Lungs: Right slightly decreased compared to left, generally coarse but no crackles or wheezes appreciated.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, Abdomen:  hypoactive bowel sounds, soft, non-tender, obese but non-distended, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm UEs but feet cool, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: unresponsive to painful stimuli.
On discharge: ambulatory, conversational, diffuse expiratory wheezes, prolonged expiratory phase or respiration, 1+ b/l pitting edema at shins, distant heart sounds.
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2157-4-26**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS, CHAINS, AND CLUSTERS.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Dense bibasilar pulmonary consolidations in the lower and less so right middle lobes, most likely reflecting multifocal pneumonia.
Given the location, component of aspiration cannot be excluded.
Mild peripancreatic edema adjacent to the pancreatic head and body.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
There again are multiple areas of increased opacification, especially in the left mid and lower lung zones, most compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
Small area of similar increased opacification is seen at the right base.
This is superimposed upon some engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with increased pulmonary venous pressure.
There is again prominence of both hila, which could be a manifestation of prominent perihilar edema or possibly enlargement of hilar lymph nodes.
[**4-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of fluid overload.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
[**4-29**] ECHO: Saline bubble contrast study was performed with cough and Valsalva release as well as during rest.
No acute pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology.
No evidence of pulmonary AVM.
Mild-to-moderate centrilobular emphysema with upper lobe predominance.
Several scattered small multifocal patchy opacities, could infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
Persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
Unchanged severe T8 compression fracture without acute spinal  malalignment .
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity size and global systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 48M with COPD and HTN, presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS and septic shock.
# ARDS/hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumonia.
Appeared to be pneumonia on presentation(aspiration vs. CAP vs. HAP given recent hospitalization) Unlikely to be ARDS given focal consolidation on initital CXR.
Post-extubation the pt was hypertensive and persistently hypoxic- this was thought to be [**1-25**] flash pulmonary edema and responded well to nitro gtt, IV enalapril and lasix.
It was thought that his hypoxia was related to a shunt phenomenon, due to the fact that his oxygen saturation did not change with large changes in his supplemental oxygen, a TTE was done that was non-diagnostic due to image quality and a CTA was done that ruled out a PE.
His oxygen requirement continued to decrease and on the day he was transferred to the medical service he was on room air with oxygen saturations in the low 90's.
On the floor, hypoxia continued to improve and patient saturated in the low 90s on either room air or 1-2 L nasal cannula.
Walked with PT, ate, all without SOB or desaturation.
# Septic shock.
BPs stable since then, eventually hypertensive which seems to be pts baseline.
Shock physiology had resolved, so patient was back on almost all of his antihypertensives (still holding atenolol on discharge) and without hypotension, and with improvement in his laboratory values that had previously been indicating septic shock.
# COPD: patient with a history of COPD, per his PCP prior to these episodes of pneumonia his PFT's did not show severe COPD.
Likely ischemic shock ATN vs. prerenal.
# Transaminitis.
Hep serologies negative.
# Thrombocytopenia.
Unclear baseline, there seems to be some component of pancytopenia following septic event, gradually trended upward.
# Leukocytosis: believed due to steroid administration.
plan for outpatient VNA check of CBC and faxing to PCP.
# Anemia: believed d/t etoh use, septic physiology; not clinically bleeding.
recommend outpatient anemia work-up.
# Lower extremity edema: believed d/t post-sepsis fluid resuscitated state with fluid settling in legs; recommended leg elevation, ambulation, compression stockings, to help with mobilization of fluid.
Doxepin 10 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
Compression stocking for bilateral lower extremity edema.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) nebulized treatment Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Combivent 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) inhalation treatment Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
of [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Multifocal pneumonia COPD exacerbation Bacteremia Shock liver Septic shock Acute renal failure Respiratory failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with respiratory distress, this was believed to be due to a pneumonia and an associated exacerbation of your COPD.
Continue to take your regular home medications except change the following: - START a new steroid (prednisone) taper over the 2 weeks - START vancomycin (an antibiotic), given IV once a day, for another 4 days by the visiting nurse team - STOP naproxen (you were taking this for pain, but it can injure your kidneys, so don't take it until you follow-up with your primary care physician) - STOP levofloxacin/levaquin and azithromycin (antibiotics you had been taking before, and now have completed the courses) - STOP atenolol, because your blood pressure has been on the lower side; if you blood pressure is elevated, then you will restart this medicaiton at half dose and then up to full dose as needed - START colace, a stool softener, as needed for constipation - START advair inhalations to treat COPD - START spiriva inhalations to treat COPD  Followup Instructions: Please attend the following appointment with a pulmonologist (lung doctor): .
