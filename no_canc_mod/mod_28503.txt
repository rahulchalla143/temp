Admission Date:  [**2110-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-4-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-6-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: transfer from [**Hospital3 105**]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Rigid bronchoscopy with removal of tracheal granulation tissue, tracheal dilation and tracheostomy tube change   History of Present Illness: 71F transferred from [**Hospital3 105**] for evaluation of blocked tracheostomy tube, increasing ventilatory pressures.
Initially at [**Hospital1 **] with trach in place and then she had increasing PEEP and bronch showed 90% stenosis distal to ostomy site.
Bronchoscopy there showed granulation tissue and edema.
Today pt had respiratory arrest and had ET tube passed and non-fenestrated tube placed.
Pt also had R sided PNA and MRSA bacteremia.
Also with Klebsiella UTI/PNA.
Pt then found to have LLL infiltrate with pleural effusion (Klebsiella empyema) that was drained by thoracentesis and then chest tube placed (removed [**2110-3-14**]).

Due to the marked obliquity of this chest x-ray.
Right-sided effusion is visualized.
IMPRESSION: Lucencies in the right apical and basilar regions, which could represent a pneumothorax.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2110-4-23**] 1:09 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
High-grade tracheal stenosis immediately below the tracheostomy which its lower part most probably is due to extensive granulation tissue.
High-grade narrowing above the tube insertion may be due to granulation tissue and/or edema.
Moderate right-sided pneumothorax.
Loculated moderate right pleural effusion and small left one which suggests lung atelectasis.
Hypodense lesion in the left kidney, further evaluation with ultrasound is recommended.
2) Ovoid lucencies in the right medial upper lung zone and large lucency at the right lung base likely residual pneumothorax, allowing for differences in positioning, not significantly changed from the prior study.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Tracheal stenosis: The patient was admitted with tracheal stenosis confirmed by bronchoscopy and tracheal CT.
This was followed with serial chest X-rays and thoracentesis or chest tube were not felt to be indicated.
3) Splenic aneurism and kidney hypodensity, incedental.
4) Hyptertension: the patient was noted to have hypertension to the 130-170s and was treated with her usual medications (clonidine patch, coreg, lasix), except captopril was discontinued in favor of hydralazine as her creatinine was increasing.
5) History of CHF: She is on bet blockade but no ACE inhibitor, which was not felt to be necessary as her echo showed EF 60%, 1+AR, no WMA.
8) Anemia of chronic disease: She is on iron and Epo  9) Code: Full   Medications on Admission: Meds on admission: Tylenol 650 mg q 4 prn [**1-6**] NTP prn for BP > 160 Combivent q 4 hours Iron 325 mg TID Lasix 40 mg PO BID Epo 20K Monday and Friday Lantus 24 units qHS RISS Clonidine patch (due 0.3 mg QWednesday) Prevacid 30 mg PO qD Reglan 10 mg PO Q8H ASA 81 Heparin 5000 SC TID captopril 12.5 mg TID Coreg 3.125 mg Po BID Celexa 20 mg PO QD Glucerna TF 70 ml/hr continuous, 200 ml free water Q12H Beneprotein 1 scoop [**Hospital1 **] Vitamin C 500 QD Zinc 220 mg QD Xenaderm [**Hospital1 **] to sacral area Bacitracin to G tube site   Discharge Medications: 1.

Also, please return to [**Hospital1 18**] pulmonary division or MICU in approximately 1 month for replacement and inspection of your tracheal tube.
