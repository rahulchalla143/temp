There is a small approximately 1 cm fracture fragment of the right coranoid process of the mandible with preserved integrity of the entire mandible.
There is marked soft tissue swelling overlying the entire right side of the face and to a lesser extent over the left face.
There is moderate subcutaneous emphysema distributed over the orbit and maxilla.
There is a tiny amount of right retroorbital air along with a small approximately 1 cm right retroorbital hematoma.
At the junction of the left sphenoid and temporal bones, there is a minimally displaced fracture with adjacent subcutaneous emphysema, best appreciated on series 2, image 65.
Fluid/soft tissue change of the ethmoid, sphenoid, and right maxillary sinuses are also noted.
There is a 1.2 x 0.8 cm cystic lesion of the maxilla to the right of midline which may represent an incisive canal cyst.
Fractures of all walls of the right orbit and right maxilla.
Small bubble of air intracranially adjacent to a fracture of the superior wall.
Right retroorbital hematoma and inferior rectus muscle abutting fracture fragments.
Fractures of the right zygoma and zygomatic arch.
Bilateral medial and lateral pterygoid plate fractures.
Right mandibular coronoid process fracture with maintained mandibular integrity.
Left sphenoid bone fracture at the junction of the temporal and sphenoid bones with extension into posterior/inferior wall of the left orbit and the left maxillary sinus.

INDICATION: Pedestrian struck with left shoulder dislocation.
CT LEFT SHOULDER WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a comminuted fracture through the superolateral humeral head.
There are multiple fracture fragments located superiorly and medially within the glenohumeral joint.
There is blood tracking within the teres major muscle without a discrete hematoma.
There is a large amount of edema within the axilla which tracks along the neurovascular bundle, along the left lateral chest wall and within the subcutaneous tissues.
Additionally, there are dependent changes seen along the path posterior lung fields.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen within the imaged portion of the left common carotid artery.
Comminuted fracture of the superolateral humeral head with fracture fragments around and within the glenohumeral joint.
Marked soft tissue edema about the left shoulder as described above.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5998**] DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  FEMUR (AP & LAT) RIGHT; TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) RIGHT  Reason: r/o fractures  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 56 year old man s/p peds struck, severe R leg pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o fractures INDICATION: 56-year-old man with severe right leg pain.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR: There is a fracture of the prioximal shaft extending from the subtrochanteric region.
There are three fracture line visualized, with medial displacement and varus angulation of the distal fragment.
FIVE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT KNEE AND TIBIA AND FIBULA: There is mildly displaced oblique tibial fracture.
There is mildly displaced comminuted high fibular fracture.
Three views of the right foot demonstrate no evidence of acute bony injury.
SINGLE VIEW OF THE PELVIS: Aside from the right proximal femoral fracture, no additional acute bony injury is demonstrated.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: post op eval.just AP view please, pt's L arm cannot be movedplease do not allow pt to move L arm during shooting, so pure AP view can be obtained HISTORY: Trauma, to compare with previous study.
FINDING: In comparison with the study of [**2113-10-10**], there is no significant change.
Again there is an avulsed bony fragment from left greater tuberosity fracture that is projecting in the acromiohumeral interval.
No metallic fixation device is seen.
As noted above, Mr. [**Known lastname 75087**] was brought into the trauma bay by EMS with a number of notable orthopaedic injuries.
His treatment, organized by problems, consisted of:  #SAH-->  Pt was noted to have a small-moderate Subarachnoid hemmorhage with a normal neurological exam.
Serial examinations were normal, and a repeat CT showed no worsening of his hemmorhage.
He has had no further neurological events.
had comminuted fractures in his L LE, treated via ORIF of femur, tib as noted above.
had no complications of this surgery, and has been improving with PT in the post-op period.
Eventually on [**10-9**] he was taken to the OR for repair of his aforementioned shoulder injuries.
He had no post-op complications and has been participating with PT.
Ophthalmology saw the patient before his operation, and cleared him from the standpoint of intra-ocular lesions.
At no time was he section 12 or suffering from suicidal or homicidal ideation.
He has had no behavioural problems while in house.
Psychiatry felt that his psychosis was stable; it required no further medications, and he required no specialized psychiatric hospitalization.
Please see his psychiatric and social work notes for extensive details of his history.
#FEN--> at time of discharge patient is able to tolerate a PO diet without difficulty; he is taking a diabetic diet and has recieved diabetic teaching from the nutritionist.
He was initially started on a SS regimen, but this had to be increased twice due to continually high FSG.
