HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and positive tobacco history who presents with one week of dyspnea on exertion.
The shortness of breath is relieved with rest.
The patient denies any recent illness, nausea, vomiting, cough, rhinorrhea, fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain, or abdominal pain.
At the [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital the patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and was diuresed.
He then went into atrial fibrillation was put on a diltiazem drip.
The patient was then given a digoxin load, but no beta blocker given the severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on his pulmonary function tests; which revealed FEV1 of 0.5 (which is 29% of predicted), FVC of 1.05 (which is 45% of predicted), and FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%.
In [**2155**], a motor vehicle accident with rib and collar bone fractures.
Peripheral edema.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; with FEV1 of 0.5 (which is 29% of predicted), FVC of 1.05 (which is 45% of predicted), and FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%.
Total hip replacement.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history revealed no evidence of coronary artery disease.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusion.
Echocardiogram at the outside hospital showed mild left atrial enlargement, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and ejection fraction of 55% to 60%, severe aortic stenosis, with a peak gradient of 114 mmHg, a mean gradient of 55 mmHg, an area of 0.7 cm2, trace aortic regurgitation, trace mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary aortic systolic hypertension (PASD of 40 mmHg plus RAP).
There was 0.5-mm ST depressions in leads I and II.
There were T wave inversions and 4-mm ST depressions in leads V3 through V6.
There was evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.
AORTIC STENOSIS:  A repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, moderate left atrial enlargement, moderate right atrial enlargement, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve are was 0.7 cm2, peak gradient of 98 mmHg, mean gradient of 60 mmHg, and peak velocity of 5 m/sec), trivial mitral regurgitation, 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild systolic pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and trivial pericardial effusion.
The patient was taken to catheterization which again showed several aortic stenosis with a gradient of 50 mmHg to 60 mmHg.
Also on catheterization, there was only 50% stenosis of the medial left anterior descending artery.
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted for possible aortic valve replacement.
If this medical regimen is to fail, the patient may return for palliative valvuloplasty.
However, it is advised that valvuloplasty in itself would carry a 5% mortality for this patient with lung disease.
However, on hospital day four, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with the following vital signs:  Heart rate was 124, blood pressure was 123/64, oxygen saturation was 97% on 5 liters nasal cannula.
However, three hours later, the patient did return back to atrial fibrillation with the following vital signs:  Heart rate was 125, blood pressure was 191/53, and oxygen saturation was 97% on 5 liters nasal cannula oxygen.
His Combivent inhaler was discontinued so that he would not convert back to atrial fibrillation by becoming tachycardic with the albuterol component.
for rate control.
On cardiac catheterization for the aortic stenosis, he only had 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery without any intervention.
At this time, he has no significant coronary artery disease.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Congestive heart failure secondary to atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis.
It is best to control his atrial fibrillation in terms of rhythm and rate for better management of the congestive heart failure.
If the patient's congestive heart failure is not improved with medical management, then it is advised that he undergo a palliative angioplasty for his aortic stenosis.
RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY FUNCTION:  The patient had acute decompensation in his pulmonary function.
A Pulmonary Service consultation was obtained, and they felt that his elevated PCO2 was likely multifactorial.
His elevated PCO2 may be due to compensation for a metabolic alkalosis, affect from PAO2, restriction from pulmonary edema, or increased VDVT related to congestive heart failure.
Given this restrictive pattern on his pulmonary function tests, it was most likely that his congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema were contributing to his poor pulmonary status.
Given that he does not have any evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on his pulmonary function tests, it is recommended that all of his inhalers (including salmeterol, Flovent, and Atrovent) be discontinued.
The patient was also to have pulmonary function tests every six months given that he is on amiodarone.
Aortic stenosis.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
No evidence of coronary artery disease.
