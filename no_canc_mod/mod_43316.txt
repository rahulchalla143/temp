Large relatively confluent areas of opacification in both lower hemithoraces look like right lower lobe collapse and possible large left fissural pleural collection.
There is also more vascular congestion and clear interstitial edema, as well as an increase in small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion relative to [**10-17**].
In this case, a chest CT scan would be very helpful in determining which abnormalities are pleural, which are pulmonary, and whether there is bronchial obstruction warranting bronchoscopy.

# Orthotopic Liver [**Month/Day/Year 1326**]: Patient recently underwent U/S guided liver biopsy [**2111-12-18**] for elevated transaminases with nonspecific findings and marked iron deposition.
Hereditary Hemochromatosis  Mutation was checked and found to be.
# Urinary Tract Infection: On the OSH urine culture patient had a Klebsiella UTI.
He has a chronic indwelling foley for urinary retension and history of UTIs.
