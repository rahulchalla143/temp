Admission Date:  [**2135-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-5-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-9-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation/sedation femoral central venous catheterization   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69yo M with history of atrial fibrillation on warfarin and hyperlipidemia who presents with altered mental status.
Patient has had sinus congestion and drainage for the past 4-5 days and saw his PCP for this who prescribed azithromycin and decongestant.
He started these medications yesterday and developed a severe headache on the night of admission with temperature of 100.7.
In the ER there, he continued to be confused and had CT of his head which showed opacificiation of his sphenoid sinus with concern for epidural abscess vs subdural empyema.
Patient's CT was reviewed by neurosurgery here who felt there was no CNS extension of the sinus opacification.
He withdraws to pain but does not follow commands.
Neurology reviewed the film with her CT with radiology and agrees there does not appear to be any signs of empyema or abscess.
In the ICU, patient is not answering questions or following commands.

Gen: sitting in bed, no acute discomfort but generally holding head while lying in bed.
Appears to have some headache.

Patient reports seeing intermittent small black "flies" moving in the distance, pt also reports intermittent "colored moving sparkles" when he closes his eyes.
STUDIES: CXR [**2135-5-7**]: IMPRESSION: No active pulmonary disease.
Positioningis suboptimal and there is motion artifact on the view of the upper abdomen.
There is metal in the patient's teeth consistent with dental work.
There is no other metallic foreign body.
Large meningocele involving bilateral sphenoid and left posterior ethmoid sinuses.
Pus completely opacifying the inferior sphenoid sinuses, including the left pterygoid recess, as well as the right frontal and maxillary sinuses.
These findings are consistent with acute sinusitis.
Small focus of dural thickening and enhancement in the medial left middle cranial fossa, along the sphenoid sinus, without evidence of a drainable fluid collection.
Diffuse leptomeningitis.
Foci of high T2 signal in the supratentorial white matter, without contrast enhancement, most likely representing chronic microvascular infarcts, given the patient's age and history of coronary artery disease.
Small chronic microhemorrhage in the right frontal cortex, which could be hypertensive or related to amyloid angiopathy.
Please note that MRA has a poor sensitivity for mycotic aneurysms as they tend to affect the distal vasculature.
Please note that MRV does not detect cavernous sinus thrombosis.
Left lower lobe airspace disease.
No evidence of abscess, as questioned.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal-appearing aortic valve bioprosthesis.
CXR [**2135-5-12**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is slightly improved ventilation at both lung bases.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
The pre-existing areas of slightly increased density at both lung bases, interpreted as atelectasis, have decreased.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
INR 2.1 Na+ 133 K+ 4.1 Bicarb 26  WBC 8.8 HCT 30.5 Plt 293   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69yo M with atrial fibrillation presenting with altered mental status in setting of sinus infection.
Pt was found to have meningitis & ventriculitis.
Per discussion with neuro, no clear findings on CT head of CNS extension but given severity of sinus disease and proximity to CNS, will aggressively workup.
ENT was consulted, and recommended continuing abx without other intervention.
Neurosurg was consulted and recommended no surgical intervention.
CTAP was checked given abdominal pain, with no significant findings and no evidence of abscess.
He had two low grade fevers following this but remained afebrile>24hrs prior to discharge.
At time of discharge, cultures were either "no growth" or pending.
# Sinusitis: He has had sinus symptoms with CT findings of sphenoid opacification.
Sinus sampling grew strep pneumo and moraxella catarrhalis.
# CAP: As suggested by imaging, and fevers.
# Atrial fibrillation: He has known atrial fibrillation and is therapeutic on warfarin on admission.
He developed atrial flutter/fib with rapid rate in setting of fevers.
He will be discharged with both metroprolol and dronedarone for rate/rhythm control.
# Hyponatremia: Initially attributed to hypovolemia given continued fevers and insensible losses.
However, Na remained low, and attributed to SIADH related either to meningitis or PNA as discussed above.
He had borderline low BP in house (SBP low 100s), but claimed he always had borderline low BPs.
3) Patient had significant brain inflammation and will have chronic headaches, please be sure to provide the pain medications as written.
3) Patient has "black spots" or "flees" in vision likely as a consequence of meningitis.

Discharge Instructions: You were seen at the [**Hospital3 **] Medical center for altered mental status and were found to have Meningitis.
If you choose to have one elsewhere, please arrange this through your PCP and be sure to have the results and images available for our infectious disease doctors.
Given your high sodium level, you have been placed on a fluid restriction that should be maintained at 1500cc per day until otherwise instructed by your health care providers.
Metoprolol - we have you on this heart rate medicine to control your heart rate but this may be discontinued at the rehab.
Please call your doctor if you experience worsening headaches, worsening visual changes, loss of consciousness.
