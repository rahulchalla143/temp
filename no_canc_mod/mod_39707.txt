There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the anterior wall and moderate hypokinesis of the anterior septum.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: moderate regional LV systolic function consistent with CAD (LAD lesion).
Dilated ascending aorta and aortic root.
No evidence of endocarditis or abscess seen.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2194-8-3**] 10:29 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-2**], there is increasing opacification at the left base, poor definition of the hemidiaphragm.
Although this could merely reflect atelectasis and effusion, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia can certainly not be excluded.
There is also some vague increased opacification at the right base that could represent a region of developing consolidation.
Septicemai due to Bacterial UTI: Pt fits criteria for sepsis with likely urinary source.
Chronic systolic CHF, CAD Native Vessle Echocardiogram noted severe hypokenesis in LAD territory which implies that she should be treated for both CHF and CAD.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation q4hr () as needed for wheezing.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Delerium Septicemia - E. Coli Bacterial UTI Chronic Systolic CHF (EF 30%) Type 2 Diabetes Controlled without Complications CAD Native Vessle Hypothyroidism Atrial Fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Return to the hospital with fever/chills, burning on urination, nausea/vomitting.
