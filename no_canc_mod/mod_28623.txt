Admission Date: [**2170-7-23**]        Discharge Date: [**2170-9-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2170-7-23**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NB   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 64481**] [**Known lastname **], whose last name will be [**Name (NI) **] at discharge, was born at 33 and 2/7 weeks gestation by Cesarean section for non reassuring fetal heart rate.
She also had a spontaneous loss in [**2167**].
This pregnancy was complicated by:  (1) cervical incompetence, treated with cerclage at 14 weeks and managed with progesterone in light of the previous pregnancy history.
(2) Increased nuchal lucency and a 2 vessel umbilical cord.
(3) Amniocentesis with a normal karyotype of 46XX.
Rupture of membranes occurred at time of delivery with yellow stained amniotic fluid.
This small for gestational age dysmorphic infant with anterior fontanel and posterior fontanel both open, soft and flat, no cutis aplasia, low nuchal hair line, thickened nuchal fold, hypertelorism with wide nasal bridge and beaking of the nose, cleft palate both hard and soft, intact lip.
Wide space nipples.
Short sternum.
Preterm female genitalia with large clitoris, small vaginal opening and a vaginal tag.
No hip clicks.
No syndactyly.
She received 2 doses of Surfactant for respiratory distress syndrome.
She does have mild increased work of breathing, associated with feedings or when she is tired.
Cardiovascular: [**Known lastname 64481**] has had several echocardiograms since delivery.
Her most recent echocardiogram was prior to her PDA ligation and this showed a secundum atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, valvular pulmonary stenosis, left pulmonary artery stenosis and pulmonary hypertension.
In light of her pulmonary hypertension, the decision was made to ligate her patent ductus arteriosus as that was contributing to her pulmonary hypertension.
She continues to have a loud murmur, with normal pulses and perfusion.
Enteral feedings were started on day of life 3 and advanced to almost full volume when she had an onset of bloody stools and was made n.p.o.
She is feeding on ad lib demand with a premature Habermann feeder and is taking anywhere between 150 to 180 ml/kg per day with slow weight gain.
Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname 64481**] was treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity.
Her abdominal x- ray showed mildly dilated bowel loops and a nonspecific gas pattern.
There was no pneumatosis.
Since refeeding, she has done well without bloody stools.
On admission for rule out sepsis, and sepsis was ruled out.
When she is not on Ampicillin, she has been receiving Amoxicillin 20 mg/kg per day for renal prophylaxis due to hydronephrosis.
On day of life 37, she received a 5 day course of Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment for bilateral conjunctivitis.
Renal:  A renal ultrasound on [**2170-7-24**] showed small peripheral cysts within both kidneys suggestive of dysplasia.
No hydronephrosis and a normal bladder.
They continued to be echogenic with peripheral cysts, suggestive of dysplasia.
In addition, a right distal hydroureter persistently noted without a ureterocele within the bladder and a normal bladder.
Neurology: Due to her prominent coccyx and dimple, a spinal ultrasound was done on [**2170-7-24**] which showed spinal cord conus does end normally at L1.
Head ultrasound on [**7-24**] showed resolving bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhages.
A follow-up head ultrasound on [**7-31**] showed evolving bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhage.
Additionally, some mild bilateral ventriculomegaly.
On [**2170-8-16**], a repeat head ultrasound again showed evolving germinal matrix hemorrhages and stable mild ventricular dilatation.
Immunizations recommended:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis     should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for     infants who meet any of the following criteria:     (1) Born with hemodynamically signficant congenital heart disease.
Because of her heart disease and evidence of chronic lund disease, we strongly recommend that she receive Synagis.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
Sepsis ruled out.
Bilateral renal cystic dysplasia.
Right distal hydroureter.
Complex congenital heart disease with left pulmonary     artery stenosis, atrial septal defect, pulmonary hypertension, mild valvular pulmonary stenosis, status post PDA     ligation.
Hyperbilirubinemia resolved.
Bilateral stable mild ventriculomegaly.
Bilateral polydactyly of both hands, status post removal     of extra digits.
