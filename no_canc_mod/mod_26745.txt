No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Dilated LV cavity.
Moderate global LV hypokinesis.
No atheroma in descending aorta.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Large vegetation on aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation on mitral valve.
No mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
An aortic annular abscess is seen in the intervalvular fibrosa (best seen at the base of the anterior mitral valve leaflet).
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Bicuspid aortic valve with a large (2 x 0.7 cm) vegetation on the posterior leaflet with severe aortic regurgitation.
Small (0.4 x 0.8 cm) abscess that appears to be in the intervalvular fibrous tissue (between the aortic valve and mitral valve), best visualized at the base of the anterior mitral valve leaflet.
The left ventricle is severely dilated with moderate global hypokinesis.
Small to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2101-12-1**] 9:11 AM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: lead placement  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 22 year old man with AV endocarditis s/p single cahmber pacemaker REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: lead placement CHEST X-RAY WITH PA AND LATERAL VIEWS  INDICATION: Patient is status post single chamber pacemaker placement.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Compared to [**2101-11-30**], there are increased pulmonary markings in a more patchy distribution, particularly in the right lower lobe that are concerning for an underlying infectious process.
There are no pleural effusions.
New patchy-like opacities within right lower lobe could reflect new underlying infectious process.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Persistent cardiomegaly.
A right pleural effusion was tapped (600 cc straw colored fluid obtained).
The electrophysiology service was consulted due to the history of heart block as well as aortic root abscess.
He has had a neurology consult (due to a small frontal lobe lesion noted on MRI).
This was felt to be a small embolic infarct, and only a small risk of hemmorhage is likely with anticoagulation.
Opthalmology consult revealed a small hemmorhagic lesion in the left eye which required no intervention.
Hepatology consult revealed no evidence of cirrhosis, and no contraindication to surgery.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: aortic valve endocarditis heart block   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: keep left anterior chest incision clean & dry, may shower, no lotions or creams to incisions   Followup Instructions: with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] upon completion of antibiotic course (last dose [**2102-1-4**]) to schedule surgery    Completed by:[**2101-12-3**
