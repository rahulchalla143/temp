The patient was complaining of generalized weakness and fatigue for approximately three weeks.
The patient denies seizures or loss of consciousness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post 3-vessel coronary artery bypass graft after a myocardial infarction in [**2132**] with intermittent left bundle-branch block.
The patient is blind in both eyes secondary to diabetic retinopathy with enucleation of the right eye in [**2137**].
The patient also has a history of hepatitis C diagnosed in [**2141-2-26**], and a history of multiple squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
Neck had no lymphadenopathy or masses.
Cardiovascular had a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was nontender, nondistended, and soft.
Extremities had cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Skin had multiple excoriated lesions in face, and upper chest, and extremities.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated by Neurology consultation who noted that the etiology of her falls were likely multifactorial including diabetic neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, possible steroid myopathy, and visual deficits.
She was also noted to have a low-grade fever on admission and underwent a fever workup.
Three days after admission, the patient developed shortness of breath and hypoxia during routine hemodialysis and was felt to be in acute pulmonary edema.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Unit where she was subsequently ruled in for a myocardial infarction by enzymes.
While in the unit, [**1-1**] blood cultures from the fistula tested positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and her urine grew out vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
The patient was given vancomycin and linezolid for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
Her gallium scan revealed questionable abdominal activity in the cecal area and delay scan in several days was recommended.
Myocardial infarction.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
