Admission Date:  [**2104-2-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-3-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2028-5-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**] Chief Complaint: s/p Fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p right hip ORIF s/p intubation  History of Present Illness:    75yo F with CAD s/p MI x4 (s/p LAD stent '[**96**] and RCA stentx2 in '[**98**] and '[**02**]), CHF with EF 55%, PAF, Inducible Vtach s/p AICD placement, sick sinus syndrome s/p pacer and COPD with restrictive lung disease.
Per daughter, pt was in her USOH until two days prior to admission when she was noted to have a superficial ulcerations on her foot with erythema.
Pt awoke later that night and felt unsteady on her feet and sustained a mechanical fall.
Per daughter, pt did not note chest pain, tachycardia, had a good PO intake and no noted seizure activity.
Pt was in severe "back pain" as per daughter which was treated with dilaudid.
CT of the neck revealed a possible C1 fracture and the X-ray at the OSH revealed intratrochanteric fracture of the right femur.
Pt was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for orthopaedic evaluation.
In ED at [**Hospital1 18**], pt was seen by the Trauma service where a CT of the neck revealed no fracture (however, the c-collar was maintained secondary to pain).
The orthopaedic service recommended emergent repair of the intratrochanteric fracture secondary to instability.
ROS: Pt is very SOB at baseline, not on home ox, no CP at rest, no LE edema, no PND, stable orthopnea (2 pillows).
Med change include discontinuation of coumadin secondary to inc risk of upper GI bleed.
HPI:  75 yoF with CAD s/p stenting, VT, SSS s/p pacer, COPD, presented to OSH [**2104-2-18**] with foot ulceration.
Expected prolonged extubation course given COPD history, as with colon CA resection surgery.
Late [**2-20**] found with afib and RVR, given beta blocker with min.
Received 2 mg dilaudid for pain o/n.
This AM with respiratory failure, continued tachycardia on dilt.
CAD s/p LAD stent in '[**96**] +RCA stet in '[**98**] with repeat RCA stent in '[**02**].
Sick sinus syndrome s/p pacer placement in '[**96**] 5.
Depression 6.
COPD (no PFT available) 7.
Chronic restrictive lung disease (no PFT available) 8.
HTN 9.
Hyperlipidemia 10.
Obesity 11.  s/p TAH 12.  s/p colonic resection secondary to perforation s/p polypectomy 13.
'[**98**] TTE: EF 50-55%; mild to moderate MR, left atrium is moderately dilated, trace AR .
[**8-31**]: Cardiac catheterization: inferior, posterobasilar hypokinesis, 1+MR, EF 48%, mid RCA 50%, distal RCA 40%, mid LAD 50%, OM3 diffusely diseased s/p stenting of RCA with drug eluting stent with 10% residual flow.
[**2104-2-19**] CXR: moderate cardiomegaly without CHF, no effusions, left retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis vs. consolidation .
[**2104-2-19**] CT c-spine: 1) No evidence of fracture of the cervical spine.
No definite fracture of C1 is identified to correlate with the history of questioned C1 fracture from outside hospital.
2) Extensive degenerative change of the cervical spine."
[**2104-2-19**] Femur & R knee X-ray: 1) Comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of the right femur, with avulsion of the lesser trochanter, displacement and angulation.
2) No other definite fractures identified.
degenerative changes of the lumbosacral spine."
[**2104-2-29**] Flexion extension xrays of cervical spine: Mild degree of instability at level C3-C4 as described.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 75yo F s/p MIx4, numerous cath, PAF, Inducible VTach s/p AICD and pacer with severe COPD/restrictive lung disease s/p fall with intertrochanteric fracture.
As per ortho, pt requires emergent repair of intertrochanteric fracture to preserve neurovascular function.
Pt is medically cleared for procedure , likely has some mile rate related ischemia.
Cards: ---Pre-op B-blocker with goal HR <70 ---No real utility in MIBI/cath prior to procedure gien previous caths with no significant lesions to be intervened on.
---B-blocker IV, Dilt PRN for PAF ---Hold coumadin for afib given hx of upper GIB and surgery in AM ---Continue ASA, plavix ---ROMI, check AM ECG .
COPD/Restrictive lung disease: ---Nebs/MDI PRN ---no need for steroids now ---expect prolonged wean given previous history of prolonged wean s/p colonic resection ---incentive spirometry for atelectasis .
Had expected prolonged post-op extubation in PACU given COPD history, as with colon CA resection surgery.
Late [**2-20**] found with afib and RVR, given beta blocker with min.
Received 2 mg dilaudid for pain o/n.
On [**2-21**] AM p/w with respiratory failure, continued tachycardia on dilt.
When NGT tube was pulled out, it was noted to have respiratory-like secretions.
Pt's respiratory distress is most likely on setting of aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis in the setting of depressed mental status secondary to post-operative narcotics.
Pt was pan-cultured and switched from unasyn (started at OSH for foot ulcer) to zosyn.
Vanco was added for possible nosocomial infection.
CTA was performed which was negative for PE, but revealed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities c/w aspiration vs. pneumonia vs. edema.
On [**2-24**], pt was noted to have depressed mental status off all sedating medications; mental status improved over the course of the day.
Atrial fibrillation was rate-controlled on dilt drip.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled in setting of rapid AF and were flat.
Initially, pt was noted to be dry with low FeNa and given IVF.
Then, noted to be volume overloaded and diuresed with lasix.
Pt had depressed mental status on transfer to MICU in setting of narcotics.
Head CT was negative for acute bleed, mass effect, or stroke.
Given standing NSAID, tylenol for pain control.
?COPD vs atelectasis as cause of hypoxia.
Had received unasyn, vanc, zosyn during hospital course for cellulitis and other unclear reasons, including possible vent associated pna.
No abx unless source found .
- continue nodal agents - consider anti coag for cva prevention, but wait until ambulating better .
Possible anemia [**1-30**] operative blood loss.
Had fall pta with ?fx on initial CT, neg fx on f/u ct. - flex/ext films done - will clear with neursurg prior to removing hard collar  Overnight on pt's first evening on the floor, she had episode of desaturation with inc O2 requirement (4L->6L-> sating 91% on NRB) - CXR with worsening - non responsive to lasix.
On exam, pt lethargic, responsive to pain but not voice, with NRB in place; obvious inc wob.
