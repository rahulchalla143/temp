Admission Date:  [**2195-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-6-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2137-3-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Elective admission for atrial fibrillation ablation.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Atrial fibrillation ablation and placement of a pacemaker.
History of Present Illness: The pt is a 58 year-old woman with hypothyroidism and atrial fibrillation discovered in [**Month (only) 956**] during screening colonoscopy.
On hospital day two, the pt developed acute onset of diplopia while she was on the floor, the morning after the procedure.
She noted an aphasia and brought the pt immediately to the CT scanner.
En route and at the scanner, the patient became noticeably worse, with the development of right arm plegia and a question of sensory deficits over her hand as well.
She also had a left gaze deviation, a right facial droop, mild dysarthria, and some disorientation.
She then had a CTA which showed no major vessel cut-off, but did have decreased apparent branch perfusion of the left posterior frontal lobe.
Past Medical History: Hypothyroidism Atrial fibrillation Syncope S/P Caesarian section   Social History: Pt lives with her husband.
Family History: No neurological disease.
OP clear CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Ext: No cyanosis/edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake, but sleepy.
Cranial Nerves: I: not tested II: Pupils unequal, with left 2-3 mm larger than right.
Later, she continues to have gaze palsy and has more trouble crossing midline.

There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
There is a small presumed mucus retention cyst within the right maxillary sinus, otherwise, the paranasal sinuses are clear.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: The distal carotid arteries and circle of [**Location (un) 431**] opacify without evidence for stenosis or aneurysm.
The vertebral arteries and basilar arteries opacify without abnormality.
CTA NECK: The internal, common carotid, and internal carotid opacify without evidence for hemodynamically significant stenosis, dissection, or aneurysmal dilation.
The vertebral arteries opacify without evidence for stenosis, dissection, or aneurysm.
There is a very slight asymmetry of the vertebral arteries (right greater than left, but no evidence for origin stenosis).
Multiple small normal-appearing lymph nodes are identified within the soft tissues of the neck.
CT PERFUSION: CT perfusion studies including calculation of blood volume, mean transit time, and blood flow demonstrate no perfusion abnormality.
Selected slice imaging was performed through the middle cerebral artery territory, and perfusion defects outside the area of interest may not be detected.
Normal CTA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and neck without evidence for stenosis, embolus, or aneurysm.
Non-contrast head CT. ([**2195-6-6**]): FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
New areas of hypodensity within the left thalamus, left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and left cerebral peduncle likely reflecting evolving infarct.
A rounded soft tissue density in the right maxillary sinus likely reflects a small mucous retention cyst.
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Focal areas of hypodensity involving the left thalamus, cerebral peduncle and temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] region suggestive of evolving infarct.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are dependent atelectatic changes in the lung bases bilaterally.
A large hiatal hernia is identified.
There is a hypodensity within the left lobe of the liver measuring 9 mm in diameter, best seen on series 2, image 27.
The loops of small and large bowel appear normal in caliber and contour.
No free air or free fluid is seen within the abdomen.
There is stranding in the right groin, with a small hematoma at the puncture site, tracking inferiorly.
No retroperitoneal hematoma is identified.
No free fluid is seen in the pelvis.
The osseous structures demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Bilateral simple fluid attenuating kidney cysts.
Large hiatal hernia.
TTE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Femoral artery ultrasound: A hematoma is present anterior to the right common femoral artery and vein.
There is no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula in the right inguinal region.
The vein itself does contain flow, however, there is some loss of respiratory variation.
Her deficits greatly improved, the only persistent symptom being diplopia.
She was in the ICU for five days over concern of low blood pressure (treated intermittently with a neosynephrine gtt) and anemia (work-up as detailed below).
Anemia: The pt developed progressively declining hematocrit after tPA administration and institution of anticoagulation.
She was transfused one unit of PRBCs in the ICU when her hematocrit dropped to 22.1 (to which she responded appropriately) A femoral ultrasound was performed on hospital day nine when the pt developed right groin and thigh pain which demonstrated hematoma is present anterior to the right common femoral artery and vein.
The cardiology service felt that this was likely the area of blood loss to account for anemia.
Right leg pain: As above, the pt developed right groin and thigh pain on hospital day nine.
A femoral ultrasound was performed and demonstrated hematoma is present anterior to the right common femoral artery and vein.
Disp:*30 injection* Refills:*0*  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: -left thalamic, cerebral peduncle and temporal lobe stroke -atrial fibrillation, s/p ablation procedure and placement of pacemaker -anemia of uncertain etiology, probably due to blood loss in the groin   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Neurologic examination notable for dysconjugate gaze and resultant diplopia.
If you experience weakness, numbness, dizziness or other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care doctor or come to the Emergency Department for evaluation.
