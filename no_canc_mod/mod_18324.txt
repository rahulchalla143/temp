The patient was in his usual state of good health until two days prior to admission when he developed interscapular back pain which a nonradiating.
This back pain worsened over the day prior to admission and was associated with diaphoresis.
The patient denied any shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or chest pain.
He described his back pain as a [**6-7**] dull/aching pain in the center of his back which increased to a [**10-7**].
At that time he denied any chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, shortness of breath, edema, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.
The patient's back pain had resolved.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general,  a well-appearing elderly male lying in bed after his cardiac catheterization in no acute distress.
The patient had dry mucous membranes.
Neck revealed no jugular venous distention and no thyromegaly.
There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
There was no evidence of lower extremity edema.
Subsequent electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 51 beats per minute with a left bundle branch block as well as 9-mm ST elevations in V2 through V3 and 5-mm ST elevations in V1 and V4.
Cardiac catheterization - on [**2170-6-14**] - revealed there was a 100 percent mid left anterior descending lesion after the second diagonal; status post three stents (two Taxus/one Pixel), dilated distal third diagonal with residual 60 percent stenosis.
Circumflex noted to come from the right coronary artery.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  As noted previously, the    patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 10154**] for as an outpatient for a diagnostic and    therapeutic cardiac catheterization.
The patient cardiac catheterization revealed a 100 percent mid left anterior descending lesion that was stented with three stents.
The patient was evaluated with an echocardiogram on the day following admission which revealed an ejection fraction of 30 percent and apical akinesis.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  As noted previously, the    patient had an echocardiogram on hospital day two that    revealed an ejection fraction of 30 percent with extensive    apical akinesis.
An evaluation    of the rhythm strip demonstrated atrial fibrillation    alternating with atrial flutter.
His beta    blocker dose was increased for better rate control, and    his Coumadin was continued for his extensive apical    akinesis as well as the demonstration of paroxysmal atrial    fibrillation.
DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient has no history of    diabetes mellitus but was noted to have somewhat elevated    blood sugars throughout his hospitalization.
GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was    continued on a proton pump inhibitor for his history of    gastroesophageal reflux disease and had no complaints    throughout his hospitalization.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
Ejection fraction of 30 percent with apical akinesis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
The patient was encouraged to discuss his elevated blood sugars with his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] we recommend that his fasting blood sugar checked once he is discharged.
