This pregnancy is remarkable for a maternal past history of Crohn's disease, with two exacerbations during this pregnancy, requiring hospitalization.
Soon after the beginning of prednisone, she required insulin for glucose intolerance.
She was admitted the day prior to delivery with a fever of 104, this morning became hypothermic, with a temperature of 94.
A fetal bradycardia prompted a stat cesarean section.
The infant emerged with spontaneous respiratory effort, but overall decreased tone and movement.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Admission physical examination reveals a pre-term infant in moderate respiratory distress.
Anterior fontanel soft and flat, non-dysmorphic facies, palate intact, moderate intercostal retractions, nasal flaring.
Respiratory:  The infant initially started on nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure and, at approximately 13 hours of age, required endotracheal intubation for work of breathing after her chest x-ray was consistent with hyaline membrane disease.
The intubation was difficult, and a chest x-ray after intubation showed a pneumomediastinum without evidence of pneumothorax, suggesting the possibility of perforation of the pharynx.
A follow-up x-ray approximately eight hours later showed that the pneumomediastinum had resolved, but there was a question of air present in the right side of the neck.
Her respirations have some mild subcostal retractions.
The infant was started on caffeine citrate for apnea and shallow breathing on day of life number three.
She has normal S1, S2 heart sound, and no murmur.
There are no cardiovascular issues.
She has had some evidence of metabolic acidosis, requiring one bolus of sodium bicarbonate intravenously, 2 mEq/kg, on day of life number two.
This was felt to be some mild renotubular acidosis.
Gastrointestinal:  She was started on phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity on day of life number two.
Infectious Disease:  The infant was started on ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The infant is being transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] for a swallow study to rule out a pharyngeal tear.
Hyaline membrane disease 3.
Presumed sepsis 4.
Hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity 5.
Rule out pharyngeal/tracheal laceration 6.
Apnea of prematurity                                 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 37237**], M.D.
