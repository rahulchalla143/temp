Pt was seen in outpatient clinic with complaint of difficultly clearing secretions and was treated with abx and pulm toilet without improvement.
Pt was admitted to OSH MICU and intubated for resp failure.
CXR noted R-sided atelectasis which resolved after intubation.
Pt was able to breathe spontaneously for a few hours on am of [**10-24**] but failed extubation due to increased secreations and poor gag.
Pt was afebrile during this admission, he had one episode of transient hypotension, cosyntropin test negative.
Denies pain and currently comfortable breathing.
Past Medical History: 1) Tracheomalacia, status post stent x 2 with failure secondary to stent migration.
2) Status post stroke in [**2109**] with TIA; right upper extremity weakness resulting.
4) Seizure disorder.
NECK: Supple, no JVD appreciated.
CARDIOVASCULAR: RRR no murmur appreciated.
LUNGS: Ant and lat fields with coarse breath sounds.
Lungs are low in volume and mild left lower lobe atelectasis is stable.
Mild pulmonary edema unchanged.
No appreciable pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2117-11-10**] no change.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Resp failure: possible etiologies included aspiration vs bacterial PNA vs bronchitis.
Likely combination of increased secretions with tracheomalacia making pt unable to clear secretions requiring intubation.
Initial extubation was not tolerated by the patient with increased respiratory distress, requiring reintubation and eventual tracheostomy with prolonged weaning course likely.
- Continued Vanc and Levoquin on admission given hx of MRSA PNA, and was switched to and completed a 10 day course of Aztreonam and Vanco.
He was extubated again on [**11-17**] and reintubated on [**11-19**] for tachypnea and inability to clear secretions.
Underwent rigid bronchoscopy on [**10-27**], which showed granulation tissue on the L lateral wall of the trachea causing tracheal stenosis and moderate to severe tracheobronchomalacia.
The area of tracheal stenosis was balloon dilated and the granulation tissue was excised.
He was transiently given Heliox for tenuous respiratory status right after bronchoscopy.
He was started on dexamethasone post-bronchoscopy for empiric treatment of tracheolaryngeal edema and continued on high dose guafenesin.
6) Sz Disorder: Maintained on phenobarbital throughout admission, dosing by level secondary to renal insufficiency.
