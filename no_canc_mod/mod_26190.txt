Hematology saw pt while hospitalized and differential for thrombocytopenia was drug induced from flagyl/gancyclovir/bactrim, myelosuppression from HIV, vs ITP.
Additionally, pt has been having guaiac positive stools and GI saw pt though opted not to scope as pt likely bleeding in setting of thrombocytopenia.
Mr. [**Known lastname 64553**] was also diagnosed with Norwegian scabies, thrush, and likely esophageal candidiasis.

There is slight prominence of the ventricles and sulci that may be related to volume loss.
Imaged paranasal sinuses appear clear.
There is a persistent area of opacity in the right lower lobe with associated displacement of the fissure suggestive of atelectasis.
There is a new area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region with air bronchograms, concerning for infectious pneumonia or aspiration.
There is a persistent small right pleural effusion and there is a new small left pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Persistent right lower lobe opacity, most likely atelectasis.
New left retrocardiac opacity, concerning for infectious pneumonia or aspiration.
#) Septic shock: Likely due to Pseudomonas in blood +/- ?
left lower lobe infiltrate He was started on Broad spectrum abx cefepime/levo to double cover for Pseudomonas.
#) Pancytopenia : Multifactorial: Likely HIV + medication .
a. Thrombocytopenia - ITP vs. medication (bactrim/ganciclovir/flagyl) vs. myelosuppression from HIV/AIDs.
Also possible include infection with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Anemia - Hct on admission 22.7.
Peripheral smear did not show evidence of hemolysis and iron studies in [**5-23**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Pt also has been having guaiac positive stools.
c. Neutropenia and lymphopenia - marrow suppression likely [**2-19**] HIV, infection.
GCSF was continued until blood counts increased and no longer neutropenic.
#) GIB/Coagulopathy: Likely from INR of 2.0 as well as low platelets.
Patient has been putting out bloody watery BMs from mushroom cath.
GI was consulted regarding GI Bleed - no intervention because of low platelet count.
#) Diarrhea - Etiology multifactorial including crytosporidia and C.Difficile, but completed a 14 day course of flagyl treatment.
Patient had over 4L stool production.
#) AIDS cholangiopathy - seen on RUQ u/s and pt with elevated AP.
It is a biliary obstruction from infection associated strictures of biliary tract, most common being cryptosporidiumm as well as CMV, microsporidia, cyclospora.
Pt again dxd with thrush at [**Hospital1 **].
As treatments did not seem to be effective, GI losses remained great, and patient remained with low CD4 count despite HAART therapy a family meeting was held on [**8-10**] with patient's infectious disease doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] and the ICU team.
