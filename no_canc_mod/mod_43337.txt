Admission Date:  [**2162-6-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-6-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Haldol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Reason for admission: Chest pain Reason for transfer to the MICU: hypercarbic respiratory failure    Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation.
History of Present Illness: 87 y/o woman with CAD, Afib, presents with shortness of breath and chest pain since morning of admission.
She felt that her shortness of breath has improved since getting to the hospital.
She denied any orthopnea or PND.
On the morning of admission she was doing regular housework, when she developed substernal pressure, as if someone was sitting on her chest.
She also c/o of having visual hallucinations at night, she thinks it prob in her dreams.
ECG with subtle ST dep/TW flattening anterior leads.
CXR showed vascular congestion.
On the floor, patient was agitated requiring large amounts of zyprexa and also Haldol was used.
Suction of brown material, question of aspiration.
Pt to CT scan to assess for bleed, CVA and then to MICU for further work up and management.
Atrial fibrillation.
Carpal tunnel syndrome.
Family History: Father with heart problems.
Abdomen: Distended, hypoactive bowel sounds, but soft.
Ext: 1+ peripheral edema bilaterally, no clubbing, cyanosis, no calf pain, DP pulses are 2+ bilaterally Neuro: moving all extremities, unable to follow commands.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
No aortic stenosis is suggested.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly increased.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 87 y/o woman with CAD, atrial fibrillation, Asthma, who presented with acute onset of substernal chest pain and altered mental status.
On [**6-12**] the floor she was found to be in respiratory distress and found to be in hypercarbic respiratory failure; this prompted emergent intubation and transfer to MICU.
In summary, this is an 87 year old woman with atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease and newly diagnosed with [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia that was likely exacerbated by use of antipsychotic medication.
This in turn may have led to oversedation, hypoventilation and subsequent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Issues: 1) Reactive airway disease/respiratory failure, asthma vs. COPD vs. sedative related hypoventilation.
4) CAD/chest pain -continue aspirin.
-ruled out for MI .
5) CHF, EF 40-45% -held diuretics for low nl blood pressures -diuresed cautiously, can restart PO lasix .
FEN: Diabetic cardiac healthy diet.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Four (4) Puff Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
**got PRN lasix, consider restarting PO lasix, also was on aldactone as outpatient  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body Dementia Reactive airway disease Pneumonia CAD   Discharge Condition: Good,  mentating at baseline, normal respiratory status on 2L NC.
