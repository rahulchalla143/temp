Partially distended gallbladder, with circumferential wall thickening that could be reactive.
No evidence of intraabdominal or intrapelvic abscess, as questioned.
Small amount of pericholecystic fluid identified, compatible with findings seen on prior ultrasound exams.
Probable patency of the cystic duct, as suggested by the normal caliber of the gallbladder on the CT scan in relation to the collapsed size of the gallbladder status post percutaneous aspiration performed on the same day.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with evidence of interstitial volume overload.
Consider inferior myocardial infarction.
Low limb lead voltage.
Consider anterior myocardial infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with PMH CAD s/p LAD and RCA stents, MI x 3, DMII, HTN, PAD presenting with CP x2 nights, seen at OSH and treated as NSTEMI and depressed EF (30-35% to 15-20%) with unchanged coronary disease and significant abdominal pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
# Decompensated CHF and coronary artery disease: The patient has known sCHF, but noted to have a depressed EF to 15-20% from 30-35% per previous report from a year ago.
Even though her cardiac enzymes were elevated, it seems unlikely to be an acute ischemic cardiomyopathy, given that her most recent catheterization findings were unchanged from those of previous catheterizations.
She was diuresed effectively with IV furosemide, without any acute changes in HR or BP.
She underwent a myocardial viability study using cardiac MR, showing findings consistent with low likelihood of functional recovery in the anterior and septal walls and distal inferior wall after mechanical revascularization.
Therefore, further surgical evaluation for CABG was deferred to the outpatient setting upon follow-up with [**Hospital1 18**] cardiology.
Her statin was held secondary to liver enzyme elevation and should be restarted at the discretion of her PCP.
She was discharged on a Lovenox bridge for continued warfarin therapy (which she should continue indefinitely for history of a parietal stroke), with INR checks by her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] should also be considered for an ICD placement with her depressed EF on outpatient follow-up.
# Abdominal Pain: She was admitted with concerning abdominal pain.
A percutaneous cholecystostomy was done, draining normal-appearing, non-purulent bile negative for microorganisms on culture.
Her pain was controlled with narcotics and eased down to her baseline abdominal pain, which she has had for a few years.
H. pylori serologies were negative and CT abomen/pelvis was unremarkable for abscess or occult infection.
No etiology for her pain was uncovered.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES .
# Follow-up: She should follow-up with cardiology for 1) ?ICD placement in future for low EF, 2) possible CABG, and 3) optimize medical management  # Healthcare maintenance:  We would highly recommend a colonoscopy to complete her abdominal pain work-up.

Discharge Instructions: You had chest pain and had a heart attack at [**Hospital3 **] Hsopital.
You had a cardiac MRI which showed that there are areas of your heart that would not benefit from a bypass operation.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29070**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
You also had pain in your abdomen that has resolved now.
All of the tests that we performed did not show a cause for the abdominal pain.
Start taking Lovenox once a day to prevent blood clots until your INR is more than 2 and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66153**] tells you to stop.
