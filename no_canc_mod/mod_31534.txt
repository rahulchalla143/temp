Admission Date:  [**2167-11-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-11-13**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ventricular tachycardia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post questionable myocardial infarction five years ago; peripheral vascular disease, status post right femoral, anterior tibial and left femoral popliteal bypass on [**10-19**] and [**10-26**] respectively here at [**Hospital1 69**].
She was transferred to a rehabilitation on [**2167-11-4**], where she was noted to become unresponsive at hemodialysis rehabilitation on Friday, [**2167-11-6**].
The patient notes feeling sleepy when she had loss of consciousness but no chest pain, shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
Again today, on [**2167-11-8**], in the morning, the patient had one episode of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with no symptoms, no light headedness, no loss of consciousness, no chest pain, no shortness of breath.
The patient was bolused with Lidocaine and noted to have no further ectopy on Lidocaine.
Here, the patient did not complain of any shortness of breath or light headedness.
Status post right femoral proximal anterior tibial bypass, [**2167-10-19**], complicated by Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, gangrene and Clostridium difficile colitis.
ESRD, secondary to noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Cerebrovascular accident and toxic encephalopathy.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
History of deep vein thrombosis with an inferior vena cava filter.
History of esophageal stricture, status post dilatation.
Positive Clostridium difficile.
Questionable myocardial infarction five years ago.
In general, she is well appearing, African-American female, with slight anxiety.
Neck:  Left internal jugular TLC; site of CDI; no JVP.
No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 102.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with a strained pattern and left axis with Q's in 2, 3 and poor R progression.
The patient's enzymes were cycled times three and were negative for any ischemic changes.
The patient also did not complain of any chest pain throughout this hospitalization.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization during this admission for questionable ischemic cause of her ventricular tachycardia which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease with her proximal right coronary artery diffusely diseased, mid right coronary artery 100% stenosed, proximal left anterior descending 30%, distal circumflex 100%, obtuse marginal one 70%, with an elevated LVEDP of 16.
However, no intervention was performed, secondary to difficulty of access for her right radial.
Her groin was not accessed secondary to her peripheral vascular disease and recent femoral-popliteal and proximal anterior tibial bypasses.
However, it was felt that her coronary artery disease was not responsible to cause her sustained monomorphic VT episode at the outside hospital.
EP was consulted and they felt that optimally, they would prefer an EP study and possible ventricular tachycardia ablation; however, her present vascular access issues precluded any studies.
She showed patterns of hypertrophic non obstructive cardiomyopathy with the left atrium mildly dilated and severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The patient had a few episodes of non sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia throughout the hospitalization, without the Lidocaine drip.
Vascular surgery recommended not accessing any groin grafts at this time, due to recent bypass surgery.
Additionally, Prednisone was continued 7.5 mg q. day for failed renal transplant.
Hematology: The patient has anemia of chronic disease.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus:  The patient was originally on Lentis 14 units q h.s.
However, due to increasing sugar levels, her Lentis was increased from 14 to 16, with adequate blood sugar levels.
The patient will need to be closely followed for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as an outpatient.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeds.
The patient had several hematocrits throughout this hospitalization.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was kept on Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile precautions throughout this hospitalization.
Chronic renal failure.
Coronary artery disease.
