([**2177-7-17**]) Moderate left apical and medial pneumothorax has not changed in volume over four hours, nor is there appreciable atelectasis or pleural effusion.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in standard placements.
Subsequent chest radiographs performed over the next four and 13 hours respectively show increase in the volume of the pneumothorax and a small accompanying left pleural effusion.

- LIFEWATCH (REPORT PER NOTES; [**2177-6-18**]): Life Watch monitor which revealed significant sinus pauses up to 4 seconds long.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 111653**] is a 80 F with a history of atrial fibrillation with tachy-brady syndrome documented by Lifewatch monitor who was admitted for pacemake placement; procedure was complicated by pneumothorax following subclavian access.
Pneumothorax was confirmed on chest xray and though ptient remained asymptomatic, serial xrays revealed that left pneumothorax has increased in volume with substantial atelectasis at the base of the lung as well as a small and increasing left pleural effusion.
Pt was attempted on 100% oxygen to assist in resorption of the pneumothorax, however given interval increase in volume, thoracic surgery placed pigtail catheter with interval resolution of pneumothorax within 24 hours.
# TACHY-BRADY SYNDROME S/P PACEMAKER: Pacemaker placement was complicated by pneumothorax.
Pacer interogration revealed that it was functioning properly, however pt often had episodes of being paced at max rate in response to sensed atrial fibrillation beats.
On DDI she continued to atrial pace while in a-fib, however, there was no elevated ventricular response so no need for additional pace maker setting changes.
She will need to take cephalexin 500mg x 5 days for prophylaxis post-procedure.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Pt has long history of atrial fibrillation complicated by tachy-brady syndrome.
CHRONIC ISSUES .
# FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN: Patient has had recurrent fevers for several months, though work-up to date has been unrevealing (negative CT torso, negative TEE, cultures negative, s/p empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics).
Pt remained afebrile during hospitalization with no leukocytosis.

Disp:*20 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis - tachy-brady syndrome - pneumothorax - atrial fibrillation Secondary diagnosis - hypertension - insomnia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted after your pacemaker placement because of a pneumothorax (small leakage of air) in your left lung.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen: 1. please start taking cephelexin for 5 days 2. please take oxycodone and/or tylenol as needed for pain 3. please take docusate and/or senna as needed for constipation, which may be a side effect of the oxycodone.
