The pregnancy was a spontaneous twin gestation with diamniotic, dichorionic twins.
The pregnancy was complicated by maternal insulin-dependent diabetes and chronic hypertension treated with labetalol.
A fetal ultrasound showed a membranous VSD on this presenting twin.
Spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred on [**2173-5-8**].
He was noted to have significant bruising and edema in the right leg and scrotum at delivery.
General - nondysmorphic, preterm male.
Hips - stable, right leg edematous and bruised.
A chest x-ray showed a left pneumothorax and lung fields consistent with retained fetal lung fluid.
[**Doctor First Name 16518**] had several episodes of spontaneous apnea and bradycardia.
He has been free of apnea for 5 days prior to discharge.
Due to the history of the fetal ultrasound showing a ventriculoseptal defect, a postnatal echocardiogram was obtained.
There was no ventriculoseptal defect seen, no structural abnormalities and there was a patent foramen ovale with left-to-right flow.
Infectious Disease: Due to the unknown etiology of the preterm labor and unknown Group B strep status of the mother, [**Name (NI) 16518**] was evaluated for sepsis upon admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.
On day of life #22, in response to increased episodes of apnea, bradycardia and poor feeding, [**Doctor First Name 16518**] was again evaluated for sepsis.
Gastrointestinal: [**Doctor First Name 16518**] was treated for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
Genitourinary:  [**Doctor First Name 16518**] had a scrotal ultrasound due to significant bruising and edema at birth.
Bruising and edema subsequently resolved.
Neurology: [**Doctor First Name 16518**] has maintained a normal neurological exam during admission and there were no neurological concerns at the time of discharge.
[**Doctor First Name 16518**] was    observed for 90 minutes in his car seat without any    episodes of bradycardia or oxygen desaturation.

Prematurity at 33-2/7 weeks gestation.
Spontaneous left pneumothorax.
Suspicion for sepsis - ruled out x2.
Apnea of prematurity.
Prenatal diagnosis of ventriculoseptal defect ruled out.
