The visualized paranasal sinuses again demonstrate a small amount of secretion in the right sphenoid sinus, which demonstrates a slight decrease in degree of aerosolization.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage.
[**2143-8-16**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
The heart remains mildly enlarged.
There is no focal infiltrate or effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 y/o M with h/o malignant hypertension & ESRD on HD (s/p recent removal of transplanted kidney) admitted with hypertensive urgency with headache.
During this time he was still requiring nitro gtt for BP control.
In the course of restarting all home meds he had a drop in BP and thus, his meds were staggered.
He was asymptomatic with high blood pressures at this time, but did complain of some lightheadedness with ambulation when he blood pressure was systolic 110s.
The patient had two episodes of dizziness in the setting of SBP in the 100-110s which were attributed to the combination of 120mg nifedepine and 600mg labetalol given at night.
He wears a Clonidine patch 0.3 put on every Sunday and was being treated with oral Clonidine 0.1mg for elevated blood pressures.
He will continue with his outpatient dialysis schedule and will go to his HD center on a regular basis for BP checks.
Headache, resolved: Likely related to his hypertension.
In the MICU, the patient was treated for pain with morphine as well as with compazine for nausea.
The patient received sevelamer & renal vitamin.
Acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Clonidine 0.1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO ONCE (Once) as needed for headache associated with high blood pressure.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Hypertensive urgency.
- End stage renal failure.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for elevated blood pressure and headaches.
