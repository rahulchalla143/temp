The patient has also been unable to do her activities of daily living, due to generalized weakness that started suddenly at the time of her second thoracic aneurysm repair.
They noticed that she had a left facial droop and her left side was weak but she was able to grip her hands on either side.
She was brought to [**Hospital 882**] hospital via ambulance with a head CT revealed a right thalamic hemorrhage.
The patient was then transferred to Neurologic Intensive Care Unit for further management of her hypertensive hemorrhagic stroke.
Magnetic resonance scan of the head revealed right thalamic hemorrhage confirmed by CT, measuring 1.2 by 1.3 by 1.5 cms.
Imaging studies showed midline shift or ventricular extension.
The patient was also treated with Levofloxacin for urinary tract infection on urinalysis.
The patient finished course of antibiotics for urinary tract infection with repeat head CT later on admission showing unchanging right thalamic hemorrhage.
The patient was afebrile on admission.
Throughout admission, the patient was somnolent on general examination with decreased arousability.
Abdomen was soft and extremities had no edema with distal pulses intact with no rashes.
On neurologic examination, the patient was only arousable to noxious stimuli on left side and right side on admission, with improvement in alertness and arousability prior to discharge.
The patient was able to follow simple commands on the right side, with severe left neglect.
The patient also had a right gaze deviation and a dense left hemiparesis on neurologic examination, with arm greater than leg.
On motor examination, the patient had increased tone on the left with 4+/5 right hand grasp, triceps with the left [**1-6**] grasp; positive pronator drift on the left with difficulty assessing lower extremities as the patient could not cooperate with the examination.
On cranial nerve examination, the patient had left facial droop with, as mentioned, a right gaze deviation and difficulty crossing midline.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a video swallow study on [**6-21**] which showed no evidence of aspiration or penetration of vocal cords, with a delay in volitional swallow, with trouble initiating.
On [**6-20**], the patient also had CT of the head without contrast for follow-up which showed no mass effect or shift of normal midline structures.
There was note made of moderate vascular ectasia and neural calcifications, likely related to atherosclerosis with unchanged right thalamic hemorrhage size.
The patient also had electrolytes and CBC monitored very closely during admission for supplementation and supportive care.
The patient did spike white blood cell count during urinary tract infection which was diagnosed early in admission but white count subsided prior to discharge.
The patient was also afebrile prior to discharge.
The patient will now be transfer to the rehabilitation facility for strengthening of left sided hemiparesis and rehabilitation of dysarthria and swallowing.
According to the patient's primary medical doctor, the patient has a baseline functional status of decreased arousability and decreased cognition at baseline.
These finding are suggestive of a neurodegenerative process such as dementia of Alzheimer's type.
-2 Possible dementia of Alzheimer's type  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Prednisone 5 mg p.o.
