Small right apical pneumothorax is not well seen.
Multiple images from the OR procedure were submitted for review ultimately showing a compression screw and fixation plate for treatment of the right intertrochanteric fracture.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  Reason: eval for retroperitoneal hematoma related to R pelvic fx  Field of view: 43 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 39 year old woman with multiple gunshot wounds, pelvic fracture REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for retroperitoneal hematoma related to R pelvic fx CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 39-year-old female with multiple gunshot wounds.
No prior studies are available for comparison.
A small area of hyperattenuation within the anterior mediastinum represents residual thymus or mediastinal hematoma.
Lung windows demonstrate opacity within the right upper lobe likely representing contusion as well as a small right-sided pneumothorax.
A small hypodensity within the lower pole of the right kidney likely represents a cyst but cannot be further characterized.
The pancreas is markedly edematous.
Fluid is seen between the SMV and pancreas, although there is no clear evidence of pancreatic injury.
There is marked enhancement of the bowel wall and narrowing of the IVC likely related to hypovolemic shock.
There is no intraperitoneal free air or active extravasation.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Low attenuation fluid tracks along the paracolic gutters into the pelvis.
There is no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
The iliac arteries are narrowed suggestive of hypovolemia.
The profunda femoris artery appeares to have a short segment occlusion after its origin with reconstitution distally.
The right gluteus muscle is indistinct and there is air and areas of hematoma.
A similiar appearance is seen within the muscles of the right thigh.
The osseous windows demonstrate a comminuted fracture of the right femur.
Multiple bullet fragments are seen within this area, the largest measuring 7 mm.
Small right apical pneumothorax.
Small IVC and Iliac arteries indicating hypovolemia and vascular contraction.
Comminuted right femoral fracture with retained bullet fragments.
Small bullet fragment in the wall or adjacent to the right proximal SFA near this level.
The SFA is bulbous in appearance 5 cm distal to its takeoff as well which may be from acute injury.
Stranding and hematoma within the gluteus muscles and muscles of the right thigh.
Orthopedics and Vascular Surgery were all consulted because of her injuries.
She was immediately taken to the operating due to hemodynamic instability.
Her right buttock wound was explored, irrigated and packed by Trauma Surgery.
Her vascular injuries from the gunshot wounds were repaired by Vascular Surgery, she underwent interposition graft repair of right superficial femoral artery, ligation of profunda femoris artery, four-compartment fasciotomy of right lower leg and irrigation of left upper extremity wound.
Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have recommended short term rehab.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
