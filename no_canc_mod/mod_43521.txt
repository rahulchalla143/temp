Admission Date:  [**2141-12-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-12-18**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: chest pain, shortness of breath.
History of Present Illness: 82 F with PMH CAD, DVT, CHF(recently hospitalized [**11-28**] for CHF exacerbation) presented to ED this am with chest pain and SOB that developed while walking to radiolgy for outpatient ultrasound of her liver ordered by PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was seen in PCP's office [**12-12**] for follow up of recent CHF exacerbation and found to have SBP 140/70 and clear lung exam.
Today per husband pt was walking and complained of sudden onset, sharp chest tightness lasting minutes associated with SOB which resolved with oxygen.
Per husband, she has not had any recent fevers, chills, cough or symptoms.
Pt given 2 L IVF with minimal improvement in SBP 70s and shortly developed increasing respiratory distress.
Resident who intubated pt reports normal intubation without evidence of aspiration.
ED concerned for PE with acute onset SOB, hypotension, and h/o DVT.
CTA showed B/L pleural effusions/ consolidations/ ?
+ bronchial breath sounds.
no palpable masses.
Extr: 1+ edema R ankle sl > L. DP 2+ b/l.
atrial abnormality old.
new ST depression I,II, aVF,mild depressiosn lateral V4-V6.
small Q3, no TWI III.
CXR on admission: + increased interstitial markings, sl blurring heart border consistent with CHF.
Repeat CXR post intubation: increased R sided interstitial markings consistent with dramatically worsening CHF.
+ air bronchograms, dependent infiltrates and small effusions.
some mild ground glass opacities.
RLE US ([**12-14**]): no clot   Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is an 82yo F with recent admission for flash pulmonary edema admitted for acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath requiring intubation.
The pt was found to have CHF likely due to transient ischemia in the setting of diastolic heart dysfunction.
The pt was found to go into afib with RVR while in the MICU, but this was likely stress induced (pt in NSR on admission).
Perhaps pt had brief episode of ischemia leading to decreased LV complaince and worsening of her diastolic dysfunction.
The pts  TTE on [**12-15**] was c/w with some diastolic dysfunction.
She ruled out for MI with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
Hypoxic respiratory distress: The pts initial presentation (CP, SOB, hypoxia, hypotension) was extremely concerning for PE and the patient was started on heparin drip but CTA was negative for clot.
Cxr initially thought to be [**3-15**] aspiration but the pts clinical status had rapid resolution w/ diuresis.
PNA felt to be unlikely as pt had no fever/cough.
It is felt the pt likely had transient ischemia leading to hypoxia/flash pulm edema.
The pt r/o for MI with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
#  Episode of Atrial Fibrillation--While the pt was in the MICU she had an episode of Afib with RVR (HR 120s).
Given EKG on admission was NSR and the A fib was noted the following day, her Afib was likely stress induced (from LV/LA volume overload in setting of stiff LV).
Per OMR notes, the pt has been followed for an irregular heart rhythm in the past, and there has been concern for anticoagulation given fall risk.
This was initially concerning for sepsis although afebrile and lactate 1.4.
Likely cardiogenic, although no signs of massive PE or MI; perhaps had ischemia which transiently worsened baseline diastolic dysfunction.
# Drop in hematocrit: Pt had Hct drop from 43 on admission [**12-14**], to 32 on [**12-16**].
Given the pts likely episode of transient ischemia inducing her flash pulmonary edema, stress test would be warranted in the near future.
#  Episode of Atrial Fibrillation--Unclear if CHF exacerbation induced atrial stretch/afib or if afib led to CHF exacerbation.
Given EKG on admission NSR and A fib noted the following day, Afib likely stress induced.
She may need outpt PFTs and stress test.
Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Stable, sats 94%RA   Discharge Instructions: Please continue to take all medications as you were previously taking.
You should return to the ED or call your PCP if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations or any other concerning symptoms.
