She underwent colonoscopy which revealed a blood clot overlying a visible vessel which was thought to be a bleeding artery.
The bleeding was thought [**3-17**] a Dieulafoy's Lesion.
She was also tansfused FFP q6 hours and given Vit K, to no avail though, her coagulopathy persisted and she continued to bleed.
She was then taken to a second colonoscopy which showed continued bleeding with areas of ulceration, therefore the patient was taken to the OR by colorectal surgery for ligation of the area under MAC.

# Coagulopathy: While the paitent had a GI bleed, she was given a total of 4 units of FFP and 10mg of Vit K x3 days to correct her elevated INR.
