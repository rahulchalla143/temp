Admission Date:  [**2160-12-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2160-12-26**]   Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old female with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and tongue cancer status post 35 cycles of XRT, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with hyponatremia and loose stools who returned two days after discharge with nausea, vomiting, and continuing loose stools.
She also complains of abdominal discomfort describes as a "funny feeling".
She denied any gas or abdominal pain.
She reports continuing loose stools with the sensation of tenesmus.
The stool is described as watery, light-colored, without blood or mucus.
She denied any rectal pain, bright red blood per rectum or melena.
She also reports no recent change in her tube feeds.
She has been taking all of her medications per NG tube including her hydrochlorothiazide which was recently discontinued during her last admission for hyponatremia.
Coronary artery disease, status post MI in [**2154**].
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Colon cancer, status post resection without chemotherapy.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  Well appearing, in no acute distress, no respiratory distress.
Evidence of some minimal breakdown of the tongue mucosa.
The patient has an edematous lower lip with blistering.
Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis.
There was 1+ pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities.
PULMONARY:  The patient was completely stable from a respiratory standpoint on admission; however, on hospital day number three, had respiratory arrest with an ABG of 7.15/82/33 and chest x-ray significant for asymmetric pulmonary edema with question of aspiration pneumonia.
She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia and when her sputum culture grew MSSA pneumonia, her vancomycin was stopped and she was continued on levofloxacin for a full course.
The etiology of the patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial.
It is considered likely that it was triggered initially by aspiration pneumonia with hypertensive urgency and subsequent flash pulmonary edema.
The patient remained afebrile throughout her hospitalization with a normal white blood cell count and was maintained on levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia.
Her pulmonary edema occurred in the setting of hypertension and resolved on the second day of her stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
It is likely that the patient has an element of diastolic dysfunction with this hypertensive crisis and she was diuresed with Lasix while in the ICU.
There was also a question of possible mucus plugging given the patient's thick secretions after XRT.
Given slight wheezing on examination on transfer back to the floor, the patient was started on Albuterol for likely post pneumonia inflammation of her airways.
She maintained good oxygen saturations on room air once transferred to the floor and was completely stable from a respiratory standpoint.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted with abdominal discomfort with her tube feeds as well as loose stools and elevated transaminase levels.
She had an abdominal CT on the day following her admission which was significant for a dilated common bile duct and was evaluated by the ERCP fellow who consented the patient for ERCP.
However, on the following hospital day, the patient suffered a respiratory arrest and was taken to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was noted during her respiratory arrest and brief stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to have troponins peak to 0.36 with flat CKs and an uninterpretable EKG secondary to left bundle branch block.
Given that she experienced a troponin leak in the context of her hypertensive crisis, it is likely that it represents demand ischemia.
There was a question of congestive heart failure.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given pulmonary edema and her respiratory arrest.
It is likely that the patient has an element of diastolic dysfunction and received several daily doses of Lasix while in the ICU.
The patient was also admitted with hyponatremia in the context of restarting her hydrochlorothiazide at home.
Her hydrochlorothiazide was held on admission and the patient received normal saline with eventual resolution of her hyponatremia.
It is likely that the patient's hyponatremia was secondary to hydrochlorothiazide with an element of dehydration contributing.
On transfer back to the floor, the patient had a video swallow study which was significant for poor tongue movement with premature spillover of fluids as well as an edematous epiglottis that does not deflect which contributes to aspiration.
The patient's visualized aspiration, however, appeared to be related to her complaints of pain and discomfort with material being swallowed and she was able to swallow water multiple times without difficulty.
It was also noted that when aspiration occurs she has an effective cough to clear it.
diet for secondary means only consisting of pureed and thin liquids with the avoidance of any asitic, citrus or spicy foods.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was admitted with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 on Glyburide.
Her Glyburide was held on her transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and when she returned to the floor she was noted to have poor control of her sugars.
It is unclear if the patient's sulfonylurea caused cholestatic hepatitis which resulted in the patient's mild elevation in transaminase levels and abdominal discomfort but for this concern the patient was switched over to Metformin.
PSYCHIATRY:  The patient was noted to have a somewhat depressed affect throughout her hospitalization as noted by physician and nursing staff.
She had many vague complaints and appeared to be moderately depressed.
Aspiration pneumonia, MSSA.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Coronary artery disease.
Shortness of breath or wheezing.
