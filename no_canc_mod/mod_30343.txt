CT Head [**2175-2-25**] A large right frontal parenchymal hematoma is again noted, measuring approximately 42 x 23 mm (2, 9) similar in size compared to [**2175-2-23**], previously 23 x 43 mm.
A small amount of blood continues to layer in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, but appears slightly decreased compared to the most recent prior examination.
The ventricles remain mildly dilated, but unchanged compared to [**2175-2-23**].
An 8-mm leftward shift of normally midline structures with subfalcine herniation is mildly decreased compared to [**2175-2-23**], previously 10 mm leftward shift.
Hypodensities in the left frontal, parietal and occipital lobes are again noted, relatively stable.
Partial opacification of mastoid air cells is once again noted.
Otherwise, layering blood within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is slightly decreased compared to the most recent prior examination.
Otherwise, no significant interval change since [**2175-2-23**].

She had a CT with vessel imaging that demonstrated significant stenosis in the left ICA.
This was confirmed on subsequent cerebral angiogram which failed to show evidence for vessel abnormalities known to cause such hemorrhages.
It was noted that there was significant vasculature disease throughout that was consistent with poor medical adherence.
EVD was necessary given obstructive hydrocephalus that developed in the context of blood in the third and fourth ventricles.
After 24 hours of clam the patients EVD was pulled and she subsequently developed an acute hypertensive emergency.
A CT scan of the head demonstrated new intraventricular blood with serial CT scans demonstrating increase ventricular size.
Repeat head CT on [**2-11**] for presurgical planning revealed new left hemispheric infarcts, likely related to severe left carotid stenosis which had progressed to closure.
Starting on [**2-20**] her drain was progressively raised from 10 cm to 15 cm then 20 cm over three days, without increased ventricular size (that could not be accounted for by reducing edema after infarcts).
She tolerated drain clamping and removal without worsening hydrocephalus on imaging.
This can sometimes occur with ventriculitis in the context of drain and blood in CSF, but infection could not be excluded, so meropenem coverage (see Pneumonia below) was broadened to include vancomycin.
Her fevers resolved on vancomycin, but CSF grew no organisms.
Pneumonia and Fever:   She was initially febrile and after multiple attempts to isolate an organism was found to grow pan sensitive Acinetobacter on sputum culture.
It was believed that her fever was of central cause.
Her antibiotics were pared down to nafcillin then switched to meropenem to better cover acinetobacter given some respiratory distress on [**2-19**].
3. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
6. nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
14. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for fever > 100 F.   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Frontal Intraparanchymal bleed with intraventricular extension Left MCA Infarct Obstructive Hydrocephulus, resolved Pneumonia Ventriculitis  Discharge Condition: Alert during the day, typically.
During the hospitalization you had further stroke, in the context of severe vascular disease, developed pneumonia (now resolving and being treated).
The drain was eventually removed without worsening.
