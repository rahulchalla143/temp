Admission Date:  [**2117-5-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-6-15**]   Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2724**] Chief Complaint: Cervical Spine Fracture  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2117-5-17**]: C6-T1 posterior instrumented fusion [**2117-5-19**]: C7 corpectomy with allograft and plate [**2117-5-26**] re-intubation [**2117-5-27**]: tracheostomy PEG placement   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname 85342**] [**Known lastname 53905**] is an 85 year old woman who presented as a transfer from [**Hospital3 4107**] for evaluation of cervical spine fractures.The patient stated that she was walking up the stairs in her basement the afternoon of admission when she fell backwards at the top after missing the handrail.
She did not loose conciousness but reported left shoulder pain.
There, she was found to have a burst fracture of C7, a C6 facet fracture and a possible fracture of T1.
She had pain in her left shoulder and upper back.
She had no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no abdominal pain.
She denied any numbness or tingling.
She had not had bowel or bladder incontinance.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Renal insufficiency (chronic, unknown baseline GFR) Chronic Anemia History of ankle fractures s/p Right knee replacement [**2116**] s/p unknown right shoulder surgery "years ago" s/p 2 c-sections and TAH   Social History: Married.
Tenderness over the left shoulder, and upper Tspine.
Absent patella and ankle jerks bilaterally.
Motor exam appears full - no deficits appreciated.
Pertinent Results: [**2117-5-14**] L Shoulder Xray- no fracture or dislocations Pelvix Xray- read pending, no obvious fracture  [**2117-5-14**] Pelvis X-ray No acute fracture or dislocation.
Minimal irregularity right anterior seventh rib, which could represent a fracture.
Correlation with the site of patient's pain is recommended.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Severe hyperflexion sprain injury with associated rupture of the intra- and supraspinous ligaments, dorsally, and associated multiple spinous process fractures, as on the prompting CT. 2.
Unstable fracture with both anterior and posterior column involvement, including interfacetal dislocation with "perched" facet on the right, and fracture involving the C7 inferior articulating facet, on the left.
Though there is associated 6-mm anterolisthesis of C6 on C7, with acutely angulated kyphosis, effacement of the ventral CSF and angulation of the cord, there is no definite evidence of cord contusion (N.B.
The processes above, including the burst fracture of C7, likely fractured osteophyte originating from the inferior endplate of C6, as well as the interfacetal dislocation combine to markedly encroach on the right neural foramen, impinging upon the exiting right C7 nerve root, correlating with the patient's acute symptoms.
There is no significant narrowing of the contralateral neural foramen demonstrated on either examination, and there is mo finding to specifically suggest nerve root avulsion.
No evidence of injury at any other level of the imaged cervicothoracic spine.
She presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] where CT c-spine showed multiple cervical fractures and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical workup.
She was found to have a C7 burst fracture as well as facet fractures.
Pre-op eval showed UTI and cipro was started on [**5-16**].
She remained intubated in the ICU and had poor urine output post-operatively.
Upon returning to the SICU she was noted to have tachycardia with hypotension which appeared rate related.
On [**5-21**] the patient had CXR showing a potential pneumomediastinum.
She was also started on triple antibiotics as empiric coverage for potential esophageal rupture.
On 5.23 she was increasingly fluid volume overloaded and received 20 of IV Lasix with good effect.
Also on the 23rd she had a drainage bag placed to her weeping left hand wound from a previous IV placement.
She was able to be weaned from ventilator and extubated [**5-25**] but then increasing respiratory difficulties prompted re-intubation morning of [**5-26**].
On [**5-27**] she remained intubated on CMV and a trach was placed due to her unstable respiratory status.
On the weekend of [**5-30**] and [**5-31**] she began to develop uremia and acute renal failure, as well as elevated LFTs.
A MRCP was performed which did not reveal any retained stones or cholelithiasis.
And further work up was held as her renal issues took precedence though there were no acute surgical issues and LFTs should be followed in the future.
Her wounds continued to be well healed.
She continued on CVVH  until [**6-6**] and diuersis of her positive fluid balance was acheived and she became more interactive.
She was titrated on medications for her anxiety which helped with ventalator weaning.
She has also [**Doctor First Name **] titrated with beta blockers for heart rate.
Olanzapine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Ten (10) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Take pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the a.m. when you wake for morning stiffness and before bed for sleeping discomfort ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation  Followup Instructions: PLEASE CALL [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] TO BE SEEN IN 6 WEEKS.
