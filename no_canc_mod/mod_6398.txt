HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year old female with no prior history of coronary artery disease who complains of substernal chest pain around 11:00 p.m. the night prior to admission on [**2142-2-24**].
EMS was called to the scene and did an electrocardiogram in the field which showed ST segment elevation approximately 3.0 millimeters in II, III and aVF.
At the time, the patient was watching television and developed sudden onset chest pain and left shoulder pain.
She denied any shortness of breath, did have some nausea, no vomiting, did have some diaphoresis at the time.
The patient's chest pain was then five out of ten and only in her back, chest, no diaphoresis, however, she continued to have ST segment changes in II, III and aVF.
The patient's cardiac risk factors include her age, hypertension and extensive tobacco use.
Seizure disorder times approximately two years, status     post multiple falls treated with Dilantin.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother died of myocardial infarction at age 73.
Sister had myocardial infarction at age 68.
The neck reveals no lymphadenopathy, no elevated jugular venous distention.
There is a small ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
Extremities revealed no edema.
Chest x-ray no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Echocardiogram from [**2142-2-25**], revealed no significant effusion or tamponade.
Cardiac catheterization from [**2142-2-25**], selective coronary arteriography of the right dominant system revealed two vessel coronary artery disease, the left main coronary artery was normal.
Left anterior descending had a 50% lesion at the origin of the first septal branch.
The left circumflex had a 70% lesion in its midportion.
The dominant right coronary artery was totally occluded in its midportion with extensive clot burdened throughout its midportion.
Intervention on occluded mid right coronary artery using Reolytic thrombectomy (angiojet) and stenting times one with excellent angiographic results and timi free flow.
The procedure was complicated by significant bradycardia, transient atrial fibrillation and hypotension requiring temporary pacing and intra-aortic balloon insertion.
An urgent echocardiogram was performed in the Catheterization Laboratory to rule out effusion/tamponade (following placement of the temporary pacing wire).
The study was limited but the right ventricle was well visualized with no significant effusion and no evidence of tamponade.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction managed by acute     stenting of right coronary artery.
No significant events during hospitalization.
Intra-aortic balloon pump and Dopamine discontinued on [**2142-2-25**], without complication.
Coronary artery disease - The patient was continued on Aspirin, Plavix.
Peripheral vascular - The patient developed hematoma status post cardiac catheterization.
Hematology - The patient was noted with mild anemia upon admission.
Infectious disease - The patient is status post recent urinary tract infection previously treated with antibiotics prior to admission.
Urinalysis sent on [**2142-2-25**], was negative for evidence of infection.
Neurologic - The patient with a history of seizure disorder on Dilantin at home.
