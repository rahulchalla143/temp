She had associated nausea but no diaphoresis.
Her pain lasted for 10+ minutes.
A 12 lead EKG showed ST elevation in leads 2, 3, and aVF.
She had been feeling weak for the last month or so, and during the last week she had three episodes of chest pain which lasted for about 30 minutes.
This pain would come on with rest, would be associated with diaphoresis and lightheadedness, and would resolve after she would lay down.

Acute inferior myocardial infarction, treated with primary PCI of the RCA.
The LMCA had mild calcification.
The LAD had proximal 70% tubular lesion to the mid segment with a focal 95% lesion.
The RCA was a dominant vessel with a 99% mid vessel hazy lesion with TIMI II flow down the RPL and PDA.
There was no pulmonary hypertension.
Successful PCI of the RCA with a 3.0 x 18 mm Cypher DES, post-dilated with a 3.5 mm balloon.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular  systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior and  inferolateral walls.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not  present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears  structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which  most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Possible acute inferolateral myocardial infarction.
Cannot exclude a component of focal inferolateral pericarditis (though unlikely).
TRACING #1 Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] S.   Brief Hospital Course: # IMI - Patient had elevated ST segments in II, III, and aVF which correlated with the RCA stenosis seen on cath.
She was also found to have flow limiting stenosis in the LAD.
Patient continued to have ST elevations post cath.
# Pump - Previous EF unknown, post cath ECHO showed EF 45%.
No AS, trace AR, trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10225**] with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls.
Pt was hypotensive after arriving in the CCU post cath, and required dopamine initially.
# Rhythm - normal sinus rhythm.
# Anemia - Patient received a total of 3 units of blood this admission.
Hct stabilized and was felt to be due to blood loss during placement of lines.
# Thrombocytopenia - Plts decreased during admission, all heparin flushes were stopped.
# Diabetes - Patient's oral hypoglycemics were held and she was kept on an insulin sliding scale and a Diabetic diet.
# Hypothyroidism - pt's TSH of 4.6 is slightly elevated.
Pt does not have any sxs of low thyroid at this time.
# Prophylaxis - pneumoboots, PPI .
# Dispo - patient was discharged to home with: home PT, [**Name (NI) 269**] services and follow up blood work that will be checked by her PCP.
