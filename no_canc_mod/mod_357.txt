Admission Date: [**2137-1-18**]        Discharge Date: [**2137-2-4**]   Service:  VSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 83-year-old, Russian only speaking female admitted due to likely cellulitis of her right above the knee amputation stump.
Her history was limited by absence of a family member or translator at the time of interview, and the remainder of her history was obtained from her medical record.
Past medical history includes coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent in [**2131**], coronary artery bypass graft in [**2132-7-29**], cerebrovascular accident in [**2128**], right medullary cardiovascular accident in [**2135-3-29**], seizure disorder, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, carotid artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis status post stent placement in the left renal artery, recurrent urinary tract infection, severe depression status post ECT therapy, left femoral neck fracture, right groin hematoma, recurrent urinary tract infections, peripheral vascular disease.
Past surgical history includes repair of a ruptured infected right femoral pseudo aneurysm, coronary artery bypass graft, right common femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass graft with a PTFE and distal talar vein patch in [**2131**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], left closed reduction internal fixation of the left hip fracture, and evacuation of right groin hematoma.
In general, the patient was alert, in no acute distress.
She has slight scleral icterus and some sublingual icterus.
CT of the legs showed skin thickening and subcutaneous stranding in the medial thigh corresponding to physical exam without underlying abscess, similar skin thickening and pronounced subcutaneous stranding and extensive soft tissue attenuation surrounding the prosthetic graft in the anterior lateral thigh also suspicious for infection, mottled and demineralized appearance of the femur likely related to disease.
She was also evaluated for heart failure causing the peripheral edema.
During the patient's stay she had considerable difficulty receiving blood pressure control.
She was taken on [**2137-1-21**] to the Operating Room for an I and D of the infected leg and removal of her right thigh graft, which she tolerated well.
Renal function was a concern, however, afterwards and her chronic renal insufficiency with acute exacerbation required monitoring.
Also postoperatively, the patient was seen by Psychiatry both for treatment of her severe depression as well as acute mental status exacerbations and need for a one-to-one sitter.
After a couple days of dressing changes soaked in acetic acid, the patient's leg wound had a VAC dressing placed, which worked well for healing purposes.
On postoperative day 3 the patient did experience a fever and received a fever workup.
Her chest x-ray did not have any CHF or pneumonia.
She also had blood and urine cultures performed.
During her stay the patient did require blood transfusion which did cause a degree of heart failure and the need for Lasix.
While in the ICU the patient never truly woke up from a neurological standpoint, although she would turn her head to the left and withdraw her left leg to pain.
She did require IV blood pressure management and drips for severe hypertension.
Patient's ventilatory support was removed and by the evening of [**2137-2-4**] at 9:55 p.m. the patient expired with no blood pressure and no respiratory effort.
