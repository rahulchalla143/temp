Admission Date:  [**2117-11-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-11-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-4-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / Lactose  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: Abnormal rhythm on outpatient cardiac event monitoring  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 64 year-old Female with a PMH significant for persistent atrial fibrillation (treated with Disopyramide and Metoprolol currently; previously on other anti-arrhythmics who underwent PVI in [**8-/2117**]), atypical atrial flutter (s/p cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in [**9-/2116**]), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ascending aortic aneurysm, primary biliary cirrhosis s/p liver transplantation in [**2095**] (on chronic immune-suppression) who presents with abnormal rhythm strip while being monitored from home via an event monitor.
On monitoring, her ventricular rate appeared to be in the 120-130s with runs of a wide-complex tachycardia (ventricular tachycardia vs. atrial fibrillation with aberrancy).
Of note, the patient had a recent CCU from [**2117-11-18**] to [**2117-11-19**] after she presented to an outside hospital with concerns for gastroenteritis and hypotension to the 80-90s systolic range; which was empirically treated with Vancomycin, Zosyn and stress dose IV steroids who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
On arrival, her GI losses were treated with IV fluids and in the ED she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to the 110s which was treated with Diltiazem, Amiodarone and Metoprolol.
She required CCU admission and Phenylephrine gtt for maintenance of her tenuous blood pressure.
She improved quickly, with resolution of her GI symptoms and improvement of her blood pressure off pressor support.
She was discharged on a 5-day course of Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for her presumed acute diarrheal illness.
She continued taking Cipro and Flagyl as prescribed and has continued to have 4-5 episodes of diarrhea per day, which is unchanged from discharge.
Today, she felt that she was reverting back to atrial fibrillation, when this happens she feels a pain which is hard for her to characterize, but is described as a dull pain in both her shoulders.
She received a call from Dr.[**Name (NI) 7914**] office which  noted the wide complex tachycardia and asked her to come to [**Hospital1 18**].
On arrival to the CCU, she is feeling well with no complaints.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus.
Denies headaches or vision changes.
No cough or upper respiratory symptoms.
Denies chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations.
No nausea or vomiting, denies abdominal pain.
No dysuria or hematuria.
No change in bowel movements or bloody stools.
Denies muscle weakness, myalgias or neurologic complaints.
No exertional buttock or calf pain.
Past Medical History: * Hypertension * Persistent atrial fibrillation (initially treated with Disopyramide, followed by Amiodarone, Atenolol and Dofetilide; all unsuccessful in restoring or maintaining sinus rhythm; she underwent pulmonary vein isolation in [**8-/2117**] - currently maintained on Disopyramide 300 mg PO Q12H and Metoprolol succinate 50 mg XL PO daily), * Atypical atrial flutter (which developed after PVI status-post  successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in [**9-/2116**]) * Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (last MRI in [**2115**] showed hypertrophy confined to the distal third and true apex portions of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction greater than 70%) * Ascending aortic aneurysm (measuring 4.2 x 4.3- cm in [**3-/2116**]) .
