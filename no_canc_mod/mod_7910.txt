Admission Date: [**2145-6-30**]        Discharge Date: [**2145-7-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-11-11**]        Sex:  F  Service:  MED   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever and dyspnea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP, on home O2 with a baseline of 93 percent on two liters, with a history of bronchiectasis and two recent admissions for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia in [**3-/2145**] and [**4-/2145**] requiring Medical Intensive Care Unit stays complicated by hypotension requiring pressors and acute renal failure, prerenal and ATN who was at home in her usual state of health until last night when she was noted to have acute shortness of breath and needed to increase her home O2 from chronic two liters to five liters.
She also had fevers and chills.
She had a mild cough with mild yellow phlegm production.
No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, diarrhea or melena.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in her sputum following hernia repair and again in [**3-/2145**] with documented pneumonia.
Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP at 8-10 cm of water.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema on chronic home oxygen 2-4 liters nasal cannula.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Acute respiratory failure in [**3-/2144**] and again in [**3-/2145**] secondary to poor p.o.
Diastolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction greater than 55 percent in 03/[**2145**].
Coronary artery disease.
Dysphagia with motility study in [**1-/2144**] showing no esophageal contraction.
Symptomatic bradycardia status post VDD pacer in 11/[**2143**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Status post hernia repair.
Chronic lower back pain.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a father and brother with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Mother died of coronary artery disease.
Neck: Jugular venous distension approximately 8 cm.
Lungs:  Rhonchi two-thirds up right lung, left rhonchi at bases, no wheezing.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, obese, no hepatosplenomegaly, multiple healed scars.
1+ edema bilaterally.
Chest x-ray:  Mild congestive heart failure and a question of a left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity.
Mild obstructive and restrictive disease.
Echocardiogram in [**3-/2145**]:  Ejection fraction greater than 55 percent, dilated left ventricle and right ventricle, [**1-29**]+ mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's shortness of breath was multifactorial.
Initial concern was congestive heart failure given the chest x-ray, as well as pulmonary examination, as well as blossoming pneumonia.
Other diagnoses included a history of bronchiectasis, worsening pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flair and obstructive sleep apnea.
When the patient was admitted, overnight during her first hospitalization stay, she had an increase in her oxygen requirement and pleuritic chest pain.
The patient received aggressive chest physical therapy and suctioning by Respiratory and subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where the patient received aggressive chest physical therapy, Mucomyst and guaifenesin with clearing of her secretions and improvement of her oxygenation from four liters to her baseline of two liters.
It was likely due to worsening pneumonia.
Her sputum culture returned and was positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
On [**2145-7-7**], the patient had increasing hypoxia with a stable heart rate.
She had no clinical evidence of deep venous thrombosis with Homans sign that she was not tachycardiac.
A repeat chest x-ray was performed, which showed increasing questioned left pleural effusion.
The patient had an attempted blind tap without ultrasound guidance, which was unsuccessful.
A chest CT was performed, which showed no pleural effusion, however, but continued consolidation of the left lower lobe and lingula region.
Given the fact that she had multiple etiologies and underlying pulmonary disease, it was assumed that this was just progression of her methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, which required significant chest physical therapy.
The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2145-7-8**], which showed mucoid impaction within the right lower lobe, left lower lobe and the lingular region.
No evidence of endobronchial lesion.
The patient should have aggressive chest physical therapy and is currently being screened for rehabilitation for possible transfer today given her recurrent mucous plugging as the source of her hypoxia.
Pneumonia:  The patient presented with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia from the left lower lobe opacity in her chest which was confirmed by chest CT.
The patient was initially given vancomycin and levofloxacin, but sputum was growing methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, so levofloxacin was discontinued.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction with a normal ejection fraction.
Chest x-ray initially showed congestive heart failure on admission.
She had no episodes of hypotension or hypertension during the hospitalization.
Anemia:  The patient had no evidence of guaiac positive stools, but her hematocrit initially was down to 25.2, likely due to blood draws while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.
She had no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Renal:  The patient had no evidence of acute renal failure and with improved p.o.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was on a low sodium diet given her history of congestive heart failure.
Chronic low back pain:  The patient had no acute flares of her back pain.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Diastolic congestive heart failure with acute exacerbation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic low back pain.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Afebrile times six days, stable heart rate and blood pressure, baseline oxygen at 94 percent on two liters, no shortness of breath or chest pain.
Mucomyst 20 percent solution, 1-10 cc nebulizer q 4-    6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium bromide nebulizer solution, one    inhalation q six hours as needed for wheezing.
