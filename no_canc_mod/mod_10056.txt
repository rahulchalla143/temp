Pt denied having chest pain or abdominal pain, no fevers or chills, no upper respiratory or cold symptoms and no difficulty breathing up until this point.
Per OSH records he was initially in sinus rhythem but then developed a. flutter followed by wide complex tachycardia w/ rates to 270 but then spontatenously decreased to 170.
On arrival pt was normotensive (98-102/50-54) w/HR in 70s; ST depressions were seen inferolateral distribution on EKG.
CXR showed elevated right hemidiaphraghm and right atelectasis but was otherwise clear.
No dyspnea, no chest pain or discomfort.
On review of systems, denies myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, orthopnea, ankle edema.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -Status post cardiac arrest in [**2163**] in setting of viral pna.
- From [**2173**]-[**2175**], he experienced infrequent palpitations, which were thought to be related to isolated premature ventricular beats.
He was maintained on lisinopril 2.5 mg daily for a number of years given his depressed left ventricular ejection fraction.
- Long QT interval.
-Chronic respiratory failure requiring ventilation; s/p trach '[**70**], vent-dependent.
-Cholelithiasis requiring recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] and ERCP.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
G-tube in place, dressing dry and intact, no significant discharge; no erythema EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e.
No femoral bruits.
No LE edema.
Feet cool  SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Depressed left ventricular function .
There is stabilization hardware along the thoracic spine.
The patient has elevated right hemidiaphragm on the prior exam and this appears stable on today's study.
There is no definite consolidation, possibility of small effusion on the right cannot be excluded.
No large pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No definite acute findings.
Stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with haziness of the right lung base which is likely chronic though a small effusion cannot be excluded.

His blood pressure was unstable and was found to have a wide complex tachycardia.
# Ventricular tachycardia: The patient presented with sudden onset of palpitations with diaphoresis and his tachycardia may be due to his longstanding history of Duchennes muscular dystrophy and systolic dysfunction with EF 35%.
# Tracheostomy/Ventilatory Dependence: His transient dyspnea was most likely secondary to his VT rather than an acute pulmonary process.
# Duchennes MD: He has longstanding musculodystrophy and has a G-tube used for taking his medications.
Upon presentation he felt bloated, KUB showed distended air filled bowel, and he was treated with lactulose and simethicone with restoration of regular bowel movements and decreased abdominal distention.
# Skin: He was maintained on his home regimen of kenalog and lotromin without complications.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Twenty (20) ML PO DAILY PRN () as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: premier nursing  Discharge Diagnosis: Wide Complex Tachycardia Duchennes Muscular dystrophy Chronic respiratory failure requiring ventilation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because you were experiencing shortness of breath and a rapid heart rhythm.
