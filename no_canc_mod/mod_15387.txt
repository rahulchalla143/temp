On [**2108-1-3**] the patient had complained of shoulder pain.
She was also being treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin.
The patient was also noted to have tarry guaiac positive stool with temperatures to 100 and subsequent increases in her BUN and creatinine to 76 and 2.
In part also due to loss of IV access at the nursing home.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, anxiety, lower back pain, failure to thrive, atrial fibrillation with a history of syncope, and breast cancer.
The abdomen was slightly distended, firm through, tender with rebound tenderness.
No masses on rectal examination.
The extremities were warm without edema and multiple ecchymoses in bilateral legs.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A chest x-ray showed free air underneath the right diaphragm.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 45606**] was seen and evaluated in the Emergency Department with again the aforementioned history of lethargy and dehydration.
A chest x-ray performed in the Emergency Room demonstrated a large amount of free air underneath the right hemidiaphragm.
Given the patient's status of abdominal pain, and urgent General Surgery consultation was obtained.
Because of her worsening renal function and relative neutropenia, it was unclear as to when this perforation occurred.
The serious nature of the patient's condition was explained to her family; including the high likelihood of her death both with an operation and also the very high risk of death with an operation.
She was electively intubated in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for airway protection secondary to respiratory distress.
We found a perforation in the distal sigmoid colon, and, since the patient was unstable, this was oversewn.
The bowel was too edematous to close the abdominal incision andthe abdominal wound was covered with a sterile plastic bag and and then ioban.
She received an additional 8 liters of fluid and several units of blood, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets.
A discussion was held with family regarding the gravity of the situation and the patient's unlikelihood for a meaningful recovery.
