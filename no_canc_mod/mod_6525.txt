PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature 100.8, heart rate 76, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 100/60 (note that patient's blood pressure is typically 100 systolic and this does not represent an abnormal finding), oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.
Because of the patient's marked agitation, however, interval examination revealed a rather deep left buttock ulcer approximately 4 cm wide and 7 cm deep.
Buttock ulcer:  In consultation with the General Surgery Service, the patient underwent a long course of wet-to-dry dressing changes for his wound with minimal improvement.

The patient's postoperative course was marked by the absence of fevers, however, there was some increased pain requiring titration of his pain medicines, while he is on a stable regimen of long-acting oxycodone.
He required additional medicines for pain control.
Another complication of his postoperative stay was increasing nausea attributed to his increased demand for pain control, optimum relief of his nausea was achieved with Benadryl by mouth and intravenously.
