At the time of evaluation he complained of dysphagia but no difficulty breathing.
He stated he had not had recent fevers and had no neck pain.
Endoscopic exam showed a 3x3cm posterior pharyngeal mass nearly occluding the airway, and the Pt was therefore taken to the operating room to safely secure his airway.
The cyst contained dark brown fluid consistent with hematoma.
He was subsequently extubated without difficulty, and reported that the dysphagia was gone.
A follow-up CT of the neck showed resolution of the retropharngeal cyst.
He had no complaints of dysphagia, respiratory distress, or any other concerns from a cardiac, pulmonary, GI, or GU standpoint.
Imaging: CT Neck ([**Hospital 794**] Hospital) - 24 x 31 x 18 mm subglottic cystic mass, above the level of the cords, resulting in narrowing of the airway.
