VATS Pleurodesis   History of Present Illness: As in primary summary  Past Medical History: As in primary summary  Social History: Tobacco + Professor  Family History: N/A  Physical Exam: Intake Exam:  Tm=100, Tc=98.3  120/60  hr=103   rr=22  O2sat=94%@RA NAD HEENT: PEERLA, mildly edematous R face/neck CHEST:  suggestion of distant BS on R HEART:  Tachy, irregular rythm, no MMR ABD: soft, NT/ND EXT:  R AV fistula w/ bruit/thrill.
Following the [**6-16**] thoracentesis, the R pleural effusion was monitored by serial CXR, and was seen to reaccumulate within 5 days, during which time, her 02 demand increased.
At this time, she was transfered to the VICU setting, and thoracentesis via ultrasound was repeated on [**6-28**]; it productive of less fluid then the original tap but without complication.
Neither tap was suggestive of a frank bleed (see lab results).
A chest CT on [**6-28**] suggested a patent stent with a large, freely-layering right pleural effusion as well as associated compressive atelectasis without evidence of large mass.
On [**7-10**], her CXR was significant for a marked reduction in the right pleural effusion, and she was maintaining an O2 sat of 92% on room air, at rest.
