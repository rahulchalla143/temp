He was given Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Flagyl for broad-spectrum coverage as well as stress-dose hydrocort and 1.5L NS for hypotension.

He and the family are fully aware of the risks of aspiration from continued eating.
On arrival to the MICU, he is on a non-rebreather in no acute distress with continued SBPs in the 80s, despite fluid resuscitation in the ED.

Non-specific ST segment changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2172-11-10**] precordial T wave changes are less prominent.
[**2172-11-18**] CXR: Emphysema with persistent airspace opacities involving the mid and lower lungs concerning for pneumonia with possible component of pulmonary edema.
Heart size and mediastinum are stable including extensive calcifications in the aortic arch.
Widespread parenchymal consolidations seen bilaterally appear to be unchanged or minimally improved, in particular at the mid left lung zone.
No interval development of pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old male with history of chronic aspiration, COPD (no PFTs), t2DM, history of PE s/p IVC filter placement and dementia, presenting with shortness of breath and hypotension likely secondary to recurrent aspiration event.
No invasive procedures were performed, but a PICC line was placed for IV antibiotic administration.
Hypoxemia and chronic aspiration: Patient's hypoxemia is very likely secondary to aspiration, given his history and multiple prior admissions for similar symptoms.
We started broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl) to cover both aspiration pneumonia and HCAP.
Leukocytosis looked to be close to baseline, though slightly elevated, with a mild left shift.
The son and patient understand that taking anything PO is a high risk and may contribute to his poor oxygenation status.
No evidence of active bleeding.
Transitional Issues: Patient has been admitted many times for recurrent aspiration pneumonia and continues to ingest food, despite the patient an family being aware of the risks of aspiration.
It was agreed that the patient will be treated for his current infection with IV antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) through the PICC.
