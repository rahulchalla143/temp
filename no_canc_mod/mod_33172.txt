He was recently discharged on [**2-3**] after presenting with ARF and [**1-17**] after presenting with Fournier's Gangrene/periurethral abscesses requiring operative debridment.
He was doing well at home until today when he had an episode of bright red hematemsis with clots this morning.
He also had a 3 bowel movements with bright red blood and associated with light-headedness but no abdominal pain or chest pain.
NG lavage positive for dark blood but no coffee grounds and he had brb per rectum.
He complained of CP initially which improved with morphine 2mg iv x 2 and blood transfusion.
His EKG demonstrated anterior-lateral precordial TW flattening consistent with ischemic changes per cardiology.
Abd CT was negative for aorto-enteric fistula and he was admitted to the MICU for further management.
Past Medical History: - large infrarenal AAA with b/l large common iliac aneurysms - Urethral abscess - DM - HTN - CAD s/p PCI - R hypogastric coiled embolization on [**2197-1-17**] - suprapubic urinary catheter placement [**2197-1-10**] - per pt has Hx of "stenting" of vessel after left arm pain, but does not believe stent in heart, thinks in arm.
Family History: Colon cancer in father  Physical Exam: VS: 98 96 107/65 100%2L GEN:The patient is in no distress and appears comfortable SKIN:No rashes or skin changes noted HEENT:No JVD, neck supple, No lymphadenopathy in cervical, posterior, or supraclavicular chains noted.
Non-distended, and soft without tenderness EXTREMITIES:no peripheral edema, warm without cyanosis NEUROLOGIC: Alert and appropriate.
No pronator drift.
Tracing may be within normal limits but unstable baseline makes assessment difficult.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 81 144 70 356/392 72 42 86  CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2197-2-8**]:  CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The imaged portions of the lung bases reveal a 7-mm subpleural nodule in the right lower lobe (3:11).
Additionally, note is made of scattered nodules in the left lower lobe, though these latter show indistinct margins suggesting that they may be inflammatory or infectious in etiology.
The imaged cardiac apex is notable for mitral annular calcification.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
The prostate is notable for diffuse calcifications which are also unchanged.
There is no free gas or fluid in the pelvis.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
The infrarenal aorta is notable for diffuse aneurysmal dilation.
A small intimal flap is seen in the proximal part of the suprarenal aorta (3:70).
More distally, just above the level of the aortic bifurcation, the aorta measures 74 x 69 mm in cross-sectional area and is notable for a large amount of mural thrombus.
Aneurysmal dilation with thrombus is also present in the common iliac arteries bilaterally, the most severe on the right with a total dimension of the vessels 91 x 83 mm, similar to that seen previously.
There is no evidence of aortoenteric fistula.
OSSEOUS FINDINGS: There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesion.
Degenerative changes are present throughout the lumbar spine.
There is also mild degenerative change in the sacroiliac joints bilaterally.
Large infrarenal and bilateral common iliac arterial aneurysms, appearing similar to those characterized recently.
There is no evidence of aortoenteric fistula.
Focal nodule in the right lower lobe and inflammatory appearing nodules in the left lower lobe.
In the absence of high risk for pulmonary malignancy, would recommend followup with a dedicated CT of the chest in six months.
In the presence of these risk factors, would recommend followup with a dedicated CT of the chest in three months.
CXR [**2197-2-9**]: FINDINGS: Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube and central line with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
No new areas of consolidation to suggest an acute infectious pneumonia.
These findings are compatible with possible portal hypertensive gastropathy.
A clot suggested recent bleeding and there were two vissible vessels.
2 2.5 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were applied for hemostasis with success.
A gold probe was applied for hemostasis successfully to anterior vissible vessel.
Two endoclips were successfully applied for the purpose of hemostasis to posterior vissible vessel.
Impression: Mosaic appearance in the fundus and stomach body compatible with possible portal hypertensive gastropathy Ulcer in the proximal bulb and anterior bulb (injection, thermal therapy, endoclip) Ulcer in the gastroesophageal junction Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year-old man with a history of a large infrarenal AAA with bilateral large common iliac aneurysms, s/p right hypogastric coiled embolization on [**2197-1-17**], who presents with hematemesis.
# GI Bleed: On arrival to the ICU patient was hemodynamically stable.
This demonstrated two large bleeding duodenal ulcers which were injected with epinephrine, cauterized and endoclips were applied.
# CAD s/p PCI: Patient initially experienced chest pain, it was considered likely that this represented demand ischemia in the setting of anemia.
Myocardial infarction was ruled out by EKG and serial troponins and cardiac enzymes.
# Infrarenal AAA with b/l common iliac aneurysms: CT scan demonstrated no evidence of aorto-enteric fistula.
Patient has a scheduled intervention for his AAA with vascular surgery.
# Periurethral Abscesses: Patient had recent periurethral abscesses requiring operative debridement and suprapubic urinary catheter placement [**2197-1-10**].
# Hypertension:  Blood pressure medications were initially held in the setting of an acute bleed.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Patient was treated with a humalog sliding scale throughout his hospitalization.
# Lung nodule: Focal nodule in the right lower lobe and inflammatory appearing nodules in the left lower lobe.
In the absence of high risk for pulmonary malignancy, would recommend followup with a dedicated CT of the chest in six months.
In the presence of these risk factors, would recommend followup with a dedicated CT of the chest in three months.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Duodenal Ulcer Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm   Discharge Condition: Stable, alert and oriented to person, place and time, ambulating without assistance.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for bloody stools.
Upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD) was performed and found a bleeding ulcer in your stomach.
