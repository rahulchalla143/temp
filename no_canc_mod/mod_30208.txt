History of Present Illness: 47M who had not had recently seen a physician and with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] distant small smoking history(<5pk/y), distant cocaine use and heavy alcohol use but sober for the last 7 years presented to OSH with chest pain.
The pain started about 4:30PM while he was lifting sheet [**Doctor Last Name **] at work.
He describes the pain as being right in the center of his chest and radiating down both arms to his wrists.
There he had an EKG with ST elevations in I and aVL and depressions inferiorly.
TTE [**2159-2-15**]: MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.8 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *6.1 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.6 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.2 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 4.0 cm Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: *0.23 (nl >= 0.29) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 3.6 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *3.6 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aorta - Arch: *3.1 cm (nl <= 3.0 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.4 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.9 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.9 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.00 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 222 msec Conclusions: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the midventricular segment of the anterior free wall and of the apical segments of the posterior and lateral walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: borderline/low normal left ventricular ejection fraction with focal wall motion abnormalities consistent with coronary artery disease   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 47yo M with minimal risk factor(tobacco, cocaine, elevated BMI) who presented with lateral STEMI with 90% occlusions in RPL and diagonal branches that were stented with bare metal stents .
#STEMI: s/p cath and bare metal stents placement.
