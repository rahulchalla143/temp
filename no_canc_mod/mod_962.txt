HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old gentlemen with end stage liver disease secondary to NASH, diabetes mellitus, esophageal varices, status post banding, who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 256**] from [**2198-2-28**] through [**2198-3-6**] for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and anemia.
He was then discharged to a skilled nursing facility where he was found to have a change in mental status on the morning of admission ([**2198-3-9**]).
A chest x-ray there showed likely aspiration pneumonia and fingerstick glucose was noted to be 30 with an oxygen saturation of 77% on room air.
He does recall some shaking chills starting the day prior to admission at the skilled nursing facility, but denies any subjective fevers.
He had had some increased diarrhea prior to admission about [**7-9**] bouts per day, baseline 2-3 times per day.
He has not been eating well secondary to poor appetite and had a very small dinner the night prior to admission.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No cough, no dry heaves, no chest pressure, palpitations.
Positive nausea without emesis, some mild shortness of breath.
No abdominal pain, no bright red blood per rectum.
End state liver disease secondary to non alcoholic steatohepatitis now off of the transplant list due to lack of social support and noncompliance with medications.
His last Mel score was noted to be 13, despite having end stage disease.
Esophageal varices with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2198-3-1**] demonstrating Grade 1 varices, portal gastropathy, duodenitis, status post banding of Grade [**1-2**] varices in [**2195-10-31**] and [**2196-9-30**].
Stress echocardiogram in [**2196**] showing an ejection fraction of 65% and no evidence of ischemia.
Diabetes mellitus type 2:  Controlled on NPH 25 q.a.m.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No known malignancy, heart disease,diabetes mellitus, or other medical issues.
General:  Shaking diffusely, rigoring, mild to moderate respiratory distress at bed height angle of 30 degrees.
No obliterating the S2 at the right base, radiating to the right carotid artery, but heard throughout the precordium, no evidence of rubs, clicks or gallops.
Abdomen distended, nontender, dull to percussion with a positive fluid wave bilaterally.
Positive bowel sounds, no peritoneal signs.
Extremities:  Trace lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Chest x-ray:  Left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
Electrocardiogram:  Right bundle branch block with normal sinus rhythm with an underlying sinus rhythm, unchanged compared with prior from [**2198-1-29**].
Blood cultures (final report) showed no evidence of bacteremia.
The septic shock was thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia, although, the chest x-ray was significant only for mild left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
A paracentesis was performed and was negative for SVP.
A urinalysis was negative for urinary tract infection.
The patient was maintained on levofloxacin and Flagyl for a 14 day course for aspiration pneumonia.
As a result of the aggressive fluid resuscitation with his previous hypotension to the 60s, he had a resulting non gap metabolic acidosis.
The propanolol was not restarted at the recommendation of the Liver Service given the patient's lower extremity edema and only Grade 1 varices.
He was ruled out by enzymes for an myocardial infarction and he had no significant events on telemetry.
Though, crackles did diminish somewhat when the Lasix and Aldactone were titrated up.
As stated above, he will be treated with a 14 day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.
There is some question as to underlying interstitial lung disease, but no further information is available at this time on that speculation.
Cough:  The patient did have persistent dry cough that was somewhat controlled with Tessalon pearls and Robitussin.
However, given the patient's guaiac positive state and questionable bloody emesis in the Emergency Room, Gastroenterology was consulted and they did not feel that the patient had an active gastrointestinal bleed and had only Grade 1 varices, therefore, they recommended maintaining him on Protonix and falling hematocrit.
Coagulopathy:  he does have an underlying coagulopathy secondary to hepatic dysfunction.
Change in mental status:  It is most likely that the patient's change in mental status is secondary to hypoglycemia.
He does have a history of hyperammonemia in the past, and his ammonia level at the time of admission was 38.
Decreased urine output:  Initially the patient had decreased urine output, and there was some concern for hepatorenal syndrome, however, after aggressive fluid resuscitation, his urine output returned to [**Location 213**] with greater than 1 cc/kg/hour of urine output.
SVP:  The patient did have a history of SVP and a paracentesis was performed on [**2198-3-9**] which showed no evidence of SVP.
Diabetes mellitus:  Initially the NPH and regular insulin standing doses were held given his hypoglycemia and mental status changes.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition/metabolic acidosis: Initially the patient had a primary metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic acidosis secondary to septic shock with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
Following the resolution of the patient's sepsis, he had a normal anion gap acidosis likely secondary to aggressive fluid hydration as well as diarrhea with a urine anion gap that was less than 12.
Given the uncertainty of the patient's true goals of care in the setting of change in mental status and hospitalization, he was maintained as a full code throughout his hospital stay.
