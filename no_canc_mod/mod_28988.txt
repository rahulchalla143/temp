Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Father has thalassemia trait.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.

Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.
Trace left pleural effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system did not reveal any significant disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated left heart filling pressures (LVEDP of 24mmHg) in the setting of systemic arterial hypertension with an aortic blood pressure of 180/114mmHg.
Left ventriculography revealed a calculated LVEF of 56% with no regional wall motion abnormalities.
There was no mitral regurgitation.
Moderate diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is a small anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
[**2102-3-25**] TTE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis of the mid/distal inferolateral wall, though with preservation of the very distal segment.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-3-22**], the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new and c/w interim ischemia.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
No evidence of retroperitoneal mass suspicious for pheochromocytoma.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2102-3-24**] 10:15 AM FINDINGS: There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial hemorrhage, visible mass lesion, minor or major vascular territorial infarction.
This finding may merely represent a congenital variant.
However, if there is any clinical suspicion for the possibility of bilateral intracanalicular masses, which can be seen in the rather unusual condition of neurofibromatosis II, supplemental MR scanning with gadolinium enhancement of the internal auditory canals would be helpful.
There is slight prominence of the visualized posterior superior nasopharyngeal soft tissues.

Pt had recurrent chest pain in the setting of hypertensive episode, and was also found to have wall-motion abnormality on echo, thought secondary to coronary vasospasm.
Chest pain/NSTEMI: Pt initally presented with NSTEMI; cath showed no occlusions with a long LCx lesion that was only 60-70% stenosed.
She was chest pain free after admission, but then had recurrance of chest pain with EKG changes, severe hypertension, and WMA seen on echo.
Episodes of chest pain may have represented coronary vasospasm in the setting of this LCx lesion.
Chest pain resolved after starting a nitro drip, and pt was monitored in the CCU overnight.
Pt had been started on amlodipine and imdur on admission, however she developed a severe heacache (?
Pt was chest pain free while in the CCU, and had no arrhythmias on telemetry.
She was transferred back to the cardiology floor, and remained free of chest pain.
However, after recurrent episode of chest pain, cardiac enzymes again were elevated.
However, TTE several days later performed in the setting of chest pain showed focal severe hypokinesis of the mid/distal inferolateral wall.
Hypertension: Pt has long history of hypertension with a family history of early HTN.
She underwent an abdominal MRI/MRA which did not show pheochromocytoma or renal artery stenosis.
She had SBP's in 170's on admission, and had episode of chest pain in setting of SBP in 200's which required nitro drip.
Iron studies c/w iron deficiency anemia (low iron and ferritin, although unclear why [**Name (NI) 59658**] not increased).
Hypokalemia: Pt was hypokalemic on admission, possibly secondary to HCTZ.
Headache: Pt had prolonged headache shortly after admission.
Incidental findings: Pt was found to have a small thyroid nodule seen on chest CT (may need outpatient f/u with ultrasound) and auditory canal thickening seen on head CT (may need outpatient f/u with MRI).
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: NSTEMI coronary vasospasm iron deficiency anemia hypokalemia  Secondary diagnoses: HTN   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Chest pain free.
Discharge Instructions: Seek medical attention immediately if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fevers, chills, bleeding from cath site, headache, hearing loss, ringing in ears, or any other concerning symptoms.
You were found to have a 6-mm right sided thyroid nodule by chest CT, and it is recommended that your PCP evaluate this further with an ultrasound.
You were also found on head CT to have a bulbous appearance of both internal auditory canals, which may represent a congenital variant, although masses could not be ruled out.
