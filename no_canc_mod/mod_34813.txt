He was admitted pre-procedurally, for potential diuresis, and possible evacuation of a pocket hematoma.
The patient has been is USOH, with notable fatigue and decreased energy recently.
He had what was presumed to have several GI bleeds in the past few months, and received multiple transfusions.
In the last few weeks he has been sleeping more, with a decrease in his functional status.
He also has an ICD hematoma which has not been evacuated.
On review of systems, He denies any prior history of stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: (-) Diabetes (+) Dyslipidemia (+) Hypertension .
LCX had a 70% stenosis in the small OM1 and 50% stenosis in larger Om2.
No intervention done.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, No cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Dilated EXJ vein.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTA on L with decreased BS on R and dullness to percussion on the R. ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND.
Positive fluid wave and shifting dullness.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Studies: Chest X-ray INDICATION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and renal insufficiency.
There is a new large pacer pocket hematoma or infection with associated left anterior chest wall swelling.
The moderate right pleural effusion has dramatically increased and fluid is seen tracking up the incomplete right major fissure.
There is no left pleural effusion.
There is persistent right basilar atelectasis.
Persistent vascular congestion is present.
No pneumothorax is identified.
New pacer pocket hematoma vs. infection.
Dramatically increased moderate right pleural effusion.
Once again, the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava are markedly dilated, and the portal vein flow is forward, but pulsatile in nature consistent with right heart failure.
There is a very large volume of ascites as well as a moderate right pleural effusion.
The ascites appears to be increased in volume compared to the scan of [**2-8**].
The gallbladder and bile ducts are normal as is the liver parenchyma with no focal abnormalities seen.
The spleen is mildly enlarged as previously noted.
The pancreas shows no abnormality, but portions of the tail are obscured by bowel gas.
CONCLUSION: Findings are consistent with congestive heart failure and hepatic congestive hepatopathy.
There is a moderately large right pleural effusion and large volume ascites which have increased since the prior scan of [**2157-2-8**].
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD was heavily calcified; ulcerated 50% mid LAd; mid-distal LAD tortous with 60% before an aneurysm and 80% after at the origin of a small D4 with diffusely diseaseed distal LAD beyond; modest upper pole of high diagonal with origin tubular 60%; larger lower pole of high 1st diagonal with proximal ulcerated 60%; larger S1.
Modest long vertically oriented OM2 with origin 40% and mild luminal irregularities.
Atrial branch arises from the proximal AV groove Cx before OM1 with modest origin stenosis of the atrial branch.
20-25mmHg pulsus paradoxus.
In addition, during all R+LHC measurements, although the "PCW" waveform often looked reasonable, there was a small end-diastolic gradient between "PCW" and LV suggestingve of mitral stenosis.
Thus, the computed CO, CI and PVR are NOT likely to be entirely accurate and should be interpreted with caution.
Calcified aortic knob.
Two vessel coronary artery disease involving multiple branches, with slight progression in the CAD in the aneurysmal mid-distal LAD with suboptimal run-off distally.
Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with some fluctuations in baseline values.
Severe biventricular diastolic heart failure.
Slight improvement in PASP and mean PA with addition of O2 and milrinone, with apparent decrease in PVR due solely to apparent increase in CO, but interpretation of these are confounded by inablility to get the PWP into a good PCW position and by fluctuations in the patient's level of arousal (which determines actual VO2, which was assumed to be unchanged throughout, and the VO2 drives the PVR computation).
No evidence of right-to-left shunting.
Reinforce secondary preventative measures against CAD and diastolic heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 59 y/o patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with familial cardiomyopathy, afib, ASD closure as a child, AFIB w/complete heart block, s/p BiV ICD with recent Gen change c/b pocket hematoma.
Active Hospital Issues: # Chronic diastolic heart failure with R ventricular systolic failure and pulmonary HTN: The patient presented with large volume ascites, an elevated JVP and a worsening R sided pleural effusion.
He underwent a L/R heart catheterization which demonstrated elevated filling pressures in the presence of stable coronary artery disease.
His heart failure, and elevated pulmonary pressures were felt to be secondary to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
However, his potassium requirement decreased when he was transitioned to oral diuretics.
# HCM: The patient has a known familial HCM, and presented with an elevation in his weight (when compared to his dry weight), and a persistent right pleural effusion.
Per the consultation of [**Hospital1 1388**] heart failure specialist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], he felt that the patient's prior ASD and closure were not the long standing antecedent cause for the patient's acute on chronic congestive heart failure.
# Ascites:  Mr. [**Known lastname 80943**] presented with large volume ascites.
He did not have any positive ascites fluid cultures, and his blood cultures did not speciate any bacteria.
In addition, he had a RUQ US which demonstrated a congestive hepatopathy but no evidence of cardiac cirrohsis.
# Acute on Chronic KI: Patient's CR was elevated at 2.1 upon admission and fluctuated with diuresis.
It was hypothesized that the elevation in his CR was secondary to long-standing congestion due to a chronically increased LVEDP and RVEDP.
# Coagulopathy: His INR was elevated prior to discharge, and his coumadin dose was held.
He did not have recurrence of his ICD hematoma.
# Persistent Hypokalemia:  During the initial portion of his diuresis, Mr. [**Known lastname 80943**] required large volume repletion with IV potassium and oral potassium.
Chronic Issues: .
# CAD: His coronary disease was stable based upon his Left heart catheterization.
# ICD hematoma:  He had his pocket hematoma evacuated and he received 7 days of IV vancomycin as prophylaxis.
After the bandage was removed he had mild swelling over the pocket.
He also had some mild tenderness.
But he never had any erythema, fevers, or chills while he was hospitalized.
He was given oxycodone for pain with adequate analgesia.
