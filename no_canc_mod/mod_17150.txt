He had a laceration and hematoma over his right brow and an ecchymosis over the right forearm.
Head CT revealed a left sided cerebral hemorrhage (the full study was not completed there, apparently; it was aborted when the hemorrhage was seen and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]).
Per his family Mr. [**Known lastname **] had not recently been ill, and his wife did not know of any complaints of headache, visual changes, or difficulty with balance or coordination.
Review of systems:  No recent illness per his family.
Past Medical History: Meningioma resected in [**2169**] Sigmoid colon CA s/p resection in [**2177**] Glaucoma Hypertension Hard of hearing Nephrotic syndrome   Social History: Lives with his second wife, daughter-in-law (married to his son from the first marriage) has accompanied her to the ED.
Physical Exam: (off propofol x 30 minutes) T 100.2   HR 80  BP 112/77  RR 23  Pulse Ox 100% General appearance: Intubated 79 year old man in NAD HEENT:  hematoma over right eye, lac sewn up; c-spine collar in place.
+ clouding of cornea CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen: Soft, moderately distended Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Ecchymosis over right forearm.
Mental Status: No spontaneous eye opening, no eye opening to voice or sternal rub.
No response to nasal tickle, no spontaneous facial movement.
Large left temporal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma, with extensive surrounding edema causing mass effect, uncal herniation, and rightward shift of normally midline structures.
Dilatation of the contralateral lateral ventricles indicates compression of the third ventricle secondary to uncal herniation.
The large amount of edema surrounding the hemorrhage is more than would be expected for simple acute blood, and bleed from an underlying neoplasm is suspected.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
KUB: no evidence of bowel obstruction  CT c-spine: No fracture or alignment abnormality within the cervical spine.
MRI brain:  There is a large acute intracerebral hematoma identified in the left temporoparietal region extending to the occipital region with fluid-fluid level anteriorly.
There is mass effect on the left lateral ventricle which is compressed with midline shift and subfalcine herniation.
There is dilatation of the right lateral ventricle with evidence of periventricular edema, consequent to subfalcine herniation.
In addition, there is a left-sided uncal herniation seen with deformity of the brainstem.
No evidence of brainstem hemorrhage is identified.
There is surrounding edema seen to the hematoma.
Following gadolinium, no definite enhancement is identified in the region of hematoma or in the surrounding brain.
At the craniocervical junction, the tonsils are approximately 8 mm below the level of foramen magnum due to mild tonsillar herniation.
IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hematoma with fluid-fluid level in the left temporoparietal region with surrounding edema.
Subfalcine herniation from left to right with midline shift and left-sided uncal herniation with displacement of the brain stem without evidence of brainstem hemorrhage.
No evidence of abnormal enhancement to indicate an associated mass.
However, due to large size of hematoma, an underlying mask or an abnormality could not be completely excluded and followup study is recommended.
MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates somewhat tortuous intracranial arteries.
There is anterior displacement of the left middle cerebral artery which is secondary to the large hemorrhage seen in the left temporal region.
There is also medial displacement of the left posterior cerebral artery secondary to uncal herniation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of vascular occlusion.
Vascular displacement due to intracerebral hematoma as described above.
Slightly increased midline shift and signs of worsenign subfalcine and uncal herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old man found unresponsive at home this morning, with large left parieto-occipital hemorrhage, with 9 mm midline shift and impending uncal herniation.
On exam, patient had no eye opening to noxious stimuli.
The most likely etiology was amyloid angiopathy, although given the extensive edema an underlying mass was also possible.
Patient's labs were concerning for sepsis, although there was no clear source.
He was started on Vanc, ceftriaxone and flagyl for possible sepsis and urinanalyises were repeated due to contamination.
Chest x-ray was negative for an acute cardiopulmonary process.
KUB was negative for obvious obstruction or perforation.
Telemetry was continued and patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Insulins sliding scale and tylenol as needed to keep euglycemic and euthermic.
Protonix and pneumoboots for GI and DVT prophylaxis.
MRI brain was obtained did not show enhancing lesion but could not exclude underlying mass given the extent of the hemorrhage.
A repeat head CT the following morning showed worsening subfalcine and uncal herniation with increased associated edema.
