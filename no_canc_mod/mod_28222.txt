HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 82-year-old, with a 2-month history of epigastric pain with a known thoracoabdominal aneurysm of 11-cm status post rupture--she is now without complaints of pain of shortness of breath, who was admitted to the emergency room and then transferred to the vascular service for definitive care.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
GENERAL APPEARANCE: This is a [**Location 7972**] speaking female, oriented x3 in no acute distress.
Abdomen is soft, nontender with a palpable, pulsatile epigastric mass.
She underwent a CT scan which showed a large saccular aneurysm from the aortic root 5-cm through the celiac and renal arteries with a large superceliac thrombus with a contrast extravasation with multiple liver and kidney cysts.
The patient was evaluated by cardiology for perioperative risk assessment.
The stress portion of the P-MIBI was absent for EKG changes or symptoms.
The patient had a moderate reversible defect involving the left circumflex territory.
There was mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity and systolic function.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is markedly dilated.
The aortic valves are 3 or mildly thickened, but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
There is mild to moderate aortic regurgitation of 2+.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspids are mildly thickened.
There is moderate 2+ TR, and there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with significant pulmonic regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The patient proceeded on [**12-5**] and underwent a repair of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (descending thoracic aorta to renals) with a beveled anastomosis.
Postoperative day 1, there were no acute events.
Recommendations were to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30, increase her beta blockade, and repeat an EKG to see if there was resolution of her right bundle branch block.
Exam showed 1+ edema in the lower extremities.
The patient was begun on Percocet for analgesic control, incentive spirometry and pulmonary toiletry.
The patient was afebrile on postoperative day #5.
The patient did have a significant amount of pleural drainage from the chest tube site.
Chest site was without erythema.
They have been instructed to call his office if she develops fever greater than 101.5, develops shortness of breath, if she develops change in character in her pleural fluid drainage.
Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm--ruptured.
Blood loss anemia--transfused.
Positive P-MIBI for moderate lateral wall reversible     defect and an echo ejection fraction of 55%.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE:  Repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysm on [**2197-12-5**].
