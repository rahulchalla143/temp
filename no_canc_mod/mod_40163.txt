No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Transversely oriented left temporal bone fracture extending into the middle ear, with hemorrhage within the middle ear, mastoid, and external auditory canal, as well as into the temporomandibular joint and the base of the styloid process.
Nondisplaced left parietal and sphenoid bone fractures, extending into the left sphenoid sinus and disrupting the foramen ovale.
Stable small left temporal extraaxial, probably epidural hematoma with pneumocephalus.
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage along bilateral convexities, which appears more prominent since the prior CT.
Small bifrontal subdural hematomas.
Possible small right temporal hemorrhagic contusions, versus nodular subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Comminuted fracture of the left femoral neck with a small surrounding hematoma.
No other fractures identified.
No other acute post-traumatic injuries noted within the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Small rounded hypodense structure along the lesser curvature of the stomach measuring up to 18 mm.
It could represent a small gastric diverticulum or a hypoenhancing lymph node.
[**2123-7-24**] Left femur : Complete fracture of the femoral neck, without major displacement or laxation of the ruptured bone elements and with normal position of the femoral head in the acetabulum  [**2123-7-24**] CT Orbits : 1.
Oblique-transverse fracture through the temporal bone extending through the mastoid air cells, middle layer, inner ear, and posterior wall of the internal auditory canal.
While the ossicles appear grossly unremarkable, evaluation is limited secondary to hemorrhage within the middle ear.
The fracture line extends through the posterior aspect of the basal turn of the cochlea.
The fracture also approaches the labyrinthine canal of cranial nerve VII, and close clinical (including audiologic) correlation is recommended.
Minimally displaced complex fracture extending from the left parietal bone through the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the left sphenoid bone.
Subtle fracture of the lateral wall of the left sphenoid sinus with associated hemorrhage within the left sphenoid sinus, not significantly changed in appearance compared to the prior head CT. 4.
Hemorrhage within the left mastoid air cells and left external auditory canal.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, fully described on the accompanying head CT. 6.
Bilateral thickening of the temporal bones within the external auditory canals could be due to "surfer's ear."
No significant change in the overall extent of subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the cerebral convexities, over the ensuing roughly six hours.
No significant change in the thin left-sided extra-axial, likely epidural  hematoma, given the adjacent temporal bone fracture, overlying the left temporal lobe.
Unchanged subdural hemorrhage along the frontal convexities, bilaterally.
Possible minimal intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right temporal lobe, not significantly changed.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
Left temporal and parietal bone, and greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of sphenoid fractures, as fully described on the CT from earlier on [**7-24**], [**2122**].
No shift of normally midline structures or central herniation.
He was admitted to the Trauma SICU for frequent neuro checks along with pain control for his left hip fracture.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and complained of headache pain.
He was alert and oriented but was amnestic to the event and trouble with short term memory and perseveration.
He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2123-7-24**] and underwent ORIF of the left femoral neck fracture with DHS (see formal Op note for details).
He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled.
He gradually started a liquid diet and was advanced to regular without difficulty.
The Neurosurgeons recommended treating him prophylactically with Dilantin or Keppra and the Head Ct was repeated to assess the epidural hematoma which remained stable.
ENT was also consulted as he had a left temporal bone fracture extending to the middle ear.
He had some hearing loss in the left ear and had an audiogram done to assess conductive versus sensoral hearing loss.
The audiogram was done on [**2123-7-26**] and demonstrated conductive hearing loss in the left ear and his steroids were stopped.
His wife noted that the team of bicyclists noted that his head was slumped down just before he fell.
Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages 2.
Left temporal epidural hematoma 3.
Left parietal fracture to temporal bone/sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] 4.
Left temporal bone fracture to middle ear 5.
Comminuted left femoral neck fracture 6.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital after you fell off your bicycle with multiple injuries including diffuse bruising on both sides of your brain, a skull fracture along with a temporal bone fracture which extends to your middle ear and a broken hip requiring surgery.
* The bruising in your brain is slowly resolving but you will continue to have some cognitive deficits which will get better in time.
The Neurosurgeons would like you to continue taking Keppra to prevent any potential seizures which could happen during this early phase.
* You have a conductive hearing loss in the left ear which will need to be followed by the ENT doctors along with a repeat audiogram as you get better.
