The patient presented with a three-week history of dyspnea on exertion.
He noted shortness of breath with stairs and has also reported increasing orthopnea.
The patient questioned whether or not he had similar symptoms in the past when he had an upper respiratory tract infection when the patient self treated with antibiotics three days prior to presentation without relief of his symptoms.
He has no known cardiac disease.
During that time, he had an upper respiratory tract infection and reported being treated with antibiotics.
He also noted increased weight over the past month from approximately 230 pounds to 240 pounds.
He reports that originally his shortness of breath was on climbing three flights of stairs, but now he experiences shortness of breath walking in a hallway.
Patient denied chest pain or palpitations.
In the Emergency Room, the patient had a chest x-ray, which was consistent with new congestive heart failure.
Patient was given Lasix in the Emergency Room with some improvement in his shortness of breath.
Sarcoidosis diagnosed by skin biopsy in [**2160-5-1**].
No other known involvement for sarcoidosis.
Hypertriglyceridemia in [**2162**].
Status post lymph node resection in his neck in [**2160-11-1**], which was consistent with reactive lymph node tissue with noncaseating granulomas.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No tobacco, no alcohol, and no IV drug use.
Respiratory:  Crackles on the left third of the way up right at the base.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Chest x-ray revealed congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions, upper lobe volume loss consistent with adenopathy.
CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolus.
It did show bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left and ground-glass opacities throughout was also noted for cardiomegaly.
EKG was sinus tachycardia at 120, left anterior fascicular block, flat T waves laterally in V5 and V6 and poor R-wave progression.
Cardiac, new congestive heart failure:  Patient with new onset congestive heart failure of unclear etiology.
The patient had an echocardiogram on [**3-13**], which revealed an ejection fraction of [**10-16**]%, dilation of the atria and ventricles as well as global LV hypokinesis and 2+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac catheterization to assess for evidence of ischemia as an etiology for his congestive heart failure.
Cardiac catheterization on [**3-16**] showed no flow-limiting disease.
The exact etiology of his new congestive heart failure maybe idiopathic, however, the possibility of sarcoidosis is very real in this patient given his history of biopsy consistent with sarcoid.
The patient was followed by the CHF service in addition to this laboratory studies for possible future transplant were also pursued.
As an outpatient, the patient will follow up for gallium thallium scan for further assessment of possible sarcoid as the underlying etiology of his congestive heart failure.
He had a cardiac catheterization, which revealed no flow-limiting disease.
Rhythm:  Patient was admitted with sinus tachycardia likely due to significant volume overload and congestive heart failure.
He was monitored on telemetry and found to have evidence of second-degree heart block.
Hypertension:  Patient with slightly elevated blood pressures on his admission.
Respiratory:  The patient with dyspnea of cardiac etiology.
The ground-glass opacities on CT are likely due to his congestive heart failure.
They did not feel that the pulmonary findings were consistent with sarcoid, however, the diagnosis of sarcoid is still possible for cardiac etiology.
Although the patient was low probability for pulmonary embolus, the patient's D dimer was drawn in the Emergency Room and the patient was ruled out for pulmonary embolus.
Heme:  Patient was started on Coumadin for his low ejection fraction.
Congestive heart failure.
The patient will discuss referral for a sleep study to evaluate for possible obstructive-sleep apnea.
