INDICATION: 78-year-old man with esophageal dilatation of free air under diaphragms.
Evaluate for pneumothorax or esophageal injury.
Posterior mediastinal emphysema centered around the esophagus after attempted dilatation of esophageal stricture, highly suggestive of esophageal perforation.
No pneumothorax or free intra- abdominal air.
Right lower lobe consolidative process suspicious for pneumonia.
Associated small bilateral pleural effusions.
Calcified pleural plaques bilaterally suggestive of prior asbestos exposure.
Left lower lobe nodule.
Hypoattenuating lesions in the right kidney, most of which are too small to characterize.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Hypoenhancing lesion with peripheral contrast puddling in segment V of the liver most likely representing hemangioma.
Additional hypoenhancing lesion in segment VIII of the liver, incompletely characterized.
These lesions should be further assessed with ultrasound or MRI.
Multiple thoracic wedge compression fractures, stable compared to prior plain radiographs.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt returned to the ED s/p esophageal dilatation with chest pain and SOB.
CT showed evidence of esophageal perforation.
Pressors were weaned off and he extubated without difficulty.
On [**12-16**] he had R sided u/s guided R pleural drainage yielding 900 cc of fluid.
He also had respiratory difficulties on the floor which may been due to narcotic pain med administered which warranted a transfer to the CSRU.
On [**12-21**] the R pigtail was d/c'd and on [**12-23**] the L pigtail was d/c'd without complications.
