The pregnancy was complicated by diet-controlled diabetes mellitus.
No maternal fetal.
The delivery was by cesarean section under epidural anesthesia for a failed vacuum and presumed CPD.
At around five minutes of age, the stomach was suctioned for a large amount of bloody amniotic fluid.
The skin was without lesions.
Mild parieto-occipital caput, no evidence of fracture on physical examination.
The neck was soft and supple without tracks or sinuses.
No skeletal injuries.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  RESPIRATORY:  No issues.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The infant's blood glucose was monitored following delivery secondary to maternal history of diabetes mellitus.
The infant developed bloody stools in the first 24 hours of life and the formula was changed to Prosobee as the mother was unable to breast feed.
The patient continued to pass bloody stools with the onset of nonbilious emesis which prompted admission to the Intensive Care Nursery.
No pneumatosis.
With a history of the bloody amniotic fluid in the infant's stomach in the Delivery Room, the bloody stools were thought to be due to maternal blood versus milk protein intolerance.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  See above for bloody stools.
