History of Present Illness: Patient is a 75 y/o RHD woman who was the restrained driver in a single vehicle MVA - car vs. tree - who was transferred from [**Hospital6 3105**] with a R distal radius fracture and a R calcaneus fracture in addition to multiple bilateral rib fractures (R [**3-16**], L 1), sternal fracture with small anterior medistinal hemorrhage, L1 and L3 transvers process fractures, and a possible L lower sacral fracture.
The remainder of the work-up was remarkable for multiple bilateral rib fractures, sternal fracture with mediastinal hemorrhage, L1 and L3 transverse process fracture, R distal radius fracture, R calcaneus fracture, and a possible L minimally displaced sacral fracture.

Comminuted fracture of the calcaneus as described above, involving posterior subtalar joints, superior, dorsal and plantar surfaces of the calcaneus, calcaneocuboid joint and anterior process of talus.
Suspected fracture at the posterior margin of the talus.
No other acute discrete fracture is identified in the mid foot.
Old fracture deformity of the distal tibia and fibula with superimposed osteoarthritis, and old osteochondral lesion of the superomedial talar dome.
Chronic Achilles thickening.
Suspected fracture of plantar calcaneal enthesophyte, plantar fasciitis, age indeterminate.
[**2168-4-30**] Right wrist fracture: Distal radial fracture in near anatomic alignment.
Focal defect in the mid scaphoid waist is concerning for a scaphoid fracture.

Tricompartmental osteoarthritis of the right knee.
Communited calcaneal fracture is partially imaged  [**2168-4-30**] CT C spine : 1.
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Cervical spine CT demonstrates no evidence of fracture.
Degenerative change is seen with mild spinal canal narrowing at C6-7 level.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Her right wrist fracture was initially reduced in the Emergency Room with plans for operative repair when she was medically stable.
She was then admitted to the hospital for further management of her injuries.
Her accident was possibly caused by a syncopal episode therefore she needed a cardiac echo and carotid duplex scan to rule out any abnormalities.
Her Cardiac echo revealed a normal EF, no wall motion abnormalities and no significant valvular disease.
She was placed on telemetry and had no arrhythmias.
Her blood pressure was on the high side but after her pain was controlled and her routine antihypertensives were resumed she was in better control.
She remained free of any dizziness, palpitations or chest pain during her admission.
She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.. She maintained stable hemodynamics and her pain was well controlled.
her blood sugars were elevated but in better control after resuming her diabetic medications.

* Your rib fractures can be painful so make sure that you take enough pain medication to be comfortable.
* If you develop any fevers, shortness of breath or any other symptoms that concern you, please call your doctor or return to the Emergency Room.
