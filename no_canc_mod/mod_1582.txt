Admission Date:  [**2122-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-1-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-4-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Meperidine / Erythromycin Base / Oxycodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**] Chief Complaint: Fever, [**First Name3 (LF) **]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Central line and Swan Ganz catheter placement Chest tube placement   History of Present Illness: 69 year-old female with CAD s/p RCA stent x 2 (last one [**2121-12-26**] post IMI), CHF with EF 60%, PVD s/p aorto-bifem bypass, and s/p left brachial pseudoaneurysmal repair, transferred from [**Hospital3 3834**] with fever and hypotension, as well as troponin leak.
Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-12-26**] with sudden onset right-sided CP and SOB, and was found to have NSTEMI (ST depressions in lateral leads, peak troponin of 5.0), with mild CHF.
A cardiac catheterization revealed 95% RCA stenosis (in-stent re-stenosis).
On [**2122-1-8**], she presented to [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **] with non-exertional right-sided CP, along with SOB, which is her anginal equivalent.
JVP was elevated at 6cm, lungs with end expiratory wheezes.
An EKG revealed NSR with RBBB, no acute changes.
She was treated with aspirin, nebs for possible COPD flare, and started on heparin IV for possible unstable angina.
While in the hospital, she had a Myoview, showing an inferior filling defect.
On the night prior to admission to the [**Hospital1 18**], she became hypotensive with SBP to low 80's, temperature to 104, CK of 300 and CKMB 15.7, trop I 13.5.
Her BP did not improve with fluid resuscitation, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on neosynephrine and heparin IV for possible re-cath.
Further history revealed a sister with recent influenza and hospitalization.
Cardiac cath in [**2117**] with 80% proximal RCA lesion, 50-60% distal RCA lesion, 50% OM and a 40% distal LM/PLAD lesion.
Cardiac cath [**2118**]: RCA had an ostial 30-40% stenosis and mild 30-40% diffuse in-stent restenosis.
Hypothyroidism 4.
Diabetes mellitus type 2  Past Surgical History: 1.
Bilateral cataract surgery  Social History: She lives with her sister, no etOH.
No murmur or rub.
No clubbing, cyanosis.
No pedal edema.
[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V3-6, ST depressions in II (old).
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior, inferoseptal, and inferolateral akinesis with relative preservation of the lateral and anterior walls.. 3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Insufficent doppler studies performed of the aortic valve to determine the presence of stenosis or regurgitation.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen but studies limited.. 6.There is no pericardial effusion.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF 25-30%).
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral leaflets and supporting structures are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year-old female with CAD s/p RCA stent on [**2121-12-27**] for in-stent restenosis, CHF, PVD, who returned to [**Location **] on [**1-8**] with chest pain, initially ruled out, and who then developed fever to 104, hypotension and rise in troponin I, transiently on Neo drip, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
1) CAD: On arrival, an echo revealed an EF of 25%, and resting regional wall motion abnormalities with inferior, inferoseptal, and inferolateral akinesis with relative preservation of the lateral and anterior walls.
CK was 250, Troponin 1.22 (peak), EKG without ST elevations.
Her picture was felt most consistent with sepsis with demand-related ischemia rather than stent thrombosis, and the decision was taken not to proceed to cardiac catheterization.
Her most recent cath in [**Month (only) 404**] revealed single-vessel CAD which was stented.
A PA line was placed on admission, with initial numbers CVP 11, PA 43/16, SVR 620, CO/CI 7.1/3.76 felt most consistent with sepsis physiology, and MUST protocol was initiated, with fluid resuscitation.
ACE inhibitor held pending recovery of renal function, resumed on [**2122-1-21**] with improving renal function and titrated up.
2) CHF: On admission, an echo revealed a depressed EF with inferior, inferoseptal, and inferolateral akinesis.
She eventually developed pulmonary edema secondary to aggressive fluid resuscitation in the setting of likely sepsis.
Subsequent echocardiograms revealed poor EF approximately 20% (overestimated on [**2122-1-13**]) with global LV hypokinesis.
It is unclear whether her current cardiomyopathy can all be accounted for by ischemic cardiomyopathy.
She will need daily weights, with titration of Lasix to 40 mg PO QD if weight increases >3 lbs.
3) Pulmonary: On admission, a PA line was placed via the left subclavian vein, complicated by a tension pneumothorax requiring intubation and emergent chest tube placement.
Serial ABGs and labs revealed a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, with compensatory hyperventilation.
She was also started on a Prednisone taper for possible COPD exacerbation, to be continued as an out-patient.
4) ID: As mentionned above, her initial presentation was felt consistent with sepsis, and the MUST protocol was instituted.
The initial CXR revealed atelectasis but no definite consolidation.
Vancomycin and Flagyl were added on [**2122-1-11**] in the setting of ongoing fever and hypotension and she completed an empiric 7-day course of antibiotics, D/C'd on [**2122-1-16**].
Serial CXRs failed to reveal a definite consolidation, and it was felt that she may have had a viral pneumonia.
She defervesced around hospital day #6, and has been afebrile since.
Renal was consulted to address her renal failure and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.
The latter was felt to be likely secondary to her renal failure and also dilutional in the setting of large volume resuscitation.
Her renal failure was felt most likely secondary to ATN (although FeNA<1%), and renal function gradually recovered.
6) Heme: While in hospital, her WBC count was noted to be trending down (nadir 2.7), which was felt most likely secondary to myelosuppression in the setting of acute illness.
