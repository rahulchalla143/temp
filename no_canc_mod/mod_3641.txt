Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 956**] after ICD firing in the setting of VT from a coughing attack.
She had been started on amiodarone on discharge, however, this was discontinued in [**Month (only) 547**] secondary to tingling/twitching in her ears and a swollen throat.
She was last seen in the device clinic in [**Month (only) 205**], with no notable events on review.
She presented to [**Hospital3 **] with the initial complaint of an episode of palpitations that she says began on Wednesday night.
She denies any chest pain but does endorse some dizziness.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.

CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning/akinesis of the inferolateral wall, mild dyskinesis of the inferior wall and apex.
The remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size with extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
[**2149-12-4**] Stress Test: INTERPRETATION: This 77 yo woman s/p MI x3, CABG in [**2126**] and [**2132**], nonsustained MMVT and s/p ICD was referred to the lab for arrhythmia evaluation.
The exercise test was stopped at the patient's demand secondary to fatigue.
No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported by the patient during the procedure.
The subtle ST segment changes noted anteriorly are uninterpretable for ischemia in the presence of the RBBB.
No significant ST segment changes were noted inferiorly or in the lateral precordial leads.
The rhythm was sinus with rare isolated APBs.
No anginal symptoms or objective ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia.
Brief Hospital Course: 77-year-old female with a past history of HTN, HL, CAD s/p MI x 2 and CABG x 2, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 25 %), h/o NSVT s/p ICD (replaced 2 years ago), presenting from [**Hospital3 **] with NSVT.
Pt was on amiodarone in the past, which worked well for her initially but then discontinued its use in [**Month (only) 547**] due to adverse side effects.
Incidence of NSVT decreased, but the patient continued to have some PVCs and couplets.
An EP study was performed, which showed dense scar along the inferior wall from mid-wall to apex extending to the infero-lateral wall and distal septum.
The pt had multiple VT morphologies induced with cath manipulation and burst pacing.
Pt was continued on metoprolol, and then started on quinidine and mexilitine after the EP study, with good control of pt's symptoms and no more ectopy on telemetry.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # CAD: Pt's history of CAD includes 3 MIs and CABG x2 in [**2126**] and [**2132**].
# HTN: Documented history of this problem, for which she had been treated with hydralazine, isosorbide, and lopressor prior to admission.
However, she was slightly hypotensive in-house, and so her home hydralazine and isosorbide were held, but she was continued on her home lopressor.
Pt has adverse reaction to Ace Inhibitors, more specifically lisinopril as she develops severe mouth sores (so bad she stopped taking all of her medicines).
# Chronic systolic heart failure: Documented history of this problem.
# HLD: Documented history of this problem.
# Anxiety: Documented history of this problem.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Pt's isosorbide and hydralazine were held during the hospitalization due to low blood pressures.
9. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual as directed as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ventricular tachycardia Chronic systolic congestive heart failure coronary artery disease Depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with palpitations caused by ventricular tachycardia and needed to get intravenous medicine to control the arrhythmias.
START taking mexilitine and quinidine gluconate to control your ventricular tachycardia 2.
