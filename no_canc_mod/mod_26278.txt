There may be a small left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION: Possible small left effusion and left basilar mild atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo F with asthma, HTN, and recurrent episodes of diverticulitis who presented to OSH with tongue swelling and despite steroids, histaime blockade, and epi, requried intubation for airway protections gien worsening angioedema.
# Angioedema: DDx - allergic reaction to shellfish vs ACEi.
ACEi-associated angioedema can happen any time while on the medication.
However, timing is suspicious for allergic etiology.
Pt does appear to have atopic tendencies given asthma and multiple medication allergies.
She was intubated in the ED secondary to severe angioedema.
Morning after her admission, her tongue swelling resolved and she was extubated successfully, started on PO prednisone taper.
She will need follow-up with allergy to flesh out her reaction, but likely to ace inhibitors given that shellfish didn't give her trouble in past and that rxn happened the next morning after a dinner meal.
Also, if her angioedema was secondary to a mast-cell mediated anaphylactic reaction, we would have expected her to respond to epinephrine, which she did not.
# asthma: Pt did not require intubation for any intrinsic pulmonary process.
M-Vit  Oral 14. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
