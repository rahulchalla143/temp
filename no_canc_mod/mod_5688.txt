Admission Date:  [**2190-12-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-11-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim DS / Nafcillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None this hospitalization   History of Present Illness: 56M with CKD s/p renal transplant, renal artery stenosis s/p stent last year, DM1, recent admission for MSSA osteomyelitis and subsequent admission for rash and acute renal failure presumably from Nafcillin and is now presenting with shortness of breath and fever.
He has experienced shortness of breath, worst when laying down flat but also on exertion, dry cough, and fatigue which has been worse for the past week.
He also reports progressive pedal edema.
He was febrile at home with low grade fevers in the 100's.
Additionally, he had one episode of nausea and vomiting yesterday but denies any further episodes since, and denies abdominal pain or diarrhea and denies dysuria.
He denies sick contacts or recent travel.
He also had his Prednisone dose increased [**12-13**] from 5 mg daily to 20 mg daily for a possible COPD exacerbation and did notice improvement of his wheezing.
He was seen again on [**12-14**] for recurrence of dyspnea and was then told to increase his Lasix dose to 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] but instead increased it from 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] due to concerns of over-stressing his kidneys.
Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 26205**] for a diabetic foot ulcer and suspicion for osteomyelitis, and was treated with Nafcillin, Cipro, Flagyl.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] again on [**11-27**] for a rash believed to be a drug reaction to Nafcillin and acute renal failure secondary to hypovolemia from diarrhea secondary to antibiotics.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient had dyspnea on exertion but was able to be rapidly weaned to a nasal cannula and face mask with high flow oxygen.
He denied other symptoms at this time.

pending [**2190-12-20**] Urine culture - pending [**2190-12-20**] Blood culutre (x 2) - pending [**2190-12-21**] Rapid respiratory viral screen - pending [**2190-12-22**] Urine legionella - negative .
IMAGING: [**2190-12-16**] 2D-ECHO - Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Increased left ventricular filling pressure.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Moderate functional stenosis due to severe mitral annular calcification.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The absence of valvular vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not preclude their presence.
If clinical suspicion for endocarditis is high a transesophageal echocardiogram may be considered.
[**2190-12-16**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN - Suboptimal exam, but no bowel dilatation or free air.
[**2190-12-17**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Right upper lobe pneumonia continues to develop.
Pulmonary edema is clearing.
Bibasilar consolidation, unchanged since [**12-15**], could be more pneumonia or combination of edema and basal atelectasis.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
[**2190-12-21**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Moderately severe, but improving pulmonary edema, and stable small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Right upper lobe consolidation could be concurrent pneumonia or if the patient has mitral regurgitation, asymmetric edema.
Mild adenopathy is reactive either to infection or edema .
No DVT seen in the remainder of the veins of both legs .
[**2190-12-22**] UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US - negative for clot burden or DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 56M with a PMH significant for ESRD (s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2165**], [**2168**]; renal artery stenosis s/p stenting, baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8), DM1, CHF (with preserved EF), HTN, with recent admission for recurrent LLE cellulitis vs. MRSA osteomyelitis with subsequent admission for rash and acute renal failure (presumably from Nafcillin) who presented with shortness of breath and fevers.
# RECURRENT, LOW-GRADE FEVERS - The patient had concern for pneumonia given his dyspnea and CXR findings, and was initially covered broadly for HCAP given his immunosuppression and recent hospitalization, completing an 8-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Meropenem).
However, the etiology of his dyspnea was attributed partially to volume overload given his elevation in BNP and volume overload on clinical exam and imaging.
His WBC remained normalized and without evidence of leukocytosis.
A drug reaction was considered given some intermittent urticaria and extensor pruritic rash that resolved with benadryl around the times of the fevers (and given his prior reaction to Nafcillin).
A line infection was unlikely given only peripheral access.
He had no clinical evidence of occult intra-abdominal infection  or sinusitis.
He was not having loose stools to send C.diff toxins and he had no diabetic foot ulcers or open wounds.
Inflammatory causes were considered and his ESR and CRP were slightly elevated, but he had no evidence of joint swelling, erythema, gouty arthritis.
Fungal infections were considered and B-glucan and galactomannan were negative for invasive fungemia.
A chest CT was eventually performed prior to discharge and showed moderately severe, but improving pulmonary edema with RUL consolidation that could be his prior pneumonia - although he had completed his antibiotic course.
Upon discharge, he was having improved low grade temperatures below 100.0 and was feeling clinically well.
# DYSPNEA, SHORTNESS OF BREATH - The patient presented with dyspnea associated with fever that worsened with lying flat and with exertion x 1-week prior to admission; and has been on immunosuppression for his cadaveric renal transplant.
CXR showing new opacity in the RML.
He was initially admitted to the medical ICU given his poor clinical status and oxygen requirement and was treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia in the setting of his immune compromise with Vancomycin and Meropenem for 8-days.
A component of CHF exacerbation was also treated given his pulmonary effusion, oxygen requirement and BNP (29,000) on admission - with response to diuresis.
TTE this admission showing preserved LVEF > 55%, normal LV systolic function, moderate pulmonary HTN without vegetations; similar to prior study.
Of note, he had some evidence of demand ischemia with cardiac biomarkers (Troponin) peaking at 0.09.
He was also treated with pulse steroids given his diagnosis of COPD with significant prior smoking history.
We weaned his oxygen requirement and he was comfortable and satting well on room air, he completed 8-days of antibiotics, and was restarted on his Lasix 40 mg PO BID (his recent home dose).
We also continued his nebulizers as needed and encouraged incentive spirometry.
# INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS - The patient has a diagnosis of type I diabetes (last HbA1c = 6.9% on [**2190-4-27**]); no reported retinopathy; history of ESRD s/p renal transplant and on immunesuppression; no history of neuropathy.
History of left heel MRSA osteomyelitis and cellulitis.
Charcot changes of right foot with multiple fractures.
# END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, S/P TRANSPLANT - The patient is s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2165**], [**2168**]; renal artery stenosis s/p stenting, baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 per our records - all in the setting of ESRD from type 1 diabetes mellitus.
He also had evidence of a normocytic anemia of chronic disease related to his ESRD which was stable this admission.
# CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, PRESERVED EF ??????
As noted above, admitted with possible component of diastolic failure exacerbation, but primarily HCAP.
# HYPERTENSION ??????
Consider restarting ACEI therapy if creatinine improves, given cardiac history and kidney disease.
Healthcare-associated pnuemonia 2.
Acute on chronic exacerbation of diastolic heart failure 3.
Fever or unknown origin .
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2.
Hypertension 4.
