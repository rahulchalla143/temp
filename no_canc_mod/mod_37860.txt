PATHOLOGY: [**2193-4-26**] URINE CYTOLOGY: Urine, catheter:    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with history of Afib on coumadin, prosthetic mitral, aortic and tricuspid valves (rheumatic fever), who presented with 18 hours of hematuria and black stools, found to have an acute 8pt drop in hematocrit within the first day of admission.
She was found to have pseudomonal urine infection and ulcerations of bladder on cystoscopy which were cauterized.
She had recurrent bleeding of the bladder and overall required 15 units of pRBC as well as other products.
This required two stays in the intensive care unit and almost 2 weeks of continuous bladder irrigation (CBI).
Eventually, she was restarted on a heparin gtt with lower target PTT while bridging to warfarin for her mechanical heart valves.
She did however have residual bladder atony from the prolonged foley cath and was intermittently straight cathing herself for high post-void residuals.
# Hematuria complicated by hypovolemic shock requiring 15 units pRBCs but no pressors.
Cytoscopy on [**2193-4-30**] showed ulcers and excoriations in bladder that were cauterized; urine cytology showed no malignant cells, then atypical specimen following.
After the cystoscopy, she continued to have large volume bleeding and her systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70s with altered mental status due to hypovolemic shock.
She had some clots and then bright red blood in urine early on [**2193-5-8**] and CBI was restarted.
Even after her INR became therapeutic she maintained non- bloody urine without clots.
# Bladder atony: After the foley catheter was removed, she was having high post-void residuals.
They were offered a [**Hospital1 1501**] for a time period until her atony improves and they become comfortable with cathing her.
# Melena - patient reported black tarry stools for several days prior to admission.
She had several non-melanotic stools during the hospitalization.
# Bioprosthetic/mechanical valves: Patient has 3 non-native heart valves due to history of rheumatic heart disease--2 metallic and one bioprosthetic valve, was on coumadin at home.
The risk of stroke is a concern with her metallic valves, but patient has also experienced 2 episodes of life-threatening bleeding during this admission.
Balancing risks and benefits, heparin was held from [**5-3**] to [**5-6**] in the setting of bladder bleeding which allowed time for clot organization in the bladder.
# Urinary tract infection (UTI) - She had a positive urinalysis (leuks, nitrites) on admission and culture grew Pseudomonas sp.
Because she had high post-void residuals after foley was removed (see above), urology recommended checking another urinalysis which looked improved from prior.
Had episode of afib with rapid ventricular response in ICU with HR 160s so patient was placed on diltiazem gtt for rate control.
Metoprolol was restarted once hematuria was stable and she did not have any rapid rates.
# Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia likely from receiving 16 units PRBCs with only 1 bag of platelets.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please complete her course of PO linezolid 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] for VRE urine culture - Please monitor INR very closely because elevated levels will likely predispose to recurrent hematuria.
Disp:*30 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0* 9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation .
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 10. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*18 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Male First Name (un) **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Hematuria Urinary Tract Infection hypovolemia from blood loss  SECONDARY: Rheumatic Heart Disease with mechanical valve replacement   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
While in the hospital we found that you had a urinary tract infection that was likely the initial precipitant of the bleeding.
Please make the following changes to your medications: - START senna and colace daily - START milk of magnesia 30 mL daily as needed for constipation - STOP aspirin - START linezolid 600 mg twice a day until [**2193-5-30**] - CHANGE your warfarin (coumadin) to 7.5 mg 5x per week (Mo, Wed, Fri, Sat, Sun) and 10 mg 2x per week (Tues, Thurs).
