Admission Date:  [**2133-3-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2133-4-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-5-28**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CARDTHOR SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 42 year old woman with a history of multiple medical problems starting with the following: 1.
Congenital hepatic fibrosis.
Hepatitis C with demonstrated liver lesions.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
History of bilateral deep venous thromboses and status post placement of an IVC filter.
History of Streptococcal infection of a dialysis catheter.
History of aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation.
History of intraperitoneal bleed.
History of Klebsiella sepsis in [**2132-1-11**].
The patient had multiple medical admissions over the year; the most recent one of note was for increasing shortness of breath in [**2132-12-11**], for which she saw Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1356**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient was admitted on the 13th for a work-up of her aortic murmur and her known four plus aortic insufficiency and three plus mitral insufficiency.
Her exercise tolerance test had shown no perfusion defects and an ejection fraction of 72%.
Also of note was the notation that the patient's glomerulonephritis was probably status post a Streptococcal infection that ultimately results in end-stage renal disease and hemodialysis.
She then developed a line infection that gave her the endocarditis and, hence, the increasing murmurs and insufficiency of her heart valves.
Her carotids had no bruits.
She had no jugular venous distention.
She did have both systolic and diastolic murmurs.
Her abdomen was soft and nontender with good bowel sounds.
She had no extremity edema and had bilateral distal pulses.
Prior work-up had also shown an echocardiogram in [**2132-12-11**], which showed mild left atrial enlargement, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and a normal ejection fraction.
On [**2133-3-18**], she had a CT scan of the chest which showed stable tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities and the right apex was consistent with bronchiolitis.
She did also, as noted in Past History, have a history of hepatic encephalopathy that had resolved.
She also had a prior history of infection with Clostridium difficile.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac catheterization was done which showed normal coronary arteries, aortic insufficiency, mitral regurgitation.
The patient had hemodialysis one day preoperatively while also on the Cardiology Service and was followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**], the Renal attending, for monitoring of her renal status.
She did have a left arm AV fistula in place and she was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery for her valve replacement.
Her murmurs are radiated to bilateral neck, Grade III/VI both systolic and diastolic.
On[**Last Name (STitle) 32377**]5th, she underwent double valve replacement with a 19 CarboMedics mechanical aortic valve and a [**Street Address(2) 11599**].
She was also treated perioperatively with Linezolid for her allergies and intolerance of Vancomycin and penicillin.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], there was concern with increased chest tube bleeding and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] mobilized the Operating Room team to bring her back to explore her mediastinum to rule out any sources of bleeding.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which did not show an effusion and the patient's bleeding decreased; the patient was returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
The patient did, over the course of the first day, have an increased PR interval and went into atrial fibrillation.
She did pick up some volume and then became a little more lethargic over the next couple of days.
The patient began to require a little bit of increased amount of pressor support other than the Neo that the patient had come up on.
The patient's lactate rose over the next couple of days to 7.5 and the patient started to have respiratory symptoms with increased dyspnea as well as continuing persistent hypotension.
Pressor requirements were such that she was now on Neo-Synephrine at 5, Dopamine at 5, and she continued to be V-paced.
She continued to have increased work of breathing and was reintubated.
A bedside echocardiogram showed increasing pleural effusions with tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient had a pericardiocentesis done by Cardiology which drained 250 cc of fluid.
The patient continued to have a dropped SER with an increasing cardiac output and cardiac index of approximately 4 with a growing septic picture.
Pericardiocentesis fluids were also sent for culture.
All of these volume management and hemodialysis issues continued to be followed on a daily and sometimes twice daily basis by the Renal Service.
Also of note on that day was increasing right upper extremity edema.
The patient's Levophed requirement also increased and was now at 0.5.
The patient also had multiple episodes of epistaxis bleeding also from around the NG tube.
On postoperative day 13, the patient had an ultrasound of the belly which showed ascites in bilateral lower quadrants.
All fluids had come back as E. coli; that included pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, cultures from urine.
Bile fluid proved to have Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus.
The patient continued to look more grave and increasingly septic as the antibiotic regimen was shifted again in an attempt to bring her sepsis under control.
She did develop some metabolic alkalosis which was addressed by the Renal Team by changing her CVVHD fluid to normal saline from the bicarbonate included solution that they had been using.
She was receiving maximal pressure support with aggressive antibiotic therapy and control of her renal status and volume management by the Renal Service.
The patient continued to be followed very closely by all services, including the GI Service, General Surgery, Renal, and daily consultations by the Infectious Disease service for management of her sepsis and multiple antibiotic therapy.
Her lactate was 7.8 and her liver failure was well documented by enzymes and coagulopathy.
The patient continued to spiral and with a very poor prognosis.
On postoperative day 22, she had increasing metabolic acidosis, was again dialyzed.
She required platelets and fresh frozen plasma and heart disease increasingly worse oxygenation.
She was passing clotted blood and frank blood from her NG tube and had a systemic anasarca picture.
On[**Last Name (STitle) 14810**]perative day 23, the patient was clearly dusky, not oxygenating well and her sepsis continued.
Status post Septicemia with Escherichia coli and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
End-stage renal disease with hemodialysis.
Congenital hepatic fibrosis.
Status post Streptococcal infection of dialysis catheter.
Status post Klebsiella sepsis in [**2133-1-10**].
