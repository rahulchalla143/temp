This pregnancy was a spontaneous, monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy.
Mom presented in spontaneous labor, no maternal fever, rupture of membranes less than 24 hours.
No retractions.
Abdomen:  Soft and nondistended.
Left testes with a small hydrocele.
No cyanosis or edema.
No Ortolani or Barlow's sign present.
The patient remained on room air for the remainder of his hospital course without evidence of significant respiratory insufficiency.
The patient did not exhibit any apnea of prematurity through his hospital course, but did have numerous episodes of desaturation and heart rate changes associated with feeding discoordination.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient remained cardiovascularly stable throughout admission, without evidence of hypotension or conce rns for a patent ductus arteriosus.
A persistent systolic ejection murmur was noted to develop over course of hospitilization.
Cardiology consultation was obtained, and assessed the murmur as most likely consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
The patient did require substantial gavage feeds early in life, with relativel y slow maturation of feeding skills.
As mentioned above, the infant did demostrate evidence of feeding discoordination with multiple episodes of desaturation and heart rate changes with feeds during hospitalization, that gradually resolved with growth and maturity.
HEMATOLOGY:  Initial complete blood count at birth revealed a mild leukopenia as well as a significant thrombocytopenia.
Due to the patient's clinically stable course, a complete blood count was followed serially throughout the hospital course with a gradual resolution of the leukopenia as well as thrombocytopenia.
The infant had no further infectious disease issues during hospitalization.
GI: Patient exhibited mild physiologic hyperbilirubinemia not requiring phototherapy, with peak bilirubin of 7.9/0.3.
Sepsis evaluation, resolved.
