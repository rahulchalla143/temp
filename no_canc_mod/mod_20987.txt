Does have palpitations also.
He notes severe L>R LE pain when walking > 5minutes.
Had coronary cath [**11/2183**] which revealed LCx 50% with no intervention.
PVD:  S/P stenting L common iliac x 2 in [**1-23**] c/b retroperitoneal hemorrhage and RLE [**2192-9-27**] (6 x 29mm) 3.
SVT:  Had holter in past that showed lots of APB's, but no SVT or VT. 6.
No longer diabetic.
Dyslipidemia   Social History: Married, works as a home and building inspector.
Physical Exam: 98.7    50    140/67    14    98%RA Gen: NAD, A&O X 3 Heent: EOMI, PERRL, MMM Neck: No JVD Heart: RRR no mrg.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system with single-vessel coronary disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LCx was occluded in the distal portion at the take-off of the OM2 branch and filled via left-left collaterals.
The RCA had mild luminal irregularities but no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures (LVEDP 16 mmHg).
There was a resting gradient across the LVOT of 20-25 mmHg.
Post-PVC, the gradient increased to 115 mmHg with associated decrease in arterial pressure (Braunwald-Brockenbrough sign).
ECHO ([**6-10**])ECHO:  There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size  andexcellent systolic function (LVEF>75%).
There is mild aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.
Following injection of alcohol 1ml into the first septal, there was prominent enhancement of the basal septum and a reduction in the LVOT gradient (on 10 mcg/kg/min) to 36mmHg.
Minimal mitral regurgitation was present.
Valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] and mild aortic regurgitation persist.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 y/o male with HOCM, severe PVD and kidney/pancreatic transplant admitted for elective ethanol septal ablation.
Amio was dicontinued and the patient had no more ventricular dyssrhythmias.
CAD:  Found to have a TO distal LCx and OM1.
PVD:  No limb-threatening vascular insufficiency while in huose.
He does suffer from severe L >R claudication and will return to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-21**] weeks for staggerred iliac PCI's.
If you have chest pain lasting longer than 15 minutes, please go to nearest emergency room for immediate evaluation.
If you have these symptoms, call your doctor:  - palpitations - dizziness - visual change - chest pain - shortness of breath  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11250**], your cardiologist, on discharge.
