She was in her usual state of health until 2 days ago when she noticed that her R leg was painful and swollen, she took 6 Advil for pain relief which did not help.
Yesterday, she began to notice swelling and pain in her L leg.
No recent trauma in the area, no open cuts or wounds preceding swelling.
Of note, pt has chronic venous stasis changes with erythema on R leg.
Also has large ulcers in inguinal areas L>R (6cm ulcer with pus and drainage in L inguinal area, 1cm ulcer in R), she does dressing changes for these daily at home using Silvedene.
Pt says she was tested for HIV since stopping drugs and has been negative, HCV infection is "inactive" per her, she was never treated for this.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Bioprosthetic valve in aortic p[osition.
RV mass in the subvalvular apparatus is still visible 4.
No other change   Brief Hospital Course: Pt is 46 yo F with hx of IVDU, HCV, hx of cellulitis and osteomyelitis who p/w chronic non-healing ulcers [**3-1**] heroin use b/l and fever, found to have MSSA bacteremia and aortic valve endocarditis.
Though pt reports not having used heroin in the past 6 months, ulcers have not healed despite dressing changes at home.
Of note, pt has history of MSSA infections in the past (abscesses, bacteremia, and R sided endocarditis) for which she completed nafcillin courses.
Pt also had history of thoracic osteomyelitis in [**2144**] treated at [**Hospital1 2025**], though this was considered as possible source of bacteremia on this admission, it seems less likely given no clinical symptoms of back pain and more likely source of ulcers.
Pt refused MRI imaging, but should consider outpatient open MRI if does not continue to have improvement.
As described below, pt was found to have aortic valve vegetation and infective endocarditis with no abscess seen on TEE.
# Endocarditis - in setting of MSSA bacteremia, pt was found to have 1.4cm vegetation on aortic valve, new since echo in [**3-9**], with moderate aortic insufficiency.
Cardiology and CT surgery were consulted and did not recommend acute surgical intervention given bacteremia and no decompensated heart function.
Daily ECGs did not show any abnormalities, pt had hypotension to SBP 100 throughout most of hospital stay and one episode of fever to 100.5 a week into therapy; given this, a TEE was done to evaluate for cardiac abscess and was negative for this.
-Patient was transferred into MICU after code was called on floors for hypoxic respiratory failure.
This respiratory failure was quickly reversed with diuresis and NIMV, and was thought to be [**3-1**] severe aortic valve insufficiency in the setting of patient anxiety.
Similar episodes occurred intermittently in the ICU with any mild increase in SVR, so patient was kept with sedative/opiate regimen to stave off anxiety.
# Inguinal ulcers - [**3-1**] long-standing heroin use though pt reports no use for past 6 months.
Wound care and plastic surgery were consulted, plastic surgery did not recommend surgical debriding, pt had wet-to-dry dressing changes three times a day which required 1mg IV dilaudid for pain control beforehand.
Pt had bilateral venous stasis changes and 1+ edema below knees, in addition to leg elevation and betamethasone cream, she was diuresed with lasix and had decrease in edema and pain in legs.
# Acute renal insufficiency - likely pre-renal given poor PO intake recently and infection.
Cr improved to 1.3 today, FeNa 2.5% and FeUrea 52% both of which suggest resolution of pre-renal state - encourage PO intake - continue to trend Cr .
# Hypotension - now improved, SBP 110s-120s.
Given aortic valve vegetation, will maintain high suspicion for valve dysfunction contributing to hypotension.
# Anemia - chronic, HCT baseline 26-27, [**Month/Day (2) **] studies in [**2145**] revealed likely etiology as anemia of chronic inflammation.
[**Year (4 digits) **] panel indicates likely ACI, no evidence for hemolysis.
# Anxiety - continue home 1mg TID ativan .
# HCV - "inactive", never treated for this.
Pt had liver biopsy in [**6-6**] which showed fibrosis with no clear etiology for hepatomegaly.
Recent poor appetite and weight loss is concerning for malignancy, though AFP not elevated.
- outpt work-up for ?malignancy - LFTs stable  # IVDU - pt reports being clean for 6 months - social work consult MICU Course The patient is a 46 yo F with hx of IVDU complicated by MSSA verebral osteo [**2143**], and prior history of endocarditis [**2145**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], h/o MRSA/pseudomonal hip wound infection, HCV, granulomatous disease of GI tract, chronic inguinal ulcers, and anxiety with MSSA endocarditis who was transferred to the MICU for hypercarpic respiratory failure and code blue after being briefly unresponsive.
The differential for her respiratory failure was medication related especially opioid use causing respiratory depression.
Although pt with high tolerance and has been stable on dilaudid dosing and no recent increase.
The patient does have a history of drug abuse and could have had an alternate source of drugs or been hording her medications.
Pt also could have fallen because of a seizure with head injury leading to bleed or embolic/hemorrhagic stroke given endocarditis, but pt awake and interactive making major CNS process unlikely.
Pt does not have a history of COPD or other history of bronchospasm.
CXR did not show clear evidence of acute pathology.
Pt had stat ECHO performed at bedside by cardiology  ID consulted and recommended changing to vancomycin and meropenem given concern for sepsis upon initial presentation to ICU, which was later switched back to Nafcillin given stable BP's and clinical status, as this provides better coverage of her MSSA bacteremia.Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures .
ECG Changes: Pt with inverted t-waves in the setting of her severe acidosis and tachycardia.
Per cardiology, will not pursue anticoagulation for concern of ACS , according to ECHO report patient most likely experienced coronary artery embolization from her endocarditis .
S/p Fall: Pt found down for undetermined time.
# Inguinal ulcers - [**3-1**] long-standing heroin use.
No evidence of infection and was being followed by plastics.
# HCV - Never underwent treatment.
Pt had liver biopsy in [**6-6**] which showed fibrosis with no clear etiology for hepatomegaly.
# IVDU - pt reports being clean for 6-8 months per prior notes .Social work following .
UA also positive; may have thrown septic emboli to kidneys.
Eosinophil smear showed..... .
# Chronic Pain?????
However, given respiratory failure after receiving dilaudid and ativan, will be conservative in dosing, ordered Lorazepam 1 mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN anxiety , HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 0.5-1 mg IV Q3H:PRN pain/agitation .
The patient remained intubated on POD 1 as she had no cuff leak and had been intubated multiple times during this admission, and it was decided to manage her conservatively.
Acute pain service was consulted, as she has a h/o IVDA and refused MS Contin or Oxycontin.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 5, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
2. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
4. lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
8. diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.
9. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezes.
10. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: MSSA bacteremia Infective endocarditis, s/p AVR PMH: IVDA -heroin(says clean 6months).
HepC, ascites,T9 osteo w/paraspinal abscess [**2143**],hepatosplenomegaly   Discharge Condition: Alert and oriented x3 nonfocal Ambulating, gait steady Sternal pain managed with oral analgesics Sternal Incision - healing well, no erythema or drainage Edema- 1+ LEs   Discharge Instructions: Medical Service: It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**].
You were admitted with fevers and leg pain.
We found a bacteria growing in your blood called MSSA (which you have had in the past) and we started you on appropriate antibiotics for this.
We did an echocardiogram of your heart which showed that the bacteria had spread to a valve in your heart.
The most likely source for your infection are the ulcers on your legs.
