Admission Date:  [**2175-6-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2175-7-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2120-1-16**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old woman with the past medical history of schizoaffective disease, atypical Parkinsonism, most likely secondary to antipsychotic medications, hypothyroidism, lung nodule, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, torticollis and urinary retention.
She presented to the ED from her [**Hospital3 12272**], where she was reported to be confused and short of breath.
She was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure on the 12th.
She had a sputum culture, which showed Staphylococcus aureus Methicillin sensitive and sensitive to Levaquin in her sputum.
The patient has had multiple admission to [**Hospital6 2121**], [**9-/2174**], [**2175-1-13**], for failure to thrive, multiple urinary tract infections.
The patient had a suprapubic catheter placed and had another urinary tract infection two weeks ago.
Atypical Parkinsonism.
I spoke to the patient's outside neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 98503**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], who said that the patient had atypical features of Parkinsonism, most likely secondary to neuroleptic medications, that the patient had received for treatment of her schizoaffective disease.
Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) 98503**] reported that the patient had been tried on a number of antiParkinsonism medicines with no resolution of her Parkinsonism or torticollis.
She had been tried on Botox injections with no success.
He suggested Ativan and/or Benadryl for relief of her discomfort and muscular pain, but suggesting that due to the longstanding nature of the torticollis for approximately three years, that the vertebra most likely have been permanently damaged by the torticollis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Urinary retention status post suprapubic catheter.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had said that the patient had neurogenic-like bladder and that she was unable to straight catheterize herself due to her movement disorder and the decision was between a Foley catheter and a suprapubic catheter and the suprapubic catheter would be more comfortable for the patient and less of an infection risk.
The patient had lung examination clear to auscultation, bilaterally regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
EXTREMITIES:  Mild 1+ edema to the ankles.
Peripheral pulses intact.
The patient had cogwheel rigidity and right torticollis.
The patient had a head CAT scan on admission, which showed no acute intracranial pathology.
The patient had a chest x-ray on [**6-27**], showing no pneumonia, no CHF, increased interstitial markings, right middle and lower lobes.
The patient had coagulase positive, Staphylococcus aureus in sputum, sensitive to Levaquin and oxacillin.
The gram stain from that culture showed greater than 25 PMNs, 4+ Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, which were the Staphylococcus aureus and 2+ Gram-negative rods.
The patient had elevated CKs to 475 and 585 with negative troponins and negative MBs both times.
This examination showed no evidence of Aspergillosis or AVPA.
There was a 1 cm left apical nodule, nonspecific apical and right middle lobe scarring.
The patient had bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis, and mild emphysema.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presented to the ED with acute respiratory distress.
The patient was found to have gram-negative rod UTI and Staphylococcus positive sputum.
The patient had both the Staphylococcus aureus and urinary bacteria be covered by Levaquin.
The Aspergillosis was most likely a colonizing organism, discovered on routine sputum examination and has no pathological significance.
for sleep and history of psychosis in the past.
for torticollis muscle rigidity.
The patient has a swallowing study on the [**6-30**], which was not positive for aspiration, however, it did show that the patient had quick transition from oropharynx to esophagus and the recommendations were to chop her solids and to give her medications in applesauce and to have the patient eat all liquids and solids in an upright position.
