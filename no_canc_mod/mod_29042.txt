Admission Date:  [**2112-2-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-3-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-5-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Erythromycin / Penicillins / Cephalosporins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: dizziness, nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: External ventricular drain placed [**2-21**], removed [**3-1**]   History of Present Illness: 31 year old right handed previously healthy female who developed pain down the back of the left side of her neck and across her shoulders one week ago, without any known history of trauma.
She does have two young children and thought the pain was related to lifting them or sleep position.
Today in the late morning she developed a headache at the vertex and right side of her head with accompanying photophobia and phonophobia.
She took two Advil, but when she was in the midst of feeding her daughter lunch at 2 pm the pain suddenly became very severe, she felt "insanely dizzy" and could see the room spinning, and fell out of her chair (it felt as though a force pulled her to the ground).
She felt generalizedly weak but did not notice any weakness, numbness, or paresthesias of her arms or legs.
There an MRI/MRA revealed a left vertebral artery dissection with left PICA infarct, and she was transferred to [**Hospital3 **].
Her headache has improved to a generalized dull ache.
She denies diplopia, dysarthria, tinnitus, or dysphagia surrounding this episode.
Preceding this incident she had been generally well, although the previous week she had an upper respiratory infection (as did her children).
She took robitussin DM until 3 days ago, but has taken no decongestants.
There was no known history of trauma or neck manipulation.
She has had no chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath.
She has a remote history of migraine as an adolescent, but hasn't had a migraine in years.
There is no known family history of stroke at a young age, although her father has had several small strokes (but they are not in touch and she doesn't know the details).
She had a Head CT that revealed a bandlike hypodensity in the left cerebellum, and subsequent MRI/MRA revealed the aforementioned vertebral dissection and infarct.
Otherwise no fever, weight loss, diarrhea, rash, joint pain or swelling.
She knows her father had several small strokes but is not aware of the details.
She has 7 siblings and as far as she knows no one else has had stroke or migraine.
Physical Exam: T 96.6 ax   HR 71-72  RR 16  BP 126/74  Pulse Ox 99% RA General appearance: 31 yo female, appears pale, lying very still in bed with head in midline, but in NAD Heart: regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No carotid or vertebral bruits heard.
Abdomen: soft, nontender Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, speech fluent, intact registration, naming, repetition, normal attention, good recall for recent and remote events, no left-right confusion, no apraxia.
There is no ptosis.
Extraocular movements are full, with 2-3 beats of horizontal nystagmus in all gaze directions, but persistent horizontal nystagmus with left gaze.
No diplopia per se, but visual image is blurry in proportion to degree of nystagmus.
There is no tremor and no adventitious movements.
There is a very mild drift of the left arm with the eyes closed.
There is some mild dysmetria when touching her nose with eyes closed, bilaterally.
MRA shows diminutive left intracranial vertebral artery, but without the source images it is difficult to say if this portion of the vessel is merely hypoplastic.
In any case, there is a subacute infarct of the left inferomedial cerebellum, in the distribution of the left PICA.
There is FLAIR hyperintensity as well as restricted diffusion in this area.
* * * [**2112-2-20**] CT HEAD No hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified.
There is hypodensity in the left cerebellar hemisphere corresponding to patient's known infarct in that region.
There is sinus mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus with an air fluid level.
Subacute infarction in left cerebellum.
No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
Right ventricular cavity size and free wall motion are normal.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified.
If the clinical suspicion for a paradoxical embolism is high, a TEE with saline contrast at rest and with maneuvers is suggested.
* * * [**2112-3-4**] CT HEAD FINDINGS: There has been resorption of some of the blood products along the right frontal lobe catheter track.
There is mild persistent edema.
No new hemorrhage is evident.
IMPRESSION:  No hydrocephalus.
Resolving right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 31 year old female with sudden severe headache accompanied by nausea/vomiting/vertigo, nystagmus worst with left gaze on exam, and imaging revealing left vertebral artery dissection with left PICA infarct.
- EKG, r/o MI - Send ESR, [**Doctor First Name **], CRP, urine and serum tox, HgbA1C, lipids - T/C further hypercoag workup as indicated - RISS, Pantoprazole, pneumoboots  * * *  Brief Hospital Course:  * Neuro:     Ms. [**Known lastname 3501**] was maintained on heparin through most of her admisson.
On the first day of admission Ms. [**Known lastname 3501**] developed a more severe headache.
Follow-up CT demonstrated a small hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe along the tract where the drain was located.
Heparin was discontinued prior to drain removal and due to the small hemorrhage, it was not restarted.
CT on [**3-4**] did not reveal any hydrocephalus or extension of hemorrhage.
In terms of her symptoms, after the first couple days her vertigo and nausea resolved completely.
During the course of the admission her headache gradually improved, so that by the time of discharge she had a low-grade daily headache with some mild left neck pain, that was stable over several days.
She initially had horizontal nystagmus and dysmetria with left finger to nose, but this resolved completely by the time of discharge, and her only deficit was some hypermetria with left arm mirroring movements.
Echocardiogram revealed no evidence of clot.
