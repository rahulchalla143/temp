All visualized peripancreatic collections appear slightly smaller.
New air bubbles within multiple collections.
Correlate with history of marsupialization or attempts at drainage in the interval since [**2198-4-10**].
Superimposed infection in the collections cannot be excluded given the new air bubbles, although the collections are infected, they would not expect to get smaller.
No evidence of worsening biliary dilatation.
Cholelithiasis and Phrygian cap in gallbladder.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased.
Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.
Atelectasis at the lung bases is slightly more severe today.
No pneumothorax.
Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in their respective positions.
Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (A): Acute and chronic cholecystitis.
REPEAT, (REQUEST BY RADIOLOGIST)  [**2198-5-5**] 6:47 PM FINDINGS: X-ray of the three surgical drains revealed no evidence of any contrast which is radiopaque within these drains.
Three surgical drains in situ with some high attenuation in the region of the lesser sac which may represent fistulization from the small bowel into this residual collection.
Loculated fluid under the anterior abdominal wall measuring 16 cm.
Renal cysts.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old man with CAD s/p CABD and ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 25% who was recently admitted for gallstone pancreatitis, now re-admitted from rehab for fevers.
On last admission, he was febrile without an identified infectious source and was thought to be from inflammatory response to pancreatitis and peri-pancreatic fluid.
Currently with leukocytosis and left shift although no localizing signs of infection.
The differential at this time includes (infected) pancreatic pseudocyst, necrotizing pancreatitis and an obstructed bile duct stent.
-- appreciate GI following -- keep NPO for now until CT scan and labs return -- CT scan of abdomen with oral and IV contrast -- culture blood and urine -- CXR to r/o PNA .
# CAD: currenty stable without chest pain.
# CHF: currently euvolemic, and stable.
# Aflutter: currently apaced -- continue to hold coumadin in case he needs surgery -- continue carvedilol .
# ANEMIA: iron studies from last admission suggest iron deficiency and chronic disease -- continue iron supplements -- continue to monitor hct .
# PPX: -- ambulating -- protonix .
# DISPO: pending .

His is now having drainage around all his drains and g/j tube with mild skin irritation.
