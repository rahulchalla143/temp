Prenatal course was remarkable for a spontaneous twin gestation in an insulin requiring gestational diabetic mother who suffered from intermittent maternal bigeminy.
Mother was admitted to [**Hospital3 3765**] five days prior to delivery with preterm labor.
However, labor progressed and she delivered vaginally with spontaneous rupture of membranes two hours prior to delivery.
Initial physical examination notable for a plethoric infant in moderate respiratory distress with ruddy color, soft anterior fontanelle, normal faces, intact palate, moderate retractions with fair air entry.
A II/VI systolic murmur with femoral pulses present, benign abdominal examination, testes descended, stable hips, normal tone and activity.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM DURING THIS INTERIM:  Respiratory:  The patient was initially grunting, flaring and retracting and placed on CPAP of 6.
He subsequently has been comfortable in room air saturating greater than 94 percent with no increased work of breathing.
Cardiovascular:  He was initially noted to have a murmur, but that has not been appreciated subsequently.
He had initial blood pressure that was slightly low and received a 10 cc per kilo normal saline bolus and subsequently blood pressures have been normal without any further intervention.
No active cardiovascular issues.
for respiratory distress.
Maternal milk supply has been scant.
On day of life number three, a repeat sodium was elevated at 147, thought due to mild dehydration.
CBC on admission revealed a white count of 7.7 with 9 percent polys and 0 percent bands, hematocrit elevated at 68, platelet count of 158.
The patient has not been symptomatic from his polycythemia.
He was treated with ampicillin and Gentamicin for 48 hours his blood cultures were no growth.
Neurology:  Given his gestational age and benign clinical course, we do not plan to have ultrasound or ophthalmologic evaluation.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Prematurity at 33 0/7 weeks gestational age, polycythemia likely due to twin-twin transfusion, status post partial exchange transfusion, hyperbilirubinemia, status post sepsis evaluation, status post respiratory distress syndrome                                 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 36400**] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.
