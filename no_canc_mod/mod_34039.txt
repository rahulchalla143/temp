Course was complicated by increasing midline shift necessitating widening of R temporal lobectomy on [**11-24**].
Past Medical History: -Intracranial hemorrhage s/p R sided craniectomy and evacuation of hematoma.
s/p right sided temporal lobectomy  ([**11-12**]) -Hypercholesterolemia -HTN -s/p PEG  [**11-12**] -s/p IVC filter [**11-12**] (placed because of prolonged immobilization in setting of recent bleed.)
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Baseline right ptosis and right facial droop.

No previous tracing available for comparison.
No new acute intracranial hemorrhage.
New hydrocephalus, especially of the left lateral ventricle and third ventricle.
No definitive obstructing mass seen.
Status post right frontal cranioplasty with unchanged pneumocephalus and post-surgical changes in the right middle cranial fossa.
Interval increase in right subdural fluid collection measuring 14 mm.
Persistent dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.
No large areas of acute infarction or new hemorrhage.
Subdural fluid collection in the right frontoparietal and surgical resection cavity filled with fluid in the right middle cranial fossa, with edema of the cerebral parenchyma and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and 8 mm shift of the midline structures to the left, not significantly changed compared to the prior study of [**2161-1-3**], allowing for the technical differences.
Enhancement around the periphery of the subdural fluid collection in the surgical resection cavity may relate to post-surgical changes or other causes of inflammation/infection if there is clinical concern for infection.
Unchanged right subdural hematoma with mass effect causing 5 mm leftward subfalcine herniation.
There is focus of high attenuation in the lower pons, which could reflect artifact at the skull base.
However, pontine hemorrhage cannot be excluded and MRI to rule out hemorrhage is recommended.
MRI [**1-18**] Head: No evidence for acute hemorrhage in the pons as questioned on the recent CT.
Interval removal of a drain from the right subdural collection, which is not significantly changed in size.
MRI Head [**1-22**]: No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
No change in subgaleal and subdural fluid collections with mass effect.
On [**1-1**], he developed respiratory distress and fevers and was transferred to the ICU, a fever w/u revealed a UTI with Coag Negative Staph in the urine.
[**1-13**] Upper extremity ultrasound performed to identify superficial thrombosis in R basilic/cephalic veins.
On [**1-20**], his LFTs were noted to have mild elevation and cefepime was discontinued.
His WBC was 6.3 on [**1-25**], and thereby not suggestive of ongoing infectious process.
