The week prior to her presentation her INR had been at goal of 2.0, she then noticed blood in her stool and red blood on the paper towel.
Guiaic showed flecks of BRB, no active bleeding.
Past Medical History: -Afib on coumadin, diagnosed post operatively for a hip fracture in [**2099-2-7**].
-Diverticulosis - diagnosed many years ago, has had 3 colonoscopies in past 10-15 years -Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] - diagnosed [**8-24**] of this year by -Neurologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Location (un) 9101**]).
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, very thin and frail appearing.
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: irregular, tachycardic unable to appreciate murmurs Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly, no tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding  GU: no foley Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait deferred.
Moderate-to-severe circumferential pericardial effusion is nonhemorrhagic.
This study is not tailored to rule out tamponade.
If clinical concern of acute aortic process remains, a C+ exam is suggested.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusion is more prominent on the left side.
Dilated aortic root with probable small sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp and severe aortic regurgitation.
At least mild mitral regurgitation - diastolic mitral regurgitation is present, in keeping with severe aortic regurgitation.
There is a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion without frank tamponade.
However, the RV wall looks hypertrophied, suggesting pulmonary hypertension (signs of tamponade may be absent with elevated right sided pressures).
Also, the presence of severe aortic regurgitation means that pulsus paradoxus is insensitive to assess inter-ventricular interaction.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2100-9-22**] FINDINGS:  There is moderate cardiomegaly, possible pericardial effusion, and a moderate left and small right pleural effusion.
A tortuous aorta is seen with aortic arch calcifications.
There is no pneumothorax and no focal lung consolidation.
Vertebroplasty material is seen in the upper lumbar spine.
There is probably moderate/severe aortic regurgitation with a a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp.
Mildly hypokinetic ventricular function.
Moderate-sized pericardial effusion without evidence of frank tamponade, although the right atrium does not fully dilate during atrial diastole, suggesting either low filling pressures or early tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: #Pericardial Effusion:  A CXR done on admission noted a left pleural effusion.
A chest CT was done [**9-22**] which was remarkable for a small to moderate left effusion with a significant pericardial effusion and ascending thoracic aorta aneurysm.
An echo was performed [**9-22**] at the bedside due to concern for tamponade which showed probable moderate/severe aortic regurgitation with a a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp, moderate sized pericardial effusion without evidence of frank tamponade, although the right atrium does not fully dilate during atrial diastole, suggesting either low filling pressures or early tamponade.
A formal echo was performed on [**9-23**] dialted aortic root with probable small sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp and severe aortic regurgitaton, a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion without frank tamponade.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended CT with contrast due to concern for dissection; CT showed dissection of the thoracic ascending aorta with possible rupture into pericardium.
She was medically managed with HR and blood pressure control but continued to decline over the next several days with increasing oxygen requirements eventually requiring 100% on a non-rebreather.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient has history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin diagnosed post operatively for a hip fracture in [**2099-2-7**].
She then had a likely vagal episode and became acutely bradycardic with a 6 second pause.
#Bright red blood per rectum: The patient present with bright red blood per rectum in the setting of an elevated INR of 8.0 and HCT of 29.0.
Gastroenterology was consulted  who felt this was likely a lower GI bleed, most likely diverticular or AVM, exacerbated in the setting of elevated INR.
Also on the differential diagnosis are hemorrhoids and malignancy.
She did have a colonoscopy in [**2098**] that did not show any polyps, making malignancy unlikely.
Etiology likely multifactorial secondary to pericardial effusion and poor reserve with underlying myasthenia.
The CXR did not show any evidence of acute infection.
Please see above, but the patient had increasing oxygen requirments eventually requiring 100% on a non-rebreather.
# Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: The patient was recently diagnosed with myasthenia after 3 years of progressive symptoms.
She had a positive anti-acetylchoine receptor antibody and was started on pyridostigmine with little improvement.
Neurology was consulted regarding diagnosis and treatment and concern for underlying malignancy with paraneoplastic syndrome.
