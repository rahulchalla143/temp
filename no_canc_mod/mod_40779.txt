Recent echo concerning for endocarditis due to ?
No evidence of active infection at time of visit.
Culture neg endocaritis panel pending at this time - sent as pt had persistent fever after treatment for e.coli infection.
At cardiology visit on [**1-11**] pt found to be in ARF with Cr of 3.3 and evidence of worsening volume overload.
On admission today the patient reports increased edema of LE as well as increasing abdominal distention.
No urine output today.
The patient denies dyspnea and states he has been able to walk around his home.
Does not climb stairs - utilizes chair lift.
He has had increased loose stools [**2-28**] daily for past days, worse than his baseline.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Complains of fatigue and loose stools as above.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
Past Medical History: diastolic CHF atrial fibrillation male breast cancer s/p R mastectomy in [**2104**] hypertension dyslipidemia gout .
Cardiac Risk Factors: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension  .
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
[**3-2**] systolic murmur over mitral area with radiation to axilla.
No thrills, lifts.
decreased BS at RLL with dullness to percussion.
Abd: Soft, +distention and fluid wave Ext: 1+ ankle edema, 3+ thigh edema b/l.
DP and PT dopplerable Skin: + stasis changes bilateral LE.
No ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Warm extremities   Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate 60bpm.
Low voltage in leads II,III, AVF with q waves in III and AVF.
Poor R wave progression.
Non specific diffuse twave flattening.
No ST changes with no significant change compared with prior dated [**2113-12-1**].
CXR [**2113-1-12**] - AP UPRIGHT CHEST: There has been interval removal of a left-sided PICC.
Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.
Mild vascular engorgement and redistribution is again identified, consistent with mild volume overload.
There is a stable moderate right pleural effusion with chronic right volume loss and right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
No pneumothorax is identified.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with mild volume overload.
Stable moderate right pleural effusion with right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia is not excluded.
There is no hydronephrosis seen and no solid masses or stones are identified in either kidney.
There is ascites noted within the abdomen and a right pleural effusion is also seen.
Ascites with right pleural effusion.
Thickened bladder wall.
Severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Successful insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump, albeit with minimal systolic unloading.
Atrial fibrillation.
Catheter-induced ventricular tachycardia.
TTE [**1-14**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is partial anterior mitral leaflet flail.
There is small vegetation on the mitral valve (remnant of prior endocarditis).
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (due to the eccentric nature of the mitral regurgitation, the volumetric assessment (based on color flow imaging) of mitral regurgitation may be underestimated.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared to the previous study of [**2112-12-28**], the mitral regurgitation is reduced, the forward stroke volume is increased, and the aortic regurgitation is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 79M with diastolic heart failure, 4+ TR and 3+ MR afib, RF in past related to obstruction, prostate ca, CKD (baseline Cr ~1.5) admitted with hypotension and anuria.
Decompensated Diastolic Heart Failure/Valvular Heart Disease: The patient presented with severe decompensated diastolic heart failure; likely precipitated by multivalvular disease.
Renal consultation was obtained and anuria felt to be prerenal in etiology.
The patient then underwent TTE and evaluation for valvular surgery as his condition was unlikely to resolve without repair of TR and MR.
Rhythm - Atrial fibrillation; induced Vtach during placement of balloon but no intervention required and returned to Afib.
Valves - Moderate (2+) AR,  Moderate to severe (3+) MR, Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation.
Etiology consistent with prerenal.
