EKG:wide QRS, STE in V1-V4 c/w hyperkalemia vs STEMI repeat EKG in MICU: sinus tachycardia at 120, NANI, no stchanges  A1c 9.9 (improved from 10.9)  H. pylori (-)  blood cultures negative   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  46M with hx of IDDM, etoh abuse pw DKA and ?STEMI vs hyperkalemia.
Patient presents with elevated glucose in 1309, Bicarb <5, Ketones in urine, pH of 7.0, thus is in diabetic ketoacidosis.
He does note abdominal pain with emesis but no diarrhea.
Insulin antibodies present on prior eval, with low c-peptide level, raising possibility of [**Last Name (un) **].
# STE/Chest pain.
Patient with ST elevations in the context of hyperkalemia.
Initially paient did have chest pain though this has resolved and his EKGs have normalized after improvement of DKA and K. Likely his STE were related to his hyperkalemia and were not a true STEMI.
TTE showed normal biventricular function without wall motion abnormalities.
ST-T wave changes resolved on subsequent ECGs.
Most likely patient is severely volume depleted in the setting of his DKA.
# HTN.
