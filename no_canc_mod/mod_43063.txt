Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old female with h/o hypercholesterolemia, hyperparathyrodism and HTN who presented with cough, n/v and was found to have a sodium of 110 on admission.
# Hyponatremia, symptomatic Renal was consulted, and given the patient's history of poor po intake, GI losses from emesis, and dehydration, it was felt that the patient's hyponatremia was due to hypovolemia in the setting of continued HCTZ use (started in late [**9-9**]), combined with decreased solid food intake, while continuing to drink signif water.
#SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM: Etiology of this is unclear, possibly secondary to hypocalcemia.
She also was found to have a very low vitamin D level in the past (25 OH vit D <4 in [**3-12**]).
#BRONCHITIS: - CXR PA/L negative for PNA, afebrile without leukocytosis - Antibiotics were discontinued on admission given her nausea/vomiting and intolerance to bactrim and augmentin.
#HEADACHE: Given elevated BP and headache, there was initial concern for possible hypertensive emergency.
Absence of papilladema on exam.
