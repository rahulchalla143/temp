Admission Date:  [**2188-3-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-3-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from OSH for acute MI.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization [**2188-3-4**] Percutaneous coronary angioplasty  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 37217**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with CV risk factor of age and hypertension, with a past medical history also significant for lung cancer status post resection, remote colon cancer status post resection, and hypothyroidism, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2188-3-4**] with acute left-sided chest pain.
Then at 1100 AM on the day of presentation, she developed acute left-sided chest pain, severe, with radiation to the back.
No prior similar episode.
EKG revealed ST elevations in V1-4.
She was never chest pain free at the OSH and was emergently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
History of colon cancer 10 years ago, status post resection 3.
Hypothyroidism 4.
History of compression fracture  Social History: She is widowed, and lives alone.
She has no children.
She ambulates without assistance, but has a history of prior falls.
She never smoked, no EtOH.
Family History: Mother with CAD at advanced age.
No carotid bruit.
Fairly clear on inspiration, but diffuse expiratory crackles.
No bronchial breathing appreciated.
CVS: Somewhat distant heart sounds.
No murmur appreciated.
Abdomen soft and non-tender.
No hematoma, no bruit.
ST elevation in V1-4.
No clear reciprocal changes.
ST elevation (3-5mm) in V1,2,3,4, aVL.
ST depression 1-2 mm in II, III.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery had a 40% ostial stenosis.
The LAD had a total occlusion of the proximal vessel.
The LCX had minimal disease.
The RCA had serial stenoses in the mid and distal vessel.
Right sided pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 9 mm Hg and RVEDP was 12 mm Hg).
Left sided pressures were severely elevated (mean PCWP was 27 mm Hg).
Severe single vessel coronary artery disease.
Severely elevated left sided pressures.
The heart is enlarged with a prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left.
The thoracic aorta is widened and elongated and shows calcium deposits in the wall mostly at the level of the arch.
There is no pneumothorax or any other placement related complication.
The accessible lung fields demonstrate a pulmonary vasculature, which is irregular in distribution consistent with COPD.
There is no conclusive evidence for pulmonary edema on the left side; however, on the right side a perivascular haze is present and the right lateral pleural sinus is blunted.
Diffuse density over the entire lower portion of the right hemithorax is indicative of pleural effusion layering posteriorly.
Some pleural effusion is also present on the left side but to a lesser degree.
There is no evidence of any external wiring.
Diffuse skeletal demineralization is noted, and there is at least one vertebral body with significant compression in the lower thoracic spine.
There exists no prior chest examination or records available for comparison.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular enlargement, bilateral pleural effusion more marked on the right, pulmonary emphysema pattern probably interferes with assessment of pulmonary vasculature on the radiograph.
Suggest correlation with findings on Swan-Ganz catheter to determine degree of left-sided fitting pressure elevation.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal and apical akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere.
No apical thrombus identified but cannot exclude.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2188-3-13**] ECHO (preliminary report): No pericardial effusion.
No LV thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with CV risk factors of HTN and age, with a PMHx also significant for lung cancer and colon cancer both status post resection, now admitted with AMI, found to have TO of LAD, status post stent/PTCA on [**2188-3-4**].
Coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the LAD, and stenting of the LAD into OM1 was performed, with rescue PTCA to the LAD.
Hemodynamics in the cath lab were remarkable for elevated left-sided pressures with PCWP 27, low CO/CI 2.6/2.0 and elevated SVR 2492, consistent with cardiogenic shock.
In the CCU, she was started on ASA, [**Known lastname **], high-dose Lipitor and continued on low-dose Captopril, later held in the setting of worsening renal failure.
She was also started on Dobutamine for inotropic support.
Integrilin was not given post-procedure given her age and high bleeding risk.
Dobutamine was later changed to Dopamine on [**2188-3-5**] secondary to hypotension.
Her picture was further complicated by a clinical and radiographic picture of CHF, worsening renal failure and poor urine output.
An echo was performed on [**2188-3-5**], which revealed EF of 20% with mid to distal anteroseptal and apical akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere, 2+ AR, 1+ MR, 3+ TR.
Given her low EF with concomitant apical akinesis, she was started on Heparin IV.
The latter was stopped in the setting of dropping hematocrit and guaiac positive stools.
On [**2188-3-12**], she was noted to have a pericardial rub, and a repeat echo was performed on [**2188-3-13**], which revealed no pericardial effusion.
There was also no LV thrombus.
Clinically, she had elevated oxygen requirements, with a radiographic picture consistent with CHF.
Her picture was further complicated by worsening renal failure and poor urine output.
She initially responded poorly to Lasix boluses for diuresis and was started on Natrecor in addition to Dopamine.
Her oxygen requirement decreased with continued diuresis.
ACE inhibitor therapy was temporarily held in the setting of renal failure and reintroduced for afterload reduction.
Consider higher Lasix dose if weight increases >3lbs.
3) Acute renal failure: Creatinine on admission was 1.4 and rose to 2.1 on [**2188-3-5**].
Urine lytes were suggestive of prerenal physiology with FeNA 0.2%, and her renal failure was ultimately felt likely secondary to poor forward flow and contrast nephropathy.
4) Heme: Ms. [**Known lastname 37217**] had low hematocrits in hospital, with normocytic indices, and was transfused a total of 2 units of PRBCs.
Stools were guaiac positive while on Heparin, which was held.
Medications on Admission: Levoxyl 75 mcg PO QD Atenolol 50 mg PO QD Captopril 25 mg PO TID Darvocet 100 mg PO Q8 hours prn for pain  Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Lifecare of [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Myocardial infarction status post coronary stent Congestive heart failure Hypertension  Secondary diagnoses: Hypothyroidism Osteoporosis   Discharge Condition: Patient discharged to rehab in stable condition.
Please call your PCP or return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, or if your legs start to swell.
