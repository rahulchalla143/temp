related to medication or SA Node dysfunction or ?combination of both).

[**2160-6-22**] 06:30AM    ALT 15 AST18  LD220  AlkP 138*  Tbili 0.5   Lipase 26 Trop 0.14     Brief Hospital Course: 79yo female with hx of CABG ([**2153**]), EF 65%, PAF on Coumadin, and DM who was transferred from an OSH with a NSTEMI, found to have bacteremia and Lt hydronephrosis secondary to an impacted stone complicated by acute on chronic renal failure now s/p ureteral stent placement.
CAD - Patient with known CAD, S/P CABG [**2151**].
Patient has not had chest pain since admitted.
On [**6-18**] she underwent a P-Mibi stress test which showed no reversible ischemia.
As she developed acute on chronic renal failure, we held her acei which was restarted prior to discharge.
Initially she was euvolemic on exam with no signs of increased JVD, trace crackles [**12-20**], and no edema.
On Wednesday night ([**6-18**]) she received 2 units FFP, 2 units PRBC in conjuction with decreased UOP and acute renal failure and started looking volume overloaded with crackles b/l on exam and new O2 requirement, and requried 5 L to maintain sats in the low 90's.
As she developed acute on chronic renal failure the disopyramide was at first renally dosed, and then dc'ed on [**6-17**] (but she got some at her PMibi on [**6-18**]).
Since this time she has remained in NSR with HR 60's, except for occasional regular irregularity which was likely caused by runs of premature atrial contractions.
#  Bacteremia/ Pyelonephritis - The patient was found to grow pansensitive E. coli [**1-19**] from [**6-12**] BCx(OSH).
Pt had + UTI with WBC of 16 which decreased to 12.
New L hydronephrosis confirmed on U/S and 1.3 x 0.8 stone seen obstructing the Lt ureter.
We think her bacteremia was secondary to her hydronephrosis in the setting of obstructive nephrolithiasis.
Her WBC remained elevated in the low to mid 20's throughout most of her stay.
A second attempt took place on [**6-18**] which resulted in a small retroperitoneal bleed with HCT drop.
Repeat Ucx revealed proteus resistant to floroquinolones; she was switched to ceftriaxone.
After antibiotics and resolution of acute pyelonephritis/bacteremia, she should be seen in urology for repeat attempt at stone removal vs lithotripsy.
#  Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a baseline Cr of appromiately 2.
Once the stone was visialized, urology was consulted, however they did not feel comfortable with surgical stone removal due to the risk of sepsis as she was already bacteremic, they recommended IR doing a percutaneous nephrostomy.
After the first perc nephrostomy attempt on [**6-16**](during which she had an episode of hypotension) her Cr began rising and she developed acute renal failure likely due to ATN versus obstructive uropathy.
The patient was given in succession 60mg lasix iv, 100mg lasix iv, then 200mg lasix iv with no significant urine output following the blood cell transfusions on [**6-19**].
# Anemia - The patient has chronic anemia, likely secondary to CKD with a baseline Hct of approximately 31.
After the second percutaneous nephrostomy attempt, the patient developed a retroperitoneal bleed on [**2160-6-18**] with a HCT drop from 31 to 21.9.
A noncontrast CT showed a bleed along her iliopsoas.
Over [**6-26**] to [**6-28**] her Hct slowly declined from to 26.1 and in the setting of chest pain overnight on [**6-27**] she was transfused 2 units PRBC on [**6-28**] and a noncon CT of her abd/pelvis was completed to look for intrabdominal bleeding.
Given poor PO intake and mild post-ATN diuresis, this was thought to be due to free water deficit.
# Leukocytosis: [**1-19**] to pyelonephritis.
CXR showed no PNA.
# Right upper extremity DVT - patient developed swelling in her RUE on [**6-29**] and was found on US to have a nonocclusive thrombus at her PICC site.
PICC line was placed for IV antibiotics for on the right side, now on the left as she developed a right DVT.
