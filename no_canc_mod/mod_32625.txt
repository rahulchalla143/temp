Admission Date:  [**2171-3-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-4-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-8-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: semi-elective cath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: coronary cath intubation MVA CVVH  History of Present Illness:  68 year old man with severe COPD (2L NC O2 dependent), ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 40%, CAD s/p unprotected LM stenting in [**2168**] with DES (not surgical candidate), PVD s/p femoral bypass, diabetes type 2 with diabetic neuropathy, s/p multiple hospital/nursing home admissions over the past several months for COPD exacerbations, CHF, pneumonia, NSTEMI and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cath.
Per patient and OSH records, he had worsening SOB for 5 weeks ago with decreased activity tolerance and worsening dyspnea on exertion.
From rehab, he was readmitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23925**] Hospital in early [**Month (only) **] with a COPD exacerbation.
He survived the episode was treated with Cipro for a presumed PNA and was sent to [**Hospital1 **] again.
At [**Last Name (un) 8612**], he developed recurrent AFib and tachycardia for which he was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2171-3-22**].
There he was treated with sotalol and digoxin but had persistent tachycardia so was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further management.
They considered amio but given the COPD were hesitant to do this given the risk of amio pulmonary toxicity.
For his COPD and possible PNA he was started on rocephin and azithromax on the day of transfer.
He was started also on prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation with plan to taper to 20mg on [**2171-3-27**].
He was taken to cath lab for diagnostic cath.
Cath showed progressive LCx (ostial 80% lesion involve origin of AV branch) and RCA (80% proximal instent restenosis, 70% mid lesion, 70% distal lesion) disease.
Post cath groin angio showed a small perforation of fem-fem graft.
When seen in ccu, he was in mild distress with pain at fem-stop, he had dopplerable pulses throughout.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 40-45% by echo on [**2171-3-22**], Chronic bronchitis, peripheral neuropathy, amputation of toes of left foot, sleep apnea, GERD, BPH, Severe COPD w/ multiple intubations .
CAD in both parents and brothers had heart attacks in their 50s.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION on ICU admission VS: T=98.8 BP=165/66 HR=63 RR=20 O2 sat=95% on 3L NC GENERAL: Obese M in mild distress.
Sclera anicteric.
NECK: Supple with JVP difficult to assess given body habitus.
crackles at right base and expiratory wheezes throughout.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ edema bilaterally, noted to have femoral-a line and a fem-stop.
EKG on admission to OSH: Narrow complex tachycardia at 150bpm.
likely atrial flutter with nl axis STD V3-V6.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had a widely patent stent with minimal proximal in-stent narrowing.
The LAD had <50% stenosis at mid-vessel.
The LCx had an 80% ostial stneosis involving the origin of a very small AV branch.
The RCA had 80% proximal in-stent restenosis with a 70% mid-vessel lesion and a 70% distal lesion.
Femoral angiography demonstrated a very small perforation of the fem-fem bypass graft.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Brief Hospital Course:  68 yoM with significant cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities including advanced COPD, IHD and sCHF (EF 42%) who was admitted to the CCU for observation following perforation of fem-fem graft during semi-elective coronary catheterization who?????
?s post cath course was complicated by unstable Afib/Aflutter, GI bleeding, aspiration, respiratory failure, sepsis, renal and hepatic failure from which he unfortunately expired.
Mr. [**Known lastname 82074**] was initially admitted for coronary cath after recent OSH hospitalziations for NSTEMI, CHF exacerbation and new AF.
Post cath groin angio showed a small perforation of fem-fem graft.
He developed upper GI bleeding with hematemesis complicated by aspiration and respiratory failure.
EGD showed deudonitis without active bleed.
He was intubated and ventilated and broad spectrum antibiotics were started for possible aspiration pneumonia and suspected sepsis.
Subsequently in the setting of low BP's and AF/RVR underwent cardioversion which resulted in a VF rythm which was terminated with shock.
He further deteriorated with worsening renal functions, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis requiring CVVH, shock requiring 3 pressors, rising lactate, liver failure consistent with shock liver, advanced anasarca.
?s poor prognosis in light of multi-system failure.
?s condition worsened including recurring atrial fibrillation and low blood pressures.
