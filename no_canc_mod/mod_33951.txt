4 mm aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery.
4 mm aneurysm at the origin of the left posterior communicating artery.
Small infundibula at the origins of the right posterior communicating artery and the right lateral lenticulostriate artery.
Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage within the fourth ventricle and tiny layering intraventricular hemorrhage within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
A small amount of subarachnoid blood in the right sylvian fissure and prepontine cistern.
Diffuse subarachnoid high density material; likely a combination of extravasated contrast material from the vascular coiling procedure of three hours earlier, as well as subarachnoid hemorrhage.

CT Brain Perfusion [**7-4**]: Residual diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with layering of hemorrhage in the dependent region of the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhagic areas.
The CTA demonstrates mild narrowing of the caliber of the vessels in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] suggesting mild vasospasm as described in detail above.
Focal outpouching is identified at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery, likely consistent with a prominent infundibulum.
She was placed on nimodipine 60mg Q4 hours for vasospasm prophylaxis.
On [**7-4**] she underwent a CT perfusion study of the brain, which showed minimal cerebral vasospasm and a resolving SAH.
She continued to do well wihout signs or symptoms of cerebral vasospasm.
She did continue to have a headache with photophobia, but was well-controlled with IV dilaudid and oxycodone.
