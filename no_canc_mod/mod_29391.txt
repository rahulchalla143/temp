No comparison studies.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is diffuse lack of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation and mild compression of the ventricles bilaterally.
These findings suggest the possibility of a diffuse edema.
