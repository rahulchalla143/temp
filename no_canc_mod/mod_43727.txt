Additional symptoms include frequent diarrhea, back and shoulder pain (old), dyspnea on exertion (old) and chest tightness (intermittent).
She has had no vomiting, dizziness or lightheadedness.
She notes that her chest tightness is not typical for having MI, but had previously told ED staff that the chest tightness was consistent with previous MI pain  On review of systems, she denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery (has had persistent nose bleed), cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for mild LE edema, absence of chest pain paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope.

Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):   DISCHARGE LABS:  [**2127-11-26**] 06:40AM BLOOD WBC-6.6 RBC-2.77* Hgb-8.5* Hct-26.2* MCV-94 MCH-30.8 MCHC-32.7 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-171 [**2127-11-26**] 06:40AM BLOOD Glucose-379* UreaN-49* Creat-1.2* Na-136 K-4.4 Cl-97 HCO3-27 AnGap-16  CXR [**2127-11-21**]: CONCLUSION: Stable cardiomegaly with minimal atelectasis at the lung bases.
There is no definite focal consolidation.
Probable etopic atrial rhythm with atrial premature beats and ventricular pacing.
Since the previous tracing earlier [**2127-11-21**] no change.
ECHO [**2127-11-24**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = XX %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-8-13**], the left ventricular systolic function is similar and the severities of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitaiton have worsened.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 86 year old female with who presented w/ acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and elevated cardiac enzymes in the setting of urosepsis.
1)Gram Negative Rod Bacteremia: Patient had blood and urine cultures positive for pansensitive E.Coli.
She initially had borderline low blood pressure in the setting of urosepsis, and was transferred to the CCU given her history of severe systolic and diastolic heart failure.
Patient remains afebrile and leukocytosis has since resolved and patient appears clinically improved.
Given that patient has had recurrent UTIs with multiple organisms she has an appointment to follow up with urology.
2)Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Patient had elevated cardiac enzymes in the setting of urosepsis, with peak troponin of 0.97, CK 232, MB 20.
Patient chest pain free at time of discharge.
3) Acute on Chroninc Systolic Heart Failure: Patient presented with a BNP of 24,000 and clinical evidence of volume overload.
She has history of systolic HF with EF 20%.
Her repeat ECHO showed no significant change in left ventricular ejection fraction since previous ECHO, but worsening mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
This acute on chronic episode of heart failure likely related her urosepsis.
Both of these medications are important for optimizing her heart failure management.
She is not anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation due to a remote history of gi bleeding.
5) Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: This was likely secondary to low/poor forward flow in the setting systolic heart failure exacerbation and urosepsis.
Patient's creatinine resolved following treatment of her urosepsis and improvement of her heart failure.
6) Type II Diabetes: Initially poorly controlled in the setting of urosepsis and stress dose steroids, though now improving.
7) Polymyalgia Rheumatica: Patient received a short course of stress dose steroids in the setting of hypotension/urosepsis.
She has now switched back to home regimen of chronic low dose prednisone.
8) Anemia of chronic disease: Hematocrit remained stable.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet  Sublingual three times a day as needed for chest pain: Take up to 3 tablets 5 minutes apart as needed for chest pain and call 911.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual as needed as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location **] center at [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Gram negative rod bacteremia, gram negative rod urinary tract infection, chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, acute on chronic renal failure Secondary: Type II diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease   Discharge Condition: good, no chest pain   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because you were feeling nauseas and generally fatigued.
You were found to have an infection in your blood and in your urine.
You were also found to be in heart failure and to have had a heart attack.
You were given antibiotics for your infection and we increased your lasix to remove fluid.
-Lisinopril: this is a medication for your blood pressure  If you experience persistent chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing while lying flat, fevers, chills or night sweats please contact your primary care provider or come to the emergency department for evaluation.
