HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 55-year-old white male with a history of severe diabetes mellitus, status post living-related renal transplant plus immunosuppression who presented on [**2139-3-16**], with a 2-day history of fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased p.o.
intake in the setting of a nonproductive cough.
A chest CT performed on admission revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
The patient was started on azithromycin at that time for presumed atypical pneumonia.
A chest x-ray at that time revealed a worsening interstitial process (congestive heart failure versus acute respiratory distress syndrome), and the patient was given Lasix 40 mg IV and transferred to the medical intensive care unit for closer monitoring.
Over the past 36 hours there has been notable in the patient's clinical picture; that is, with regard to his respiratory function, and he has been able to ambulate; although, he still has persistent low-grade fevers.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is notable for a 27-year history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus combined with severe triopathy.
His past medical history is also notable for hypertension, retinopathy with bilateral blindness, gastroparesis, neuropathy with no sensation below the knees, autonomic neuropathy with orthostatic hypotension.
He is also status post lymphocele drainage and ureteral  reimplantation in [**2131-5-10**], and he is also status post nephrostomy tube placement in [**2131-5-10**].
In general, he appeared nontoxic and in no apparent distress.
His skin examination revealed multiple raised red papules with dry serous discharge and hemorrhagic crust.
No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Pulmonary examination revealed positive bowel sounds, mild crackles at the bases.
His extremity examination was normal with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, and no calf tenderness.
All of these abnormalities were in the process of improving at the time of his evaluation, in comparison to the laboratory values noted when he was in the medical intensive care unit.
Pathology revealed no anaerobes, and the AFB smear was negative, and so were fungal cultures.
His urine revealed no eosinophils.
He had an echocardiogram done on [**3-23**] which revealed left atrial left atrial enlargement, 5, and mild-to-moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40%.
His echocardiogram also revealed anteroseptal akinesis and apical akinesis as well.
Trivial mitral regurgitation and a small pericardial effusion were also noted on the echocardiogram performed on [**3-23**].
Chest x-ray revealed no changes in the infiltrative process noted on his admission films.
The origin of the patient's acute pulmonary disease was still of unknown etiology, but it was believed to be either viral versus atypical pneumonia.
He exhibited no shortness of breath and was breathing very comfortably on room air.
It is important to note that the patient is at increased risk for infection given his current immunosuppressive regimen of prednisone and cyclosporin given his LLRT (i.e.
living-related renal transplant).
On admission, given the abnormalities noted on the patient's echocardiogram, he was scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] for further cardiac management given the findings consistent with mild congestive heart failure on chest x-ray in addition to the abnormal findings on echocardiogram.
Although an elevated BUN and creatinine were noted earlier in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, it continued to improve during the latter part of his hospitalization; more specifically, upon transfer to the medical floor.
He will be continued on cyclosporin and prednisone as immunosuppression for his transplant.
Renal consultation recommended Lasix for the patient's mild left lower extremity edema, and the patient does note however that he follows his edema closely and currently takes Lasix 20 mg q.d.
