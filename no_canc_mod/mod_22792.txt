Admission Date:  [**2108-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-7-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-12-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Benadryl  Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 88932**] Chief Complaint: Right chest wall abscess.
Debridement of mastectomy cavity  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 51-year-old female who underwent a right total mastectomy with right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy on [**2108-7-2**] for multicentric right breast carcinoma.
She presented approximately 2 weeks postoperatively to the emergency room with concern for septic shock and hypovolemia.
Her surgical incision site was imaged with ultrasound and showed a 5-cm x 5-cm simple fluid collection which was aspirated to resolution.
The cultures grew out methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus.
On exam, her surgical site remained clean, dry and intact without evidence of cellulitis or induration.
There was no appreciable fluid collection at the surgical site.
However,continued to have elevated fevers to the 38.3 with as a persistently elevated white count of 15,000 to 16,000.
On repeat ultrasound, was found to have  7- cm x 2-cm fluid collection at the site, not appearing loculated or rim-enhancing.
Due to her low-grade fever, the persistently slightly elevated white count,and the finding of cloudy fluid within the mastectomy cavity, the decision was made to proceed with operative incision and drainage, and debridement.
The patient does not have any further details.
With packing removed, beefy red granulation tissue within cavity, no evidence of infection or purulence  Pertinent Results: EMG [**2108-7-19**]: -esentially normal nerve conduction studies.
-although F waves were impersistent in the ulnar nerve and absent in the peroneal and tibial nerves, as may be seen in early [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome (<1 week), normal recruitment argues against GBS -no evidence for a presynaptic or postsynaptic disorder of neuromuscular junction transmission (as in Botulism and myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] respectively) -no evidence for a generalized myopathy  Radiologic Data:  MRI Brain w/Contrast: Few scattered non-specific foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensities.
Otherwise, no significant abnormalities on MRI without Gadolinium.
MRI C-Spine w/o Contrast: mild degenerative changes of C-spine in the form of mild discrete disc bulging (C5-C6, C6-C7), no significant spinal stenosis or evidence of cord compression  CT Chest:  Foci of subcutaneous air and fluid collection measuring up to 7.5 cm within the right mastectomy site, likely post-surgical.
Approximately 45 mL of clear serosanguineous fluid were aspirated without difficulty.
Following completion of the procedure, there was near complete resolution of the fluid collections.
Repeat Ultrasound R Chest [**2108-7-18**]: Successful ultrasound-guided aspiration of right breast fluid collection with approximately 55 mL of cloudy serosanguinous fluid removed.

Her symptoms progressively improved over several days, however she continued to have low grade fevera and leukocytosis.
Thus the decision was made to take patient to the operating room where she underwent an incision and drainage of right chest wall abscess and debridement of mastectomy cavity.The patient was transferred to the inpatient general surgery unit in good condition.
Neuro: The patient presented with new onset bilateral lower extremity weakness.
Neurolgy was consulted and she underwent various neurological studies none of which showed any clear cut diagnosis.
The patient's weakness progressively improved.
The patient denied cough or respiratory symptoms.
The foley catheter was discontinued  postoperatively and voided without difficulty.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
The wound bed appeared clean with beefy red granulaetion tissue.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and pain was well controlled.
