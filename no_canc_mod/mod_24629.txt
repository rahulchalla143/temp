This was presumed to be for biliary colic.
He was discharged home and began to have worsening abdominal pain over the next 3-days.
On POD#3 he also began to have dyspnea so he presented to [**Hospital6 302**] for evaluation.
A CT scan was performed as well and this revealed bilateral atelectasis and free fluid in the gallbladder fossa and in the right paracolic gutter.
The patient's only complaint was abdominal pain that was diffuse in nature.
Records stated that he did have a temperature of 101F at home, but he was afebrile on admission.

Normally enhancing pancreas with pancreatic stent.
No large peripancreatic fluid collection.
Minimal fat stranding of the omentum could be related to history of pancreatitis.
Status post cholecystectomy, no fluid collection in the gallbladder fossa Small, right greater than left, pleural effusions.
Subtotal bilateral lower lobe and subsegmental right middle lobe atelectasis.
No extraluminal tracer noted to suggest bile leak.
Brief Hospital Course: 26M with bile leak seen on HIDA scan s/p lap chole from [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH after ERCP stenting of his pancreatic duct (unable to cannulate the CBD at [**Hospital6 302**]), presenting with evidence of acute pancreatitis.
A CT showed free fluid within the right upper quadrant tracking in the bilateral paracolic gutters and into the pelvis, but likely simple fluid density.
He was intubated overnight for worsening respiratory distress, felt to be an ARDS picture.
(OSH HIDA had shown a bile leak at the R inferior hepatic lobe).
During [**4-18**] and [**4-19**] multiple attempts to wean the vent were unsuccessful as pt would become hypercarbic and hypoxic with lower settings, kept on pressure support [**6-28**].
On [**4-21**], he was more alert, but still had some mental status clouding, was tolerating only facemask supplemental oxygen, and was out of bed to chair.
He had no abdominal complaints and his laboratory studies were reassuring.
