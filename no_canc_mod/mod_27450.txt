Admission Date: [**2157-6-17**]        Discharge Date: [**2157-10-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2157-6-17**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NB   HISTORY:  This infant was born at 26-0/7 weeks gestation, the product of an IVF pregnancy with an EDC of [**2157-9-23**].
This infant was delivered due to concern for chorioamnionitis.
He was intubated in the delivery for respiratory insufficiency.
He was noted to have bruising along the back of the spine and a superficial laceration on the right side.
General:  On admission to the NICU at birth, the infant had bruising noted above the spine, left thigh, buttocks, and the soles of both feet and toes.
Lungs:  Very shallow respirations with intercostal retractions and crackles heard bilaterally.
Spine: Midline, no dimple.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:  Discharge physical exam shows mildly sedated pink skin, warm and dry.
Normal facies with mild edema.
Respiratory:  Breath sounds clear and equal with mild to moderate subcostal retractions on conventional ventilation with intermittent tachypnea.
GU:  Normal male GU with scrotal edema present and bilateral hydroceles.
Musculoskeletal:  Normal with increased tone during agitation.
Respiratory:  The infant had respiratory distress     syndrome at birth and was given two doses of surfactant     therapy on the newborn day.
The infant was started on     caffeine citrate for apnea prematurity at two days of     age and was extubated to CPAP at that time.
The     infant was also started on vitamin A at birth to     decrease severity of chronic lung disease.
The infant     remained on CPAP until [**2157-7-13**], which was day of life     26, at which time the infant was reintubated for     increased for work of breathing and apneic spells.
Due to increasing edema, Diuril and     Aldactone were added to chronic lung medications on     [**2157-8-26**].
An ORL was consulted on [**2157-9-29**] due to     increased work of breathing and inability to wean CPAP     with intermittent episodes of apnea with bronchospasm     and dusky spells, requiring bag-mask ventilation.
A flexible bronchoscopy was done at the bedside     which showed abnormal vocal cord movement thought to be     tethered vocal cords at that time and recommendation for     full bronchoscopy to be done at [**Hospital3 1810**] was     made at that time.
The infant remained on CPAP through     until [**2157-10-7**] due to worsening blood gases and continued     work of breathing.
An echocardiogram was done     on [**2157-7-22**] which was day of life five, which showed a     very small PDA less than 1 mm in size with left-to-right     flow.
The echocardiogram on [**2157-8-25**]  showed     a small ASD with left-to-right flow and right ventricular     volume overload.
His most recent ECHO was on [**2157-10-10**]     it showed no pulmonary hypertension but a small PFO vs ASD     was present and there was good bilateral function.
The calories were subsequently     decreased and the infant is presently on 130 milliliters     per kilo per day fluid restriction for edema and chronic     lung disease and on Similac Special Care 24 calories     per ounce.
The infant was started on calciferol for     osteomalacia on [**2157-9-1**].
GI:  The infant had hyperbilirubinemia and was treated     with phototherapy for a peak bilirubin level of 4.4 over     0.3.
Sepsis evaluation was done on     [**2157-6-28**], day of life 11, for increased apneic spells.
The CBC at that time     was not shifted, but there was neutropenia and the CBC     was benign at that time.
Sepsis evaluation was done     again on [**2157-7-6**] due to increased work of breathing and     apneic episodes.
The trach aspirate     culture grew methicillin-sensitive staph aureus.
The infant received a total of 14 days of antibiotics     during that sepsis treatment.
Trach aspirate     grew gram-negative rods.
A repeat trach aspirate culture was sent on     [**2157-8-6**] which was positive for proteus, and lumbar     puncture was done on [**2157-8-9**] which was benign and grew     no bacterium.
The infant had an additional sepsis     evaluation done on [**2157-8-23**], day of life 67, for     increased work of breathing.
The     infant was started on vancomycin and amphotericin for     concern for yeast infection or concern for fungal     infection on trach aspirate culture, so the vancomycin     was discontinued after 48 hours, but the amphotericin     was continued for a full seven-day course.
The infant     did have gram-positive cocci and no yeast in the trach     aspirate culture at that time.
Mother has a history of postpartum depression from her     previous pregnancy.

Immunizations received:  The infant has received the     hepatitis B vaccine on [**2157-7-16**] and two-month     immunizations of PEDIARIX, HIB, and pneumococcal on     [**2157-9-30**].
Immunizations recommended:  (1)  Synagis RSV     prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through     [**Month (only) 958**] for infants that meet any of the following four     criteria:  Born less than 32 weeks gestation; born     between 32 and 35 weeks with two of the following -     either daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the     household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities,     or school-age siblings; chronic lung disease; or     hemodynamically significant congenital heart defect.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the     child's life, immunization against influenza is     recommended for household contacts in that of home     caregivers.
