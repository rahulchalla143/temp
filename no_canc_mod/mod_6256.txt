ST-T wave configuration consistent with acute infero-posterior injury/ischemia and possible infarction, although inferior  Q waves are non-diagnostic.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed one vessel coronary artery disease.
The RCA had patent stents with 40% instent restenosis in a calcified and tortuous vessel.
There was a distal subtotal occlusion.
Resting hemodynamics revealed high systemic blood pressure with SBP of 152 mmHg, normal right and elevated left sided filling pressures with a PCWP of 19 mmHg.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO [**2171-8-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal and mid-inferior and basal inferolateral hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
There is no evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
Mild bibasilar atelectases are associated with low lung volumes.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o M with past medical history significant for CAD s/p PCI who presents with inferior STEMI.
# CAD/Ischemia: Patient has a history of CAD with prior inferior MI & 4 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] to proximal RCA.
He presented with a new inferior STEMI.
On cardiac cath, he was noted to have 40% in-stent restenosis but also distal subtotal occlusion in his RCA, requiring the placement of 3 BMS stents.
His echo showed mild basal/inferolateral hypokinesis with an LVEF of 45-50%.
Pt was concerned about recurrence of MI as this one occurred despite comprehensive medical therapy.
He did not have recurrence of chest pain and was anxious to return to work.
# HTN: Patient was maintained on atenolol/chlorthalidone 50/25 mg & ramipril 20 mg daily as an outpatient, but these were held on admission due to his risk of vagal/bradycardia in the setting of an inferior MI.
# EtOH use: Pt with significant history of EtOH use ([**3-10**] glasses of wine with dinner, occasional binging) but did not exhibit any signs of withdrawal.
