According to his wife, he had been complaining of numbness in his right arm for 2-3 days, otherwise no other symptoms such as problems with his vision, or speech problems, or weakness were noted by his wife.
The neurologist from [**Hospital1 189**] discussed the patient with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], and a decision was made to transfer the patient, for possible a neuro interventional radiological procedure.
Social History: He does not smoke cigarettes, but occasionally smokes marijuana, dose not drink alcohol   Family History: Sister had an intracranial aneurysm which has resulted in a hemiparesis.
Physical Exam: T-afebrile in the OSH, whisked to CT and then angio before temp could be checked BP-132/87 HR-80 RR-18 O2Sat-99% Gen: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, left carotid bruit, but no vertebral bruit Back: No point tenderness or erythema CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: NIHSS: 19 Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
Right facial droop.
Tone flaccid in the right arm, and slightly increased in the right leg.

Occlusion of the left cervical internal carotid artery, with partial reformation at the carotid canal at the proximal carotid canal and thombitc in etiology related to atherosclerotic disease.
Acute infarct in the left parietal and insular region, in the MCA territory, with a larger area of reversible ischemia surrounding.
Both the areas of infarction and reversible ischemia are incompletely imaged on the present study, with upper limits not being included.
Atherosclerotic disease, in the right common carotid artery bifurcation, extending into the proximal cervical internal carotid artery, resulting in approximate less than 50% stenosis.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine mild-to-moderate, incompletely characterized on the present study.

Procedure note- [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 82957**] underwent cerebral angiography and emergent stenting and angioplasty of his left internal carotid artery and mechanical thrombectomy of the left middle cerebral artery without any complications.
Study Date of [**2200-6-4**] 1:54 PM, MRA brain In comparison with the most recent examination, again areas of subacute ischemia are redemonstrated involving the left caudate and lentiform nuclei without evidence of hemorrhagic transformation, the areas of ischemia also involve the left insular and temporal lobe extending the convexity, vascular territories of the left anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries.
The MRA of the head demonstrates vascular flow in both internal carotids as well as the vertebrobasilar system, apparently the left medial cerebral artery is patent including the M1 and M2 segments, no evidence of flow stenotic lesions are identified in the posterior circulation or right internal carotid artery.
IMPRESSION: There is evidence of vascular flow in the left middle cerebral artery, including the M1 and M2 segments as well as the M2 bifurcation.
No flow stenotic lesions are demonstrated, the right internal carotid and the vertebrobasilar system arteries are patent.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest (patient unable to cooperate with maneuvers).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracardiac thrombus.
Normoglycemia and normothermia was achieved using sliding scale and tylenol prn.
It was felt that his carotid occlusive disease was atherosclerotic in nature.
