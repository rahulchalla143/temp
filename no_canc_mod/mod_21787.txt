Admission Date:  [**2106-2-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-3-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of COPD, CHF with LVEF 45% (from [**2101**]), CAD s/p CABG and past PCI, and AFib on Coumadin who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for shortness of breath and urinary retention from [**2106-2-12**] to [**2106-2-16**].
During the above admission, his SOB was attributed to a COPD exacerbation in the setting of a recent viral URI.
A chest X-ray performed during that admission did not show evidence of pneumonia.
One day after discharge, his family was notified that he was having increased work of breathing and shortness of breath while at rehab.
His CXR showed new opacities in the RUL field and LLL.
Labs were notable for a newly elevated WBC count 15.1 (7.1 the day before) with 5% bands.
His INR was 3.1, consistent with his recent trend with Coumadin held.
He was admitted to the ICU for further management of pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation.
Once in the ICU, he continued to have increased work of breathing and significant wheezing.
His course was complicated by delirium and he failed a bedside speech and swallow evaluation on [**2-19**].

There is patchy density in the right mid upper lung zone.
There is also retrocardiac opacity, small left pleural effusion.
[**2106-2-22**] MRA/MRI head IMPRESSION: Severe atheromatous disease with no evidence of acute infarction .
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferolateral dyskinesis, mid inferolateral akinesis, basal inferior/inferoseptal akinesis, mid inferior hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation are now more prominent.

He was noted to be aspirating and was seen by s/s who felt that it would be safest for him to continue with nectar thickened liquids.
His hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure and hypernatremia.
However, he developed volume overload and acute systolic heart failure and worsening SOB with BNP > 7000.
Echocardiogram revealed depressed LVEF 40% (new) with worsening valve disease and regional abnormalities.
He was not started on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]/ACE due to low GFR and rapidly changing renal function.
He was noted to have delirium in the ICU which was attributed to high dose prednisone.
However, he developed acute mental status changes on [**2-22**] and was essentially unresponsive.
Neurology was consulted due to concern for stroke but MRI/MRA did not reveal any acute infarct (severe severe small vessel disease and a large old CVA with hemorrhage that likely predisposed him to seizures or encephalopathy).
He had another episode of somnolence on the evening of [**2-26**] that was attributed to worsening respiratory status and acute heart failure.
During his hospitalization, he was treated with empiric Flagyl despite negative c-diff toxins because of new diarrhea and recent exposure to antibiotics.
However, because of worsening wheezing and rhonchi with radiological evidence of resolution of the multifocal pneumonia, his prednisone was restarted.
The patient had a type II myocardial infarction during this admission (demand ischemia) and was continued on aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker.
His atrial Fibrillation was rate controlled on metoprolol 50 mg TID.
Warfarin was held because of coagulopathy because of poor PO intake.
In regards to his chronic kidney disease stage 3-4 with an eGFR around 30, he was in acute renal failure on admission with peak creatinine of 2.9 which improved after IVF and remained stable.
He history of prostate cancer and intermittent urinary retention.
Flomax was restarted during this admission and he had no further episodes of urinary retention.
Because of worsening respiratory situation (despite treatment of pneumonia and confirmation of resolution with repeated CXRs), inability to treat heart failure because of hypernatremia, evidence of dementia with delirium, and advanced CKD with [**Last Name (un) **], several family meetings took place.
We advised comfort care, DNR/DNI and no re hospitalization.
