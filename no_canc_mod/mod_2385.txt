Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
There are no pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal areas of consolidation,the right lower lobe areas are concerning for pneumonia.
ECHO [**2192-9-12**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is an abnormal systolic flow contour at rest, but no left ventricular outflow obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
V/Q scan low probability .
[**9-19**] CT chest: As suggested on the prior chest radiographs, there are multiple linear opacities within the lung lobes, right greater than left consistent with atelectasis and/or scarring.
There are no focal areas of airspace consolidation, or pleural effusion.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen within the aorta, left anterior descending and right coronary arteries.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dyspnea/Hypoxia- no organism identified in sputum at outside hospital, and a sputum was unable to be obtained here.
She was begun on levofloxacin and vancomycin for community acquired pneumonia (started at OSH).
PA/LAT CXR showed a multilobar PNA.
She remained on her home asthma medications although she never showed any signs of obstructive disease on CXR or exam.
At this point the pulmonary consult team consulted and a Chest CT was obtained that showed diffuse scarring versus atelectasis.
A V/Q scan showed low-probability for PE.
Pulmonary consult felt that her hypoxia was due to shunt physiology and upon reviewing the CT scan felt her abnormal findings were most likely due to atelectasis.
Pt appears clinically euvolemic, had ECHO that showed preserved LVEF, with moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Hx of renal transplant - Ms [**Known lastname 13662**] was continued on her home regimen of prednisone 5mg and tacrolimus; her tacrolimus was decreased to 3mg [**Hospital1 **].
HTN - was continued outpt regimen of metoprolol, amlodipine, with good BP control .
7. suicidality: Ms [**Known lastname 13662**] expressed suicidal intent during this hospitalization which may have been related to anxiety over an oxygen facemask.
Given her hypoxia is thought to be from chronic underlying lung disease she is medically cleared to receive psychiatric treatment at this time with additional work-up/management as detailed above upon discharge  Medications on Admission: Transfer Meds: Tigecycline 50mg IV q12 Aztreonam 1 gm IV q12 Caspofungin 50mg daily Prednisone 5mg daily Prograf 5 mg po BID Protonix 40mg daily Lopressor 150mg [**Hospital1 **] Bactrim DS PO daily vitamin C 500mg daily Zocor 40mg MagO4 400mg TID Amlodipine 10mg daily Lovenox 30mg SQ Lantus 30 Units Ilotycin eye gtt Flovent 110mcg [**Hospital1 **] Xalatan eye qtt Alphagan eye qtt   Discharge Medications: 1.
