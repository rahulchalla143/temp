She was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for RV outflow repair and evaluation of her pulmonic valve.
She had increasing symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and recent cardiac MRA showed a severe pulmonic regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency.
She had cardiac catheterization performed on [**2182-3-28**], which showed normal coronary arteries, and was referred for RV outflow tract reconstruction and pulmonic valve replacement versus repair.

Percocet for pain management, and was satting 98% on room air, in sinus rhythm at 77, maintaining good blood pressure of 132/83.
