The patient had an abnormal electrocardiogram at primary care physician's office and left bundle branch block and was denied life insurance.
He was referred to cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who did an echocardiogram and found the patient to have cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of approximately 20 to 25%.
The patient was without symptoms.
The patient had a Holter monitor without ventricular tachycardia.
He had clean coronary arteries, but the biopsy procedure was complicated by bleeding, cardiac tamponade, decreased blood pressure and PEA arrest.
Repeat echocardiogram initially in the Coronary Care Unit showed a small collection of fluid.
JVD unable to assess given positive pressure of ventilation.
Distant heart sounds.
No distention.
Abdomen was soft with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Vitamin C.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has no known prior coronary artery disease.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No family history of coronary artery disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 50 year-old male with new onset unknown etiology cardiomyopathy who presents to [**Hospital1 1444**] for elective catheterization and biopsy.
Status post a catheterization a clean coronary arteries, status post perforation secondary to biopsy complicated by tamponade.
Pulseless electrical activity arrest status post tamponade drain, transient use of pressors, status post 2 units of packed red blood cells, status post intubation and had an echocardiogram in the Coronary Care Unit with only a small amount of residual fluid.
The final one after the pericardial drain was pulled on 9th showed trivial physiological pericardial effusion.
Regarding his cardiomyopathy initially and remained tachycardic during any motion.
Pulmonary:  The patient was extubated overnight on the 8th and had no respiratory distress afterwards.
He has no history of lung disease.
He had trouble recalling events around the time of the code, but otherwise had no focality on neurological examination.
Impression was subconjunctival hemorrhage likely secondary to the time of anticoagulation at the catheterization with the code and some possible refractory error in the left eye.
Status post myocardial biopsy.
