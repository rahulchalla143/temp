Admission Date:  [**2155-3-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2128-3-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2115-5-15**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39 year-old female with a history of AIDS, last CD4 count was 6, history of multiple opportunistic infections including PCP times four, thrush, CMV retinitis, CMV colitis, also history of asthma presenting with increased shortness of breath and chest pain recently discharged from [**Hospital6 15291**] with PCP on unclear antibiotics.
She developed progressively worse shortness of breath and sent to the Emergency Department for evaluation by the visiting nurse.
She had subjective fevers or chills, night sweats at home, plus exertional dyspnea, plus cough with white sputum.
Positive odynophagia/dysphagia, positive chest pain with breathing similar to past episodes of PCP.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chronic diarrhea has improved.
No hematemesis.
No urgency, no infrequency.
Chronic diarrhea.
Occasional social alcohol.
She is a middle aged woman in acute respiratory distress.
No scleral icterus.
No oral thus visualized.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Bilateral patchy infiltrates in right and left lung fields.
No pleural effusions, patchy infiltrates in both lower lobes predominantly.
She has not been treated for many years and has had multiple complications.
She is coming in acute respiratory distress with a recent diagnosis of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6643**] was inadequately treated.
She is allergic to Bactrim and so she was started on Primaquine and Prednisone and Clindamycin with little improvement.
A chest CT Was performed, which showed diffuse severe parenchymal lung disease with minimal uninvolved lung thus explaining the patient's significant respiratory distress even at rest.
She continued to spike fevers on the Primaquine and Prednisone, so she was started empirically on Levofloxacin and Zosyn and for a short time Vancomycin.
The Azithromycin is her [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis and Valacylcovir for CMV prophylaxis.
All cultures remained negative throughout hospitalization including blood, urine and myolytic cultures.
She had no meningeal signs or mental status changes during the hospitalization.
It is unclear what infectious [**Doctor Last Name 360**] or agents were responsible for the patient's continuing deleterious course, however it was felt by infectious disease consult as well as the medical team that PCP alone was most probably not responsible as she should have been receiving adequate therapy with the Pentamidine and steroids.
A CT of the chest as mentioned before showed massive infiltration of the lung consistent with PCP pneumonia making oxygen saturation with noninvasive ventilation to an adequate degree largely impossible.
Cardiovascular:  This patient was hypotension sporadically throughout the hospitalization.
Fever of unknown origin.
