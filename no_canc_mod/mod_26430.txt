The chest pain radiated to her neck and jaw.
It was associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis.
A chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
One sublingual nitroglycerin was given, and she became hypotensive.
She ruled out for a MI by enzymes.
However, a chest CT done at that time revealed an ascending aortic dissection originating at the level of the RCA, and she was emergently transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for definitive treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a non-Q-wave MI, AFib, hypertension, status post cholecystectomy, status post hemorrhoidectomy, TIA about 10 years ago, and question of cardiomyopathy.
ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.
Cardiac reveals a regular rate and rhythm with a [**5-11**] holosystolic murmur.
The extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema and palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilateral.
With this, the patient became extremely hypertensive and therefore was re- sedated.
It should be noted throughout this period that the patient had intermittent periods of atrial fibrillation, for which she was treated with amiodarone.

During the opposing times she required Nipride and/or nitroglycerin to control her hypertensive episodes.
