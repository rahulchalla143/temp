Admission Date: [**2107-8-20**]        Discharge Date: [**2107-8-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2033-4-27**]        Sex:  F  Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old female, with past medical history significant for schizophrenia, a recent T12 burst fracture complicated by bilateral lower extremity paresis, diabetes mellitus and COPD, who presented from her rehab with fever, change in mental status and hypotension.
In rehab, there was concern for pneumonia, so she was given empiric Flagyl and levofloxacin.
She subsequently developed respiratory distress and was intubated.
Her orogastric tube put out small amounts of reddish fluid.
She developed supraventricular tachycardia at a rate of approximately 150, subsequently read out as sinus tachycardia, and she was admitted to the ICU.
ALLERGIES:  Include Risperdal and an ACE inhibitor for which she developed angiolaryngeal edema requiring intubation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dementia, schizophrenia, history of GI bleed for which she declined work-up, gastroesophageal reflux disease, COPD, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, neuropathy, urinary incontinence, recent T12 burst fracture complicated by bilateral lower extremity paresis, status post T12 vertebrectomy and T11-L1 fusion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**].
Her OR course at that time was complicated by a lung collapse requiring a chest tube placement, spinal, status post PEG placement in [**2107-7-9**].
Chest: A few crackles at base, decreased breath sounds, no wheezes.
Cardiac: Normal S1, S2, II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard across the chest.
PEG tube without erythema or draining.
There were low-grade troponin elevations of 0.17 and 0.18, but there was no significant change throughout the hospitalization.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU, treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intubated for respiratory failure.
There was initial concern that she might have a source of infection in her low back from recent instrumentation.
Despite broad cultures, no specific organism was identified; however, during the hospital stay she was noted to have a left lower lobe consolidation which may be the primary etiology of her sepsis syndrome.
SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Patient had intermittent bursts of a     sinus tachycardia at a rate of approximately 140-150;     however, despite the cardiology read this could be an     atrial tachycardia, although flutter seemed unlikely.
She was noted to have several small bullous lesions on     her lower extremities which remained stable.
RELEVANT IMAGING STUDIES:  CT of the chest,INDICATION:  Fever, altered mental status.
Recent spine surgery.
TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis were acquired with the use of intravenous and oral contrast material and displayed with 5-mm slice thickness.
COMPARISONS:  No prior studies are available on PACS for comparison.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, left larger than right and small left pleural effusion.
The heart appears normal and there is no pericardial effusion.
There are coronary artery calcifications and calcifications of the aortic arch and left subclavian origin.
There are stable mediastinal lymph nodes, [**Location (un) **] of which meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
No hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy is seen.
A metallic cage is seen in the space that appears to be resected T12 vertebral body.
No paravertebral fluid collection is seen to suggest the presence of an abscess.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The gallbladder contains several gallstones but no signs of cholecystitis are seen.
The liver, spleen, pancreas, stomach and small and large bowel loops appear unremarkable.
No free air is seen.
There is no ascites.
No localized fluid collections are seen to suggest the presence of an abscess.
The right adrenal gland appears normal, the left adrenal gland contains a 19 x 16 mm nodule which may represent an adenoma but cannot be fully characterized on this single phase study.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST:  There is sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
The uterus is not well seen, and may be atrophic or surgically absent.
No free fluid is seen in the pelvis.
No abscess is seen.
No pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.
There is a bony defect in the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] consistent with a bone graft harvest site.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
Status post extensive spine surgery without evidence of paraspinal abscess.
Bilateral dependent atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Multiple hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys, too small to characterize.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Possible left adrenal adenoma.
A dedicated CT may be performed for further evaluation if clinically inicated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A new patchy infiltrate is seen retrocardiac in the left lower lobe representing either atelectasis or consolidation.
Atelectasis versus consolidation in left lower lobe.
-Senna  8.6 mg Capsule  Sig:  One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
-Lactulose  10 g/15 mL Solution  Sig:  Three (3) PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Left lower lobe pneumonia.
19 x 16 mm nodule left adrenal adenoma, outpatient follow-up     recommended.
Chronic gastrointestinal bleed for which she declined     gastrointestinal work-up.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Diabetes mellitus.
Urinary incontinence.
Chest tube placement for lung collapse.
Laryngeal edema requiring intubation secondary to ACE     inhibitor.
