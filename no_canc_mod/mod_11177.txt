She previously had refractory ascites in early [**2145**], and underwent placement of TIPS for this reason.
She was then doing well and was without significant ascites on aldactone.
US [**11-18**] showed increased velocity in the TIPS.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**Date range (1) 40579**] with increasing SOB, received 60 mg lasix underwent removal of 10 L of ascitic fluid, with resolution of SOB.
She was doing well until [**12-18**] when she presented for routine labs and was found to have renal failure beyond her baseline (creatinine 2.0 elevated from recent b/l 1.5) and hyperkalemia to 5.4 with peaked T waves.
On acceptance to the medicine team, she complains of epigastric pain, worse with lying and accompanied by a sour taste.
Also no chest pain or shortness of breath.
No urinary symptoms.
Intraoperatively you way hypotensive to SBP 70s, treated with 1L 5% albumin and neo gtt without complication.
[**Name (NI) **], pt again became hypotensive to the 70s, asymmptomatic and resolve with 50g 25% albumin and 500cc NS.
States she's had some mild abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: # ESLD secondary to HCV cirrhosis - Hep C dxed [**2126**], unknown exposure: no hx transfusion, IVDU, tatoo placed after hep C diagnosis - genotype IA, treated with multiple courses of interferon unsuccessfully - bx [**2140**] stage 3-4 fibrosis - hx encephalopathy, - grade 3 varices banded [**3-5**].
No history of variceal bleeding.
+ history of hemorrhoidal bleeding.
- hx refractory ascites, s/p TIPS [**2145-3-19**], revised [**8-3**] after presenting with recurrent ascites - on transplant list # Renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 1.5 per OSH records but previously has bumped to >2 # Diastolic CHF # Asthma # Depression # Anxiety # GERD # IDDM # Seizure disorder # Hypertension # OSA # Refractory nausea - controlled with reglan - ?
gastroparesis # s/p CCY # h/o Asthma - stable # Pancytopenia - related to ESLD .
Family History: Family History: no family history of liver disease  Physical Exam: Admission PE:  T 96.1  89,  100/58, 23, 99/RA Gen: no apparent distress, appears well HEENT/NECK: could not visualize JVP, supple, oropharynx clear, sclera anicteric Cor: regular, 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border Pulm: lungs clear bilaterally except fine bibasilar crackles posteriorly Abd: Distended, soft, nontender.
No rebound, no guarding.
Ext: trace pitting edema bilaterally, warm Neuro: A&O x 3, appropriate, coherent historian, no asterixis.
No evidence of ischemia.
Radographic studies: .
There is a lack of wall-to-wall flow in the mid to distal TIPS, suggestive of neo-intimal hyperplasia.
Brief Hospital Course: A 57 yo woman with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS is transferred from OSH with refractory ascites for consideration of TIPS revision.
# Ascites: The patient had large ascites on exam but was not uncomfortable.
Ultrasound showed lack of wall-to-wall flow in the mid to distal TIPS, suggestive of neo-intimal hyperplasia.
Diuretics were held for elevated creatinine.
PPI was continued for reflux symptoms likely secondary to ascites.
# Hypotension:  Intraoperatively while under general anesthesia, patient was hypotensive with SBP 70s.
Initial hypotension likely related to anesthesia and fluid shift from large volume paracentesis.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine at OSH was increased from baseline 1.5 to 2.0.
Urinary sodium was <10, consistent with prerenal vs HRS.
She was discharged off all diuretics with plans for lab tests in 3 days to monitor kidney function given that she had large volume paracentesis on the day of discharge.
# UTI: She had had a recent E Coli treated with Bactrim at an outside hospital.
# Pancytopenia: Hematocrit and platelets were at baseline.
