Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Partial small bowel obstruction.
Your fever was likely due to the strep throat that you had, for which you received a course of antibiotics.
Your nausea and vomiting was from a partial small bowel obstruction which has resolved with conservative treatment.
You also had some tests to evaluate for vitamin deficiencies as a cause of your ongoing symptoms, however your B12 and folate levels came back in the normal range.
We also spoke with the rheumatologists concerning your dry mouth and eyes.
Finally, you had a cortisol level drawn which was slightly low at 4.9, which indicates that you may have a condition called adrenal insufficiency.
This may be a cause of many of your symptoms and you should discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 438**] what further tests you may need to confirm or disprove this diagnosis.
