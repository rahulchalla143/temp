Admission Date:  [**2177-12-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-1-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-1-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain/nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation IR guided nephrostomy placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 78y/o WF w/a PMH significant for HTN and afib who presented to an OSH w/ complaints of abd pain and nausea.
She was found to have a R ureteral stone w/ resultant hydronephrosis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ureteral stent placement.
Her INR was found to be elevated when admitted and, in the course of waiting for this to normalize, the patient spiked a temperature to 105 and became hypotensive to the 70s.
However, tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture, afib, and increased dyspnea.
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for >24hr on this regimen.
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem and has been in NSR since this time.
HTN 2.
Cataract disease 4.
[**12-2**] closed fracture of radius s/p closed reduction 5.
There is cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with small bilateral pleural effusions consistent with CHF.
No pneumothorax.
CT Abd [**2177-12-29**]: 1) Moderate to severe right hydroureteronephrosis with two obstructing distal right ureteral stones, 8 mm and 6 mm respectively.
2) Probable obstructing 5mm right mid ureteral calculus causing mild hydroureter, though it is difficult to tell definitively if this stone is within or just medial to the right ureter on this CT without IV contrast.
3) Small bilateral pleural effusions.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical  quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic  valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is present.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

She originally had hypotension and a leukocytosis in the ER and was admitted to the MICU.
However, tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture, afib, and increased dyspnea.
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for >24hr on this regimen.
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem on the day of call-out.
Sepsis - The patient was septic in the ER and her blood cultures eventually grew proteus.
She has been afebrile since she was called out to the floor.
3. a.fib - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation controlled with beta blockers at home.
After this, the patient had no further problems with her rate control.
She will be d/c w/out her heparin as she is trending upwards with her INR and has no MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 65330**]c heart disease.
4. delirium - The patient had troubles with agitation while in the MICU.
