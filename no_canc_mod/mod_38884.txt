In the Fall of [**2139**], she developed chest pain and sought care at [**Hospital3 **].
She underwent a persantine mibi in [**11/2139**] which suggested a small, mid territory of distal anterolateral ischemia with an ejection fraction of 52%.
This revealed moderate mitral regurgitation.
A repeat persentine Mibi showed anteroapical ischemia similiar to her previous study and possible inferoapical reversibility.
She has noted more angina recently and  was referred for a cardiac catheterization in preparation for knee surgery.
Given the significance of her coronary disease and worsening angina, she has been referred for surgical management.
