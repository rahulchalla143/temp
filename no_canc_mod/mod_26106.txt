She was brought to [**Hospital3 22439**] where she had a head CT that demonstrated SAH, b/l frontal contusions with IPH, R temporal pneumocephalus, and non-displaced occipital bone fracture.
Past Medical History: Parkinson's disease w/ signs of mild dementia, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, Moh's procedure.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: Upon admission:  Physical Exam:  Vitals: T 97.9; BP 131/66; P 58; RR 16; O2 sat 100%  General: intubated, sedated HEENT: dried blood around mouth Neck: c-collar Extremities: no c/c/e.
Neurological Exam:  intubated, does not repsond to voice, PERRL, 4-->2mm with light, + VOR, + corneal reflex, no spontaneous movements, does not withdraw to pain, trace reflexes in UEs and absent in LEs.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion, increased from prior outside examination.
Occipital bone fracture on the left, with concern for sinus injury and venous epidural hematoma along the left occipital bone.
Subdural blood layers along the tentorium.
Nondisplaced clivus fracture with possible involvement of the right carotid canal.
No evidence of acute traumatic injury in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
Right adnexal cystic lesion and small amount of pelvic free fluid.
Chronic degenerative changes of the lumbosacral spine, with likely chronic malalignment at multiple levels as described.
MRA Brain [**2141-3-26**]: IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of dissection.
This is a limited examination related with motion artifacts, the distal branches of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are not clearly identified, either related with artifact or possible vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage, please correlate clinically.
Based the axial source images, no dissection or major vascular occlusion is identified.
Extensive subarachnoid, intraparenchymal and subdural hematoma, not significantly changed.
No shift of normally midline structures.
Mild prominence of the temporal horns which may represent early hydrocephalus although is unchanged when compared to prior exam.
Multiple skull fractures with possible involvement of the right internal carotid artery canal.
CT head [**2141-3-28**]: Mild decrease in the previously noted subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the occipital lobes.
No significant change in the areas of hemorrhage noted in the intraparenchymal, subdural and subarachnoid compartments, otherwise.
No new hemorrhage.
Multiple skull fractures are inadequately assessed on the present study.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 80 yo female w/ PMHx sig for Parkinson's, HTN, hypercholesterolemia medlflighted from [**Hospital1 6687**] after fall with evidence of SAH and frontal contusions on head CT.
She was brought to [**Hospital3 22439**] where she had a head CT that demonstrated SAH, b/l frontal contusions with IPH, R temporal pneumocephalus, and non-displaced occipital bone fracture.
