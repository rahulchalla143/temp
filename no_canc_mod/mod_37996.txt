On further ROS she also notes mild occasional occipital HA, relieved by tylenol and baseline pain in upper thighs at rest [**3-7**] PVD and worse in LE with exertion.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

Possible bruit on R carotid CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
No m/r/g appreciated.

No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Initial angiography of the aortic arch was obtained revealing a type 1 aortic arch without critical stenosis atthe level of the arch.
The Left ICA has a tubular 80% stenosis present involving the bulb and extending into the proximal left ica.
Successful ptca and stenting of the left ICA utilizing spider filter for distal protection.
Successful deployment of a self-expanding  tapering 6-8x40mm protege carotid stent which was post dilated to 4.5mm.
Final angiography revealed a 10% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and brisk flow (see ptca comments).
Left internal carotd disease   Brief Hospital Course: #Carotid Stenosis: Pt with Carotid stenosis found on screening US.
Relatively high risk of stroke based on the degree of stenosis.
The Left ICA has a tubular 80% stenosis present involving the bulb and extending into the proximal left ica.
Left ICA was successful ptca and stented utilizing spider filter for distal protection.
Final angiography revealed a 10% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and brisk flow.
The AV block with slightly sccoped ST segments and new fatigue all suggest possible digoxin toxicity.
Concern because mobitz [**6-4**] worsen with vagal stimulation (and carotid stents frequently complicated by high vagal tone so her PCM backup rate was increased to 50bpm as above.
CAD: Cardiac cath on [**1-17**] showed stable coronary anatomy with known RCA occlusion supplied by collaterals.
Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline Cr.
#PVD: Hx of claudication S/P POBA to L profunda femoral artery.

You must continue to take this medication to prevent a blot clot formation in your carotid stent.
