Admission Date:  [**2125-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-4-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-3-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Acute right-sided weakness and aphasia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: t-PA   History of Present Illness: 23 year old man RH who presents as a code stroke, called at 9:52am.
He was in his USOH working out at the gym (treadmill and lifting weights) when he felt his right leg go "off" and he couldn't turn the treadmill off with his right hand.
He developed difficulty talking and comprehending spoken language but apparently someone at the gym noticed his symptoms and call EMS.
Patient currently states he has a mild headache (points to his left side), unclear onset or quality given language problems.
After t-PA, he did improve -> speech improved, more fluent, repeats cats climb trees, facial droop improved, no ataxia on the right, still strong.
NO complaints of headache.
Past Medical History: coarctation of the aorta s/p surgical correction at age 5, with bicuspid valve, no h/o migraines or headaches.
Social History: denies drug use, occ etoh, no smoking, moved here from [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2 months ago, lives with 5 other roommates, not married, no kids, works at a desk job in a bank, avid exerciser Father [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 67116**]  Family History: mom age 59 with CHF and "ministrokes", pat GM w/strokes in elderly years   Physical Exam: VITALS:  139/57, 86, 26, 98% RA GEN:  mildly anxious young man, very healthy appearing SKIN:  no rash HEENT:  NC/AT, anicteric sclera, mmm NECK: supple, no carotid bruits CHEST:  normal respiratory pattern, CTA bilat CV:  regular rate and rhythm without murmurs ABD:  soft, nontender, nondistended, +BS, no HSM EXTREM:  no edema .
No right/left mismatch.
Fundoscopic exam: discs flat, fundi clear, no hemorrhages or exudates.
No nystagmus or ptosis.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]:  shrug [**3-23**] bilaterally XII:  tongue midline without atrophy or fasciulations.
No fasciculations, + right upward drift.
No adventitious movements.
Coordination: + ataxia on finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin on right side only, slowed RAMs on the right side only.
3D reconstructions suggest occlusion, but a source imaging does indicate a small amount of antegrade flow through this tight stenotic portion.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK: The internal carotids, vertebral arteries, and basilar opacify without evidence for occlusion, dissection, or hemodynamically significant stenosis.
IMPRESSION: Marked narrowing of the superior division of the left MCA, that may be secondary to dissection.
MR is more sensitive for acute brain ischemia .
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  Left frontal vertex diffusion abnormalities, with an appearance strongly suggestive of embolic infarcts in the superior division, left MCA distribution, likely correlating with the patient's acute symptoms.
High-grade stenosis or embolic material in the proximal portion of the superior division, left MCA, distal to that MCA bifurcation, related to the above.
No definite evidence of dissection involving either the left MCA or the more proximal left ICA.
No evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis .
A patent foramen ovale is present(bubble study positive during cough and Valsalva maneuver release).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is a mild coarctation of the distal aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened; borderline/trivial aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient had a rapid recovery of motor function with normalization of speech and only slight pronator drift following tPA administration.
Various studies performed above showed that a PFO may have caused multiple emboli to reach the L MCA territory.
There were no complications to the hospital course.
Acute ischemic infarct (left middle cerebral carotid territory) 2. patent foramen ovale   Discharge Condition: Good; residual pronator drift   Discharge Instructions: Please take your medications as instructed.
