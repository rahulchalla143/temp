In addition, he has known severe mitral regurgitation which has been followed by serial echocardiograms which have demonstrated worsening mitral regurgitation and increased pulmonary pressures.
A repeat cardiac catheterization was performed [**2185-4-13**] which showed severe two vessel disease.
He occasionally experiences chest pain at rest.

The patient has a history of gastric bleeding and ulceration, and so gastric views were avoided.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The anterior leaflet is very myxomatous and elongated.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a mitral ring repair which has an eccentric jet of MR.
There is a prosthetic valve in the mitral position with no MR and a mean gradient of 3 mmHg.
Initial attempt was made to repair his valve, however a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed systolic anterior motion and an eccentric jet of mitral regurgitation.
He developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was cardioverted to sinus rhythm with the aid of amiodarone.
Coumadin was initiated for atrial fibrillation and a mechanical aortic valve with a heparin bridge until therapeutic.
His laboratory values revealed acute kidney injury and likely hepatic shock immediately post-operatively, but these values trended toward normalization with time.
He was treated for a Klebsiella pneumonia with meropenum and ciprofloxacin per the recommendations of the infectious disease service.
He did develop a moderate left pleural effusion.
It was decided to aggressively diurese this, rather than perform a thoracentesis in the setting of elevated INR.
By the time of discharge on POD 19 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
