Admission Date:  [**2137-12-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-1-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-1-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Indocin / Tigan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: Malfunctioning AV Graft  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thrombectomy  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 25922**] is a 58yo woman with multiple medical problems including DM, ESRD on HD, CHF with EF 25%, afib on amiodarone and coumadin, obesity and T11-12 vertebral fractures who initially presented to the hospital on [**2137-12-29**] with CC of clotted R AVG and increasing DOE and orthopnea c/w fluid overload.
wears 2LNC at baseline for unclear reasons as she has no diagnosis of COPD or other lung disease.
Past Medical History: CHF home O2, AF, RA, DM 20yrs on HD since [**1-11**], gastroparesis, GERD PSH: AICD (VFIB), cholecystectomy, cataracts, ovarian cysts drainage  Social History: Recently at [**Hospital1 1501**] since [**Month (only) 359**] s/p compression fx c/b osteomyelitis.
No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
Mediastinal lipomatosis.
Multinodular and heterogeneous thyroid gland with calcifications.
No definite evidence of interstitial lung disease.
Dedicated high- resolution CT of the chest would be more suitable for assessing for subtle interstitial changes.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 25922**] is a 58 yo woman with ESRD on HD, CHF, Afib, DM, obesity, and vertebral fractures, who presented with clotted AVG and DOE, was transferred to the MICU for further respiratory distress in the setting of narcotics, successfully reversed and diuresed and called out to the floor at her baseline O2 requirement.
Dyspnea/Respiratory Acidosis: While on the floor,the patient received narcotics for pain control and subsequently went into respiratory distress which largely responded to Narcan in the ICU.
She was treated with Zosyn/vanc for 5 days for possible aspiration along with hypotension on original presentation to the ICU (requiring levophed for less than 24 hours).
Her respiratory distress however, did not completely resolve and subsequent ABGs performed in the ICU suggested that her baseline is likely acidemia with pH of 7.2.
CXRs were negative for evidence of parenchymal lung disease (an initial concern given her amiodarone use) and w/u for PE was negative.
It was concluded that her respiratory acidosis likely represented a combination of restrictive picture secondary to her obesity, CHF and possible COPD.
Additionally, her respiratory decline began approximately 2 weeks prior to admission when her Digoxin was stopped, so this was restarted.
The patient was transferred back to the general medicine floor at her baseline oxygen requirement with no complications.
She continued to have oxygen saturations in the high 90s on 2L with no complaints of dyspnea.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.

Discharge Instructions: You were seen and evaluated for a malfunctioning AV graft as well as shortness of breath, which was thought to be due to fluid-overload from congestive heart failure.
You had to briefly go to the intensive care unit for management of your breathing and heart failure, after which you were evaluated for the malfunctioning AV graft.
* Please keep all of your follow-up appointments  * Call your doctor or go to the ER for any of the following:   fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain or   any other concerning symptoms.
