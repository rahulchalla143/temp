He remained seizure free in the hospital and his neurological exam on discharge was normal save perhaps some mild slowness of mentation/verbal responses.
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: recurrent seizures   Discharge Condition: stable, no neurological deficit.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for increased seizure frequency, which we believe occured in the context of your recent GI illness that likely lowered your seizure threshold.
Please return to the ER if you experience a significant increase in number of seizures or if you experience new types of seizures.
