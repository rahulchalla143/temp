Admission Date:  [**2192-8-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2192-8-15**]   Service:  ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old female with a history of osteoporosis and compression fracture, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic anemia who was transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital for further management of Clostridium difficile colitis with toxic megacolon, sepsis, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
The patient had recently been on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.
The patient complained of back pain and it was discovered she sustained a new compression fracture at T11.
An abdominal CT with intravenous contrast revealed no evidence for abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Over the subsequent days, she developed diarrhea accompanied by abdominal distention.
Abdominal films were suggestive of a dilated colon.
Stool studies proved positive for Clostridium difficile toxin times two, and the patient was begun on Flagyl.
The patient subsequently underwent colonoscopy on [**8-12**] which revealed diffuse colitis with pseudomembranes consistent with Clostridium difficile colitis.
She has concomitant leukocytosis from 11,000 to greater than 30,000 over her hospital admission and with this noted to have a fall in platelets as well as evaluated PT/PTT consistent with a DIC pattern.
The patient became increasingly unstable, later developing hypotension and mental status changes.
She was also found to have methemoglobinemia to 18%, presumably as an adverse drug effect related to dapsone.
Osteoporosis with back pain and multiple compression fractures at L1 and T11.
Peripheral edema.
Chronic anemia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The family describes a declining quality of life in recent months following ischemic stroke she sustained in [**2192-2-17**].
She suffered several falls following this incident, and the family also related evidence of cognitive decline consistent with early dementia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on presentation revealed an elderly white female who was intubated and in moderate discomfort.
Lungs revealed mild inspiratory crackles at the bases.
The abdomen was grossly distended with absent bowel sounds, profusely tenderness to palpation.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at around 100 beats per minute with a first-degree AV conduction delay, left axis deviation, with left anterior vesicular block, T wave flattening in I and aVL.
A chest x-ray showed left lower lobe atelectasis with small bilateral effusions.
Abdominal films revealed dilated sigmoid colon estimated greater than 8 cm in diameter.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 82-year-old woman with recent antibiotic exposure who developed severe Clostridium difficile colitis and toxic megacolon complicated by overwhelming sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
In addition, she had developed acute renal failure with anuria and profound metabolic derangement with lactic acidosis and shock requiring treatment with pressors.
Given her overall situation and overall extremely low probability of meaningful recovery, the family chose to withdraw further support.
Her pain was controlled.
Clostridium difficile colitis with toxic megacolon.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Acute renal failure.
