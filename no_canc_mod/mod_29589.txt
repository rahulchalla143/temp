He presented to his PCP today who found lower abdominal pain and referred him to the ED, where he was found to have EKG changes.
He was in his USOH until 6 days ago when he underwent capsule endoscopy as part of a continuing GI investigation of previous anemia and guaiac positive stools, despite a recently normal hematocrit.
He began to have loose stools the day before the procedure, while on a liquid-only diet for the procedure, and after the procedure noted nausea, diaphoresis and dizziness that has persisted until this admission.
The symptoms waxed and waned during the course of each day.
He also reports insomnia and anorexia.
Of note, he reports that these symptoms are very different from any prior episodes of CP, GERD or esophageal spasm.
His recent GI workup is for a h/o low Hct on prior admissions (to 34) and guaiac positive stools.
He denies CP, palpitations, syncope, SOB or edema.
He also denies vomiting, abdominal pain, black or bloody stools or urine, cough, fever, chills or night sweats.
Denies prior history of stroke, TIA, DVT or PE.
He notes regular use of stool softeners at home but no recent constipation.
He also notes recent extensive dental work and antibiotic treatment due to an abscess.
His PCP noted [**Name9 (PRE) 25714**] abdominal pain on deep palpation, which the patient says was reproduced in the ED.
In the ED, he was hemodynamically stable, NAD with no CP.
Initial vitals showed hypertension to SBP 190.
EKG changes were concerning for STE in the inferior leads, over a territory of a known old infarct.
CAD s/p MI, with h/o 11 stents - Two recent admissions in late [**Month (only) 547**]: the first admission the patient was taken to cath for CP and stented in the LAD and LCX.
The patient experienced an improvement in frequency and severity of symptoms after stent placement.
Hypertension 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
DM type II with peripheral neuropathy 5.
Obstructive sleep apnea - uses CPAP occasionally; states he does not need it this admission 6.
Esophageal spasm 7.
GERD - experiences symptoms 3-5 times per week 8.
Chronic back pain secondary to spinal stenosis s/p cervical laminectomy, s/p L3-5 laminectomy and L4-5 in situ fusion [**12-6**]  9.
Overactive bladder 10.
Restless leg syndrome 11. s/p cholecystectomy   Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: No early history of heart disease.
Brother with MI in 50s, died in 70s of MI.
No family history of sudden cardiac death.
Father died of prostate cancer at 51.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities.
No abdominial bruits.
Tenderness in midline lower abdomen to deep palpation, but without guarding or peritoneal signs.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls with an overall EF of 40%.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function with an EF of 40% and regional dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral hypokinesis consistent with CAD.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 yo man with DMII, HTN and an extensive cardiac history including known 3VD and multiple PCIs including 11 stents who now presents with 1 week of nausea, lightheadedness, diaphoresis and loose stools in the setting of recent capsule endoscopy for h/o anemia, found to have ST elevations in an area of prior ischemia.
# CORONARIES: EKG findings are nonspecific because of known prior inferior infarct.
The ST changes may represent a collateral vessel territory given known RCA occlusion.
Given no CP and low enzymes, not ACS or cardiac strain in the setting of hypovolemia and likely tachycardia from diarrhea and nausea, c/w lightheadedness.
From a cardiac standpoint there are no acute issues.
Echo today showed mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function with an EF of 40% and regional dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral hypokinesis consistent with CAD.
No evidence of vegitations on TTE given recent dental work.
# Abdominal Pain and symptoms: No abd pain at home but c/o nausea, loose stools.
[**Month (only) 116**] be residual discomfort from endoscopy, possibly with a subacute viral enteritis.
Given territory of pain, differential includes prostatitis or UTI, diverticulitis, infectious colitis or enteritis, UTI.
Low suspicion for appendicitis or PUD given clinical picture.
Recent endoscopy and colonoscopy were negative for sources of bleeding or diverticula (per patient).
Normal WBC and normal temps not suggestive of an acute infectious process.
In the setting of diarrhea and lightheadedness, likely prerenal related to mild hypovolemia.
# Diabetes - Hold home glucophage and glyburide; continue home lantus and add SSI.
# Dyslipidemia - atorva 80 mg daily, as above .
# GERD - Continue outpatient regimen of sucralfate and ranitidine.
Holding prilosec due to potential interaction with plavix.
# Chronic back pain secondary to spinal stenosis s/p L3-L5 laminectomy and an L4-L5 in situ fusion- PRN APAP for pain.
# Neuropathy - Continue home nortriptyline.
Decreasing neurontin dose to 300 q12h due to increased creatinine.
Considered neurontin toxicity as underlying cause of mild renal failure, nausea, diarrhea, but less likely.
# Overactive bladder - Continue home hytrin.
# Depression - Continue home effexor.
Nortriptyline 10 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
