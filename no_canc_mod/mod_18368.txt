Admission Date:  [**2113-5-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-9-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, altered mental status Intubated  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2113-5-17**] Ventriculostomy placement [**2113-5-18**] Cerebral Angiogram [**2113-5-31**] Tracheostomy [**2113-6-14**] PEG placement   History of Present Illness: 45yo male with history of IV drug use, endocarditis s/p MVR and PPM placement, and hepatitis C admitted to OSH with altered mental status.
He was found to have a subclavian DVT and a left brachial arterial aneurysm, which was thought to be secondary to injection of IV drugs.
He had an elevated WBC there and was febrile so he was started in azithromycin with improvement in both.
However, on [**5-8**], he became agitated and left the hospital AMA.
He returned to the ED on [**5-9**] and reported chest pain radiating to the left arm, headache, photophobia (no rigidity) and shortness of breath.
While there, he was found to be febrile with increasing shortness of breath.
CXR with no clear consolidation and he was scheduled to undergo a TEE to rule out endocarditis but the patient started withdrawing right before the procedure.
Later on during the hospitalization, he was found to have a dense aphasia and left hemiplegia.
Neurology was consulted and felt this could be secondary to meningitis vs embolic events.
CT scan demonstrated poor definition of perimesencephalic cisterns without asymmetry which was concerning for some increased intracranial pressure.
There was evidence of treated AVM with no other signs of acute or evolving territorial infarct.
CXR did not reveal a clear consolidation and he had elevated A-a gradient so he underwent a CTA which did not reveal a PE.
On day of admission a new right eye lateral deviation was noted on exam.

Hyperlucency in the upper lungs is again seen consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
There are some areas of increased opacification in the bases bilaterally.
However, there may be some pulmonary vascular congestion related to overhydration.
In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia on one or both sides would have to be considered.
Compared to prior examination of [**2111-9-20**], there are new infarcts in the spleen, right kidney in the lower pole and left kidney in the upper pole.

TCD [**2113-5-26**] Abnormal TCD evaluation.
Mild vasospasm was seen in the right proximal MCA.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2113-5-24**] overall extensive ST segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST segment depressions in the anterior leads have decreased suggestive of ongoing infarction.
The pre-existing parenchymal opacity in the retrocardiac lung areas is likely to be atelectatic, given the concomitant elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.

Normal appearance of the lung parenchyma, except for the known areas of hyperlucency in both lung apices.
CXR [**6-7**]: New opacification at the lung bases, confluent on the left, is probably due to atelectasis, conceivably attributable to aspiration.

# PONTINE INFARCATION AND ICH:  The patient presented with altered mental status, initially concerning for meningitis.
He had aphasia and left hemiplegia at the OSH prior to transfer, thought to be due to infection.
Neurology consult at OSH recommended stat head CT, which was negative for intracranial hemorrhage.
On [**5-17**] at 1100 he was noticed to have right eye deviation and to be non-responsive even to pain.
He was found on imaging to have both a pontine ischemic stroke and small intracranial hemorrhage.
The ischemic stroke may have been due to endocarditis leading to embolic event, particularly given the patient's open PFO.
As hospital course progressed, it was determined that bleeding had stopped and patient was restarted on heparin drip as bridge to coumadin for mechanical mitral valve.
#  ANTIBIOTICS FOR CULTURE NEGATIVE ENDOCARDITIS:  Patient continues on vanc IV 750 mg Q12 and gentamycin 80 Q12 for endocarditis through [**2113-6-28**].
#  HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The patient's initial respiratory failure was of unclear etiology, but was thought to be secondary to aspiration event in the setting of altered mental status.
OSH ABG demonstrated elevated A-a gradient, which could be suggestive of PE but CTA was negative for pulmonary embolus.
EKG with no acute ST changes.
TEE showed valve vegetation and open PFO.
However, he has been afebrile for the last weeks.
Patient will need a repeat ECHO to evaluate for endocarditis on [**2113-6-28**].
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Initially concerning for infectious etiology (meningitis, endocarditis).
On [**5-16**] patient was noted to have both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, responsible for his worsening mental status.
# HEPATITIC C: Chronic.
# DEPRESSION/ANXIETY:  Abilify and celexa were stopped during admission due to critical illness and change in mental status.
#  ANEMIA:  Patient with combination of iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease.
Patient's goal INR is 2.5-3.5 because of mechanical mitral valve.
Palliative care was consulted during this admission; below is an exerpt:  "I spoke with [**Doctor Last Name **] on the phone, who seems to have a fairly balanced perspective on the [**Hospital **] medical condition and prognosis.
Overall appears that pt's brother has realistic expectations and hopes for the pt's future course, and is able to acknowledge that quality of life is important for guiding future decisions if the pt suffers any future major medical complications.
Transitional Issues: --Repeat ECHO on [**2113-6-28**] to evaluate for continued endocarditis --Ensure INR is between 2.5-3.5 and overlap with heparin gtt for 48 hours --Daily creatinine checks while patient is on gentamycin --Vanc IV and gent through [**2113-6-28**] for culture negative endocarditis --PEG care --Check IV vanc and gent trough on [**2113-6-26**] --Twice weekly hematocrit checks --Tube feeds as recommended by nutrition --Neurosurgery follow-up --Consider starting ASA for CAD after patient is off heparin gtt and OK with neurosurgery --Continued goals of care discussion with family and palliative care team --Taper fludricortisone as above .

You originally came to the hospital because you had an ischemic stroke.
You subsequently had a bleed in your head and you needed a drain placed by neurosurgery to relieve the pressure.
You will need to follow-up with neurosurgery (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**2-24**] weeks for a CT scan and an appointment.
You will be discharged on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
You were given a blood transfusion on [**2113-6-20**] for low blood counts probably because of iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease.
You were started on a medication called fludricortisone to treat low sodium levels.
You will continue on vanc IV 750 mg Q12 and gentamycin 80 Q12 for endocarditis through [**2113-6-28**].
