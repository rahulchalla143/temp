Head CT [**2116-2-8**] FINDINGS:  There is no sign of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the normally midlined structures, or hydrocephalus.
There is no change in the appearance of the brain since the previous day's exam.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the  left atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis/dyskinesis of the distal septum/septal apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSION: Regional wall motion abnormality c/w CAD.
No definite cardiac source of embolism identified.
No focal, lateralized, or discharging abnormalities were noted.
SLEEP: The patient drowsed intermittently but failed to maintain stage I or enter stage II sleep.
No abnormalities were noted at this time.
CARDIAC MONITOR: No arrhythmias noted.
IMPRESSION: Normal waking and mildly drowsy EEG.
Head CT [**2116-2-10**] FINDINGS:  Again, there is no loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation,  new intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or mass effect.
There is no evidence of a major vascular territorial infarct.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the right ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of a new infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: 80yo woman with history of previous TIA's, coronoary artery disesae, Alzheimer's disease, and atrial fibrillation transferred from OSH with left MCA infarct after receiving tPA.
Stroke:  No evidence of acute stroke were found on subsequent imaging studies.
It was felt that the patient's decreased arousal and loss of right sided motor function likely represented a delirium and superimposed TIA.
Additionally, she developed some myoclonic jerks and asterixis bilaterally, thought to be consistant with a metabolic insult.
Echocardiogram was done which showed no embolic source.
A speech swallow study was done which showed risk of aspiration, and and NG tube was placed for tubefeeds and meds.
She was advanced to thin liquids/ground solids, with 1:1 sitter during meals to watch for risk of aspiration.
ID:  the patient was found to have a urinary tract infection, and was started on levofloxacin [**2116-2-11**].
Culture grew coagulase negative staph and Grp B strep.
The diarrhea is likely due to the tube feeds; however, given her concurrent antibiotic treatment, if diarrhea continued, C. diff infection should be considered and ruled out.
Mental status:  the patient has a history of Alzheimer's dementia.
These were attributed to delirium caused by her urinary tract infection and hospital psychosis.
These medications were discontinued due to concern of worsening delirium.
The patient was continued on her outpatient Risperdal and supplemented with Seroquel for continued agitation and sleeplessness.
She should be observed while eating for risk of aspiration.
She is not treated with anticoagulation given her fall risk.
Medications on Admission: Aspirin 81mg daily Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **] Digoxin 0.125mg daily Aricept 10mg QHS Risperadol 0.25mg [**Hospital1 **] Xanax 12.5 prn Sinemet 25/100 TID Vit E daily SL nitro prn  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1894**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. possible stroke in left MCA territory.
post t PA, with right hemiparesis and aphasia resolved 2.
Afib   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Return to care for significant changes in mentation, or weakness or speech deterioration.
