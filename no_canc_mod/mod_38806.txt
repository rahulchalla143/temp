Reopening of recent laparotomy with gastric wall biopsy and [**Location (un) **] patch of gastric perforation, [**2120-12-27**].
Exploratory laparotomy, Washout of abdomen, Placement of jejunostomy and multiple abdominal drains.
[**2121-1-9**]   History of Present Illness: 74M s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] patch for perforated antral ulcer [**12-22**] xfer from OSH w hypotension, pressor requirement and free air/fluid likely [**1-23**] re-perforation.
In usual state of health until presented to OSH [**12-23**] w four days of abdominal discomfort.
ED workup at OSH revealed perforated gastric ulcer for which patient was taken to OR for [**Location (un) **] patch repair of perforated antral ulcer.
Postop course notable for self-limited episode of unresponsiveness of unknown etiology.
Given narcan with equivocal improvement.
Xferred to OSH ICU for further care.
In 24 hours prior to xfer patient became increasingly hypotensive, dyspneic and distended.
CT showed increased intra-abdominal free air/fluid.
As pt developed pressor requirement likely [**1-23**] abdominal sepsis decision was made to xfer pt to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgmt.
Complains of mild shortness of breath (on supplemental O2) and moderate abdominal pain.
No nutrition since [**12-22**].

No pulmonary embolism or acute thoracic aortic pathology.
Moderate right and a small left pleural effusions with near-complete right lower lobe and partial left lower lobe atelectasis.
Moderate amount of intraperitoneal free fluid and air, with a few locules of air are seen adjacent to the gastric antrum.
Large anterior abdominal fluid collection with an air-fluid level.
Multiple loculated fluid collections within the abdomen, some of which have increased in size since the prior study.
No definite signs of infection.
Improvement of pneumoperitoneum with residual small foci of gas noted.
New fluid around anterior abdomen drain.
Unchanged small left and moderate right pleural effusion.
Concentric gallbladder wall edema, likely secondary to third spacing given the patient's hypoalbuminemic state with evidence of volume overload.
The gallbladder is not particularly distended and there are no gallstones identified.
If there is a very high clinical concern for acute acalculous cholecystitis, further evaluation could be performed with a HIDA scan.
Small volume ascites and right pleural effusion, as on prior CT from [**2121-1-9**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Surgical ICU on pressors, had a central line and arterial line placed and then was taken to the OR for emergent  reopening of recent laparotomy with gastric wall biopsy and [**Location (un) **] patch of gastric perforation.
After extubation, patient exhibited confusion and sundowning consistent with mild ICU psychosis.
Intermittent confusion remained upon transfer to the floor, but improved during stay back to normal AAOx3 baseline.
Pt received quetiapine prn confusion while on floor.
He was readmitted to the ICU on [**2121-1-8**], shown to have a collections on CT scan and taken to the OR on [**2121-1-9**] for exploration and washout.
He returned intubated and sedated and his post-op course was complicated by hemodynamic instability and a need for pressors and prolonged ventilation.
CV: Patient was initially hemodynamically unstable likely due to sepsis from abdominal source and required multiple pressors in the initial pre and post-operative period which was ultimately weaned to a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**], Levophed.
Patient developed SVT on POD#5 that was controlled with metoprolol and then diltiazem drip/ Patient was started on intermittent Lasix for diuresis and Diltiazem drip was converted to po.
Pt was also placed on 20mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, with good urine output for diuresis.
However, sepsis recurred on [**2121-1-8**] with suspicion for recurrent leak and patient was taken to the OR emergently on [**2121-1-9**].
GI: After abdominal washout and repair of the perforation in the OR, he was kept NPO with NGT and IVF.
JP drain was also placed in the OR, output was measured daily and it was removed with minimal serous drainage.
An UGI was performed with no evidence of leak or obstruction and patient was started on a regular diet.
However, patient began to have confusion, nausea, and abdominal pain on [**2121-1-8**].
Patient was transferred back to the ICU and CT scan was performed, showing recurrence of his gastric leak.
Despite drainage and washout, patient had persistent fevers and leukocytosis.
Cultures were negative for bacteria.
Over the following week, patient's fevers resolved with normalization of his WBC count.
GU: He was in acute kidney injury likely from sepsis.
His Cr was 2.5 on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] and was monitored, trending down to 0.8. he was also noted with scrotal edema, likely related to low albumin and aggressive fluid resuscitation while septic.
No further plans for dialysis per Nephrology despite his rising creatinine- it was felt that this would improve ove time and to continue with close monitoring of his electrolytes.
All negative except for several BALs and sputum growing small amounts of yeast (<100,000) and a [**1-15**] mini BAL culture that grew pan sensitive pantoea species.
PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
8. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for pruritis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 32674**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Antral ulcer perforation Sepsis Pulmonary edema Acute kidney injury Hypernatremia Hypokalemia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions:  You were admitted to the Acute Care surgery service for perforation of an antral ulcer and septic shock.
You required 2 more operations due to complications and now have a specialized dressing on your abdomen called a VAC dressing.
This allows for quicker wound healing.
JP Drain Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
