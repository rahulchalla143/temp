Bilateral pleural effusions.
Moderate ascites.
CXR [**11-12**]: Bilateral lower lobe opacities, possibly representing aspiration or atelectasis.
CXR [**11-13**]: Basal densities developing over the last two days and are suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions.
Complete PA and lateral chest view is recommended for further confirmation of the somewhat subtle findings.
A previous abdominal chest CT of [**2149-11-12**], included images of the basal portions of the lungs disclosed bilateral pleural effusions as well as some atelectasis in the dependent portion of the posterior segments.
CXR [**11-14**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**11-13**].
Minimal interstitial edema persists along with left lobe atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
RLE LENI [**11-15**] 12pm: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 56yo man with h/o poorly controlled DM admitted with DKA secondary to medication non-adherence in the setting of depression.
This was initially thought to be a stress reaction similar to that evidenced in a prior admission, but after one blood culture grew E coli he was started on levofloxacin and flagyl.
As such, the levofloxacin was continued only for a 7 day course for possible pneumonia (CXR with unclear basal opacities on initial read).
This was most likely secondary to dehydration from the hyperglycemia.
Hyperkalemia - On admission, he had peaked T waves on ECG and a K of 8.3.
His hyperglycemia was treated with IVF and insulin, and he received calcium for the hyperkalemia.
He had no evidence of active ischemia during this admission.
He had no evidence of withdrawal.
Disp:*1 mo supply* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Diabetic ketoacidosis cardiomyopathy Acute renal failure - secondary to volume depletion.
Depression History of substance abuse.
He still has minimal abdominal pain, no other complaints.
Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, dizziness, high blood sugars, diarrhea/loose stools, or any other concerning symptoms.
