Patient's daughter states that pt awoke this morning with severe shortness of breath.
She reports one episode of chest pressure in the last 24 hours, which came on at rest and resolved within seconds.
She was initially given SL Nitro and SBPs dropped from 150s to 50s, which then came up to low 100s with 250 cc bolus after 2 minutes.
CXR was consistent with volume overload, with a possible increased opacity in the RLL.
Her daughter also notes that she has had [**2-3**] episodes of chest pressure over the last several weeks, relieved with nitroglycerin.
CARDIAC HISTORY: # CAD s/p MI with CABG in [**2110**] (in [**Location (un) 74814**], [**State **]) # PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: DES X2 in OM/Cx placed in [**2118**].

Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation # Atrial Fibrillation per OSH records .
Multifactorial origin thought to be secondary to atrophic right kidney, longstanding hypertension, and prior cardiac events.

GENERAL: Elderly russian speaking female, no acute distress, on nasal cannula.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with no JVD appreciated.
[**2-6**] holosystolic murmur at LSB.
No thrills, lifts.
nild bibasilar rales, R>L, No wheezes.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Overall there is apparent heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.
Slightly more confluent opacity at the right lung base may be secondary to focal edema versus a concurrent infectious infiltrate or aspiration.
Recommend repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection.
Renal U/S [**2124-10-20**]: The right kidney is atrophic, measuring 8.7 cm, with an echogenic cortex and mild hydronephrosis.
There is a 1.2 cm calculus within the right renal pelvis, similar to that seen on the prior CT examination.
There is a 1 cm exophytic simple cyst arising off the upper pole of the right kidney.
No stones or hydronephrosis is noted within the left kidney.
Within the upper pole is an anechoic 1.9 x 2 x 1.7 cm cyst without internal vascularity compatible with a simple cyst.
An 8 mm simple cyst within the mid pole appears similar to the prior CT examination.
Previously noted hyperdense lesions on the prior CT within the left kidney are not clearly noted on the current ultrasound.
No ureteral jets were visualized during the examination.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 74813**] is an 83 year-old female with a history of CAD s/p multiple PCI, multiple MI's, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 15-20% and PPM/ICD in [**2116**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with worsening shortness of breath secondary to an acute systolic CHF exacerbation .
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC CHF EXACERBATION: TTE in [**4-/2124**] showed EF 15-20%.
There is substantial evidence to support pulmonary edema secondary to CHF exacerbation, including history of drinking more fluid recently, bilateral rales on exam, and chest x-ray findings.
She was ruled for for MI as an underlying cause.
Her digoxin was held at the time of discharge given her impaired renal function.
She was provided with teaching about how to manage her CHF at home including fluid restriction and low sodium diet.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Her baseline creatinine is 1.5 as of [**4-/2124**], was 2.3 in [**7-/2124**], 2.5 on admission.
FEurea 47%, indicative of an intrinsic renal process.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: .
# CAD: MI with CABG in [**2110**] with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 in OM/Cx placed in [**2118**].
Has ruled out for MI during this admission with negative EKG's and CE's x 3.
Her [**Last Name (un) **] was held due to acute kidney injury but was re-started at the time of discharge and she was started on spironolactone.
# HTN: Her home [**Last Name (un) **] was held while in-house due to acute kidney injury, but her beta blocker was continued.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) Digoxin: Her digoxin was held during this admission and at discharge given her impaired renal function.
This could be re-started as an outpatient for symptomatic management CHF but levels should be monitored periodically.
2) [**Hospital1 **]-Ventricular Pacing: She has a mildly widened QRS of 170ms and lowish EF of 15-20% and may benefit from biventricular pacing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 74817**] homecare Inc  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure excacerbation Acute kidney injury .
Secondary: Coronary artery disease Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Hyperlipidemia Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were complaining of shortness of breath.
We think that your shortness of breath may have been due to having too much fluid in your body.
We gave you some medications to help remove some of this excess fluid and your breathing improved.
When you initially came to the hospital, your kidney function was also not doing so well, but it improved as we took off all that excess fluid off.
