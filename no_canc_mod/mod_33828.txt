Two weeks ago she noticed increased SOB with exertion and a feeling of chest tightness.
The patient was noted to be short of breath and was sent to the ED.
Patient's examination was notable for weakness of neck extensors and mild fatiguable weakness at the deltoids.
She had no ptosis or diplopia with sustained upgaze and was able to count to 36 in one breath.
Her NIF was -80 and vital capacity was 0.8 L.  It was thought her presentation was consistent with an exacerbation of her myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] and she was admitted to the neurology ICU.
She reported subjective improvement in her shortness of breath and proximal muscle strength each day.
At time where she was found to have a low vital capacity she was still able to count to 20 in one breath.
The patient was also evaluated by interventional pulmonology given her history of tracheomalasia.
She continued to have some tachycardia with ambulation which was felt to be related to her pulmonary function as well.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] Tracheomalacia Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent Neurologic exam was notable for 4+/5 weakness at the next extensors, and right deltoid, triceps with fatigueability.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for increasing shortness of breath and weakness.
This was thought to be consistent with your myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
Your blood sugars where noted to be elevated and your lantus dose was increased to 18units in the morning.
