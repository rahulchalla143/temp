Admission Date:  [**2195-10-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2195-11-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2130-9-4**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of cardiology to evaluate this 64 year old, Hispanic male, with several years of anginal pain.
Prior to admission in [**Month (only) **], he had a myocardial stress perfusion study that showed reversible ischemia, as well as areas of the left apex and apical and lateral regions.
The plan was to electively do a cardiac catheterization but he developed unstable angina in the left upper extremity and pain.
The Emergency Room evaluation revealed a new anemia with a hematocrit of approximately 25.
He ruled out for myocardial infarction.
On [**8-6**], he did finally have his cardiac catheterization which showed no flow limiting coronary artery disease but he did have an ascending aortic aneurysm of approximately six cm.
There was mild to moderate aortic insufficiency with no significant AS noted.
The left ventricular function was mildly depressed with an ejection fraction of approximately 45%.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma, question chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
He denied peptic ulcer disease, liver or kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack or myocardial infarction.
He had no prior surgery and he had no known allergies.
He also has a history of hypertension.
He had a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, no S3 or S4 appreciated.
He had no crackles in his lungs.
When he was seen in [**Month (only) **], he did have an occasional wheeze but, on examination on the morning of admission, his lungs were clear.
When he was seen in [**Month (only) **], he had 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.
He was alert and oriented without any gross cranial nerve defects.
At that time, transesophageal echocardiogram was ordered, as well as the possibility of an upper gastrointestinal series and colonoscopy to evaluate the source of his bleeding.
Arterial blood gases was also done and he recommended increased blood pressure control and to obtain a CT scan and a magnetic resonance scan of his neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis.
Sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain.
On [**2195-10-23**], he underwent Bental procedure by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with a 28 mm gel-weave graft and a 23 mm aortic valve homograft.
The patient was fairly stable overnight with no bleeding.
He had minimal edema of his extremities.
We noted that he was approaching oliguric renal failure with probable ATN and/or hyperperfusion of his kidneys and a little bit of metabolic alkalosis.
They also recommended a renal ultrasound with Doppler flow, although there is suspicion of decreased renal flow which was low.
He did manifest left arm weakness at this point.
He was seen by the clinical nutrition team to evaluate his tube feeds and was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18079**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of neurology for a consult.
At the time of her examination, he did not follow commands or open eyes to any verbal stimulation but he did grimace to noxious stimulation.
She recommended Magnetic resonance scan of the brain to rule out an acute stroke or an intracranial MRA, to evaluate him for his continuing left upper extremity weakness.
There was no movement noted from his left arm at all.
He was restarted on Propofol for agitation and a rise in his blood pressure.
He remained in sinus rhythm on postoperative day number four but he did have some occasional premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions.
He had peripheral pulses by Doppler.
The magnetic resonance scan from the day prior was consistent with bilateral strokes on the right side, moderate to large, and the left side a small stroke.
The question was whether this was embolic in nature with tiny micro hemorrhages.
His chest x-ray showed consolidation of his left lower lobe.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] noted his water shed stroke bilaterally with right greater than left and a question of an aneurysm in his right internal carotid artery.
She recommended that he not receive any heparin at that time and that once he was fully awake, that he have a physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluation for video swallow.
On postoperative day number five, he had no events and no acute issues overnight.
His lungs were clear but he had copious secretions that require, to this day, constant and effective pulmonary toilette to keep him clear.
He had decreased breath sounds in his bases but his arterial blood gases were good at 50%.
He continued to have suctioning and turning frequently with tight control of his blood sugars.
On [**10-31**], he was bronchoscoped by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14968**] for mild whitish secretions.
No other obstructive pathology was found.
On postoperative day number eight, his betablocker was increased and he was periodically hypertensive and agitated.
He continued with his upper extremity weakness on the left side with no active or stimulus movements.
He followed commands appropriately and was able to withdraw his right and left legs to pain and stimuli but still had not moved his left arm.
On postoperative day number 11, he did have some respiratory alkalosis, which he compensated for.
He had bilateral rhonchi.
His extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There were no issues from a nutrition point of view.
Asthma, question chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
