Admission Date:  [**2167-12-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-8-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: # Left hip fracture s/p fall # Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: # Arterial line placement # Right internal jugular central venous line placement # Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 78F h/o COPD, presumed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis on home O2, CAD s/p MI, CHF and Afib, presented with L hip fracture s/p fall [**1-9**] lightheadedness after transitioning from sitting to standing while doing laundry on the day of admission.
Pt reported no LOC or seizure activity, and had fallen to the floor without striking furniture or head, remaining down approximately 30-40 minutes until a nursing assistant found her.
Pt stated that she also had noticed increased DOE and SOB x 1 week with yellow sputum, occasionally blood-streaked with recent epistaxis [**1-9**] nasal drying due to home O2 NC.
Pt had her flu vaccine this year and confirmed annual pneumonia vaccinations for the last 3 years.
Pt reported a sensation of midsternum "heartburn" which quickly resolved, and stated that her pain during her past MI felt more like pressure and was different than this sensation.
Ortho was consulted about her L hip fracture as seen on x-ray and recommended ORIF as soon as medically stable.
Pt was therefore admitted for further work-up of hypoxic respiratory distress, EKG changes, and consideration for surgical repair of her L hip fracture.

PELVIS (AP ONLY)  [**2167-12-21**] 7:55 PM Extensively comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of the left proximal femur, with marked varus angulation, as described.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-12-21**] 6:54 PM Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion, superimposed on chronic, diffuse interstitial process which (according to previous reports) represents known idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
There is no definite new airspace process.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
No thrombus/embolus is seen in the pulmonary artery.
Brief Hospital Course: 78F h/o COPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, CAD s/p MI, admitted to MICU with hypoxia and L intertrochanteric femur fracture.
# PEA arrest: Pt was noted to enter into PEA arrest while undergoing induction in the OR for ORIF.
Emergency TTE performed in the OR demonstrated severe global free wall hypokinesis at the dilated right ventricular cavity.
Pt was returned to the MICU, during which time she was ultimately placed on four pressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, dobutamine, and vasopressin), as well as NS boluses for hemodynamic support, and increased FiO2 for respiratory support.
Given her poor prognosis, family members decided to withdraw care; pt expired within minutes of withdrawing pressor and ventilatory support.
# L femur fracture: Orthopedics was consulted in the ED and recommended ORIF after pt was deemed medically stable.
Given h/o pulmonary disease and cardiac disease, MICU team discussed with the patient about risks associated with surgical repair, specifically perioperative MI and difficult post-op extubation.
Pt reversed her DNR/DNI status in order to undergo surgery, and in prepartion for surgery, received 2units PRBC given her low hematocrit.
During induction, pt entered into pulseless electrical activity while on the OR table and underwent 20min of CPR.
# CAD s/p MI: Lateral [**Known lastname **] depressions on admission EKG resolved on repeat EKGs with troponin T elevated to 0.10, possibly indicating some cardiac demand.
Pt reported "heartburn" but no chest pressure.
# Hypoxia: Pt was noted to have increased O2 requirement from baseline of 90% on 5L O2 NC, with DDx including PE (thrombotic vs fat in the setting of fracture), COPD flare, worsening idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, infection, or worsening heart failure with associated pulmonary congestion.
Pt improved rapidly overnight, indicating possible reversible cardiac etiology as also evidenced on EKG changes.
# Code status: Pt was initially DNR/DNI, but after deciding to proceed with hip fracture repair, reversed her status to full code.
