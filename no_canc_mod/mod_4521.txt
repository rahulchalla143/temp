Cough/Shortness of Breath: Questionable small infiltrate in left upper lung field in setting of low grade fevers, leukocytosis, and upper respiratory tract symptoms.
Likely represents exacerbation of patients known COPD in the setting of possible viral versus bacterial lung infection.
There may be a component of volume overload although no clear cardiac history.
Solumedrol weaned to prednisone for possible COPD exacerbation with plan for quick taper, which was completed while patient was in house.
On the floor, patient had an episode of persistent hypoxia to 85% on oxygen likely in the setting of delerium that was relieved with ativan and anti-psychotics.
She was satting >90% on discharge, but still had evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR and expiratory wheezes on exam.
Acute Renal Failure:  Baseline of 0.9-1.0 as of 10/[**2186**].
Likely prerenal in the setting of infection and decreased PO intake.
Hydration was changed to 1/2 normal saline in the setting of mild hypernatremia.
This is likely caused by a combination of being in a hospital setting with underlying infectious process and uremia.
Anion gap: The patient has an anion gap, likely secondary to dehydration in setting of decreased PO intake.
Depression/Anxiety: The patient was very tearful, anxious throughout hospitalization and reported ongoing difficulties with depression.
The patient had elevated FSG, likely secondary to steroid treatment, Humalog Insulin Sliding Scale tightened and pt restarted on home dose lantus.
FEN: Low Sodium / Heart Healthy / Diabetic Diet.
Prophylaxis: Patient was on PPI for GI prophylaxis and Subutaneous Heparin for DVT Prophylaxis.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q12H (every 12 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: COPD Exacerbation, Pneumonia and Delirium  Secondary: DM2, HTN, Lung Ca (s/p lung resection), depression   Discharge Condition: Vitals stable, O2 saturation >90% on 2 liters nasal canula.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with shortness of breath, which likely resulted from a combination of exacerbation of your COPD and a respiratory infection, likely pneumonia.
You were treated for pneumonia with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levaquin).
You were given nebulizer treatments and steriods (Solumedrol, followed by Prednisone) for COPD exacerbation.
Your kidney function has worsened over the past several days likely secondary to dehydration.
We treated you with a fast steroid taper which has completed while in the hospital.
We have held your Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide because of your acute renal failure.
We have also stopped your Advair Discus and switched you to Fluticasone inhaler, because you were tachycardic and because your are already getting Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.
We do not recommend that you receive any further antipsychotics or Lasix.
You should return to the hospital should your breathing worsen or you develop new chest pain, fever, severe cough.
