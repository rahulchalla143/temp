History of Present Illness: 60yo woman with PMH signficant for CAD s/p MI in [**2182**], San [**Location 68545**]fever s/p RUL lung resection, presents as an OSH transfer with two weeks R sided headache.
She reports her symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, when she had "flu-like symptoms" - body aches, headache.
She was concerned this was the San [**Location 68546**], as the body aches were similar (but were accompanied by fever and unclear if accompanied by headache, this time they were without fever and with headache).
She treated these symptoms with tylenol, alleve, and other cold medications but the headache did not go away.
She describes it as a shooting pain behind her right ear (never on the left side), constant and gnawing, with occasional "jolts" that cause her to lose her balance, become nauseous, and once vomit.
She went to the hospital when she could no longer stand the pain or the lack of sleep.
She found no aggravating or alleviating factors (?if ice may have helped), no change with position.
She had no preceding trauma, loss of consciousness, numbness, tingling, weakness, change in speech, difficulty thinking, bowel or bladder dysfunction, hearing problems, or diplopia.
She denies fevers or chills.
She presented to an OSH, where she had a HCT and was found to have a right sided subdural hematoma.
Further history became somewhat limited as she became more somnolent immmediately after receiving the dilaudid.

[**2199-9-15**] 7:40 pm URINE     Site: CATHETER                              **FINAL REPORT [**2199-9-18**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2199-9-18**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
**FINAL REPORT [**2199-9-18**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2199-9-18**]):    NO STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ISOLATED.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: Acute on chronic right subdural hemorrhage measuring 9 mm with 11 mm of rightward midline shift.
No evidence for acute ischemia, hydrocephalus or herniation.
Given the foci of acute hemorrhage within this chronic subdural collection, close short-term followup is recommended.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is subfalcial and uncal herniation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-9-16**] 11:07 AM IMPRESSION: Acute on chronic right subdural hemorrhage accompanied by rightward midline shift, subfalcial and uncal herniation, unchanged from prior exam.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-9-18**] 7:30 AM IMPRESSION: Status post right frontal craniotomy and evacuation of extra-axial hematoma, with small residual collection, and improvement in ventricular effacement, shift of the midline structures and uncal herniation.
Essentially unchanged appearance of the right frontal craniotomy site with small residual collection.
Unchanged degree of midline shift and mass effect on the right cerebral hemisphere from 9/27/06.2.
Hypodensity within the right temporal lobe probably represents contusion secondary to the recent craniotomy.
This contusion contains a linear hyperdensity which may represent a thrombosed vessel or hemorrhage.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2199-9-18**]):    NO STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ISOLATED.
She had a urinary tract infection for which she was treated; she was then prepared and consented for surgery as per standard.
Intraoperatively, there were no major complications which occured.
She had some complaints of bilateral eye swelling but no changes in her vision.
