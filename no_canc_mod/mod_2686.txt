In the MICU, pt was found to have ETOH withdrawl, possible GI bleed, elevated lactate, and alcoholic ketoacidosis.
Pt was seen by GI and felt to have likely [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tears and esophagitis given his cofee grounds on NGL.
GI also felt his BRBPR was from hemorrhoids or diverticulosis or polyps (given h/o polyps on [**2105**] colonoscopy).
# BRBPR: No gross [**Year (4 digits) **] noted on stools, all guaiac negative since admission, hct stable with no more abdominal pain.
Upon transfer to the floor, the pts hct was checked daily given he had no further evidence of bleeding.
The most likely etiology of lower GI bleed was felt to be hemorrhoids (ddx of diverticuli vs avm vs hemorrhoid).
They recommended EGD and sig or colonoscopy once pt is discharged.
Per GI, likely [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] vs esophagitis vs gastritis.
EGDs [**9-18**] have shown erythema in the antrum consistent with gastritis.
# Tachycardia: Pts HR was up to 137 on admission; on transfer to the floor it was 80s-100s.
# Metabolic acidosis: Gap resolved from 27 on admission to closing by [**12-28**].
Gap and non gap components: Per GI, gap acidosis was likely secondary to  ketones from starvation ketoacidosis,and lactic acidosis, etoh, n/v.
# HTN: Initially the pts metoprolol was held given concern for hemodynamic stability.
DM poorly controlled with A1c of 11.8.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: IVF hydration improved Cr from 1.7 to 1.1.
# CAD: s/p 3 stents in [**2-17**].
# TI: wall thickening shown on CT abdomen but no fever, no wbc, no abd pain, no diarrhea, exam belly exam unremarkable.
# Thrombocytopenia: likely [**1-17**] early cirrhosis and dilution, mild portal htn-->splenomegaly & sequestration.
