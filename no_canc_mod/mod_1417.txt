At around 2pm, she developed chest tightness, radiating to her L arm.
Cath revealed an ulcerated plaque in the prox-mid LAD with distal emboli.
Hemodynamics revealed normal R and L filling pressures and a CI of 3.2.
Past Medical History: - DM, type I: dx 9y ago, on insulin pump, no known complications, states HgA1C has been 8.4 x 1y, followed at [**Last Name (un) **] - HTN: reports SPBs in high 130s, on quinapril - Major depressive disorder: on bupropion and Trileptal - Cervical disc herniation: C5-6, moderate spinal stenosis, stable - vitamin B12 deficiency: monthly injections  Social History: married,  2 children, works at [**Company 2267**], exercises daily, denies tobacco and drugs  Family History: no heart disease or DM  Physical Exam: vitals- T 97.0, HR 80, BP 154/83, RR 14, O2sat 100% 2LNC General- young woman lying flat in bed, NAD, flat affect HEENT- sclerae anicteric, moist MM, OP clear Neck- no JVD, no carotid bruits Lungs- CTAB anteriorly Heart- RRR, 2/6 SEM heard throughout Abd- soft, NT, ND, NABS Ext- no LE edema, DP/PT pulses 2+ b/l  Pertinent Results: OSH ECG: NSR at 86, 6-8 mm STE in V4-6, 1 mm STE in V2-3/I/L/II, TWI V1 ECG p cath: NSR at 76, 4 mm STE in V5-6, <1mm STE I/L/II, TWI V1 ECG in CCU: NSR at 85, persistent 1 mm STEs V4-6.
Cath: 50% ulcerated prox-LAD with distal thrombus, LV apical segment occluded; no RCA disease.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
There is probable mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with a small area of focal septal apical hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Echo ([**2173-2-25**]): unchanged compared with prior study [**2173-2-23**] except focal dyskinesis involving the very distal apex is now present.
Chest X Ray: no acute process .
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 39F with diabetes mellitus type 1 x 9 years and mild HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 628**] with nausea, vomiting, and chest discomfort, found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis and to have large lateral ST elevations on ECG.
# CAD: admitted with an ST elevation myocardial infarction, s/p bare metal stent to mid-LAD.
Risk factors include suboptimally managed DM1 x 9 years (HbA1c in mid-8% range), mild HTN, mild hyperlipidemia with (LDL 108, TG ~90, HDL ~70 in [**10-26**]).
Echo on [**2173-2-23**] revealed preserved ejection fraction and no anterior wall dyskinesis.
ST elevations slowly improved post-cath but persisted even at discharge.
Repeat echo on [**2173-2-25**] revealed small area of dyskinesis at distal apex, which likely accounts for patient's persistent ST changes.
# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: pt initially with FS glucose in 300-400 range at [**Location (un) 620**], with low bicarbonate, and anion gap, all consistent with DKA.
Precipitant of pt's DKA was likely her acute myocardial infarction.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed): Take 1 tab for chest pain every 15 minutes x 3.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST elevation MI Diabetic ketoacidosis Hypertension   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: Please take all of your medications as prescribed.
If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, vomiting, or other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or go to the ER.
