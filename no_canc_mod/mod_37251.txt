Admission Date:  [**2117-1-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-1-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2033-12-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: left femoral to posterior tibial artery bypass left below knee amputation  History of Present Illness: Pt is an 83 y.o male with h.o CAD, s/p CABG [**2103**], HTN, PVD, COPD, CHF, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with difficulty ambulating d/t PVD.
There, he developed rapid aflutter and was noted to have NSTEMI with elevated biomarkers.
Stress test showed reversible ischemia (anterior and inferior walls).
Pt noted to have NSVT-short runs.
Pt reports chronic "angina" L.chest/neck/back/L.arm pain ~[**6-10**] days that is not accompanied by SOB/LH/palp/diaphoresis or nausea.
HE denies any increase in severity of symptoms prior to [**Hospital3 **] admit.
In addition, he denies any CP while hospitalized.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for current absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: # severe native 3vd, patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, 90% [**Hospital3 **] ostial lesion, diffusely diseased RCA with 85% lesion and patent SVG-RPDA.
CAD s/p CABG in [**2103**] with a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA, SVG to the OM ([**2103**]) .
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: HTN IDDM PVD s/p bilateral LE bypass now with dry gangrene of l 2-3rd toes.
COPD carotid disease CKD 4 BPH s/p TURP nephrolithiasis history of thrombocytopenia CHF chronic thrombocytopenia sciatica  Social History: Pt lives at home with his wife with [**Name (NI) 11964**] dementia.
History of heart disease in mother and father with DM.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
dry mucous membranes.
NECK: Supple with no elevation of JVP.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
crackles at the bases.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: +stasis dermatitis, +L.foot 2nd and 3rd toe arterial ulcers, PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ trace DP PT trace+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ trace DP PT trace+  Pertinent Results: CXR (portable AP) [**2117-1-15**]: No evidence of pneumonia.
CT head w/o contrast [**2117-1-15**]: Limited CT due to patient motion; however, no acute pathology identified.
If clinical concern for ischemia persists, an MRI with DWI is more sensitive.
ECHO [**2117-1-27**] - Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of apical function (LVEF = 35 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-1-14**], biventricular systolic function is more depressed and the severity of mitral regurgitation (previously minimal on review) is increased.
Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis is also now apparent.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 83 y.o male with h.o CAD s/p CABG, HTN, PVD, DM, COPD, CKD, CHF, chronic thrombocytopenia who presented to OSH with weakness, was found to have afib Vs. flutter, NSTEMI, reversible defect on PMIBI and transferred for possible cath.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Per last catherization, the patient has severe native 3-veseel disease, patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, 90% [**Year (4 digits) **] ostial lesion, diffusely diseased RCA with 85% lesion and patent SVG-RPDA.
Pt had cardiac enzyme elevations at OSH, likely [**3-9**] demand ischemia in the setting of rapid Aflutter.
PMIBI showed anterior/inferior reversible perfusion defects.
He remained hypotensive requiring pressors.
Later in the day on [**1-18**], he became acutely bradycardic to the 30s, requiring atropine, and had profound hypotension not reponding to maximum dose of 3 pressors.
The patient's EKG showed ST elevations in V1-V2 with an new LBBB; the patient cath images and EKGs were again reviewed and cath was not felt to be an option.
# PVD/gangrene: Patient with bilateral peripheral vascular disease who was admitted with with dry gangrene of left 2nd and 3rd toes.
Angiography indicated a femoral to posterior tibial bypass was a resonable option.
On [**2117-1-24**] patient was going through lower extremity bypass pathway, was found to have lost pulse signals on the operative side, since this was a PTFE bypass and without bypass option, option of LBKA was discussed with patient and family which they agreed.
Patient underwent a left BKA on [**2117-1-25**] and tolerated the procedure well without complication.
