Indeterminant 3-cm cystic appearing lesion exophytic off the upper pole of the left kidney in addition to multiple bilateral simple renal cysts.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent airspace disease likely representing predominantly atelectasis.

Upper Ext U/S ([**2142-5-9**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of thrombosis seen in right or left internal jugular or subclavian veins.

Since [**5-9**] although heart size may have increased only mildly, there is more mediastinal vascular engorgement and dilatation of upper lobe pulmonary vessels due to worsening cardiac decompensation or volume overload.
Confluent opacification at the lung bases could be explained by combination of atelectasis and confluent edema though radiographically one cannot exclude aspiration or even pneumonia.

Stable lung volumes and interval improvement in left basilar opacification.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old male with history of with HTN, DMII, HLD, morbid obesity who presented with severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis.
There was no history of significant EtOH use, triglycerides were WNL, he had not had a recent ERCP or steroid use, and there was no evidence of gallstones on imaging.
Given his very significant resuscitation requirements, the patient was intubated to maintain oxygenation and ventilation in the setting of worsening anasarca and third-spacing of fluid.
The patient initially began to show interval improvement after the first 48 hours as measured by lab abnormalities and fluid resuscitaton requirements, but then again decompensated with fevers > 103, a precipitous rise in WBC, a diffuse rash, and hypotension requiring more aggressive fluid resuscitation and eventual initiation of vasopressors.
Repeat imaging showed no evidence of progression of necrotic pancreas or other any intra-abdominal process.
The patient was empirically switched to aztreonam/flagyl given concern for a drug-induced reaction (see below).
The patient was followed with serial CT scans of his pancreas, which ultimately showed extensive pancreatic necrosis.
Due to significant difficulty placing a post-pyloric feeding tube, he had an NG tube placed and was started on tube feeds, which he tolerated.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: His respiratory failure was secondary to LLL collapse and pulmonary edema and increased abdominal distension from ileus and anascarca.
Requiring PEEP initially as high as 18 likely secondary to increased intrabdominal pressure.
Dead space measurement did not reveal a significant amount of dead space present, and he was able to increasingly tolerate pressure support.
He was transitioned to trach mask ventilation and had a Passy-Muir Valve placed.
Anesthesia and CT surgery urgently evaluated the patient.
The patient did not have any further problems with his tracheostomy.
As he approached discharge, the patient remained grossly fluid overloaded.
BACTEREMIA/ FEVERS:  As above, he was initially started on meropenem on admission for severe pancreatitis.
The meropenum was transitioned to aztreonam after he developed skin changes concerning for an allergic reaction.
He continued to spike daily fevers, which were felt to possibly be related to his pancreatitis but also possibly related to an underlying infection.
Eventually, he grew coag neg staph sensitive to linezolid in consecutive blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 71614**] and then coag neg staph that was resistant to linezolid in a blood culture on [**5-3**].
However, his diffuse skin breakdown in the setting of his allergic reaction was also thought to be a possible source of his staph.
He underwent multiple CVL changes, given these positive cultures.
TEE negative for vegetations or abscesses.
Also, he grew acinetobacter from a right IJ blood cx on [**5-3**] and from multiple sputum cultures.
He was tried on tigecycline but developed a questionable allergic reaction.
However, he thereafter developed a clinical decompensation, including a diffuse rash.
This rash consisted of significant erythema and desquamation and ultimately covered a significant portion of the patient's upper and lower extremities as well as his trunk.
When he developed this rash, he was empirically switched to aztreonam/flagyl given concern for a drug-induced reaction (i.e.
Dermatology was consulted and agreed that the rash likely represented a drug reaction but felt that the likely inciting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was unasyn approximately two weeks prior to rash development.
Biopsies were performed and were also consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction.
Later in his hospital course, the patient was started on tigecycline, after which he was noted to develop a new papular rash, concerning for an allergy.
Allergy and Immunology was consulted to comment on patient's multiple skin reactions to various antibiotics, and it was thought the culprit was tigecycline since it correlated to his time course.
There was some initial concern for c.diff, and he was kept on flagyl for an extended period of time, given the impossibility of collecting stool samples.
However, stool samples were eventually negative for C. diff.
He subsequently developed marked abdominal distention and tube feeds were held.
In the setting of weaning his sedation, he began to experience some agitation and delirium, for which he was started on standing methadone and haldol.
As his clinical status improved and his sedation was weaned, his hypotension improved and his pressors were weaned and stopped.
ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: The patient presented with acute renal failure, which initially improved with IV hydration.
His hospital course was complicated by some additional elevations in his creatining, generally in the setting of CT scans.
ANEMIA Patient's hematocrit slowely trended down during his hospitalization.
NG tube contents and stool were both guaiac negative, and felt to be secondary to repeated phelbotomy.
TYPE II DIABETES, c/b neuropathy: The patient was continued on sliding scale insulin and was given insulin in his TPN.
Due to high blood sugars, lantus 10u daily was added to his regimen, and he will continue on hospital humalog sliding scale, which may need to be adjusted as appropriate.

You were admitted for severe pancreatitis, complicated by respiratory failure, shock, and multiple blood stream infections.
The cause of your pancreatitis is unknown, but you should NOT drink alcohol anymore as you are at high risk of losing complete function in your pancreas.
In addition, you were noted to have a severe allergic skin reaction most likely related to Unasyn, but possibly due to Meropenum.
You also developed a worsening skin rash after being started on Tigecycline.
