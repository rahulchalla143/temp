TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the chest were obtained without IV contrast secondary to patient's elevated creatinine level.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Linear opacities again seen at right apex, consistent with scar.
New ground glass opacity and bronchiectasis seen in the right upper lobe.
Diffuse patchy opacities also seen within the upper lobes bilaterally.
Large consolidations are seen at the lower lobes bilaterally, right greater than left with associated pleural effusions.
There is suggestion of a loculated effusion on the right (series 2, image 24).
The left sided consolidation appears improved compared to [**2108-1-5**] CT. No evidence of abscess seen.
Coronary artery calcifications are noted.
There is also evidence of mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which appear to meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement.
Associated pleural effusions.
No evidence of abscess.
New ground glass opacity and bronchiectasis at right upper lobe.
Probably small loculated effusion on right.
5mm nodular opacity seen in right lobe, possibly secondary to infection.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo male with complicated medical hx, recent aspiration pna on Oxacillin still with Subclavian line, from HRC with fever, oxygen desaturation, and continued cough.
# PNA/Fever- patient has a h/o aspiration events (h/o VRE/MRSA/pseudomonas).
CT scan showed extensive bilateral lower lobe consolidations.
Given that this likle represents a worsening of his previous PNA on narrow coverage with oxacillin.
Hypoxia improved with frequent chest PT and suctioning.
No symptoms but may explain some of the admission fever.
# Bipolar disorder and Wilsons disease: continue on home meds clonazepam, olanzapine, buproprion, lamotragine.
# Orthostatic hypotension: Continue midodrine and fludrocort while also giving Metoprolol for patient's underlying CAD as long as pressure can tollerate it.
# CRI: currently Cr at upper end of baseline (1.9-2.4).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Living  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Please continue your anitbiotics until [**2108-6-9**].
