COPD flare - this was thought to be the etiology of pt's acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2.  pneumonia - On admission, pt was on day [**1-28**] of broad spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime, Flagyl, and vancomycin), with H flu the only reported organism growing from sputum cultures at the VA (never here).
This was thought to be likely due to a contaminant, as there were greater than 15 colonies, no bacteremia, and no leukocytosis.
3.  atrial fibrillation - On the day of admission, pt devleloped a new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension.
Cardiac enzymes were sent, which revealed an elevated troponin thought to be most likely due to demand ischemia in setting of rapid a fib.
Due to the risk of aortic dissection with an aortic thrombus associated with some ulceration into the aortic wall, it was decided not to anticoagulate pt for a fib.
Pt was rate controlled, first with metoprolol, but was then changed to verapamil in the setting of severe lung disease.
4.  fever - Pt was afebrile after the first 1-2 days of admission.
PICC infection was another possibility, though the PICC was removed and cultures showed coag negative Staph.
Possible thrombophlebitis prompted a L upper extremity ultrasound, which did not show any evidence of DVT.
5.  aortic thrombus - Pt has an aortic thrombus, which is somewhat ulcerated.
In this setting, pt was not anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation.
6.  left cephalic vein thrombosis - Pt's arm was noted to be somewhat swollen, though this was initially thought to be due to PICC infiltration.
Another ultrasound, performed 3 days after the first, showed a thrombosis in the L cephalic vein not previously seen.
The case was again discussed with cardiology and radiology, as well as the primary attending, and it was decided not to anticoagulate the patient, since a cephalic vein clot is not considered to be a deep vein thrombosis, and the risk of anticoagulation in this pt is high.
7.  hyperglycemia - pt does not have a history of diabetes; this was most likely due to high dose steroids.
8.  pleural effusion - pt has a pleural effusion seen on CXR.
During the last hospitalization, this was tapped, and the cytology was consistent with atypical epithelial cells, favor reactive mesothelial cells.
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow team, who had done a video swallow study earlier this year and found him to not be an aspiration risk.
