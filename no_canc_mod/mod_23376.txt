MODERATE GROWTH.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..          OF TWO COLONIAL MORPHOLOGIES.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 62yo man with A fib on Warfarin, PE in [**2168**], prostate cancer, and prior GI bleed who presented to OSH with massive hemoptysis- being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchial artery embolization.
Hemoptysis-  Patient experienced massive hemoptysis at OSH requiring 10U PRBCs and 5 units of FFP.
Differential diagnosis includes bronchiectasis and occult malignancy.
IP service consulted and performed bronchoscopy which demonstrated thick, organized mucous blood clots in RUL, RLL, and LLL.
Rigid bronch performed in OR, notable for friable mucosa suggestive of DAH/vasculitis but no visible bleeding source.
ANCA and anti-GBM were found to be negative; no active sediment on urine analysis.
Vital signs remained stable with no further transfusion need.
Extubated on [**5-28**], but failed speech and swallow.
Prior to that he had an IR-guided bronchial artery embolization.
He tolerated the procedures well- clot was suctioned with no new bleed on [**6-3**].
Patient remained hemodynamically stable with no evidence of new bleed.
Called out to floor on [**6-4**] and had no further bleeding or hemoptysis.
[**Last Name (un) **]- At OSH, creatinine elevated in the setting of hemoptysis.
Urine with no active sediment.
Some RBCs, no acanthocytes.
No RBC/WBC casts.
Left adrenal mass- Present on prior imaging, but noted to have increased in size.
Confusion: Patient had episodes of short term memory loss and hallucinations/dellusions while on the floor.
He was oriented X3 however due to ICU/multiple intubations/multiple transfers and illness he was felt to be mildly confused/delerius.
His HCP felt that his memory and hallucinations had been improving over time.
pansensitive ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE from [**6-2**] bronchoscopy: Initially on Ciprofloxacin, changed to Levofloaxin for planned 7 day course through [**6-9**].
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) paclet packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -hemoptysis  Secondary: -hx of afib, on coumadin -hx of PE - HTN   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Some confusion about recent events, dellusions/hallcinations in retrospect from ICU/multiple transfers/illness  Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You had bronchoscopy and were intubated.
It could have been because you have an pneumonia.
You also had a urine infection while you were here.
You may need to see a blood doctor because of your history of clots and bleeding.
They are aware and will call you with an appointment.
