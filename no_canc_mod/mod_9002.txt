Unfortunately infection recurred and underwent a second pacemaker pocket revision on [**10-13**].
Since then he has developed staph epidermitis bacteremia without systemic symptoms.
Congestive heart failure EF of 35% status post mitral valve repair with mechanical valve in [**2174**], status post pacemaker pocket revision times two.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  In general he is a pleasant elderly male in no acute distress.
His chest x-ray showed no acute infiltration or effusion on admission.
Cardiovascular:  This 79 year-old man with infected pacemaker pocket was admitted for pacemaker explantation at its leads.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained off his Coumadin until [**2-1**] when the patient underwent new pacemaker implantation into a new abdominal pocket.
Post lead extraction the patient was continued on his heparin while he was restarted on his Coumadin to get a therapeutic INR given that he has a mitral valve replacement.
The anesthesiologist had refused to do a TEE here given the patient has a history of Zenker's diverticulum.
The patient was to have his Vancomycin throughout the hospital stay here and then be discharged without Vancomycin.
He was to have follow up surveillance blood cultures one week after discharge off of Vancomycin to ensure that he did not develop any further bacteremia.
In terms of his pacemaker pocket on the right upper shoulder the patient did develop a subcutaneous hematoma and possible fluid collection.
Unfortunately the patient did develop a recurrent small hematoma, however, this remained stable and the drainage from the JP drain tapered off, therefore the JP drain was removed by the CT Surgery Service.
After days of remaining subtherapeutic and INR was therapeutic at 2.7 on [**2182-2-10**] his Coumadin was dosed was decreased for a goal INR of 2 to 2.5 for the next week given the bleeding recurrence at the pacemaker pocket.
The patient's hematoma had remained stable overnight with no further bleeding.
He was ambulating and pain free.
New pacemaker implantation.
Atrial fibrillation.
Mitral valve replacement.
In addition, he was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17863**] in one week after discharge on Monday [**2-18**] for bacterial cultures to ensure that there is no sign of infection off the Vancomycin.
He was advised that if he had any fevers or chills or increased pain at his pacemaker site that he should call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17863**] his primary care physician immediately for further medical advice.
