Mother with a history of vaginal discharge cultured positive for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.
Respiratory distress secondary to surfactant deficiency status post surfactant therapy times two.
Rule out sepsis in progress being treated with Ampicillin, Ceftazidime and Tobramycin.
IDENTIFICATION:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] is now day of life ex-33 and [**2-26**] week male infant who was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 69**] secondary to prematurity as well as respiratory distress and rule out sepsis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] is now day of life number two ex-33 and [**2-26**] week infant male who was delivered yesterday [**2196-5-18**] via C section to a 38 year-old G3 P1 now 2 mother who has had an unremarkable pervious obstetrical history and whose prenatal laboratories were significant for bloody type B positive, antibody screen neurological, Rubella immune nonreactive, HSBSAG negative and GBS unknown.
The mother's current pregnancy was unremarkable until [**2196-4-30**] when she developed premature rupture of membranes.
She was transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital to [**Hospital1 69**] secondary to her premature rupture of membranes and she was maintained at [**Hospital1 1444**] via bed rest.
Of note, during this stay at [**Hospital1 69**] she was noted to have a bluish green colored amniotic fluid drainage.
Culture revealed the presence of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and gram positive cocci.
However, the mother had no clinical signs of chorioamnionitis and as such she was not treated with antibiotics.
The mother underwent cesarean section on [**2196-5-18**] secondary to the development of a maternal fever at 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
The presence of the fever therefore prompted a cesarean section in the setting of prolonged premature rupture of membranes.
He developed increased work of breathing and grunting shortly after birth and was placed on CPAP without significant improvement.
He was thus admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further management of prematurity, respiratory distress as well as evaluation for possible infection and rule out sepsis.
No organomegaly.
Neurological tone excellent.
Status post his normal saline infusion his mean blood pressures were greater then 40 and he has had no further episodes of cardiovascular instability including tachycardia, bradycardia or dysrhythmias.
He continued to have respiratory distress and a large oxygen requirement and as such he was intubated with a [**2-24**] endotracheal tube and was given 2 doses of surfactant overnight from [**5-18**] through [**2196-5-19**].
His most recent arterial blood gas was 7.32, 42 and as such he was extubated without difficulty.
He has not had any apnea of prematurity.
Of note his chest x-ray was consistent with hyaline membrane disease.
Hematologic/infectious diseases:  Secondary to his respiratory distress, prematurity, and mother's unknown GBS status as well as the presence of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa either in her amniotic fluid or in the vaginal canal baby [**Name (NI) 1692**] was treated with 7 days of AMpicillin/Gentamicin and Cefatazidime.
