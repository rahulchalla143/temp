Patent hepatic and portal veins; limited assessment of hepatic artery.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
CT head without contrast ([**2168-12-27**]): No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral swelling.
No retroperitoneal hematoma 2.
Diffuse enlargment of the pancreas which can be seen with pancreatitis.
Small R>L pleural effusion.
Diffuse ephysematous changes.
CT Brain Perfusion :  No large area of increased MTT or perfusion deficit in the imaged portions of the brain.
Evaluation of the imaged posterior fossa structures is limited due to artifacts.
The study is somewhat suboptimal due to slightly suboptimal quality of the perfusion maps for the posterior fossa.
EEG ([**2168-12-31**]): This EEG continues to show a moderately severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy although some of the frequencies now appear to be slightly faster suggesting there may be some reversibility.
Also, two events occurred that appeared, in one case, to be a focal sustained seizure from the right frontal region and the other a more generalized discharge, neither associated with a clear clinical accompaniment.
Status post right frontal bolt removal with a small amount of residual blood products, but no large intracranial hemorrhage.
No evidence of acute infarct.
Paranasal mastoid sinus or air-fluid levels, most likely the sequela of recurrent intubation.
No occlusive small vessel vasculopathy identified in this sample.
No biliary obstruction identified.
Moderate amount of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions noted.
Collapsed gallbladder with a thickened gallbladder wall, likely due to underlying liver disease.
EGD ([**2169-1-25**]): Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Mosaic appearance in the fundus, stomach body and antrum compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Rotated duodenal anatomy- likely secondary to pancreatitisOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Successful placement of Dobhoff 10-French nasojejunal feeding tube   Brief Hospital Course: 48 y/o F w/ COPD and alcohol abuse who presented from an outside hospital with altered mental status, found to have fulminant hepatic failure and renal failure, initially requiring intubation and pressor support, then extubated with improving mental status, improvement in liver function, but interval development of pancreatitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ongoing volume overload due to persistent renal failure requiring dialysis.
# Fulminant Liver Failure - Patient with no known underlying liver disease except history of alcohol abuse presents with altered mental status and abnormal liver enzymes ALT 7780, AST [**Numeric Identifier 89939**], LDH 319, Alk Phos 117, TBili 3.7)  and elevated INR (peak of 8.9)suggestive of acute liver failure.
She does report using standing tyelnol but no overdose.
Likely etiology tylenol toxicity in setting of alcohol abuse as the cause of her liver failure.
RUQ U/S with Dopplers showed patent vasculature and no evidence of obstructive disease (stones).
Follow-up MRI did not show evidence of infarct or hemorrhage.
She was treated empirically with Vancomycin/Levofloxacin/Zosyn on [**2168-12-26**] and transitioned to Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl for hepatobiliary infection from [**2168-12-30**] to [**2169-1-8**].
Transplant surgery and hepatology evaluated her for liver transplant.
She experienced hepatic encephalopathy which was quite subtle at times (only recognizable to family) but completely improved with lactulose and rifaximin which she will continue.
The length of her course suggested more profound underlying liver disease than was apparent on admission so liver biopsy was obtained, which was pending at the time of discharge and the hepatologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow up.
An EGD was performed that showed 2 cords of grade 1 esophageal varices.
Acute kidney injury: Differential includes acute tubular necrosis from hypotension versus hepatorenal syndrome type 1.
Urine lytes consistent with prerenal etiology which could be any of the latter two.
The prognosis of her renal failure is still unclear; most likely she will be on hemodialysis permanently, but she still requires closely monitoring of intra-dialysis creatinine given that she may recover some kidney function.
She should not be aggresively hemodialysed given history of labile BP during HD.
Respiratory distress: The patient developed increased work of breathing on [**2168-12-26**] to compensate for her metabolic acidosis due to elevated lactate from acute liver and kidney failure.
She showed no evidence of alcohol withdrawal or DT's and the CIWA scale was discontinued.
She was seen by social work for alcohol cessation counseling and for support coping with acute illness.
# Pancreatitis: The patient was noted to have a chemical pancreatitis on admission (lipase 164 on admission and 1237 on HD 2) which appeared to resolving by HD 9, however over the next few days the lipase was noted to be in the 1000s again.
Patient largely denied abdominal pain but did experience some nausea with po intake.
A CT Abdomen on [**12-27**] showed the pancreas to be diffusely enlarged with surrounding stranding consistent with pancreatitis, but no evidence of necrosis or pseudocyst.
# Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis:  On the day of liver biopsy, the patient underwent paracentesis.
She later spiked a fever to 100.6 and developed increased epigastric tenderness.
She is discharged on ciprofloxacin for sbp prophylaxis.
After transfer from the MICU to the hepatology service, she did not require any nebulizer treatments as she was breathing well on room air without wheezing, shortness of breath, or desaturations.
# Liver transplant workup - Patient was seen and examined by transplant team and psych/social work.
Follow-up MRI did not show evidence of infarct or hemorrhage.
# Depression/Anxiety: Given fulminant hepatic failure, anuric renal failure, and concern for hepatic encephalopathy, the patient's mirtazapine, wellbutrin, and ativan were held for much of her inpatient stay.
Given her hepatic encephalopathy her ativan was held and should continue to be held until she recovers completely from liver insult.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Fulminant Liver Failure, Hepatic Encephalopathy, Grade I Esophageal Varices, Acute Renal Failure requiring Hemodialysis, Hepatorenal Syndrome, Cholangitis, Septic Shock,  Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis, Malnutrition, Pancreatitis, Increased Intracranial Pressure, Respiratory Distress .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for liver failure due to alcohol and tylenol use.
As a consequence of your severe liver disease, your kidneys were injured and began to require dialysis.
There was concerned that you had swelling in your head, so a bolt was placed to reduce the pressure.
Your course was complicated by infections which were treated with antibiotics.
