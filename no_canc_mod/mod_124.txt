There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Right atrial abnormality.
Possible old septal myocardial infarction.
Possible left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tracing is compatible with pulmonary disease.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-12-9**] QS complexes in leads V1-V2 are less prominent and there is less suggestion of possible left ventricular hypertrophy.
Both tracings are compatible with pulmonary disease.
Despite this, there is motion artifact on the study acquired limiting the evaluation.
This is likely related to underlying HIV encephalopathy.
There is a advance atrophy for age which is consistently seen in HIV encephalopathy as well.
There is no acute interval change or midline shift.
No intracranial hemorrhage is evident.
Findings most consistent with HIV encephalopathy with no superimposed acute process.
In addition, lack of IV contrast, significantly limits evaluation for any focal infection.
Within these limitations, there are no large masses noted on the visualized images of the neck.
However, subtle areas of increased attenuation in the fat and inflammation cannot be assessed.
There is moderate dilatation of the esophagus with small amount of fluid/debris within the esophagus.
This finding is new compared to the CT chest on [**2145-12-16**], with interval removal of the nasogastric tube.
There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present study.
There is a small 4-mm soft tissue density nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung, unchanged.
There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present study.
Brief Hospital Course: # Seizures:  The patient had two witnessed tonic-clonic seizures before presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] ED and one seizure in the ED.
The most likely etiology for patient's seizures is imipenem which was used to treat his urine culture positive for acinetobacter and elavil which was given at high doses for neuropathy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1071**] is thought to have HIV encephalopathy and this condition combined with imipenem may have lowered his seizure threshold.
Patient's amitriptyline was also considered as possible cause of patient's seizures.
Infectious etiology or mass effect were ruled out by [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, benign appearance of CSF, and head CT; however, initially the patient was given empiric IV acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin because of suspicion of viral or bacterial central nervous system infection.
Of note, patient has had no seizures since admission and stopping of imipenem and amitriptyline.
# Mental status changes:  The patient's mental status changes are likely due to HIV encephalopathy.
CT showed no CNS mass effect and no acute CNS infectious etiology found.
The patient was examined by Ophthomaology who did not see any signs of CMV retinitis.
The patient has also had urinary retention during this hospitalization.
# Neck position:  The patient had head turned to left and was resistant to changing position and has point tenderness bilaterally on sides of neck.
Patient continuesd to keep head turned to left with some improvement noted with use of clonazepam.
# Allodynia:  The patient had complaints of allodynia on last admission and reports of neuropathic pain dating back to [**2142**].
This allodynia may be part of the spectrum of his neuropathy which is thought to be secondary to HIV.
According to OMR, the patient has not had relief of his neuropathy with gabapentin in the past.
However, after patient left ICU for floor, opiates were held because of worries of sedation affecting mental status.
His pain was treated with gabapentin and acetaminophen.
ID did not recommend HAART as HAART carries increased risk of toxicity in setting of poor nutrition, and patient is vulnerable to immune reconstitution syndrome with low CD4 count at start of HAART and patient has known Hepatitis C.  ID's recommendation was that HAART not be initiated until Mr. [**Known lastname 1101**] nutritional status improves and that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] (outpatient ID doctor for patient) should make decisions about implementing HAART.
# Fluid, electrolytes, nutrion:  Patient was profoundly cachectic, had not eaten in several days and failed a speech and swallow evaluation.
GI did not wish to place PEG because of patient's low albumin (which would impede healing) and prominent epigastric surgical scar.
Rate of continous infusion determined by pharmacy-See Label 3.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: # Seizures thought due to Imipenem treatment # Multi-drug resistent Acinetobacter UTI # HIV/AIDS # Urinary retention requiring foley catheter placement (failed voiding trials x2) # Cachexia requiring TPN .
Secondary: # HIV/AIDS # HCV # Asthma # AIDS related neuropathy   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with seizures.
While you were in the hospital we treated you with IV antibiotics for a question of an infection in your spinal column.
We also treated an infection in your urine with IV antibiotics.
