Cardiovascular  A. ECG Sinus bradycardia with blocked atrial premature complexes and some which are conducted, along with a junctional escape.
Non-specific ST segment changes.
There is a normalized P-R interval and the ST segment changes are less marked.
EXERCISE STRESS TEST RESTING DATA EKG:  SR, WNL HEART RATE:  62 BLOOD PRESSURE:  150/88  PROTOCOL [**Doctor First Name 569**] - TREADMILL STAGE TIME SPEED ELEVATION HEART BLOOD RPP (MIN) (MPH) (%) RATE PRESSURE 1 0-3 1.7 10 108 178/80 [**Numeric Identifier 13436**] 2 [**2-17**] 2.5 12 120 202/78 [**Numeric Identifier 13437**] 3 [**5-23**] 3.4 14 123 212/80 [**Numeric Identifier 13438**] 4 [**8-26**] 4.2 16 146 232/80 [**Numeric Identifier 13439**]  TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  12 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  91  SYMPTOMS: NONE ST DEPRESSION: EQUIVOCAL   INTERPRETATION: This 60 year old man with a h/o Lyme disease was  referred to the lab for evaluation of sick sinus syndrome and syncope.
There were no chest, neck, back, or syncopal symptoms reported by the patient throughout the procedure.
There was 1 mm of upsloping ST segment depressions inferolaterally at peak exercise.
Resting mild systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: No exercise induced arrhythmia or anginal symptoms with non-specific ST changes at the achieved workload.
Resting mild systolic hypertension with mildly exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise.
C. ECHO ([**2105-3-2**]) Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No valvular patholology or pathologic flow identified.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: 60-year-old male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lyme disease presented with fatigue, lightheadedness, bradycardia, and significant sinus pauses (up to 4.6 seconds) that seemed to occur after cessation exercise was found to have sinus node dysfunction and is status post pacemaker placement for sinus node dysfunction.
# Sinus node dysfunction Patient had noted onset of palpitations and lightheadedness about 4 weeks ago and described it as a feeling like he was about to pass out.
He also felt weak and lightheaded about 15 minutes after exercise.
It was noted that he had frequent sinus pauses that correlated with his symptoms up to 4.6 seconds.
He was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service but had significant bradycardia and transferred to the CCU.
His rhythm was mostly junctional with continuing long pause intervals (4 to 5 seconds at times) with continuing symptoms including feeling "awful, washed out, and nauseous."
He was placed on chronotropic support to bridge him while awaiting potential pacemaker evaluation requiring isoproterenol especially during rest given bradycardia to 30-40s.
An ECHO was performed on [**2105-3-2**] showing normal biventricular sizes and function with no overt valvular pathology.
He had a mildly dilated ascending aorta.
There was 1 mm of upsloping ST segment depressions inferolaterally at peak exercise.
There was no apparent exercise induced arrhythmia or anginal symptoms with non-specific ST changes at achieved workload.
There were no apparent complications.
# Hypertension He was continued on hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril.
# Hyperlipidemia He was continued on simvastatin  # Hct drop Labs on [**3-2**] showed Hct decrease from 46.1 to 35.3 with repeat labs stable at 44.7 -47.2 likely reflecting an isolated and spurious value.
# Transitional issues - Pacemaker follow-up  # Pending studies - follow-up final CXR report performed on [**2105-3-3**]  Medications on Admission: HCTZ 25 mg daily lisinopril 20 mg daily simvastatin 20 mg daily aspirin 81 mg daily propranolol 20 mg Q6H PRN hypertension (rarely takes) triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Medications: 1. hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Sinus node dysfunction specifically sinus pause/arrest Secondary: hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for fatigue, lightheadedness, and a slow heart rate.
You were monitored closely in the Cardiac Care Unit, and it was decided that given your slow heart rate that you needed a pacemaker to keep your heart rate at a good level while at rest.
Please see the pacemaker discharge instruction sheet for activity limitations and other instructions related to your new pacemaker.
Discuss with your primary care doctor if you need additional medications to control your blood pressure.
This is to prevent infection at the site of your new pacemaker.
