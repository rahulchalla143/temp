Admission Date:  [**2172-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-2-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-11-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim / Codeine / Penicillins / Benadryl / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Demerol / Dicloxacillin / Morphine / Vioxx  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation, Bronscopy, A-line  History of Present Illness: 63 y/o F w/COPD, OSA, RSD, GERD, who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital tonight c/o dyspnea.
Per their notes, she had four days of increasing shortness of breath, "raspy breathing", and leg edema.
Pt nods her head yes when asked if she has increasing swelling in her legs and difficulty breathing when lying flat, says no when asked about cough.
En route to their hospital she developed 8/10 chest pain.
She was emergently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Her ABG here (per ED resident was a preintubation ABG but was after she had been intubated x 5 minutes?)
She was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure.
Past Medical History: # Cardiac arrest in [**2158**] while under anesthesia for surgery on hydradenitis # Hypertension # CHF (EF here [**2167**] >60%) # Hydradenitis # RSD # GERD # Gastrointestinal bleed # Asthma # Bipolar d/o # PTSD # Hypercholesterolemia # Obesity # DM (diet-controlled) # ?COPD: PFTs here in [**2-25**] with FEV1 1.8 L (75% pred), FVC 2.7 L (80% pred), FEV1/FVC 94% pred, DLCO 70% pred # s/p cholecystectomy # s/p appy # s/p TAH/BSO # s/p breast reduction surgery # s/p R knee surgery # s/p bladder surgery   Social History: Stopped smoking when she had the diagnosis of asthma made in [**2166**].
Family History: Father died of a CVA and an MI presurgery.
Mother: had a cardiac cath and a dye shut down her kidneys and she died.
Cardiomegaly with mild volume overload versus mild CHF.
Widened superior mediastinum which can be positional.
Opacities in both lower lobes representing combination of atelectasis and pneumonia.
Enlarged cardiac contour raises the possibility of pericardial effusion.
Probable sinus tachycardia.
Low voltage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is  mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is  seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Radiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS P Study Date of [**2172-2-13**] 1:45 PM IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 63 year-old F w/obesity, COPD, CAD, CHF and diet controlled DM, who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation.. .
# Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to pneumonia given her fever, bandemia, infiltrates on chest xray.
Has significant A-a gradient based on her initial ABG (on 100% FiO2).
Also may have several other contributing factors, including chronic hypercarbia likely from COPD, OSA, restriction due to habitus.
Other obvious concern is that this is CHF or complicated by CHF, given history of worsening LE edema and orthopnea.
Chest xray was consistent with both pneumonia and edema.
Bronchoscopy on [**2-12**] demonstrated substantial secretions and likely mucous plug obstructing right-middle lobe which was cleared, with subsequent re-expansion of RML.
TTE was negative for tamponade or wall motion abnormality and unchanged from prior.
Multiple sputum cultures were sent and grew out staph aureus, methacillin sensitive.
TTE showed mild symmetric LVH.
No AR, no MR. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pericardial effusion.
# DM: placed on humalog sliding scale with good control of blood sugar.
# RSD:  Has indwelling morphine pump.
# FEN: While intubated, received tube feeds for nutrition.
Nursing was concerned that on thin liquids might have some aspiration; no difficulty with thickened liquids.
Transitioned to regular diet with thickened liquids; recommend speech and swallow evaluation (ordered but not performed at time of transfer).
