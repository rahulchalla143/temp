The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in mid-[**Month (only) 1096**] with a perirectal abscess complicated by hypotension and a MICU admission.
His course was further complicated by renal failure and a transaminitis attributed to unasyn therapy.
He endorses chronic knee and LE pain but denies any recent CP, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V, poor PO intake, progressive weakness, paresthesias, HA, melena, or BRBPR.
He has noticed some intermittant painless shaking in his hands that has occasionally caused him to drop objects.
She feels that his altered mental status can be directly attributed to the doses of narcotics that he was discharge on as this was a new medication for him.
His bradycardia was treated with atropine to which his HR increased to the 70s and his relative hypotension (systolic ~90) improved.
EP was contact[**Name (NI) **] and reportedly felt that no intervention was indicated at this time.

Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.
However, if there is a clinical suspicion for pneumonia, recommend repeat PA and lateral views after diuresis.
The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormality.
No definite stones or evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 year old man with CHF (EF 20%) and Afib admitted for altered mental status and hypotension.
# HYPOTENSION: Found to have BP of 80/60 at Neurologist's office and then sent to the ED.
The thought is that he was bradycardic and had decreased cardiac output resulting in low BP.Not infected so not likely septic hypotension.
Peripherals warm and well perfused so not likely cardiogenic hypotension.
# BRADYCARDIA: Found to have heart rates in the 40's in the ED.
Unclear why he became bradycardic when he's been taking coreg chronically.
EP was consulted regarding threshold setting and felt no changes needed to be made.
Patient was restarted on coreg without difficulty.
Monitored on telemetry with no events.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Likely from hypotensive episode, or from narcotics.
Possibly from poor PO intake at home, although he denies.
Possibly from incorrect insulin dosing, especially since he recently switched brands of novalog.
# CHF: Non ischemic cardiomyopathy with acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure and EF 20%.
Currently volume overloaded with elevated JVP to jaws, peripheral edema and crackles in lungs.
Initailly treated with IV lasix for diuresis and transitioned to PO regimen of 80 mg daily with improvement in peripheral edema and lung exam.
# Atrial fibrillation: in afib currently w/ rate ~ 80s.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: at baseline.
# LFT elevation: Elevated since previous admission in setting of both unasyn reaction and stones in the CBD.
Possible contribution from liver congestion from CHF.
