Admission Date:  [**2198-9-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-9-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Zocor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2078**] Chief Complaint: syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pacer placement- DDD   History of Present Illness: 80yoM with h/o atrial fibrillation (on coumadin INR=1.2, and sotalol, and s/p DC cardioversion in [**3-31**]), HTN, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30% by cath in [**2197**]), CAD, hyperlipidemia, and chronic renal insufficiency, who had a syncopal episode while attending a rehearsal dinner.
He had no prodrome, aura, or tinnitus, and denied CP, SOB, palpitations or lightheadedness.
He was apparently unconscious for approximately three minutes, and was not incontinent of urine or feces, and did not have convulsions.
He was brought by ambulance to an outside hospital where a head CT revealed a small left frontal lobe sub-arachnoid hemorrhage.
HTN 2.
9. h/o rhabdmyolysis on statins 10. dementia   Social History: Pt.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
5.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
6.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
9.There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
A head MRI/MRA was obtained which showed a normal circle of [**Location (un) 431**] with no aneurysm.
A repeat head CT showed no change in frontal hemorrhage pattern.
The patient was seen by cardiology and an EP study and echocardiogram was recommended, as the syncopal episode could have resulted from a pause, a tachyarrhythmia, or low cardiac output.
had two episodes of nausea and vomiting, the first while being transported to CXR, and the second while being transported for pulmonary function tests.
He was treated with anzemet, and due to possibility of progression of SAH, a head CT was obtained, which demonstrated that the small left medial frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage is much less prominent, compared to [**2198-9-22**], and there was no other interval change.
Aspirin and coumadin for atrial fibrillation was held due to the SAH.
Ischemia:  Continue beta blockade with carvedilol, and afterload reduction with lisinopril.
may consider elective cardiac catheterization in the future to potentially improve cardiomyopathy (EF=30%) with stenting or bypass.
reports h/o cirrhosis and family history of liver cancer.
denies workup for hepatitis in past.
LFTs are within normal limits with the exception of an elevated alkaline phosphatase.
Chronic renal insufficiency: Pt.
Continue afterload reduction with lisinopril.
