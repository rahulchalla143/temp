Pt was found to have critical carotid stenosis on the right and underwent CEA without complication.
On pod#2 he had chest pain at rest that lasted approximately 45 minutes.
Troponins were mildly elevated.
A repeat echo revealed slight changes in wall motion and ejection fraction.
Cardiac cath was performed and revealed multivessel coronary artery disease.

Moderate spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=40-45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the distal aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**2-5**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: The right heart chamber has decreased in size to a normal range.
The LV systolic function remains mildly depressed, estimated EF = 45%.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
Aortic Insufficiency was noted on echo and dental consult was obtained in the event that the valve would be replaced.
The patient had dental extractions on [**2169-5-8**].
He did develop profound hypotension following Protamine, and this will be listed as an allergy for the future.
He did develop post-op atrial fibrillation and was started on amiodarone and coumadin.
He was maintained on an insulin drip in the immediate post-op period for his diabetes.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 13 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with Tylenol.
4. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
5. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezes.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
