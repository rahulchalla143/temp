The week prior he was admitted to an outside facility for weakness which was thought to be secondary to inderal dosing.
He had a CXR which showed evidence of a LUL opacity.
In the ICU, a TTE showed an EF of 20-25% with severe global hypokinesis, dilated LA, mild TR, and no other valvular dysfunction.
He was treated with IV lopressor for his rapid rate.
He was initially transferred to the cath lab for suspected cardiac catheterization, but given his elevated INR, the decision was made to postpone cardiac cath until the AM.

The LMCA had no stenosis.
The LAD was heavily calcified and had serial long stenoses ~85% in the proximal to mid vessel.
Venous conduit arteriography showed SVG/RCA and SVG/OM occlusion.
Angiography of the LIMA for upcoming re-do CABG showed a large non-obstructed vessel.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular enddiastolic filling pressures at 14 and 15 mmHg, respectively.
Multifocal areas of ground-glass opacities involving mainly the upper lobes.
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes pneumonia and ARDS, although the distribution is not typical.
Atherosclerotic changes as described above.
[**3-20**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with .
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
In addition to being medically managed for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, he received treatment for congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation and pneumonia.
On [**3-19**] he was brought for a cardiac cath which revealed severe three vessel disease and totally occluded saphenous vein grafts.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for redo bypass surgery.
