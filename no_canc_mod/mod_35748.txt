Admission Date:  [**2168-1-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-1-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-3-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Demerol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: transfer from OSH for submassive PE  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 78 F with htn, HL, [**Hospital 106626**] transferred from OSH for new cardiomyopathy and question for AICD placement.
In early [**Month (only) 404**], she has severe pnuemonia requiring ICU stay but did not get intubated.
Then on [**1-13**], she developed SOB and was admitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]again.
She was diagnosed with bilateral lower lobe PNA and was given a course of Vanc/Zosyn (transitioned to Vanc/Augmentin), and a steroid course for COPD flare.
She also had CHF and was diuresed until her creatinine bumped.
Per report from OSH, she had a normal echo about 6 months ago, and repeat echo in early Janurary showed new depressed EF of 30-50% with WMA.
She is then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of new cardiomyopathy and abnormal stress test.
At [**Hospital3 **], she also had diarrhea and Cdiff cultures were negative.
Her hct dropped to 27 and because of her CHF, she was given two units of blood and her hct bumped to 31-35.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension .
Family History: Mother and father with CAD in their 50s, one sister with CHF and another sister died with AS, sister with DM.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
+ crackles in the lower lung fields, no wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
MICRO: C.diff ([**1-22**], [**1-23**]) - negative Fecal cultures ([**1-22**], [**1-24**])- negative for shigella/salmonella, negative for campylobacter.
RADIOLOGY: CXR [**1-22**] IMPRESSION: Abnormal opacities involving both lungs.
Diagnostic considerations include pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic interstitial disease.
Pneumonia is not excluded.
ECHO [**1-22**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, with septal near-akinesis (LVEF = 25%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
A 12 x 9-mm mobile echodensity is seen just proximal to the pumonary artery bifurcation, most consistent with thrombus.
Severe global left ventricular dysfunction, with mild regional variation, suggesting multivessel CAD.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Occasional premature atrial contractions.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities.
Cannot rule out myocardial ischemia.
However, diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are now present.
Large pulmonary embolus extending from main pulmonary artery into the right main pulmonary artery and into branches of the right pulmonary artery in the upper, middle and lower lobes.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Background pulmonary interstitial fibrosis in a subpleural and predominantly basal distribution, with involvement also of the lingular segment of the left upper lobe.
Bilateral LENIs [**1-23**] IMPRESSION: No bilateral lower extremity DVT.
Left bundle-branch block.
EKG [**1-24**] Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Left bundle-branch block which is likely rate-related.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2168-1-24**] atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response has appeared.
CXR [**1-24**] A single portable radiograph of the chest again demonstrates an abnormal interstitial pattern involving both lungs with relative sparing of the left upper lung, similar to [**2168-1-22**].
Bilateral breast implants are again noted.
No pneumothorax is evident.
Lung volumes are low normal.
Overall, there is little interval change.
CXR [**1-25**] IMPRESSION: No significant change in findings suspicious for pulmonary fibrosis.
There is no hydronephrosis, stone or solid renal mass demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of renal mass.
REPEAT TEE [**1-27**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global hypokinesis and inferior akinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-1-23**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
Mild aortic valve stenosis is now suggested.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 106627**] is a 78 year-old female with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was transferred from an outside hospital for workup for new cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20%), and was found to have a submassive pulmonary embolism, transferred to the CCU for haemodynamic monitoring.
Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with submassive pulmonary embolism.
# Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler.
No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
Fixed defects on echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Other possibilities include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic illness.
Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic, myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure .
Normal iron, only slightly increased TSH.
Unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**].
Lung Infiltrates: Patient's infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
?d abx [**1-24**], given no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may have caused worsening diarrhea.
Continues to have diarrhea here 4-5 episodes a day.
Given concern for large PE and low preload, potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea.
Per pt and RN this am, diarrhea is better but persists.
Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes.
Focal wall-motion abnormalities suggest ischemic etiology.
# HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for hypotension.
# Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia.
No evidence of active bleed.
Heparin IV continous as per sliding scale until [**2168-1-30**] goal PTT 60-80  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 **], [**Hospital1 189**] MA  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Pulmonary embolism Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Systolic congestive heart failure (EF 25%) Pneumonia .
Discharge Condition: Good, hemodynamically stable, afebrile, satting in mid-90s on 4L   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for management after you were found to have a large pulmonary embolism in your heart.
You have had low blood pressures likely secondary to this blood clot.
You have highy impaired heart function, and should continue to follow-up with your cardiologist after discharge.
Because of your decreased heart function it is importnat that you weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
On exam, we noted some assymetric swelling in your left breast, which you PCP should follow up with a routine mammogram.
If you experience any chest pain, SOB, nausea, lightheadedness, return to the ED.
