Since then, she has been re-admitted multiple times for hepatic encephalopathy.
Over the past 3 months, however, her baseline mental and functional status has deteriorated.
She does communicate meaningfully with her family but has frequent episodes of increased confusion.
Most recently, she was hospitalized for 1 week approximately 2 weeks ago for hepatic encephalopathy and weakness.
She was discharged from this hospitalization on a prednisone taper for unclear reasons, although her son thinks it was related to chest pain.
Beginning on [**3-4**], Ms. [**Known lastname 48600**] son noted that she seemed increasingly confused.
Ms. [**Known lastname 48600**] son denied that she has complained of any abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, fevers, or chills recently.
At the OSH, head CT was negative for acute intracranial pathology.
CXR was notable only for low lung volumes.
She was intubated for airway protection with etomidate and rocuronium (given elevated K).
Paracentesis was attempted to r/o SBP, but no fluid pocket could be found.
Instead, she was covered empirically for SBP with ceftriaxone.
She was also found to be guaiac positive and given protonix 40 mg IV.
She received a total 3 L of fluid with good BP response to the ~100 systolic.
Past Medical History: [**Hospital1 **] cirrhosis Hyperlipidemia HTN Anxiety/Depression Herniated discs   Social History: She lives with her son (who works in a pharmacy) and husband.
She has never smoked or drank alcohol  Family History: son and brother with [**Name2 (NI) **]  Physical Exam: GEN: intubated, sedated, opens eyes to loud voice, appears comfortable SKIN:No rashes or skin changes noted HEENT:No JVD, neck supple, No lymphadenopathy i CHEST:Lungs are clear anteriorly without wheeze, rales, or rhonchi.
Slightly distended.
EXTREMITIES: warm, no peripheral edema NEUROLOGIC: intubated, sedated, opens eyes to loud voice.
No color flow identified in the right portal vein or main portal vein, although Doppler signal was able to be identified.
This may represent an extremely slow flow versus thrombus within these vessels.
A spot in the left lower quadrant was marked for paracentesis.
There is no evidence of cholelithiasis.
Moderate left pleural effusion with left lower lobe consolidation likely representing compressive atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.
Elevated diaphragm, much greater on the left.
No discrete pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection is demonstrated.
Moderate simple ascites.
Findings consistent with cirrhosis.
No sequelae of portal hypertension or enhancing hepatic mass lesion.
Colonic distention with air fluid levels, incompletely assessed on teh current exam.
Body wall edema suggestive of fluid overload.
L4 body focal hypodensity of unclear etiology.
This may represent focal osteopenia, and attention to this area is suggested on follow-up imaging.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Of note, she has a left sided pleural effusion, with no evidence of pneumonia.
However, a paracentesis was performed which did not show evidence of infection.
Because of severe hypotension, she required two pressors.
