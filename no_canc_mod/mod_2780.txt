Admission Date:  [**2180-11-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2180-11-18**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year-old male with hypertension and a family history of coronary artery disease who is admitted to the CTU for observation following coronary catheterization.
The patient was in his usual state of health until the day of admission when he woke from sleep around 3:00 a.m. noting substernal chest pain and nausea and vomiting.
He went to his primary care physician's office where an electrocardiogram showed anterior ST segment elevations.
The patient received aspirin and nitroglycerin times three with slight relief in his chest pain.
His catheterization showed single vessel coronary artery disease and an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.
At the time of admission in the Coronary Care Unit the patient confirms above history and denies any current chest pain, shortness of breath or other complaints.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy on day 28 of 42.
Chronic lumbar radiculopathy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother with coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
General, elderly male, obese, pleasant and conversant and in no acute distress.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
2+ dorsalis pedis pulse and radial pulses.
Chest x-ray questionable right middle lobe infiltrate.
No evidence of congestive heart failure.
Cardiovascular:  Coronaries, the patient is admitted with acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.
He went to emergent cardiac catheterization, which showed 100% stenosis of his mid left anterior descending coronary artery.
The patient remained stable following catheterization and had no subsequent ischemic or anginal symptoms.
Pump, in the catheterization laboratory the patient was noted to have an increased wedge pressure raising concerns for elevated filling pressures.
The patient remained stable following catheterization with close monitoring in the Coronary Care Unit and echocardiogram was obtained the day after admission to assess his wall functioning following his acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Echocardiogram showed multiple wall motion abnormalities including anteroseptal, anterior and apical akinesis.
He also had focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
He was started on Lovenox for anticoagulation given his wall motion abnormalities with plans for a follow up echocardiogram in approximately one month.
Given his EF of 40% and clinical symptoms consistent with mild fluid overload he was started on low dose Lasix.
The patient had excellent diuresis with this regimen.
Valve, the patient had an echocardiogram, which showed mild mitral regurgitation.
He otherwise had no valvular abnormalities.
He did have a short episode of ventricular tachycardia the day following his myocardial infarction, which was thought to represent reperfusion.
He remained asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable with this episode.
He was maintained on tele for several more days and had no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia.
Diabetes:  The patient reported a history of diabetes on admission, which had been on diet and exercise controlled.
His blood sugar at admission was markedly elevated at 372.
This was felt to be particularly important in the setting of his cardiovascular disease and acute myocardial infarction.
[**Last Name (un) **] diabetes center was consulted for help in managing his diabetes and his new insulin regimen.
Renal insufficiency:  The patient with mildly elevated creatinine at admission, which further bumped for the first few days of his hospitalization.
Acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Cardiac wall motion abnormalities including akinesis and hypokinesis.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 requiring insulin.
Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
