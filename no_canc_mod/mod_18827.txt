The echo at that time showed no coronary disease with an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm with a mean gradient of 45, an EF of 59 percent, an LVEDP of 10, aortic valve heavily calcified.
She had no coronary disease.
Right common iliac stenosis of 70 percent and subtotal left common iliac stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient with known aortic stenosis followed with serial echocardiograms.
Repeat echo done in [**12/2177**] showed left ventricular hypertrophy with significant aortic calcification and aortic valve area of 0.4 to 0.5 cm2 with a peak gradient of 70 mm/Hg.
No complaints of angina.
Aortic stenosis.
PVD with aortoiliac disease.
Degenerative disc disease.
Stress incontinence.
ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No diabetes, no thyroid disease, no CVA, no TIA, no seizures, no peptic ulcer disease, no hematochezia, no melena, no COPD, no asthma, no fevers, chills, sweats, or constitutional systems.
Posterior PVD, pain in thighs with walking; relieved with rest.
Chest x-ray showed mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with no evidence of CHF.
EKG:  A left bundle branch block at a rate of 80 with Q wave in Lead III as well as V2 through 3, an ST depression in Lead I, aVL, and V6.
No erythema or exudates.
Neck is supple; no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly; no JVD, with a radiating murmur.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema; no varicosities.
In summary, the patient had a difficult operative course.
She had an aortic valve replacement with a #19 mosaic valve.
The patient showed evidence of right heart failure following a wean from the bypass pump.
In summary, the patient had an RVAD placed, and following the procedure she was again returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, again, with an open chest.
On postoperative day eight the patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab for a diagnostic catheterization which showed a tight right coronary artery lesion which was stented at that time.
However, she was noted to have an elevated white blood cell count.
By [**2178-2-27**] the patient was beginning to have an ARDS type picture by chest x-ray, and at that time she was bronched by the Interventional Pulmonary Service.
The bronchoscopy showed diffuse blood in the airways with bleeding from the right upper lobe.
Over the next week the patient continued to make slow progress at weaning from her vasoactive IV medications as well as slow progress in weaning from the ventilator.
In summary, she had a 7 mm percutaneous Portex trach with a small amount of superficial bleeding.
Additionally, the patient was noted to have some sternal wound drainage.
Distal incision was superficially debrided and a VAC dressing applied.
However, by [**2178-4-2**] the incision showed necrotic tissue in the base of the wound and her sternum was felt to be unstable.
Extremities are warm with no edema.
Aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement with     number 19 mosaic valve.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Degenerative disc disease.
Stress incontinence.
Right hip replacement.
Right carpal tunnel release.
Right heart failure.
