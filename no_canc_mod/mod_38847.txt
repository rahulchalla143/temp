Admission Date:  [**2169-7-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-8-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2131-6-2**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 38 year old Haitian female with a recent history of travel to [**Country 16573**] who presents with fever and chills for two days.
She was in her usual state of fully functional health until two days prior to admission when she developed sudden onset of fever, shaking chills and diffuse muscle aches.
The patient also reported a bitemporal headache with the fever but without neck stiffness.
She has never had a presentation similar to this one, nor has she ever been a diagnosis of malaria or yellow fever.
Her husband reports having malaria at least three times while growing up in [**Country 16573**] but not since.
The patient denies cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, light-headedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, poor appetite, urinary tract changes or night sweats.
She reports no new sexual contacts or HIV risk factors.
She presents for evaluation and treatment of fever and chills.
Gestational diabetes mellitus.
No smoking, drugs or alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:  She has no history of lymphoma or other cancers.
ALLERGIES AND DRUG REACTIONS:  The patient has had nausea and vomiting with Codeine.
The oropharynx is moist with no lesions noted.
Neck - no nuchal rigidity or lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac - regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No wheezes or crackles.
Back - no spinal or costovertebral angle tenderness.
Her abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound or guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly, normoactive bowel sounds times four.
Extremities - 2+ pulses times four, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no joint effusions and no changes to nails.
Dermatologic - no jaundice or pallor, no rashes appreciated.
Peripheral smear demonstrated malarial forms with 1.4% parasitemia.
Urinalysis showed 11 white blood cells and trace ketone.
The chest x-ray on admission was normal with no infiltrates or effusions.
No typing of the organisms was obtained and she had 1.7% parasitemia on peripheral smear.
On hospital day two, the patient desaturated to 87% but looked well and had no evidence of respiratory distress.
She had several episodes of emesis after Quinine administration which was not helped by Reglan or Droperidol.
An emergent AP film showed ill-defined opacity of the right lung base and to a lesser extent in the left lower lobe.
These were read as consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
On hospital day three, the patient continued to spike fevers and have vomiting.
Her examination was noteworthy for crackles at the right base.
Repeat chest x-ray showed bilateral posterobasal segment consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
D-dimer and FDP were elevated but fibrinogen was within normal limits at 334.
The patient was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for treatment of aspiration pneumonia.
She was started on Quinidine at night as she had many episodes of emesis and the intravenous administration of Quinidine was felt to be superior to the oral Quinine.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations and possibility of small pleural effusions.
On day four, the patient was afebrile on the morning shift but febrile later on.
An increase in lower lobe consolidation is evident of the right middle lobe and lingula and bilateral pleural effusions with the right side greater than the left were appreciated on chest x-ray.
Clindamycin was added to cover aspiration pneumonia and malaria.
Chest x-ray showed increase in bilateral air space opacities consistent with pneumonic consolidation, adult respiratory distress syndrome.
There were small bilateral pleural effusion.
She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Pulmonary - The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with impending respiratory failure and was intubated on [**2169-8-2**].
She had been having problems oxygenating at first, most of which was positional in nature.
Chest x-ray continued to show adult respiratory distress syndrome, most likely secondary to malarial infection.
An echocardiogram was performed to rule out pulmonary edema.
Echocardiogram showed borderline pulmonary artery hypertension.
Infectious disease - The patient was most likely felt to have falciparum malaria based on her clinical presentation, essentially the severity of that presentation.
She was found to be [**Doctor Last Name 5239**] antigen negative and [**Doctor Last Name 5239**] antigen is required for infection for plasmodium vivax.
The Levaquin was discontinued as it was felt that aspiration was unlikely in a young otherwise healthy woman.
The Clindamycin was left on as it had some protective effect against malaria.
The patient was afebrile since admission to the Intensive Care Unit with repeated spikes until [**2169-8-8**].
She was afebrile [**2169-8-9**], in the morning but spiked again in the afternoon.
Malaria was thought to be an unlikely cause as she had been without parasitemia for several days.
CT of the head, chest and abdomen on [**2169-8-8**], were negative for any intracranial pathology.
She was aggressively hydrated and eventually became somewhat fluid overloaded being approximately five liters positive.
She began to have worsening hypoxemia and increased pulmonary pressures and was diuresed.
Hematologic - The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with low hematocrit, thrombocytopenia and relatively low white count.
Her low hematocrit was considered likely secondary to direct effects of malarial infection, low grade hemolysis and underlying iron deficiency.
Parenteral iron was not started as the risk of anaphylaxis was greater than the potential benefit.
She had transient thrombocytopenia which resolved.
This was also felt to be secondary to malaria.
Her prothrombin time and INR were rising which was thought to be secondary to malnutrition.
Gastrointestinal - The patient had diarrhea on the regular medical floor.
She had stool sent for C. difficile and fecal leukocytes at the time which were negative.
On admission to the Intensive Care Unit, she had slightly elevated liver function tests.
She had ascites on CT scan on [**2169-8-8**], and was reported to have no bowel sounds in the Intensive Care Unit on [**2169-8-7**], and [**2169-8-8**].
She had repeatedly high gastric aspirates which were occult blood negative.
The patient's fevers were felt to be secondary to a line infection.
Culture grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Aspiration pneumonia.
