Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 104673**] is a 50yo woman with h/o AFib on coumadin, CHB s/p PM, MVR with prosthetic valvewho presented on [**4-25**] with 4d of melena, feeling lightheaded and weak.
She was also noted to have ARF and hyperkalemia with peaked T waves on EKG.
EGD on [**4-27**] showed gastritis, ulcers in the cardia and the body of the stomach but no active bleeding.
Findings were thought to be most likely cause of GI bleed.
She has had B wrist swelling since then.
B arm XR shows no sign of osteomyelitis, although CRP and ESR were elevated.
Due to mental status changes with pt being confused her CTX was increased to meningitis doses empirically, as LP could not be performed given her high INR, which cannot be normalized [**2-14**] mechanical valve.
The patient was incidentally found to have an elevated amylase/lipase and was kept NPO as well as hydrated.
Abd U/s revealed mod GB sludge, no stones, mild wall edema, calcifications in the liver and patent vasculature.
She was started on CTX/azithromycin/flagyl at that time to cover for possible community acquired or aspiration pna.
Past Medical History: - Complete heart block s/p PM - Atrial fibrillation --- anticoagulated and rate controlled - Lower extremity edema - Rheumatic heart disease with mitral valve disease s/p MVR x3(porcine valve, prosthetic valve, Bjork-Shiley valve).

Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS 99.8, 100/60, 81, 98% RA, 22 Gen: lethargic, answers questions appropriately, unable to fully converse/cooperate with exam HEENT: anisocoria R pupil 3mm, L 2mm, reactive to light, OP not injected, MM dry, thrush over tongue Neck: no JVD noted Cor: s1s2, irreg irreg, III/VI systolic murmur, artificial valve click Pulm: CTAB except L base one wheeze/crackle at base Abd: soft NT ND +BS, no HSM Ext: no c/c/e LE, B hands edematous, erythematous over all fingers, NT, full ROM Neuro: confused, lethargic, unable to cooperate with neuro exam, generalized weakness, BUE 2/5 strength   Pertinent Results: bartonella panel pending .
blood cxs [**4-25**] [**2-14**] pasteurella, 4/14 [**2-16**] pasteurella  STUDIES: [**4-26**] CXR: no definite evidence of pna, L pleural clacification possibly c/w asbestos exposure, small effusions .
[**4-26**] echo: EF nl, physiologic MR, 3+ TR, mod systolic PA HTN .
CT head: no hemorrhage, abcess or mass .
Extensive coronary artery calcifications.
Small right pleural effusion with atelectasis at the lung bases and subcentimeter bibasilar calcified granulomas.
Feature-less fluid filled distal colon.
5.Diffuse abdominal and pelvic ascites.
No evidence of intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess.
Differential diagnosis includes edema or cellulitis - - clinical correlation required.
No bony changes to confirm the presence of osteomyelitis.
Diffuse osteopenia noted  Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo woman with h/o MVR, afib, recent cat scratch presented with 4d melena on coumadin for MVP and Afib, required brief intubation, now s/p extubation doing well from respiratory standpoint.
Now transferred to floor from MICU with Pasturella bacteremia in setting of prosthetic valve.
Pasturella bacteremia: day 5 CTX, day 2 of increased meningitis dose.
- pt was unable to tolerate [**Month/Year (2) **] to rule out endocarditis - azithro stopped yesterday per ID recs after 5d of treatment.
- increased CTX dose to cover meningitis as of [**4-29**] given pt with mental status changes and INR elevation making LP risky (cannot reverse anticoagulation given artificial valve) - attempted [**Date Range **] today to rule out endocarditis, but pt could not tolerate - will give tetanus vaccine as pt last remembers having it in [**2172**] after cut with metal.
Lip lesion: Per note, Tzank smear sent today by ICU team to rule out HSV, although not logged.
supratherapeutic INR: unclear cause for supratherapeutic INR on admission.
No dose changes recently.
hyperemia/edema in B hands: per ID recs, this is concerning as necrotizing fasciitis can occur with pasturella.
ESR 100/CRP 116 but B arm XR no sign of osteomyelitis.
- will d/w ID re whether pt should have bone scan of B wrists - this may not be helpful if pt has overlying cellulitis rather than simply soft tissue swelling .
no active bleeding seen on EGD.
Likely gastric ulcers were etiology of anemia.
# pancreatitis: amylase/lipase trending down.
unclear cause of pancreatitis.
h/o dig toxicity with dig level 0.8. .
thrombocytopenia: Pt has had steady decrease in plastelet count since admission.
HIT antibody negative.
Continue to monitor and transfuse platelets for active bleeding or plts <20.
FEN: per swallow eval soft solids and thin liquids but NO STRAWS.
Pt to take supervised meals, aspiration precautions.
Nutrition consult re pt's low albumin and cachectic appearance.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: pasteurella bacteremia gastric erosions upper GI bleed .
**Please be sure to have your blood drawn at your usual clinic for your INR check TWICE per week so that your dose can be readjusted.
**Please be sure to have your blood drawn ONCE per week at our usual lab and have results faxed to our [**Hospital **] clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].
This is to monitor your infection and your kidney and liver function.
If you have bloody stool, black tarry stool, lightheadedness, increased arm swelling, fever, chills or other concerning symptoms please call your primary doctor or come to the emergency room.
