Admission Date:  [**2186-7-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-8-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2158-6-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, nausea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Upper Endoscopy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 28 yo F with a past medical history of IBS and ADD who presents with abdominal pain and musculoskeletal pain.
She did not have abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting at this time.
She did have three apthous ulcers- which she has had in the past.
Approximately one week ago she developed subxiphoid abdominal pain, dull, mild in nature, and nonradiating which she attributed to heartburn- she had no relief with ranitidine with no improvement.
She says that the pain is much worse with eating.
At around this same time she developed she developed bilateral shin pain.
At this point her diarrhea had improved somewhat- she weas still having loose stools but much less frequently.
Abdominal pain worsened to [**11-12**] and was worse with po intake.
Two days ago her shin pain developed in diffuse myalgias and arthralgias involving the ankles, knees, wrists, elbows and shoulders- this was so bad that it was difficult to walk.
She denies any new rashes during this time and denies any swelling in her joints or any edema.
Also denies any sick contacts, recent travel abroad, and new pets or exposure to animals.
No recent NSAID use.
She denies eating any new or suspicious foods.
She denies any eye pain or visual changes with the exception of slightly tender eyelid on R side.
Of note, the patient had an extensive GI workup in HS that ruled out celiac and lead to a presumptive diagnosis of IBS.
In college, she again had an extensive GI workup at [**Hospital **] was was finally found to have pleurisy.
CT abdomen again revealed transverse colitis with associated LAD.
Pelvic exam was performed and was reportedly normal, with GC and chlamydia sent.
Patient was initially going to the floor, but dropped to SBP 80s and only improved to 88/40 with fluid resuscitation.
Past Medical History: -IBS--Diagnosed as teenager, with occasional flares since.
No colonoscopy in the past.
Pain at that time different from this recent presentation.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, mild tenderness to palpation in epigastric region with no rebound or guarding, non-distended, bowel sounds present  Ext: Marked edema in legs, feet and hands.
Few splotchy red macules on lower legs, with one raised 1 inchx1inch nodule on R ankle.
No acute abdominal pathology detected.
Numerous prominent mesenteric lymph nodes along the hepatic flexure, transverse mesocolon and ileocolic region.
As per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 26216**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] resident physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient had transverse colitis diagnosed on outside hospital CT four days ago.
Given this history these nodes may relate to underlying infectious or inflammatory etiology.
If no evidence of Crohn's disease/inflammatory bowel disease, suggest repeat CT in [**4-8**] months to assess for interval change of the lymph nodes.
Colonoscopy Impression [**2186-8-2**]:Stool in the transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum;;Erythema and congestion in the colon;v Normal mucosa in the colon; Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum  Endoscopy Impression [**2186-8-2**]: Erythema, congestion and erosion in the antrum; Coffee-ground blood in the stomach;Ulcer in the pylorus (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Biopsies: SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: GI BX ( 3 JARS) [**2186-8-2**]  DIAGNOSIS:  A.  Gastric ulcer biopsy:  Focal chronic active gastritis with erosion and a cluster of macrophages suggestive of poorly formed granuloma.
Special stain for H. pylori pending.
C.  Sigmoid biopsies:  Focal chronic active colitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 28 yo F with a past medical history of IBS, ADD presents with abdominal pain and msk pain.
Her symptoms initially started with diarrhea and developed into abdominal pain and polymyalgias.
Abdominal pain: In a patient who was completely healthy with the exception of IBS, the differential of this pain was extensive upon admission.
Crohns seemed most likely diagnosis, given family history of two first cousins with several weeks of abdominal pain with myalgia/arthralgia and rash (see below.)
Patient was treated empirically with IV Solumedrol because she was in severe pain and had a nodular rash.
Flex sig showed erythema and congestion in the colon, Normal mucosa in the colon and otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum.
Upper endoscopy showed erythema, congestion and erosion in the antrum,Coffee-ground blood in the stomach,Ulcer in the pylorus (biopsy),Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.
Biopsies showed Focal chronic active gastritis with erosion and a cluster of macrophages suggestive of poorly formed granuloma with H.pylori stain pending, focal active ileitis and focal chronic active colitis.
# Arthrlagias/Myalgias: Patient presented with arthralgias and myalgias which worsened over first night of hospitalization.
She also developed a erythematous, nodular rash on her legs and arms over the first night of her admission; this rash started on her ankles and rapidly spread over the course of 10 hours to her arms.
This rash was thought to be consistent with erythema nodosum, although the time course was puzzling.
She was completely asymptomatic for hypotension and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
Given endoscopy showing ulcer and colonoscopy showing melena, the patient likely bled from her ulcer at some point.
These studies indicate that there is now no active bleeding and patient is competely hemodynamically stable.
There is likely a component of both iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease.
Disp:*40 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Colitis secondary to Inflammatory Bowel Disase- Crohns Hypotension Anemia Duodenal Ulcer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for severe abdominal pain and musculoskeletal pain with a rash.
You were treated with pain medications, started on antibiotics for concern for possible infection and started on steroids out of concern for IBD.
You had a flexible sigmoidoscopy that showed inflammation in your colon and you had an endoscopy which showed an ulcer.
The studies did not see any active bleeding but did reveal stool with blood (melena) which indicates that you did bleed at some point, likely from your ulcer.
The GI team found that these studies were likely consistent with Crohns disease (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) and the biopsies that they took confirmed this.
Of note, your musculoskeletal pain and rash are also consistent with Crohns disease.
This was likely due partially to past bleeding from your ulcer and partially due to receiving a lot of fluids.
