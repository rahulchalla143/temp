Admission Date:  [**2131-8-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-8-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-10-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tetanus,Diphther Toxoid Adult / Aggrenox  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status Hyperthermia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of diabetes, peripheral [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] disease, stroke, CAD, chronic renal failure who presents with hyperthermia and lethargy.
As temperature improved to 102 degrees, patient's mental status improved, temperature was brought down to 98.6 degrees prior to transfer.
Chest x-ray demonstrated fluid overload and patient had increased respiratory rate, therefore he received furosemide 80mg IV, and was also temporarily started on NIPPV.
Non-contrast CT Torso was done to assess for infection and appeared negative.
For refractory hypertension and fluid overload on chest x-ray, he was started on nitroglycerin gtt, which was turned off after blood pressure improved.
CT head was also performed and showed no acute process.

Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.6 BP: 181/58 HR: 72 RR: 20 O2Sat: 94% Gen: alert and oriented, NAD Cardiac: RRR, no murmurs Lungs: CTAB Abd: soft, NT, +BS Ext: 2+ oedema BL   Pertinent Results:  Laboratories: Notable for Creatinine of 2.7 (baseline 1.7-2.0), potassium 6.3, lactate 2.1, UA negative for Leukocyte esterase or nitrites, WBC 18.5 with 85% PMN and 1% Bands, Hct 30.7 (baseline 34-36), normal liver enzymes.
ECG: Sinus rhythm at 76 bpm, left-atrial abnormality, normal axis, first degree AV conduction delay, normal QT intervals, poor R-wave progress, no specific ST or T-wave changes, Q-waves in III and aVF, consistent with prior inferior MI.
Patient had left-bundle morphology IVCD in prior tracing, but QRS width is 124, so now complete LBBB.
No source of infection is identified on this non-contrast CT. 2.
Stable perinephric low density lesion, likely an exophytic simple renal cyst.
New linear metal density wires within the urinary bladder.
L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis.
No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Encephalomalacia of the right occipital lobe, consistent with the patient's history of right posterior cerebral artery infarct.
Stable, subtle, asymmetric low attenuation of the left temporal lobe, most likely representing chronic small vessel disease.
TTE on [**2131-8-6**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-9-27**], mild mitral regurgitation is now seen (may be no difference as image quality is better on the current study).
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of diabetes, peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease, stroke, CAD, chronic renal failure who presents with hyperthermia.
<br>HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: <br>Fevers - Patient presented with fever to 104, which came down with cooling blankets and ice.
Initially fever was believed to be hyperthermia (being in a hot room with no A/C in the summer), but patient re-spiked after cooling which increased concern about infectious etiology, likely exacerbated by high room temperatures at home.
He was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible complicated/MRSA UTI.
He had one blood culture on [**8-2**] positive for coag-negative staph in one bottle but this was ultimately thought to be a contaminant and ceftriaxone was D/Ced at this point.
The copper wire grew out coag-positive staph which was speciated as MRSA and was the reason he was initially put on vancomycin, and this was continued until [**2131-8-8**].
On the floor, he remained afebrile for the rest of his hospital course.
<br>Acute on chronic renal failure - Patient presented with hyperkalemia likely secondary to renal failure.
Acute renal failure was felt to be likely secondary to dehydration and possibly a component of ATN.
<br>Bladder Foreign Body: CT scan showed foreign body in the bladder which was new since last CT scan in [**2131-4-3**].
This may have been a source of infection contributing to patient's fevers.
<br>Mental Status: Patient presented with altered mental status.
Likely toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.
<br>Acute on chronic hypertension: Patient became very hypertensive with fever spikes, requiring nitro gtt in the ED, and then again briefly in the ICU for about 1 hour.
<br>Chronic pain - continued gabapentin  <br>CAD - Continued clopidogrel, aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol,  <br>Gout - continued allopurinol, tramodol  <br>Diabetes - Insulin 40 Units in AM, 30 Units in PM per home regimen, and sliding scale  <br>FEN: Low-sodium, heart-healthy diabetic diet, IV fluids as above.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual PRN as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Foreign body in bladder colonized with MRSA Acute on chronic renal failure   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a high temperature and increased white blood cells.
Your blood grew a small amount of bacteria but this was likely a contaminant and not a true blood infection.
you were also found to have a copper wire in your bladder which had some infection, but your urine itself did not seem to be infected.
You were briefly in the ICU and your fever resolved and after you were transferred to the medical floor you were stable with no further signs of infection.
You received some antibiotics to treat any possible infection of the blood or urine.
If you have high fever, urinary burning or discomfort, or shortness of breath, chest pain, fever or other symptoms which are concerning to you, please call your PCP or if your PCP is not available please go to the nearest emergency room.
