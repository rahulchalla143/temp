The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right heart strain.
Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
Trace aortic and mitral regurgitation.
There is volume loss at both bases with obscuration of the right heart border likely representing right middle lobe infiltrate.
There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution and perihilar haze.
It is difficult to assess for small effusions given overlying soft tissues.
The overall impression is that of mild CHF with a superimposed infiltrate in the right lower lobe given history of pneumonia is likely.
Acute thromboembolus in the basal trunk of the left pulmonary artery, extending to several segmental branches.
Fat-density mass in the right middle lobe at location of prior pneumonia, is likely lipoid pneumonia.
Exogenous lipoid pneumonia secondary to aspiration of a lipid-[**Doctor First Name **] substance, such as mineral oil supplementation, should also be considered.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes which are modest and non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-7-22**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Brief Hospital Course: Chronologic course:  The patient is a 63 year-old woman with Goodpasture's disease (diagnosed [**3-/2119**]) s/p plasmapheresis on prednisone and cytoxan, who initially presented to OSH with nausea and vomiting, found to have bilateral DVTs, and subsequently developed progressive dyspnea and hypotension prompting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Upon arrival she was noted to have fever in the setting of neutropenia/pancytopenia and an infiltrate on CXR.
She was started on Vancomycin and Meropenem (latter switched to Cefepime) and a Heparin drip for DVT treatment.
On [**2119-7-15**], she developed Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was given IV metoprolol without response, followed by Amiodarone bolus and drip with conversion to sinus rhythm.
Per heme/onc, the Neupogen was stopped on [**2119-7-18**] as she was no longer neutropenic.
She was continued on vancomycin + cefepime for 8 days for her pneumonia until [**2119-7-21**].
The patient experienced R sided chest pain waxed and waned over the course of her admission reaching a crescendo on Sunday [**7-24**] when she became extremely uncomfortable, with generalized malaise.
CXR showed no new pathology.
Chest CTA revealed a L-sided pulmonary embolism and a R-sided mass (resolving PNA vs atelectasis vs tumor).
She had another episode of chest pain at dialysis on [**7-26**] that responded to high dose dilaudid and again at dialysis on [**7-28**].
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # ESRD on HD: Secondary to Goodpasture's.
Plan is to treat with azothioprine for 3 months (managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to prevent renal progression and to prevent pulmonary disease.
# Septic shock: Likely source was pulmonary in the setting of neutropenia.
Cytoxan was discontinued due to pancytopenia.
Now on azothiprine and will need weekly CBC to assess for bone marrow suppression.
No clinically significant bleeding noted while hospitalized, except for epistaxis (see below).
# DVT/PE: Started on heparin drip in hospital for DVT and PE (diagnosed by CTA) with goal PTT 60-100.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: On [**7-15**], in ICU pt had episode of A fib with RVR that responded poorly to beta-blockers/calcium channel blockers due to hypotension but later resolved with IV Amiodarone.
# Pulmonary findings on CT: On [**2119-7-24**], a CTA chest was performed to assess for PE.
This scan showed a new lesion in the right middle lobe with a differential diagnosis including resolving PNA, rounded atelectasis, or new lung mass.
Her CT findings were not believed to be consistent with pulmonary Goodpasture's.
Likely multifactorial, no obvious active bleeds, most recent guaiac was negative.
[**Month (only) 116**] be related to chronic disease.
There is no appreciable pulmonary embolism in the right lung, troponins were negative, and there was no clinical or radiographic evidence of new pneumonia.
Responded to PRN Dilaudid 0.25-0.5mg.
The pain almost always occurred at HD.
# Epistaxis: On the evening of [**7-27**] the patient developed L-sided epistaxis.
It was a slow bleed but continuous and lasted until the day of discharge.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  - Amiodarone taper as above and follow-up with Cardiology for further management of atrial fibrillation.
- Pulmonology follow-up and repeat CT chest have been arranged for abnormal CT finding.
