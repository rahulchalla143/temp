PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for both parents with sickle cell trait with previous child of mother and father of baby infected with sickle cell disease.
Admitted at 26 weeks for monitoring.
The exam was remarkable for a well-appearing preterm infant in no distress with initial vital signs with a temperature of 97.4, heart rate of 145, respiratory rate of 44.
No grunting, flaring or retracting was noted with clear breath sounds.
On day of life #24, due to     persistence of the soft systolic murmur a chest x-ray was     obtained--the cardiac silhouette was noted to be     normal.
There was some change in the lung fields     consistent with a slight amount of chronic lung disease.
GI: Patient was begun on phototherapy on day of life #2     for an elevated bilirubin.
Phototherapy was discontinued     on day of life #6, and she has no further issues with     hyperbilirubinemia.
Repeat screening was sent and returned on day of life #16, also with an FS pattern consistent with sickle cell disease.
As stated     previously, patient was started on amoxicillin due to     concerns of sickle cell disease.
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from     [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the     following 3 criteria: 1) born at less than 32 weeks     gestation; 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the     following: Daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the     household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities,     or school-age siblings; or 3) with chronic lung disease.
Before this age (and for the first 24 months of the     child's life) immunization against influenza is     recommended for household contacts and out of home     caregivers.
Sickle cell disease.
