History of Present Illness: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with pmhx HTN, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain starting yesterday afternoon.
She characterizes the chest pain as a pressure.
Patient has never had this chest pain before.
She reports that the pain came on suddenly and lasted for approx an hour.
The pain came and went the whole day.
However, patient notes that she has been more short of breath over the last couple days and noted diaphoresis yesterday with walking.
Patient was able to sleep without pain last night, but remembers waking up with the pain.
EKG done at rehab showed st segment elevations and patient was sent emergently to the ED.
Patient was started on heparin gtt, integrillin, plavix 600, ASA 325, NTG bolus and taken to cardiac cath where PCI showed LAD with 70% mid just beyond origin of major diagonal, 90% mid-distal LAD, large diag with 90% complex lesion proximally.
On transfer to the floor, patient was HD stable and feeling well without chest pain, sob, abd pain, nausea, leg or back pain.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Past Medical History: sciatica afib not anticoagulated HTN CAD Breast cancer [**2124**] s/p left masectomy PUD s/p subtotal gastectomy colon cancer macular degeneration CRI (baseline 1.1) Anemia (mixed iron deficiency and ACD) hyperthyroidism CVA [**10-2**] Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia, Hypertension, age   Pertinent Results: [**2156-8-5**] 02:00PM   PT-11.9 PTT-21.9* INR(PT)-1.0 [**2156-8-5**] 02:00PM   WBC-11.1* RBC-3.72* HGB-11.7* HCT-35.9* MCV-96 MCH-31.3 MCHC-32.5 RDW-15.9* [**2156-8-5**] 02:00PM   GLUCOSE-137* UREA N-34* CREAT-1.3* SODIUM-143 POTASSIUM-4.7 CHLORIDE-107 TOTAL CO2-20* ANION GAP-21* .
Cardiac catheterization: PTCA COMMENTS: Initial angiography revealed a severe 90% lesion in the ist diagonal at the bifurcation of the LAD ( smaller vessel).
The LAD had a 70% stenosis at bifurcation and 90% stenosis beyond it.
A CPT floppy wire crossed the diagonal lesion easily.
Small dissection noted.
Excellent result with normal flow down vessel and no residual stenosis.
Excellent result with normal flow down vessel and no residual stenosis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to extensive apical hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female who presented with chest pain and was found to have anterior STEMI.
# CV --ischemia- Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 97028**] was started in the ED on aspirin, plavix, integrillin and taken urgently to cath where she was found to have 90% occlusion of a large/dominant D1 artery which was treated with a bare-metal-stent.
She also had a diffusely-diseased small LAD with 90% mid-stenosis which was treated with balloon angioplasty that was complicated by a small dissection (this was further treated with balloon inflation x 3 minutes with good result).
She was asymptomatic on transfer to CCU and denied chest pain throughout her stay.
--pump- Ms. [**Known lastname 97029**] ecchocardiogram showed an EF of 30-40% with moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
--rhythm- Patient has h/o paroxysmal afib and was not anticoagulated on admission.
She had no a-fib while in-house, and because of her markedly-easy bruisability we decided to not anticoagulate her.
