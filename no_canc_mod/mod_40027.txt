Limited resting hemodynamics revealed central hypertension with opening blood pressures of 180/74 mmHg.
Angiography demonstrated a type 1 aortic arch.
Subclavian arteries were without angiographically significant, flow-limiting disease or gradient.
The right internal carotid artery had an eccentric 90% lesion and filled the ACA and MCA.
The left common carotid arteyr and internal carotid artery were without flow-limiting disease.
The left vertebral was without significant disease and filled the cerebellar circulation.
Successful placement of [**6-25**] x 40 mm AccuLink stent postdilated with a 4.5 mm balloon in the right internal carotid artery (ICA) using AccuNet filter distal embolic protection.
Final angiography demonstrated a 20% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Severe right internal carotid artery stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 95068**] is a 79 year-old man with a h/o TIA, recent right eye vision loss, high grade stenosis of the right ICA, referred for carotid  revascularization.
The patient's blood pressures were extremely labile overnight, requiring both pressor support and intermittently labetolol drip.
He was restarted on home medications except for antihypertensives.
