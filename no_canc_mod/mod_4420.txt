No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The is a leaflet [**Pager number 11368**] at the posterior medial commissure with a posteriorly directed jet of mitral regurgitaton.

CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W&W/O C Reason: assess for bleeding, injury to liver [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 34 year old man s/p MVR with traumatic injury to liver with angiocath intraop, now with distended abdomen, dropping hematocrit.
CLINICAL INDICATION: MVR with traumatic injury to liver.
Bilateral consolidation seen at the lung bases.
The right chest tube is seen with minimal air within the right pleural space.
Previously noted right lower lobe nodule is not again seen on image #11 of series 4, unchanged since the prior exam.
There does appear to be a splenic laceration, well seen on image #26 of series 4.
Small hypoattenuating foci seen within the right kidney, which are too small to characterize but likely represent simple cysts.
Scattered subcentimeter periportal and peripancreatic lymph nodes are incidentally noted.
No suspicious lytic or blastic bony lesions are seen.
Moderate hemoperitoneum.
However, there does appear to be a splenic laceration.
Bibasilar consolidation seen.
Moderate portal and mild lobular/periportal mixed cell inflammation (grade 2).2.
Moderate steatosis, without balloon degeneration or intracytoplasmic hyalin.
Trichrome stain: Increased portal and focal periportal fibrosis (stage 2).4.
Iron stain: No stainable iron.
Note:  The findings are most consistent with chronic hepatitis C.  The mixed inflammation is suggestive of an additional drug effect.
There are no features of ischemic disease or abscesses.
Please refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative note for further details.
Mr.[**Known lastname 28388**] immediate post operative course was complicated by hemodynamic instability due to anemia with hematocrit dropping from 35 to 16.
The addition of Levophed was required and serial monitoring of hematocrit,platlets, and fibrinogen ensued, along with transfusion of multiple blood products.CT csan of the abdomen revealed extensive hemoperitoneum with no obvious source.
Upon exploration a liver evulsion and splenic laceration was identified and cauterized.Please refer to Dr[**Location (un) **] operative report for further details.
The patient was transferred back to the CVICU with his abdomen packed,left open due to high bladder pressures and in anticipation of further resuscitation requirements.
ID was consulted due to postoperative fevers and in light of his recent hixtory of endocarditis.ABX regiment and serial pan cultures were performed.
[**4-25**] Mr.[**Known lastname 6884**] was extubated without incident.He continued to remain febrile and on ABX regiment until cultures revealed haemophilus in his sputum.
