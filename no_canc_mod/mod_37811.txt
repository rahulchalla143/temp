HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and left face and arm weakness, who presents for elective right carotid stenting.
History included the following:  Right siphon stenosis discovered in [**2151**], which was treated with antiplatelet agents.
Subsequent MR imaging on [**2153-12-25**] revealed 40% to 60% stenosis in the right ICA.
The patient has a one year history of TIA characterized by left hand and face weakness/numbness and dysarthria.
A Carotid ultrasound, in [**2154-4-24**], revealed 80% to 90% stenosis in the same vessel.
Angiogram at this time revealed severe right ICA stenosis ( >95%) at the bifurcation with right siphon stenosis and 4 mm aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery.
The patient underwent right carotid stent without complications.
Peripheral vascular disease 3.
Degenerative joint disease.
Breast cancer status post XRT.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN AND CODEINE.
FAMILY HISTORY:  History was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.
GENERAL:  Intubated patient in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, supple, no bruits, no lymphadenopathy.
No evidence of hematoma or bruits.
There is a horizontal-gaze nystagmus bilaterally; moves symmetrically.
The hospital course was complicated by a moderate left groin hematoma in the setting of heparin anticoagulation post procedure.
While in house, we also note a metabolic acidosis consistent with elevated lactic acid.
This is likely partially secondary to hypovolemia and, therefore, she was transfused and the volume status corrected.
Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) 101641**] also had mild elevation in creatinine likely secondary to her dye load during the procedure.
She is able to ambulate both on a level plane and up and down stairs without problems.
We note that she has a few episodes of bradycardia down to the low 40s, which are not sustained.
We should further state that she had no evidence of chronotropic incompetence.
Right carotid artery stenting.
The patient continued to have an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery, which will be monitored by Drs.
This was done as the patient has evidence of increased creatinine and, therefore, decreased creatinine clearance.
