She attributed these symptoms to a virus and was taking tylenol for symptomatic relief.
She complained of severe fatigue, nausea, vomiting and poor appetite.
Family denies a history of psychiatric disease or suicide attempt, and does not feel that this episode represents a suicidal gesture.
No reported fever, chills, sweats, headache, stiff neck, photophobia, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, melena, jaundice, edema, sick contacts, or recent travel.
CT head did not show any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
CxR showed LLL infiltrate vs. atelectasis.
Past Medical History: Fatty liver disease diagnosed by biopsy [**4-7**] ([**Hospital **] hospital) s/p gastric bypass surgery PUD s/p perforated ulcer repair calcium nephrolithiasis s/p parathyroidectomy Epilepsy Alcoholism   Social History: Unemployed.
Drinks 2 beverages per day but has a history of alcoholism per family.
New hazy opacification of the left lung due to a combination of left lung collapse and superimposed pulmonary edema is noted.
Dense consolidation in the periphery of the right lower lobe is probably due to infection and unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT head: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is diffuse obliteration of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation consistent with mild diffuse cerebral edema.
Hypodense appearance of deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter structures in the area of the basal ganglia and thalamus likely also represents sequela of diffuse cerebral edema.
The basal cistern and suprasellar cisterns are patent.
No lytic or sclerotic bone lesion is seen.
There is crowding of the foramen magnum, which may represent low lying cerebral tonsils.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse cerebral edema as described above.
Technically limited study due to the very echogenic liver which is consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
The degree of fatty infiltration limits the ultrasound ability to assess the hepatic architecture, but no focal lesion is identified.
No biliary dilatation is seen.
Minimal ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 39 yo F who was admitted with fulminant hepatic failure wtih multisystem organ failure,  most attributable to acetaminophen toxicity.
Medications on Admission: calcium vitamin D   Discharge Medications: N/A  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Fulminant hepatic failure Acetaminophen overdose Shock Acute renal failure Acute respiratory distress syndrome  Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: N/A  Followup Instructions: N/A
