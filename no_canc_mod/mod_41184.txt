She presents from [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital where she had a Head CT that was consistent with subdural hematoma with midline shift.
While in the ED, the patient became nauseous with increasing headache and a repeat Head Ct was performed.
The patient's son was present and stated that his mother refused to go to the hospital yesterday, but this morning she was lethargic and confused so he brought her to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital.
The patient proceeded to become lethargic and stopped following commands while in the Emergency Department.
Past Medical History: Afib on coumadin CHF CAD Vertigo HTN Left hip ORIF  Social History: Lives at home, has son named [**Name (NI) **] who is the HCP.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.

This hemorrhage measures 14 mm in maximal dimension from the inner table of the skull and demonstrates mass effect on adjacent sulci and the right frontal and parietal lobe with stable leftward shift of normally midline structures by 8 mm.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
A hypodensity region is again noted in the right frontal lobe, and may represent an infarction of indeterminate age.
Confluence of periventricular white matter hypodensities.
Bilateral basal ganglia calcifications are again identified.
No acute fractures are noted.
There is mild sphenoidal mucosal thickening as well as mild opacification of the right maxillary air cells.
Stable appearance of acute right subdural hematoma, ranging from anterior to the right frontal lobe to posterior to the right occipital lobe measuring approximately 14 mm in maximal dimension from the inner table of the skull.
New foci of hemorrhage is identified.
Hypodense region in the right frontal lobe is again noted and may represent an infarction of indeterminate age, versus a confluence of periventricular white matter hypodensity.
There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
Blunting of the left posterior costophrenic sulcus may represent a tiny pleural effusion or scarring.
Prominent diffuse interstitial markings suggest underlying chronic lung disease.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
Degenerative changes seen in the shoulders bilaterally.
No displaced rib fracture is identified.
A wedge compression deformity in the lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine is of unknown chronicity.
Aortic calcifications are better seen on the prior study.
No acute intrathoracic process.
There is persistent 8 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures.
A small left parafalcine hemorrhage layering along the left tentorium is more apparent than prior studies.
No new intraparenchymal hemorrhage is identified.
Hypodensity in the right frontal lobe is unchanged and may represent an infarction of indeterminate age versus confluence of periventricular white matter hypodensity.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the right sphenoid sinus.
Post-surgical changes after right craniectomy with stable 8 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures.
Small left parafalcine subdural hemorrhage.
Pelvis Xray [**2170-7-8**] FINDINGS:  There are no old films available for comparison.
There is an old healed left hip fracture with an intramedullary rod and screw with associated deformity of the left femoral head and new bone formation extending into the soft tissues.
No new fracture is identified, but osteopenia limits this assessment.
CT head [**2170-7-12**] There is reaccumulation of fresh subdural hematoma along the right convexity.
New right parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage surrounded by edema  [**7-15**]: CXR: FINDINGS:  Tip of the nasogastric tube is in the mid-to-lower stomach with the side hole just distal to the esophagogastric junction.
Little change in the heart and lungs when compared to the study of this date.
FINDINGS:  Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There was residual barium with all thicknesses, most pronounced with pudding thickness barium.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10502**] DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   Brief Hospital Course: 85F who presented to an OSH after a fall, on Coumadin, CT showed a R SDH and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
There were no issues overnight.
Dilantin level remained high and so she was switched to Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Overnight on [**7-10**] into [**7-11**] she became tachycardic to the 130s.
On this day she was noted to have decreased strength on the left and had pupil asymmetry, L>R.
CT head showed a new Right SDH and new right IPH but improvement in MLS.
Stroke Neurology was consulted and did not feel that this was a hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke.
We discussed the need for NGT or Dobhoff placement.
Video swallow evaluation was performed on [**7-18**] and demonstrated moderate-severe pharyngeal dysphagia primarily characterized by risk of aspiration with all PO intake due to swallow initiation delay, reduced laryngeal valve closure, and residue mixing with secretions.
At the time of discharge on [**7-19**] she was tolerating a regular diet, afebrile with stable vital signs.
Artificial Tears Preserv.
