HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 40-year-old male with a history of diabetes, status post haplotype living donor kidney transplant in [**2164-4-10**] in good function (creatinine 1.3 to 1.5) until this summer (creatinine 2.6 to 2.8).
The patient had a biopsy prior to admission that showed fibrosis consistent with ischemia.
MRA confirmed stenosis of the apical renal artery.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient presented to the hospital for a renal angiogram of the transplanted kidney and possible stent.
Angiogram was performed on [**2166-10-29**] that showed virtuosity of the proximal renal artery with focal moderate stenosis centrally and 35 mmHg systolic gradient.
The patient was taken emergently to the OR on [**2166-10-29**] where an exploratory laparotomy, division of branch of transplanted renal artery and reimplantation of the transplanted artery to the external iliac artery were performed without any complications.
In the SICU, the patient received 1 unit of packed RBCs for low hematocrit, at least 1 unit of RBCs, and was also started on an insulin drip for better control of his blood glucose.
Serial creatinine levels were measured and showed a gradual increase consistent with nonoliguric ATN.
The patient was well hydrated and his hemodynamic status was very closely monitored and regulated by the SICU Team and the Renal Service along with Transplant Surgery.
The patient's pain was well controlled with PCA Dilaudid that was changed to Percocet on postoperative day number three.
