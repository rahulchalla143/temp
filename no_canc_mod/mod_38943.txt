Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pathologic structural valvular disease identified, but views are limited.
The appearance of the lungs, while significantly obscured by motion artifact and extensive multifocal consolidations, is not typical for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as there is no evidence of basilar reticulation or honeycombing.
The appearances are more in keeping with a multifocal pneumonia rather than an acute flare of pulmonary fibrosis.
When the patient's clinical condition has improved, a HRCT may then be performed to assess for subtle pulmonary fibrosis.
Moderately severe pulmonary enlargement suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
# Hypoxia/respiratory failure: Patient on home 2L 02 and admitted with hypoxic respiratory distress and required full face bipap (failed nasal CPAP) for the first 24-36 hours.
Pneumonia (increased cough, sputum production and leukocytosis) vs. CHF (bnp .
Since then the patient's steroid requirement was as low as 10mg po daily but the he was hopsitalized in [**State **] last [**Month (only) 205**] with respiratory failure and since then has remained on 20mg prednisone and home 02.
Patient's CT scan here was not consistent with IPF and it is not the usual standard here to diagnose IPF on transbronchial biopsy (typically transthoracic).
Patient was continued on Dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**] (concern at an earlier admission that he had renal failure from Bactrim).
After significant diuresis the kidney function improved to baseline at 1.6, likely poor forward flow from CHF.
Hemolysis unlikely with nl bili and other hemolysis labs normal.
Initially concerned for GI bleed still in ddx esp with INR of 3.5 but patient guiac negative and had no BRBPR.
Patient's iron studies showed iron deficiency.
You were admitted for shortness of breath and increasing oxygen requirements.
CT scan revealed a multilobar pneumonia.
In addition, you had an exacerbation of your diastolic heart failure.
Your heart is slightly stiff as a result of high blood pressure.
