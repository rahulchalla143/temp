Sepsis: Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] tachycardic, initially hypotensive responding to IVFs, and leukocytosis with positive UA and CXR c/w pneumonia.
He did not require any changes to his home ventilator settings except for a slight decrease in TV to prevent barotrauma to his right lung that did not have evidence of PNA.
He also had a large sacral stage IV decubitus ulcer which was evaluated by wound care.
His hypotension resolved with IVFs.
He will be treated for a full 2 week course of cefepime (started [**3-22**]) to cover for complicated UTI and Hospital/Ventilator associated pneumonia.
Acute Kidney Injury: creatinine up to 1.9 from 0.7 on [**3-21**]; this was most likely in the setting of hypotension/sepsis in the setting of infection.
Chronic hypercarbic resp failure dependant on Vent: The patient's outpatient vent settings were continued, except for a decreased TV to 600 from 650 since we wanted to avoid barotrauma of his non-infected lung.
He had a bronchoscopy revealing no significant aiway obstruction but has LLL bronchus with severe narrowing at opening likely contributing to chronic collapse, not amenable to stenting.
DM: Intitially, the patient's metformin/glipizide were held due to his acute illness.
Hypertension: The patient was hypotensive initially likely in the setting of sepsis and his home BP meds were held.
His BP medications were not restarted as he remained normotensive.
