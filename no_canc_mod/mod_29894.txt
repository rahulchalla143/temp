CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Fevers and increased white blood cell count.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85 year old female with multiple medical problems who was sent in to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Room from her nursing home for fevers and an increased white blood cell count.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] from [**2146-3-17**] until [**2146-4-6**] initially for shortness of breath and then had a prolonged hospital course which included respiratory distress thought secondary to a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare from Pseudomonal pneumonia.
Other etiologies were entertained including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis versus Turk-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**].
During the patient's last admission she had intermittent shortness of breath episodes that were treated with Lasix for pulmonary edema.
She had also ruled out for an myocardial infarction at that time.
Her hospital course at that time was also complicated by a steroid induced myopathy, incidental thyroid nodule with biochemically sick euthyroid, acute T12 compression fracture, ataxia attributed to steroid myopathy, pancytopenia attributed to medication, and a PEG placement.
She complained of mild abdominal diffuse pain.
Status post pseudomonal pneumonia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Degenerative joint disease.
Coronary artery disease with a history of anterior myocardial infarction and an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
T12 compression fracture.
Steroid myopathy.
The patient appeared sedated and was becoming agitated and combative at times.
Her neck was supple without any lymphadenopathy or bruits.
She had fine crackles half way up bilaterally on her lung examination and had occasional expiratory wheezes.
She had normoactive bowel sounds and no guarding.
Her PEG site was clean, dry and intact without erythema or drainage.
She had trace edema to the ankles.
There were no cords or erythema present.
She had no point tenderness over her spine.
She had no sacral decubitus ulcers and no skin ulcers.
On urinalysis she had moderate leukocytes and moderate blood.
Chest x-ray showed increasing rounded but ill defined opacity in the left upper lobe, same as in [**2146-2-17**].
There was a question of cavitary worsening left upper lobe opacity.
An EKG was done which showed sinus tachycardia at 108 with normal intervals and left axis deviation.
FEVERS:  Initially, the patient's fevers were thought to be due to a urinary tract infection as seen on her urinalysis upon admission.
She had been placed on Levaquin to treat for the urinary tract infection, however, when the cultures came back showing methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, the patient was switched to Vancomycin.
The patient continued to have occasional spikes in her temperature.
PULMONARY NODULE:  Given the presence of this pulmonary nodule on chest x-ray upon admission, a CT scan was recommended by a pulmonary consultation that had been obtained in the early part of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course.
CT scan showed that the nodule had been present on a prior CT scan but had slightly grown in size.
Thus, the patient was placed in isolation in order to have her ruled out for tuberculosis.
The first two sets of sputum cultures had no acid fast bacilli on smear.
The patient had initially been placed on ceftazidime and Ciprofloxacin in case this had been a recurrence of her Pseudomonal pneumonia.
ELEVATED TROPONIN:  Given that the patient's CK and MBs were within normal limits, it was thought that the patient's slightly elevated troponins were likely from demand ischemia.
She had no new EKG changes and the patient continued to be asymptomatic.
She denied any chest pain or shortness of breath throughout her hospital course.
There were no events up to the time of this dictation.
DECREASED HEMATOCRIT:  The patient had a slightly decreased hematocrit upon admission.
MENTAL STATUS:  The patient has baseline Alzheimer's Disease dementia.
Initially she appeared improved since her last admission, although at times she had periods of agitation and depression.
A swallow consultation was obtained to see if the patient was at high risk for aspiration.
The patient refused to have this test done, and given that she clearly had some risk of aspiration, she was made NPO as her diet throughout her hospital course.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
T12 compression fracture.
Steroid myopathy.
The patient was instructed to call her doctor or return to the Emergency Room if she experienced any further chest pain, increased shortness of breath, abdominal pain, fevers, change in mental status, or other worrisome symptoms.
If there are any further events in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, they will be dictated at a later time.
