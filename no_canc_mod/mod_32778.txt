Pain waxed and waned subsequently and he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for revascularization and management of symptoms including IABP placement.

IV Metoprolol was administered with normotension and slower HR ensuing and his pain resolved.

Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The non-coronary cusp is more calcified and moderately immobilized but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate (bordering on moderate) ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mitral regurgitation unchanged.
No evidence for thoracic aortic aneurysm.
IABP terminates in descending thoracic aorta at the level of the left main stem bronchus.
Moderate left-sided pneumothorax.
Bibasilar atelectasis in the posterior dependent aspects of bilateral lungs.
Nonspecific small patchy opacity in left upper and lower lobes may represent areas of patchy consolidation, but follow up chest CT is recommended after treatment to ensure resolution as a nodule cannot be entirely excluded.
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Suggest clinical correlation to exclude acute sinusitis.
