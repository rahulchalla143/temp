The patient's blood cultures were positive on [**2164-9-28**] when one out of two blood cultures grew out staphylococcus coagulase-negative organisms.
The patient remained afebrile and subsequent numerous blood cultures thereafter remained negative until the date of discharge on his vancomycin regimen.
The patient was also placed on spironolactone due to increasing and worsening peripheral edema secondary to his hepatic failure and low albumin state.
The patient was also started on Epogen 20,000 units once a week to help increase his bone marrow production of his red blood cells.
The patient was seen by the Renal Service who maintained that the patient's worsening kidney function was most probably due to his intervascular depleted state secondary to his hypoalbuminuria as well as his 4+ AR which prevented forward flow of the blood that he did still have intravascularly.
The patient continued on his vancomycin with no further spikes in his temperature and remained afebrile and clinically looked quite well at the time of discharge.
The patient was to have VNA services and to have daily CBC, SMA-7, and albumin as well as vancomycin levels faxed to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 833**]  who would follow the patient closely.
