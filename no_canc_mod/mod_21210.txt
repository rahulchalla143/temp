Admission Date:  [**2168-11-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2168-12-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-5-12**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73 year old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension.
He presented to an outside hospital with a history of worsening shortness of breath times four days.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization, after electrocardiogram showed anterolateral ST segment elevation and Q waves.
The patient states that he was in his usual state of health until four days prior to admission, when he began to experience shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
The patient attributed the symptoms to asthma, which he has a remote history of.
Over the following few days, he experienced worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
He was then brought to the hospital where an electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 and lead 2.
The patient denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, or chest pressure.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had a myocardial infarction in his mid 60's.
Two brothers with myocardial infarction in mid 60's.
General:  No acute distress.
Abdomen soft, nontender, mildly distended.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 135 beats per minute; normal interval; normal axis;  ST elevations with Q waves in leads V2 through V4.
Cardiac catheterization:  Hemodynamics mildly elevated; filling pressures with severely depressed cardiac index, consistent with cardiogenic shock.
Coronary angiography:  Right dominant, LMCA normal; Left anterior descending 100% total occlusion; proximal origin T1; also occluded apical left anterior descending, fills via faint right to left collaterals intermedius.
Moderate sized vessel, 20% ostial stenosis of the left circumflex; small vessel, normal.
Right coronary artery:  Large ectatic vessel, 40% proximal stenosis with common 90% large PL branch.
Final angiography demonstrated 0% residual stent type but pruned appearance distal to the left anterior descending, beyond D-2, consistent with extensive previous infarction.
Given ongoing cardiogenic shock, they elected to treat right coronary artery as well.
The patient had a 13 mm Zeta stent with post dilation utilizing a 3.0 by 9 NC ranger, with 10% residual versus flow dissection.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 25%.
There is severe hypokinesis of the anterior wall and the anterior septum.
The mild and distal lateral wall is hypokinetic.
Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function would be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.
No thrombus is seen in the left ventricle.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Arterial leaflet is mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no aortic stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
There is at least moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial physiologic pericardial effusion.
Limited right coronary ultrasound:  There is a large hematoma in the right groin; normal flow was identified with no superficial femoral artery and vein.
No pseudo aneurysm was identified.
In the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the patient had an intra-aortic balloon placed.
That same night, the patient developed an enlarging right groin hematoma after pulling of the arterial sheaths.
Occlusive pressure was applied for about 20 minutes and Integrilin and heparin were held.
The patient subsequently developed bradycardia down to the 50's and hypotension with systolic blood pressure of 70.
The patient was stabilized off pressors and inotropes and was continued to monitor serial hematocrits q. four hours.
Stat ultrasound was obtained which showed a large hematoma in the right groin and no pseudo aneurysm.
Normally identified superficial femoral artery and vein.
Prior to discharge, the patient had two episodes of non sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Given his low ejection fraction and cardiac function, it was recommended that he see the electrophysiologist,  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1008**], M.D.
or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 53426**] for further work-up and possible ICD pacer.
Congestive heart failure.
Anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease.
