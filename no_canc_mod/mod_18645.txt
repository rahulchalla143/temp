Her husband witnessed these episodes and said she would have LOC only for a few seconds and she never had seizure activity.
At the OSH she was found to have complete heart block.
She had an ECHO done with concern for tamponade from perf after pacemaker placement, but her ECHO was benign.
She also began to have a dropping bicarb without a gap.
She had a CT abdomen without contrast which was suggestive of diverticulitis with R paracolic fluid.
During transfer she had an episode of pulseless VT. .
Once at [**Hospital1 18**], she went to the cath lab and was found to have cardiogenic shock and moderate +3 MR which was not thought to the be cause of her shock.
High wedge and R pressure.
In the cath lab she had another episode of pulseless VT and was shocked.

RV function appears depressed but only mildly at worse.
No evidence of endocarditis seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Diffuse mild bowel wall and gallbladder wall edema likely due to third spacing.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.

3.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
4.There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload or pacer wire.

A TEE showed low LV outflow and minimal RV function.
# metabolic acidosis: unknown etiology.
Likely ischemia secondary to her cardiogenic shock but could also be from ischemia secondary to sepsis.
A CT of her abdomen at the OSH done without contrast showed suggestion of abscess/diverticulitis given fluid in the paracolic gutter.
While getting a CT chest to rule out PE, a CT abdomen/pelvis was also performed which did not show any suggestion of abscess or infection.
Lyme titers were sent given her presentation of complete heart block and have subsequently returned as negative.
Over the course of the evening, despite aggressive measures, the patient continued to have ongoing hemodynamic collapse.
The patient continued to deteriorate and went into multiorgan system failure with increasing INR, increasing creatinine, LFTs, and DIC (low fibrinogen, low platelets, and high INR).
Family declined autopsy for religous reasons.
