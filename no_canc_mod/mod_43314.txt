ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2111-9-17**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
Ill-defined patchy opacity within the left lung base concerning for pneumonia.
Hazier opacification in the right lung base may represent second area of infection or possibly atelectasis.
Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate in size on the right, and small on the left  Chest Radiograph [**2111-9-16**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-15**], the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion appears to have decreased.
There is increased opacification at the left base consistent with pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions with some compressive atelectasis are again seen.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 55-year-old male who is s/p orthotropic liver [**Year (4 digits) **] in [**Month (only) 205**] [**2108**] for alcoholic cirrhosis, history of colon cancer s/p colectomy, on rapamune who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and SIRS from L sided pneumonia.
1) Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient presented with hypoxia and a clear left lower lobe infiltrate.
No organisms were obtained from initial BAL or sputum cultures so this treatment was empiric.
After intubation sats failed to improve so he underwent semi-urgent bronchoscopy revealing significant mucus plugging as well as an aspirated tablet.
Due to his previous failure, poor nutritional status, and great weakness decision was made that he would be unlikely to clear secretions adequately and to pursue tracheostomy for better pulmonary rehab and clearance of secretions.
2) Sepsis: Patient was meeting criteria for sepsis on admission with leukocytosis and tachypnea and also had hypotension requiring norepinephrine for blood pressure support later in his course.
With treatment of pneumonia as explained above his pressures improved and he had been off pressors >72 hrs at time of discharge.
3) End stage liver disease s/p [**Year (4 digits) 1326**]: The patient has a liver [**Year (4 digits) **] and is on sirolimus chronically for immune suppression.
He never had a transaminitis or signs of liver dysfunction.
4) Acute Kidney Injury:The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease with most recent baselines around 1.5.
5) Cytopenias: Patient has been intermittently cytopenic in the past likely due to sirolimus.
With improvement in his sepsis cell lines dropped.
6) Nutrition: Patient has remained chronically thin and somewhat emaciated appearing since his [**Month/Year (2) **].
At time of admission he was very cachectic appearing and may have been some worsening of baseline poor nutritional status in the context of his wife's recent death.
After tracheostomy PEG was discussed but not desired by hepatology due to infection risk.
He had some intolerance of tube feeds and high residuals for which he was started on metoclopramide and rate was lowered with a more dense formula with improvement.
7) Chronic diarrhea: The patient has chronic diarrhea at baseline for which he is on DTO and choleystyramine.
These were stopped during his intubation as he was having no bowel movements.
At time of discharge given recent trouble with high residuals both these medications were being held.
8) Pain : The patient complains of chronic neck and leg pain when extubated.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] -for continueing med care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia with sepsis Hypoxic respiratory failure Severe malnutrition  Secondary: Alcoholic cirrhosis, status-post orthotopic liver [**Hospital3 **] Anemia Pancytopenia Depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for shortness of breath, cough, and eventual respiratory failure.
You were given antibiotics to treat a presumed pneumonia.
You were started on tube feeding for nutritional support, but it was unclear if you were digesting much of it, as your nurses were suctioning high levels of tube feeds back up through your feeding tube.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Discontinued cefpodoxime, an antibiotic you were taking before your admission - Discontinued cholestyramine, loperamide and tincture of opium, because your diarrhea improved and these can worsen your digestion of your tube feeds - Discontinued prochlorperazine (Compazine) because it can interact with METOCLOPRAMIDE, which we started at 5 mg with meals and at bedtime, to help you digest your tube feeds - Decreased your dose of SIROLIMUS to 1 mg daily, to keep it at the appropriate levels - Started HEPARIN injections, 5,000 units subcutaneously, three times daily, to prevent blood clots - Started NYSTATIN oral suspension, taken orally four times daily AS NEEDED for thrush - Started SENNA, one tab taken orally twice daily AS NEEDED for constipation - Started LIDOCAINE patch 5% adhesive patch applied topically for 12 hours at a time, followed by 12 hours off, as needed for back pain - Started PANTOPRAZOLE 40 mg tablets, taken orally once daily - Started MEROPENEM, an antibiotic to treat your pneumonia.
You will receive 500 mg through the IV every eight hours, through [**2111-10-3**] - Started ALBUTEROL nebulizers, one nebulizer treatment every four hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing - Started IPRATROPIUM nebulizers, one nebulizer treatment every six hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing - Started Heparin Flush (10 units/ml) 2 mL IV PRN line flush, this is for your PICC line maintenance  Followup Instructions: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Hospital 1389**] CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] Date/Time:[**2111-11-4**] 1:20  You may hear from the [**Month/Day/Year **] center in the next week or two to discuss scheduling an earlier appointment.
