The pregnancy was spontaneous di-di twins.
At the appointment no heart rate was found in one twin and was diagnosed as intrauterine fetal demise.
The mother was also noted to have elevated blood pressure and thrombocytopenia and, therefore, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.
During assessment serial blood pressures consistently were elevated with diastolics greater than 100 and worsening thrombocytopenia.
Decision was made to deliver by cesarean section also for breech positioning in addition to worsening pregnancy induced hypertension and thrombocytopenia.
The patient emerged floppy with no spontaneous respiratory effort.
Color and heart rate improved with positive pressure ventilation.
He was intubated for lack of respiratory effort.
Slightly split sutures.
Ears normally set without anomalies.
No retractions.
No grunting or flaring.
2+ femoral pulses.
The abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly.
No sacral anomalies.
He was on CPAP for an additional few hours and then transitioned to room air without further respiratory distress.
Prior to extubation he was started on caffeine and currently remains on caffeine 5 mg/kg/day for apnea of prematurity.
Cardiovascular:  Apnea and bradycardia as above.
Endocrinology:  Patient was diagnosed by newborn screen as hypothyroid with an elevated TSH of 18.4.
On day of life 21 thyroid function tests at [**Hospital1 188**] returned and were significant for a very elevated TSH at 58, a T4 at 4.5, T3 83, TBGI 1.05.
He was subsequently started on Synthroid and most recent thyroid function tests on [**5-7**] were more normal with a still slightly elevated TSH at 9.8 but a normal T4 at 8.2.
Ophthalmology:  Had his initial ophthalmologic evaluation on [**2160-5-6**] and both retina were immature bilaterally.
Respiratory distress now resolved.
Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia resolved.
