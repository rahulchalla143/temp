Within minutes, she became completely unresponsive.
There is upward retraction of the right hilum.
There is a right apical opacity.
Left apical pleural thickening is also seen.
No pneumothorax is evident.
There is a markedly tortuous aorta.
NCHCT: FINDINGS: There is a large intraparenchymal hematoma centered within the right basal ganglia involving the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.
There is considerable associated mass effect with complete effacement of the right lateral ventricle and temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Contralateral dilatation of the left lateral ventricle and occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is consistent with "trapped ventricle."
Subependymal blood is seen within the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Layering interventricular blood is seen with both lateral ventricles.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is noted within the sulci of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.
There is mild diffuse vasogenic cerebral edema.
Air- fluid levels within the right maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are consistent with intubation.
Large intraparenchymal hematoma centered in the right basal ganglia exerting considerable mass effect and 1.7-cm leftward subfalcine shift.
Effacement of the suprasellar and basilar cisterns is consistent with transtentorial hernation.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage, predominantly involving the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo woman with hx HTN, high chol, sz d/o who vomited and became unresponsive within minutes today while talking with family, found to have massive R hemisphere hemorrhage with shift of midline structures, mass effect at OSH ([**Hospital 71227**] Hosp.
Repeat CT scan at [**Hospital1 **] shows impending herniation through the foramen magnum, and enlargement of hemorrhage.
No neurosurgical intervention indicated.
