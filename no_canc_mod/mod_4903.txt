Notably, during his extended admission, he was found to have severe aspirations and a subsequent aspiration pneumonia.
He reportedly had been up the whole night and complained of abdominal discomfort.
On exam the patient was dry with course rhonchi bilaterally.
EKG: showed native left bundle with intermittent pacing and he was noted to have 8 beats of NSVT.
He would [**Last Name (un) 25177**] have bradycardia to the 30s before his pacer would start pacing.
The patient was given lidocaine bolus for non sustained vtach.
He had a head CT which showed "No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities, but air in the masticator spaces."
Abd CT showed distended gallbladder and bilateral pleural effusions.
RUQ U/S showed distended gallbladder with thickened wall and sludge, concerning for acute cholecystitis.

60 minutes following morphine administration, there is faint uptake lateral to the common bile duct, which is atypical for but could represent evidence of partial delayed gallbladder uptake.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal study, without definite visualization of gallbladder.
Although this cpuld be due to the prolonged fasting status, acute or chronic cholecystitis cannot be excluded.
No fluid collections are present.
IMPRESSION: Occlusive thrombus within the right axillary vein and one of two brachial veins (the one containing a venous catheter).
Abd U/S INDICATION: 72-year-old man with abdominal pain, NPO.
Assess for acute cholecystitis.
FINDINGS: The gallbladder is markedly distended containing a large amount of echogenic sludge.
Areas of the sludge appear mass-like and may be consistent with tumefactive sludge.
The gallbladder wall is thickened, though this may be due to known heart failure.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation.
There is a large pleural effusion, better evaluated on the recent CT. A small amount of perihepatic ascites is present.
IMPRESSION: Markedly distended gallbladder containing sludge.
Nonspecific GB wall thickening which could reflect heart failure.

Please evaluate for acute process.
FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN: There are at least moderate bilateral pleural effusions, which are unchanged in size since the prior study.
There is adjacent bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
Small amount of stranding around the gallbladder may also be due to patient's fluid overload state, as there is a small amount of perihepatic ascites and perisplenic ascites.
An IVC filter is noted in place with infrarenal position.
Accessory right upper renal artery supplies the lower right kidney.
There is no free air.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
There is diffuse calcified plaque atherosclerotic disease.
There is diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
The rectal wall appears somewhat edematous and featureless, though unable to determine if this might be resulting from acute or chronic colitis, vs underdistention.
Air within the bladder is likely due to recent instrumentation.
There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
There is no free fluid within the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning osseous lesions are identified.
There is adjacent compressive atelectasis with collapse of the visualized aspect of the right lower lobe.
Trace amount of perihepatic and perisplenic ascites and diffuse anasarca, unchanged.
Somewhat featureless and minimally thickened appearance of the rectum, similar to the prior study from [**2115-7-7**], may be related to chronic or acute colitis, though underdistention and third-spacing is a possibility.

He had a Head CT that was negative for acute process.
His somnolence was thought to be from systemic infection given the patient was not on sedating medications, EKG appeared baseline, and there were no gross electrolyte abnormalities.
Sources of infection were presumed initially to be pneumonia within stable right pleural effusion and/or cholecystitis given CT abdomen that showed distended gall bladder and RUQ U/S that confrimed distended gallbladder containing sludge.
Surgery was consulted and did not think the patient had cholecystitis given his CT abdomen looked similar to CT from [**7-7**] and thought the findings could be due to lack of PO intake on TPN.
The patient's abdominal exam remained stable and he was not felt to have had cholecystitis.
The patient did not exhibit septic physiology and did not require IV fluids or pressors to maintain urine output and blood pressure.
He did not have elevated WBC or fevers.
Due to RUE DVT, he was taken down to IR for replacement L sided PICC but b/l UE dvts were discovered and piccs were exchanged for b/l midline IVs.
Intubation:  The patient was intubated for airway protection in the setting of altered mental status.
He was noted to have some mild white secretions.
He has a history of aspiration and had previously been NPO.
He was reintubated later that day for poor oxygenation, difficulty clearing secretions and increased work of breathing.
Trache was placed for airway protection for secretions so plan would be to keep it in for that reason and if anything decrease size.
# DVT in upper extremities: Both line associated however still has left midline in place.
# Pleural Effusions: The patient was noted to have a right sided pleural effusion which had been present on chest x rays seince [**2114-9-17**].
He was not noted to be hypoxic, but thought to be in respiratory distress at rehab.
His ABG did not indicate he had a large A-a gradient.
His effusions were thought to be a combination of CHF with recent aspiration pneumonia, but a superimposed pneumonia could not be ruled out.
His electrolytes should be checked on [**7-27**] to ensure stability and assess need for replacement.
# Malnutrition: Patient wanted [**Month/Year (2) 282**] tube last admission in setting of severe aspiration.
Plan was for repeat swallow eval on Monday with reconsideration of goals of care pending the results.
The patient was intubated for airway protection and extubated on [**7-19**] briefly before being reintubated for airway protection [**12-19**] work of breathing and increased secretions.
He received lidocaine in the ED for concern of Vtach though he did not show evidence of this in the ICU.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
11. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
12. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: pneumonia acute on chronic CHF   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] with decreased mental status.
You also had fluid on your lungs which improved with lasix infusion.
Before it was replaced, we discussed if you would like to proceed with a more permanent breathing tube, or tracheostomy, and feeding tube ([**Month/Day (2) 282**]) which you decided with your health care proxy you wanted.
