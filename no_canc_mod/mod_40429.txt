# CAD: Although patient has with multiple CAD risk factors, prior non-invasive and invasive testing showed no significant obstructive coronary disease.
A troponin of 0.04 in the context of normal CK and EKG with no ST-T changes was likely demand ischemia secondary to hypertensive heart disease.
Admission EKG did not show signs of active ischemia and the patient was monitored on telemetry and continued on aspirin and statin.
# CHF: The pt's hypoxia was attributed to CHF and not pneumonia as she denied any cough, and was afebrile and lacking a consolidate on chest xray.
Pulmonary embolism was also unlikely as the patient is on chronic anticoagulation.
Due to chronic diastolic congestive heart failure and a physiologic HOCM that leads to hypotension during dialysis sessions, it is most likely that the patient developed pulmonary edema  in the setting of volume status change while receiving dialysis.
Her oxygenation status improved significantly following blood pressure and rate control and a dialysis session.
There are no PFT's to support the diagnosis of COPD, but marked hyperinflation on CXR and notable smoking history indicated strong possibility of COPD contributing to patient's symptoms so patient was treated with home dose of spiriva and albuterol as needed.
# Atrial fibrillation: The pt was anticoagulated with coumadin and rate controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem for her history of atrial fibrillation.
# Hypertension: The patient's hypertension was also controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol and following a successful dialysis session her lisinopril and irbesartan were restarted.
# Diabetes: For her diabetes the patient was continued on her home dose of NPH with an insulin sliding scale.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient has end stage renal disease and receiving HD.
The patient was orginally volume overloaded and on day two of admission developed hyperkalemia to a K of 6.7.
She had no peaked T waves or QT prolongation on EKG and received calcium carbonate and D5/insulin as well as dialysis.
Prior evaluations had not shown renal mass that could contribute to over production of erythropoietin and on [**2163-5-30**] the epo level was low normal which would suggest a MPD such as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] [**Location (un) 269**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute diastolic Heart Failure End stage renal disease on hemodialysis .
Secondary: Peripheral Vascular disease Atrial Fibrillation on Coumadin Hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath and acute diastolic heart failure.
This has been treated with dialysis & aggressive blood pressure control.
If you develop any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, weakness or any other general worsening of condition, please call your PCP or come directly to the ED.
