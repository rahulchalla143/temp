HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old white gentleman with coronary artery disease, status post multiple myocardial infarctions, status post coronary artery bypass graft with postoperative atrial fibrillation in [**2184**], ischemic cardiomyopathy, type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and peptic ulcer disease (status post gastrointestinal bleed) who was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] in [**2186-12-28**] with an ischemic right foot an gangrenous toes.
During hospitalization, the patient's wound cultures grew pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
Postoperatively, the patient had fevers and positive blood cultures growing beta streptococcus group B.
The patient also had gangrenous left toes and returns for admission because of severe rest pain.
Coronary artery disease.
(a)  Myocardial infarction times four; last myocardial infarction in [**2185-9-27**].
Postoperative atrial fibrillation in [**2185-10-28**].
History of asymptomatic carotid stenosis; ultrasound in [**2186-11-27**] showed less than 40% stenosis bilaterally.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic pancreatitis.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Duodenal ulceration with gastrointestinal bleed.
Clostridium difficile colitis in [**2186-12-28**]; treated with 10 days of Flagyl.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Right below-knee amputation on [**2187-1-19**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed his temperature was 98.7, his pulse was 78, his respiratory rate was 18, his blood pressure was 124/62, and his oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.
In general, an alert and cooperative white male in no acute distress.
There were no rashes.
There were no lesions.
There was no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
There were no murmurs.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
No masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
The left foot with mild edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray on [**2186-12-2**] showed no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Old inferior myocardial infarction.
Occasional ventricular ectopy.
He was started on vancomycin 1 g intravenously q.24h., levofloxacin, and intravenous Flagyl empirically for cellulitis of the left foot.
A pulmonary vascular resistance of the left lower extremity was done on [**2187-2-15**] and showed a 7-mm deflection at the level of the metatarsals.
Posterior tibialis and peroneal arteries had diffuse disease.
The anterior tibial artery had serial stenoses with focal 70% to 80% stenosis at midshin and 70% stenosis at the ankle.
There was only 20% residual stenosis following the procedure.
The patient had an episode of hypertension with decreased urine output and elevated blood sugars which was treated and resolved on the day prior to surgery.
On [**2187-2-23**] the patient developed hypotension with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.
His electrocardiogram showed some ST depressions.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2187-2-23**] for a possible peritonitis and aggressive fluid resuscitation was continued.
The patient's abdominal pain resolved.
However, he continued to have diarrhea which was improving at a very slow rate.
The patient left the Intensive Care Unit after several days and has been doing well except for an episode of tachycardia to a rate of 135 on [**2187-2-27**].
A repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20% to 25% with global hypokinesis.
Cardiology felt that the patient's symptoms did not suggest progressive heart failure.
A suggestion was made that perhaps the patient's diarrhea was due to diabetic autonomic neuropathy given that the patient's Clostridium difficile cultures had been negative.
The patient was to be treated with a total of two weeks of oral vancomycin for presumptive Clostridium difficile colitis.
Ischemic gangrene of left toes.
Hypovolemia secondary to dehydration from diarrhea.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic pancreatitis.
