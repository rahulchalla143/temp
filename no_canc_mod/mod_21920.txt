He did have ICD shock x 2 this evening without any associated symptoms.
EP was consulted who recommended increasing metoprolol to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], trending troponin and admission to [**Hospital1 **] after interrogation revealed his ICD shocks were appropriate for 330 ms cycle length ventricular tachycardia.

Ventricular paced complex is of the appropriate left axis deviation, but with a right bundle-branch block pattern in the precordial leads consistent with biventricular pacing.
No pulmonary edema.
Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo M with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, recurrent Vtach, atrial fibrillation, and PVD who p/w recurrent VT.
# Vtach: The patient has a h/o Vtach and is s/p 2 ablations and ICD placement previously.
He presented with recurrent Vtach from a scar focus with ICD firing and ATP pacing successful in terminating VT.
In the PACU, he had an episode of Vtach, either from irritation of the myocardium from the procedure versus failed ablation.
He was monitored on telemetry without event.
# Chronic Systolic CHF: Continue lisinopril, metoprolol, lasix.
Patient received 80mg IV lasix x 1 on arrival to CCU because appeared volume overloaded.
