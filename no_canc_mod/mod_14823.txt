HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old female with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus Type 2, insulin dependent and history of hypertension, asthma and a history of thrombocytosis of unclear etiology, who initially presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of increasing dyspnea times one week.
The patient was diagnosed with bronchitis with an asthma exacerbation and treated with Azithromycin times five days and a five day course of Prednisone tapered and then discharged home from the Emergency Department.
Over the past week the patient has had increasing shortness of breath, productive cough with whitish sputum and polyuria and occasional nausea.
The patient denied fevers, chills, sore throat, abdominal pain, melena, dysuria, rashes, joint pain or chest pain.
The patient notes continued use of her nebulizer without relief of shortness of breath and notes increasing weight loss over the past six months, unintentional.
In the Emergency Department the patient was found to have a blood sugar of 570, was found to be tachycardic, afebrile, with an anion gap of 40, small ketones in her urine and total c02 of 7.
A chest x-ray was obtained which was clear without evidence of infiltrate but a dedimer returned with greater than 1,900 and an emergent CTA was done showing a filling defect in the right posterior apical segmental branch with multiple areas of air space opacities within the left upper and left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.
Antibiotics were held off given that she was afebrile and unclear if there was a focal source of the pneumonia.
The patient reports decreased ambulation over the past week due to fatigue, also denies leg swelling or upper extremity swelling.
Asthma since age 8.
History of episodic abdominal pain as a teenager.
She is     G-3, P-2, status post spontaneous abortion and vaginal     delivery and cesarean section.
Question of pancreatitis status post pancreatotomy with     incidental splenectomy at age 28.
Diabetes mellitus Type 2, insulin dependent, on Glargine     since age 51.
GENERAL:  In general, slightly tired appearing thin female in no apparent distress with slowed speech, blunted affect.
No scleral icterus.
NECK:  Supple, no jugular venous distention, no masses.
Shoddy cervical lymphadenopathy.
No axillary lymphadenopathy.
CORONARY: Regular rate and rhythm,no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Nondisplaced point of maximal impulse.
5:5 bilateral upper extremity and lower extremity strength.
2+ deep tendon reflexes bilateral knees.
Electrocardiogram - sinus tachycardia at 114, right atrial enlargement, no ST or T-wave changes.
Chest x-ray - lungs are clear, no congestive heart failure, mild pectus.
CT angiogram of the chest - positive pulmonary edema in the right posterior apical segmental branch and peripheral pulmonary opacities in the left upper and lower lobes concerning for pneumonia.
Shortness of breath.
The patient had progressive dyspnea over the past week, initially treated with bronchitis + asthma flare, now found to have a pulmonary edema on the CTA, unclear if initial presentation Emergency Department eight days prior to admission was related to pulmonary edema at the time, however, patient risk factors are, over the past week, with decreased ambulation and mobility secondary to fatigue makes it less likely until recently.
No palpable cords or deep vein thrombosis obvious on exam.
Patient has a history of thrombocytosis of unclear etiology, unclear whether or not the patient has a hypercoagulable state.
Asthma flare.
She had no obvious wheezing on exam.
The patient was maintained on nebs around the clock and then transitioned to meter dose inhalers with her Albuterol and subsequently started on her steroid of Salmeterol and Flovent on the day prior to discharge with improvement of her shortness of breath.
Hyperglycemia, anion gap closed while in the MICU off the insulin drip.
We optimized her blood sugar control with changing her Glargine over to NPH given the fact that her Glargine was also not available on formulary for Medicaid.
Diabetic teaching was maintained and the patient was maintained on a diabetic diet.
The patient remained afebrile with a white blood cell count that was stable and within normal limits, although there was a question of pneumonia on the chest x-ray.
We held off antibiotics for the pneumonia given the fact that clinically she did not appear as if she had any pneumonia, given her being afebrile and no cough.
Positive constitutional symptoms of unclear etiology including a thrombocytosis.
The patient had a stable platelet count was in house with no acute evidence of infection.
Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturations on room air, afebrile, stable fingerstick blood sugar controlled, no cough or wheezing.
Diabetic ketoacidosis/Type II.
MAJOR SURGICAL INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  CT scan showing pulmonary embolus within the right posterior apical segmental branch.
