You also had a urinary tract infection.
You had some difficulty breathing on admission, which was felt to be due to multiple problems, including obesity, pulmonary hypertension, and pneumonia.
You continued to have low oxygen saturations intermittently, so you will be discharged with oxygen for you to use at home as needed.
