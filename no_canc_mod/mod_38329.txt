Small LV cavity.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
She was confused and had worsening respiratory status and a low mixed venous despite inotropes which required reintubation.
Poor cardiac output/mixed venous results warranted an echocardiogram which showed the heart to be underfilled and volume was administered.
[**10-1**] EP was consulted in the setting of afib with rapid ventricular rate.
Per EP, Mrs. [**Known lastname 12130**] likely has significant diastolic dysfunction given her LVH and would benefit from rate control and restoration of sinus rhythm.
She is high risk for embolus given history of LAA thrombus and was not yet back on anticoagulation.
On [**10-2**] HIT panel was sent secondary to postoperative thrombocytopenia, which resulted negative.
She was placed on a lasix gtt for worsening pulmonary edema and diuresed.
She remains in a rate controlled atrial fibrillation on beta-blocker, Digoxin, and anticoagulated with Coumadin.
Her thrombocytopenia has been consistently improving.
POD# 6 she was placed on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.
She remained in the CVICU until POD 8 when she was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring and increased physical activity.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
