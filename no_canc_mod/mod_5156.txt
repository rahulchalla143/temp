She also had CHF with elevated BNP and was diuresed with consideration for ARF.
There was also seen by vascular surgery for her severe PVD.
She also had diarrhea and was treated with Flagyl although multiple cultures have been cdiff negative.
On review of systems, denies hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**1-/2180**] EF 35-40% The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with global hypokinesis (basal to mid lateral wall moves best) and distal LV/apical akinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography revealed diffuse 3-vessel disease.
The LCX had diffuse disease with a proximal occlusion.
The SVG-RCA was patent, filling an RCA with severe 90% lesions in the PLB unchanged from prior studies.
The LIMA-LAD was patent and supplied an LAD with diffuse disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated LVEDP of 25mmHg.
Successful stenting of the subclavian artery with a 6.0 stent post dilated with a 7.0 stent with no residual stenosis.
Elevated filling pressures 3.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 F with CAD s/p CABG and CHF (EF 35-40%) transferred from OSH with NSTEMI and CHF after a long hospital course.
She underwent cardiac catheterization on the second hospital day with balloon angioplasty to a stenosis in the distal LAD and placement of a DES in the SVG-PDA graft.
The patient was previously known to have a depressed LVEF; repeat echo during this admission showed an EF of approximately 25%.
She was felt to be mildly volume up and thus was gently diuresed.
# ARF: The patient's creatinine reportedly peaked at 2.9 at the OSH.
This renal failure appeared to have fully resolved by the time she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**].
# PNA and bacteremia: The patient completed courses of vanc and ceftriaxone at the OSH.
Repeat cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] were negative and the patient did not have evidence of recurrent infection.
Radiology advised a repeat CXR to evaluate for resolution of PNA as an outpt.
SOB: The pt complained of shortness of breath throughout her hospital stay.
This was felt to be primarily due to volume overload and improved significantly with diuresis.
Nevertheless, the pt did have some wheezes on exam and it was thought that she might have some airway reactivity.
# UTI: The patient had a positive UA at the time of admission but no urinary sxs.
She did report some itching and erythema in her groin folds bilaterally.
The [**Last Name (un) **] service was consulted and assisted with her managment, though no major changes were recommended for her regimen.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Discharge Instructions: -You were admitted with pneumonia and a small heart attack.
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
YOUR CHEST X-RAY SHOWED A PNEUMONIA DURING YOU ADMISSION.
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU HAVE A REPEAT X-RAY IN SIX WEEKS TO BE CERTAIN THE PNEUMONIA HAS COMPLETELY RESOLVED.
