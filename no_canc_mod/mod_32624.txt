There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic or the mitral valve.
Normal overall LV systolic function <br>  [**2118-2-18**] Echo (TTE): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
