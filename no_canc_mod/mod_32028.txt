Admission Date:  [**2103-3-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-3-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-8-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation at OSH [**3-12**]-> self-extubation on [**3-13**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 13275**] is a 52 year-old man with IDDM and pulmonary sarcoid, presents from OSH with altered mental status.
At 3am this morning, she found him minimally responsive with R foot twitching.
He was initially on propofol for sedation but became hypotensive to the 70s and was switched to fentanyl and versed.
Neuro evaluated the patient in the ED, exam was non-focal, recomended coverage for infection and also EEG.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS - T 99.3; BP 101/60; HR 90; RR 12; O2sat 100% [**Year (4 digits) 5442**]: PS 5/5, rate 12, VT 600s, FiO2 70% Gen: intubated, sedated HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, ETT in place, MMM CV: RRR, no m/r/g Chest: CTAB anteriorly, no w/r/r Abd: +BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended Ext: no LE edema Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Gram stain No PMNs, no micro-organisms .
STUDIES: ECG: NSR at 98bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no ST or TW changes, no prior for comparison.
There were no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform features.
[**2103-3-13**] Non contrast head CT FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or vascular territorial infarction.
A moderate amount of fluid layers in the oropharynx and nasopharynx as well as both ethmoid air cells bilaterally.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
[**2103-3-13**] CXR FINDINGS: There are increased interstitial lung markings consistent with mild fluid overload.
There are slight low lung volumes.
There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
An abnormal contour lateral to the descending aorta is noted and this may be due to poor inspiration.
Alternatively, the differential includes lymphadenopathy or aneurysm.
Mild fluid overload with likely retrocardiac atelectasis.
This may be due to poor inspiration, although differential includes possible descending aortic aneurysm or lymph nodes.
There is interval progression of perihilar interstitial opacities also involving the lower lobes, findings that might be consistent with pulmonary edema given its rapid development.
Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
# Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hypoglycemia.
[**Month (only) 116**] have had a hypoglycemic seizure and the AMS noted at OSH may have been post-ictal state.
Given initial fever and leukocytosis, pt received broad spectrum antimicrobials for meningitis/encephalitis coverage including Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Ampicillin (for listeria coverage, then quickly dc'd given pt doesn't meet the demographics), and Acyclovir.
Upon weaning of sedation (while being ventilated) and self-extubation, pt regained full neurologic function with no deficits.
After the inital fever, pt remained afebrile and WBC count normalized.
-[**2103-3-13**] BCx x 2 no growth to date -Urine culture negative (final) -CSF culture negative (final) -routine EEG with no specific abnormalities (see results) -serum tox negative .
# Hypotension on presentation: Most likely secondary to sedating meds and intubation.
Was worked up for infection as above with antimicrobials until infection was ruled out.
CXR after extubation showed possible pulm edema however pt did not develop dyspnea or decreased O2 saturation.
Monitored without intervention.
# Diabetes Type I: See above for pt's home regimen.
Hypoglycemia on the night of presentation likely due to unusually strenous activity with light dinner afterwards.
Did not change his usual regimen as the patient had been stable on the same insulin schedule for months, and this event was likely due to the unfortunate combination of excessive activity with small dinner.
No acute issues during hospital stay.
It is likely that you had a seizure stemming from hypoglycemia.
