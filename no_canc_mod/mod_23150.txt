Clinical correlation is recommended   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old lady with diabetes who was admitted to the ICU on [**2187-11-20**] with fevers and respiratory distress.
Sepsis/Pneumonia:  Due to concern for influenza and possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia, she was started on tamiflu and empiric antibiotics including vancomycin/ceftriaxone/levofloxacin on admission.
She had worsening respiratory distress and was intubated on [**11-21**], with multifocal infiltrates on CXR.
Gram stain of sputum demonstrated gram positive cocci and gram negative rods but cultures were ultimately negative, including a negative influenza DFA.
She developed ARDS and was managed with the ARDSnet protocol, eventually having an esophogeal balloon placed.
Acute Renal failure:  She developed acute renal in the setting of sepsis and likely acute tubular necrosis.
During her hospitalization, she did develop transaminitis (which was the reason lipitor was held), but this was thought to be secondary due to an antibiotic sided effect, as liver enzymes trended downward upon discontinuation of the offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
# Depression:  She can be restarted on prozac and amitryptiline.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for rash in groin.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Sepsis Pneumonia Acute respiratory distress syndomre Acute renal failure  Secondary: Obesity Diabetes type 2   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of shortness of breath.
We treated you for pneumonia and had to mechanically ventilate you, but you were eventually able to breathe on your own.
Return to the ED if you have fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms.
