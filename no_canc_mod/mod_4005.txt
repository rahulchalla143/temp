Of note, the patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-16**] for RIJ thrombus and now on Coumadin.
She presents today from nursing home with concern for vaginal bleeding vs. rectal bleeding per ER notes.
She was also noted to have mental status changes and diaphoretic.
Her eyes opened but no verbal response.
She also had some rectal bleeding on exam.
Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-16**] after she presented with high ammonia levels and R arm swelling.
She was found to have a RIJ thrombus and was started on a heparin gtt and transitioned to Coumadin at time of discharge.
In regards to her ammonia levels, the patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and per OMR there is some concern that she is not receiving her lactulose at the NH.
No report of fevers or chills.

no facial edema.
Lungs: crackles at bilateral bases.
S1S2, 3/6 systolic murmur Abdomen: + BS.
R arm more edematous than left.
Mild engorgement of the bilateral hilar vessels is consistent with volume overload.
There are no consolidation or masses.
Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
[**2105-2-24**] EGD: 2 cords of grade I varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
Excavated Lesions Multiple superficial acute non-bleeding ulcers ranging in size from 10mm to 15mm were found in the antrum.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
[**2105-2-23**] Echo: EF>60%, Mild mitral regurgitation with normal morphology.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No definite cardiac source of embolism identified.
Cxray ([**2-21**]): Early interstitial edema and pulmonary vascular redistribution.
Retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis although consolidation cannot be excluded on this single view.
No acute intracranial process detected.
Slight increase in mucosal thickening of the left sphenoid sinus consistent with chronic sinus disease.

#Fever- Started on [**2105-2-27**], most likely due to viral syndrome.
She was evaluated with blood cultures, urine cx, stool culture and chest xray, none of which showed any evidence of acute bacterial infection.
She was treated symptomatically with tylenol and oxycodone as needed for discomfort.
#wheezing, dyspnea - most likely due to combination of COPD exacerbation due to viral illness and mild degree of diastolic heart failure, CXR on [**2-27**] showed mild engorgement of bilateral hilar vessels and possible small effusions.
In addition, she was given an extra dose of IV lasix 60mg prior to discharge to help with her dyspnea.
#Acute renal failure -Baseline Creatinine likely around 1.1, currently with mild renal failure in the setting of likely overall volume overload with a possible element of diastolic heart failure.
# Mental status changes: On [**Date Range **], she was encephalopathic, most likely [**2-14**] hepatic encephalopathy vs. UTI, currently back to baseline and stable.
Urine culture with possible urinary tract infection, treated with ceftriaxone for a 7 day course, last dose given [**2105-3-2**].
# GI bleed: Per medical records she had BRBPR on examination in the ED with Hct~22 ( baseline Hct is between 28-30), also developed gross melena - stat Hct check demonstrated Hct 27 --> 24.9.
On transfer out of MICU, HCT relatively stable at 21 with no additional episodes of BRBRP or melena in ICU.
EGD with grade I non-bleeding varices and non bleeding ulcers in gastric antrum.
# RIJ thrombus: Patient presented with RUE edema during recent [**Name (NI) **] and was found to have a RIJ clot on CTA.
# Hepatitis C: prior complications of varices and encephalopathy.
# Hypertension: continue outpatient regimen of amlodipine now that HCT/BP stable.
