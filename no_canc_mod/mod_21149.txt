No definite focal hepatic lesion is seen.
The gallbladder wall appears mildly thickened, likely due to underlying liver disease.
The common bile duct is normal in caliber, measuring 0.5 cm, and there is no evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
The spleen measures 13 cm which is mildly enlarged.
Cirrhosis with hepatofugal flow within the main portal vein.
Moderate to large amount of ascites and mild splenomegaly.
Mild gallbladder wall thickening that is likely due to underlying liver disease.
No biliary dilatation.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.
Linear opacity projecting over the right middle lobe likely represents atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
Renal ultrasound ([**1-3**]): FINDINGS: Note is made that this is a limited study due to the patient's body habitus.
There is no hydronephrosis, and no renal stones are identified.
No cyst or solid mass is seen in either kidney.
There is a moderate amount of ascites within the abdomen.
No hydronephrosis, and no renal stones identified.
Moderate ascites.
EGD ([**1-7**]): Impression: - Varices at the lower third of the esophagus - Mild portal gastropathy, old residual in the stomach - Abnormal mucosa in the duodenum - Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: - follow up with liver center and PCP.
CXR ([**1-9**]): Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
New multifocal lung opacities right grater than left are consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema, multifocal pneumonia cannot be totally excluded.
There is no evident pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There are low lung volumes.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right are new.
These are more consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.
ECHO ([**1-10**]): Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Dilated right ventricle consistent with possible volume overload.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
EKG ([**1-11**]): NSR, no acute ST/TW changes.
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right lower extremity.
The patient experienced epistaxis from the left nostril briefly at the beginning of the procedure, which she stated is not unusual for her.
IMPRESSION: Fluoroscopic placement of an 8 French nasointestinal tube.
The tiplocation is post-pyloric and the tube is ready to use.
Given history of frequent epistaxis, the continued use of a bridle should be reviewed by the primary team.

# Hyperbilirubinemia, ascites, edema, liver failure: The patient had known risk factors for EtOH hepatitis, and her previous elevation in LFTs was in the context of admitted EtOH use.
Diruesis was started to reduce ascites and peripheral edema.
Dobhoff feeding tube placed [**1-21**] for tube feeding given poor nutritional status.
# Kidney injury:  Cr elevated at 2.2 on admission, last value 0.8 in [**2099**].
Renal ultrasound no evidence of obstruction or hydronephrosis.
# Leukocytosis:  The patient had leukocytosis that persisted throughout admission.
# Anemia and duodenal ulcer: Patient presented with anemia (Hct 24.1), required 3 units PRBCs to maintain Hct.
EGD found duodenal ulcer that was cauterized.
# Respiratory distress and MICU course:  On the night of [**1-9**], the patient spiked a temperature to 101 and developed a new oxygen requirement.
In the early morning of [**1-10**], patient became acutely hypoxic with crackles throughout her lung fields.
A CXR was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
She was treated with IV diuresis and was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress.
Echocardiography was consistent with volume overload, but there was no clear precipitant for flash pulmonary edema.
The cardiology team was consulted and recommended outpatient follow-up to ensure resolution of right ventricular distension with appropriate diuresis.
# Depression / ETOh abuse:  Per family, the patient has been struggling with depression for the last 2 years, which has been the main driver for her EtOH abuse.
# Mania:  Patient had visual hallucination [**1-12**] overnight.
Per Up-to-Date, treatment for Grade III dislocations is conservative, and at as her function was good there was no indication for orthopedic intervention.
# Hyperlipidemia:  found to have dyslipidemia with low HDL and elevated LDL.
Treatment deferred to outpatient follow-up # Hyperglycemia:  Brief period of hyperglycemia on admission, rapidly resolved.
# CODE: Full # CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **], son [**Name (NI) 916**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60942**] ===================================================== Transitional Issues: - Treatment of dyslipidemia - Psychiatric follow-up for substance abuse, mania - Consider transplant listing once patient has achieved 3 months sobriety - Cardiology follow-up to ensure resolution of right heart volume overload - Per Psychiatry:  In outpatient setting, could consider the following non-urgent recommendations.
1) Neuropsychological testing to determine whether or not there may be longterm cognitive deficits associated with ETOH abuse 2) consider cross-tapering Haldol to another medication with more mood-stabilizing properties (e.g.
quetiapine) - Trend WBC for persistent leukocytosis.
- Trend HCT, transfusions for symptomatic anemia - Check EKG once a week to eval QTc while on haldol - Encourage PO intake, regular nutritional assessments while on tube feeds - Assess when able to change psychiatric meds based on LFTs - Trend LFTs, chemistry, CBC daily until sees liver in outpatient followup  Medications on Admission: LORAZEPAM 0.5MG TABLETS TAKE ONE-HALF TO ONE TABLET BY MOUTH THREE TIMES DAILY AS NEEDED atenolol 100 mg Tab one Tablet(s) by mouth once a day ZOLPIDEM 10MG TABLETS TAKE [**12-31**] TO 1 TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY NIGHT AT BEDTIME AS NEEDED  Discharge Medications: 1. thiamine HCl 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
9. haloperidol 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for agitation.
12. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itching.
14. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

You were determined to have cirrhosis (long term damage of your liver), likely due to alcohol intake.
An endoscopy revealed a duodenal ulcer that was thought to be the cause of some slow GI bleeding.
You had an episode of respiratory distress that led to a brief stay in our intensive care unit.
You were found to have some aspects of mania during your stay.
We made the following changes to your medications: - STOP Ambien - STOP atenolol - STOP Ativan - START Haldol for mania - START thiamine, folic acid, multivitamin - START omeprazole for ulcer treatment - START furosemide and spironolactone to treat fluid overload and swelling - START propranolol for blood pressure and to prevent GI bleeding  Please follow-up with your outpatient providers as listed below.
