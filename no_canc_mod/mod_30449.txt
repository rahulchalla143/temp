Admission Date:  [**2175-1-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2175-1-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2119-3-9**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEUROLOGY HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year-old woman with a past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation, mechanical mitral valve regurgitation on Coumadin, osteoporosis, prior strokes and rheumatic heart disease who was recently admitted over [**Holiday 1451**] to the left lower extremity weakness and dysarthria that improved over the coming days.
With her history of multiple recurrent spells of left sided weakness and dysarthria diagnosis at that point was thought to be seizures versus transient ischemic attack.
Electroencephalogram was obtained, which frontal bilateral parietal and bilateral cerebellar strokes and question positive diffusion study in the right posterior limb and the internal capsule and right anteromedial temporal lobe.
She then went home and in the next few days developed a severe headache, ([**11-3**]) was subacute in onset and was most severe at the top of her head.
At that time she denied nausea, vomiting photophobia or phonophobia.
A repeat MRI and MRA showed subarachnoid and intra parenchymal blood with supraclinoid ICA stenosis, question vasospasm.
She was admitted to the Neurosurgery Service, had an angiogram at that point, which was negative for aneurysm, and confirmed the ICA stenosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General appearance, the patient is a well appearing woman in no acute distress.
Her naming was intact to high and low frequency items.
There was no apraxia or neglect.
Speech was mildly dysarthric, but fluent.
There is a left mild facial droop present in primary position.
Her strength examination she did have a left pronator drift, 4 out of 5 left triceps weakness as well as a 4- weakness of her extensors and of her wrists and fingers on the left.
She did have a left pronator drift.
She also had 4+ weakness of her left IP.
Coordination showed some ataxia and finger nose finger on the left upper extremity.
Rapid alternating movements were also somewhat slow on the left.
Gait was normal based, but slightly ataxic with a short stride.
MRI and MRA [**1-1**] showed subarachnoid blood extending from the right ICA to the intra parenchymal region, small amount of blood seen in both lateral ventricles, small intra peranchymal component involving the medial anterior temporal lobe.
MRA showed a supraclinoid stenosis showing narrowing of right side.
TCDs were done on [**1-3**] showed increase velocity of the right MCA, siphon and ACA.
Angiogram done on [**1-3**] and subsequently repeated on [**1-9**] did not show an aneurysm or AVM.
With anticoagulation there is an increased risk of hemorrhage and bleeding and subsequent death, however, without anticoagulation given her mechanical valve and atrial fibrillation there is also a risk of embolic stroke disability as well as death.
We seemed to agree that using heparin in the short term for a low PTT of 40 to 60 using Coumadin for the long term goal would be an optima solution .
Regarding her mitral valve regurgitation, cardiology would like an optimal INR of 2.5 to 3.5 to prevented thromboembolism, however, in her situation of recent bleed on Coumadin we will plan on watching her INR extremely closely as we do not want to get to a supratherapeutic range.
We consulted cardiology for help with further management of her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] blood pressure has always been systolic of 102 to 120 and this has at times limited us from using antihypertensives and rate control agents such as beta blockers for her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
The pharmacologic interaction of Digoxin increasing the INR when the patient is on Coumadin is noted and also needs to be watched extremely carefully while both Digoxin and the Coumadin achieve a steady state for Ms. [**Known lastname **].
Hemorrhagic stroke.
Atrial fibrillation.
History of ischemic strokes.
Rheumatic heart disease.
