Chest: Increased AP diameter.
Mild crackles in bilateral bases.
No HSM or tenderness.
Normoactive bowel sounds Ext: 1+ pitting pedal edema Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Stress: INTERPRETATION: 82 yo woman (h/o MI x 2; cardiac catheterization revealing moderate LM and RCA disease and mild LAD and LCx disease without intervention) was referred to evaluate an atypical chest discomfort.
No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported by the patient during the procedure.
In the presence of baseline ECG abnls, no additional ST segment changes were noted during the procedure.
The rhythm was sinus with no ectopy noted.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ECG changes from baseline.
Left ventricular cavity size is moderately dilated.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a large area of moderate to severe and fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior and inferseptal walls and a large area of moderate to severe and fixed perfusion defect in the proximal and mid anterior and ateroseptal walls.
Gated images reveal global hypokinesis more pronounced in the inferior wall and septum.
Large area of moderate to severe and fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior and inferseptal walls 2.
Large area of moderate to severe and fixed perfusion defect in the proximal and mid anterior and anteroseptal walls.
Dilated LV with septal and inferior wall hypokinesis; LVEF 34%.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 2-vessel coronary artery disease involving the Left main.
The LAD had a 60% stenosis at the origin with heavy calcification.
The LCX was a non-dominant vessel and had heavy calcification proximally.
The RCA was a dominant vessel with a 40% stenosis in the mid segment.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided filling pressures, with a LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed hypokinesis of the anterior, apical and inferior walls, with a depressed ejection fraction of 45-50%.
There was no transaortic gradient on pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.
Carotid U/S [**2154-9-26**] IMPRESSION: Less than 40% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Echo [**2154-9-27**] PRE CPB Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the septal, inferoseptal, and inferior walls.
The right ventricle displays focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
Infiltrative process.
There is severe and fairly diffuse calcification of most of the thoracic aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The left ventricle now displays akinesis of all segments other than the anterior wall which displays moderate hypokinesis.
The right ventricle shows apical akinesis with moderate hypokinesis of the basal right ventricle.
The aortic insufficiency remains moderate.
There is no appreciable pneumothorax.
There is no definite consolidation or effusion.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes.
As she complained of shortness of breath and leg pain, a CTA was performed which showed no pulmonary embolism.
The CT scan did reveal and incidental finding of an air-fluid level in esophagus.
A proton pump inhibitor was continued and follow-up was recommended to for evaluation for possible esophageal dysmotility.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a Persantine-MIBI stress test which showed large areas of mod to severe perfusion defects in inferior, anterior and septal walls.
Given the evidence of large defects and her significant cardiac history, a cardiac catheterization was performed.
Given the severity of her coronary disease as well as the significant aortic calcification, the cardiac surgical service was consulted.
A carotid duplex ultrasound showed no significant carotid artery disease.
Given her extensive coronary and aortic calcification, it was planned that she would undergo an thoracoscopic [**Female First Name (un) 899**] harvest followed by off pump single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting through a key hole incision.
Then prior to discharge, she would undergo stenting of her circumflex artery.
Overnight she became increasingly acidotic and arrested in the morning.
