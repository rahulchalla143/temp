Neuro: CN grossly intact, [**4-13**] muscle strength of LE bilaterally, LE weakness is greater on the left than right.
Back: No spinal tenderness on palpation.
Pt has tenderness at right paraspinal area without fluctuance or erythema.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
There is no evidence of mass/vegetation on the right atrial/ventricular device leads.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
Aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
No paravalvar abcess is seen.

No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process to explain the patient's symptoms on this limited non-contrast-enhanced CT. 2.
New small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with simple fluid attenuation.
Trace pelvic fluid by the sigmoid colon.
Multiple pancreatic and renal lesions are better evaluated on the prior contrast-enhanced CT. 4.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
A small amount of high density material, possibly oral contrast, and air within the excluded stomach, post gastric bypass.
This could result from reflux from the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis, but gastro-gastric fistula cannot be excluded based on imaging.
Brief Hospital Course: Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: This was thought to be secondary to sepsis acquired from his UTI.
He required presors for several days in the ICU, upon callout from the ICU he was normotensive off of pressors for several days.
The Pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound showed no evidence of fluid collection or abscess in the right chest.
Abd/pelvis CT without appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis.
Back pain:  Patient with chronic back pain, asking on a daily basis to have a steroid injection in his spine.
Would not instrument this patient while he is actively being treated for bacteremia.
GPCs in blood: Unlikely to be contaminant given coag negative staph grew from BCX at [**Location (un) **] and catheter tip here.
CAD: continue aspirin, statin - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension .
DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD.
- humalog SS .
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: SEPSIS UTI related sepsis .
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after you were found to have profound blood infection with difficulty keeping your blood pressures up.
You were found to have two different bacteria in your blood.
We treated this by changing all of your indwelling catheters, and starting you on long-term antibiotics.
The following changes were made to your regimen: You must continue Ceftazadime until [**5-28**] You must continue Flagyl until [**6-11**] Your calcium carbonate was increased to four times per day You were started on oxycodone 1-2 tabs every four hours as needed for pain You were stared on lidocaine patches as needed every day (12 hours on 12 hours off) for your back pain You were started on anusol supositories for anal pain, you should take these until your pain resolves.
You were started on standing tylenol 1 gram every 6 hours standing for pain  We stopped your metoprolol and flomax and you must discuss these with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40802**].
