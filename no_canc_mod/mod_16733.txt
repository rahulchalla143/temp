HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 42-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C, alcoholic hepatitis, chronic pancreatitis, narcotic abuse, and gastritis, last hospitalized from [**7-24**] through [**7-27**] at [**Hospital6 4299**] for alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis flares, who was transferred from [**Hospital6 8283**] for acute elevation in liver chemistries and hypotension.
She initially took Penicillin without relief and was seen at [**Hospital6 8283**] Emergency Room on [**10-1**] where she was found to have a right tooth abscess and was prescribed erythromycin and Percocet.
The patient subsequently developed nausea, vomiting, sharp and crampy epigastric pain that was radiating to her back.
In the Emergency Room at the outside, she was found to be afebrile, tachycardiac with a heart rate of 134, orthostatic, and her exam was notable for scleral icterus, poor dentition, epigastric tenderness, and dry mucous membranes.
History of chronic pancreatitis.
Status post cesarean section and ectopic pregnancies in the past.
History of traumatic wrist laceration in the past status post surgical repair with blood transfusions in [**2084**].
ALLERGIES:  ERYTHROMYCIN CAUSES HIVES, LIBRIUM CAUSES MENTAL STATUS CHANGES ACCORDING TO THE PATIENT.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for mother who died secondary to complications of diabetes.
Father died secondary to complications of coronary artery disease.
No family history of liver disease.
Cheek swollen secondary to dental abscess.
No stigmata of chronic liver disease.
Tenderness in the epigastrium and left upper quadrant without rebound or voluntary guarding.
Unable to percuss liver and spleen size or palpate secondary to subcutaneous fat and tissue.
LABORATORY DATA:  As above for labs at outside hospital.
Labs also notable for a white blood cell count of 13.4, hematocrit 40, platelet count 85; UCG negative; toxicology screen positive for opiates, but negative for acetaminophen; urinalysis positive for 2+ protein, 3+ bilirubin, [**2-1**] fine granular casts.
Chest x-ray, PA and lateral, without any acute disease, infiltrates, or failure.
Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated fatty infiltration of liver with several small gallbladder polyps and no gallstones.
Ultrasound also demonstrated pancreatic calcifications consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
She required no more pressors or had no more episodes of hypotension throughout the course of her hospitalization.
Infectious disease:  The patient had a low-grade fever on admission with a white blood cell count slightly elevated at 10.5.
She had two blood cultures from the outside hospital positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus which was sensitive to Clindamycin.
She also underwent a 3-day course of Levofloxacin for pyuria; however, she continued to have fever spikes throughout the course of her hospitalization as high as 102-103??????F.
Dental films were obtained, given the patient's complaint of dental abscess and demonstrated no abscess or no signs of osteomyelitis.
The patient was seen and followed by Oral Surgery, and they felt that the source of her staph bacteremia was unlikely from her dental issues which they felt were more consistent with cellulitis and not an abscess.
Transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography were within normal limits and did not demonstrate any vegetations on exam.
She was followed by the Infectious Disease Services while in-house and for the last two days of her hospitalization has been afebrile with normal white blood cell count and no fever spikes.
GI:  The patient presented with acute hepatic toxicity, likely secondary to not only alcohol but acetaminophen toxicity with elevated liver function tests that are also suggestive of ischemic hepatitis.
She has an ultrasound that demonstrated patent hepatic vasculature, as well as patent portal vein.
She did not at any point have any asterixis or signs of hepatic encephalopathy.
EGD demonstrated no significant varices, but only some esophagitis.
She did have a CT scan that demonstrated some small splenic and gastric varices.
She was confirmed to be positive for hepatitis C and negative for hepatitis A and B viruses.
She did during the course of the hospitalization develop diarrhea and C-diff.
The patient thus likely had hepatic toxicity secondary to alcohol and acetominophen, as well as ischemic hepatitis.
Neurological:  The patient received Benzodiazepines per CIWA scale with signs of delirium tremens in the Intensive Care Unit; however, the patient was rapidly titrated off of her benzodiazepines and did not require any for the rest of the course of her admission without any signs of DTs; however, the patient was started on Dilaudid for her abdominal pain and pan secondary to multiple blood draws during the course of her admission, and titration is ensuing for these medications.
Heme:  The patient had a low hematocrit noted during the course of the admission with iron studies demonstrating normal iron but lower TIBC and an elevated MCV.
Pain:  As above, the patient continues to take small Dilaudid for abdominal pain which we will attempt to wean off as tolerated.
The patient also underwent abdominal CT to rule out intra-abdominal source of abscess, splenic infarct, or colitis, which may be contributing to her fever spikes.
There was no evidence of splenic or renal pathology.
There was no evidence of intra-abdominal abscess or other abnormal fluid collections.
There was a diffusely calcified pancreas noted and diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
There were mild gastroesophageal and splenic varices as described before.
Infectious Disease Service recommended one week more of Oxacillin to treat the coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus that was noted on blood cultures at the outside hospital.
No obvious source of this infection has been noted to date and may have been a transient bacteremia, but given the status of the patient on admission and her hypotension/sepsis, they recommend one more week of antibiotic treatment.
Hepatic toxicity secondary to alcohol and acetaminophen overuse.
Ischemic hepatitis.
Anemia likely satisfactory condition alcohol abuse and myelosuppression.
