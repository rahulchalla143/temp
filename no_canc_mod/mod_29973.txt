URINE CULTURE (Final [**2191-9-16**]):    NO GROWTH.
EKG: [**2191-9-14**]: tracing # 1: Narrow complex tachycardia.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes likely due to repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-11-13**] narrow complex tachycardia is seen and there are ST-T wave changes.
[**2191-9-14**] Ectopic atrial rhythm with ventricular premature beats and premature atrial contractions.
Non-specific lateral T wave changes.
No diagnostic interim change.
Segmental and subsegmental PE affecting the posterior basal segments of the left lower lobe.
Probable additional subsegmental PE involving the right upper lobe apical segment.
Echo [**2191-9-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Portable CXR [**2191-9-15**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
No pulmonary edema.
Liver/gallbladder US [**2191-9-15**]: FINDINGS: The gallbladder is mildly distended but no gallstones are identified.
There is no gallbladder wall edema and no pericholecystic fluid is identified.
No biliary dilatation is seen and the common duct measures 0.5 cm.
No focal hepatic abnormality is identified on limited views of the liver.
No ascites is seen in the upper abdomen.
IMPRESSION: No gallstones and no biliary dilatation identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old woman with history of CAD, dCHF, last cath [**2185**] with clean coronaries, Diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prior PE recently completed 6 month course of anticoagulation presented with new PE and atrial flutter, discharged in stable condition on anticoagulation.
# PE: Recurrent.
Aspirin was held and not continued on discharge due to bleeding risk per patient.
# Atrial Flutter: No history of arrhythmia per OMR.
Outpatient cardiologist is not aware of any history of arrhythmia in the past.
Initially in the ED after adenosine administration it was showed that she has atrial flutter.
Subsequent EKG showed ectopic atrial rhythm with PAC's and PVC's.
Her HR was well controlled by diltiazem and metoprolol, however given her low borderline BP upon transfer to the floor with bradycardia, diltiazem dose was reduced to 15 mg twice daily while we continued metoprolol at 12.5 mg twice daily.
Echo showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function in addition to Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Subsequently upon improvement, her diltiazem and metoprolol were restarted, while lasix was still held due to low borderline blood pressure.
# Chest pain: Pleuritic per history.
Likely related to underlying PE but given extensive cardiac history (despite clean coronaries [**2185**]) there was an initial concern of an ischemic event.
Her chest pain resolved in the ICU and remained without chest pain during the rest of her stay in the hospital.
# Elevated Lipase: Unclear why.
Initially pancreatitis was a concern given her abdominal pain and elevated lipase which was initially ~ 1200 that trended down to 30.
Her abdominal pain resolved upon having a large bowel movement.
There was no concerning symptoms for infectious etiology.
UA was mildly positive but asymptomatic.
TSH slightly elevated but likely related to stress of hospitalization and sick euthyroid.
Please consider restarting lasix if needed and as appropriate to her HR and BP   Medications on Admission: CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Confirmed with patient - caltrate 600mg-400u po daily - vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q month - diltiazem HCl 30 mg po bid - fluticasone 50 mcg spray [**Hospital1 **] - lasix 40 mg po bid - levothyroxine 88 mcg po daily - lithium 150 mg po bid - metformin 500 mg po daily - mirtazapine 30 mg po qhs - nitroglycerin 0.3 mg sl prn chest pain, used occ weekly/monthly - omeprazole 20 mg po daily - KCl 10 mEq po bid - asa 81 mg po daily (held while on coumadin) - tylenol 500 mg po bid prn pain - [**Doctor First Name 130**] - risperidone 0.5 mg qAM, 1mg qPM - metoprolol 12.5 mg po BID - miralax 17 gram po daily   Discharge Medications: 1. enoxaparin 60 mg/0.6 mL Syringe Sig: One (1) injection Subcutaneous Q12H (every 12 hours) for 14 days.

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to chest pain and shortness of breath.
Upon imaging your chest, it was found that you have a clot in one of your lung vessels.
You had low blood pressures requiring you to be admitted to the ICU where your blood pressure was stabilized.
During your stay, we noticed you had abnormal heart rhythm.
Given the abnormal heart rhythm and the repeated clotting, we recommend that you stay on coumadin to reduce the risk of further clots in the future.
