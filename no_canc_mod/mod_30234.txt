Hypotension/UTI:  Likely due to urosepsis.
His chronic bradycardia probably contributed to the overall picture and inability to compensate.
Non responsiveness: He has a long history of vasovagal syncope and has had multiple outpatient studies to work this up.
He had no witnessed seizure activity.
This episode was more likely due to global cerebral hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension / UTI.
Pt to have outpatient cognitive screening.
Bradycardia: Was seen by EP last year for recurrent syncopal episodes, hypertension, and prolonged PR interval his syncope was determined to be likely vasovagal given his prodrome of diaphoresis, fatigue, and nausea.
Has chronic constipation and was continued on his bowel regimen.
Hypercholesterolemia: His statin was held due to an increased Ck which trended down during his admission.
Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia and responded to hydration.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
