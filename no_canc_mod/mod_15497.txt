Admission Date:  [**2178-7-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-7-4**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented from an outside hospital with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the inferior and posterior segments.
The patient had multiple episodes of nausea, chest pressure, chest discomfort, and epigastric pain over the past two weeks prior to admission.
The pain and episodes were stuttering in duration and progression.
The pain radiated to her back and neck and was associated with shortness of breath.
The patient also had shortness of breath at rest.
She presented to an outside hospital where her electrocardiogram showed first-degree atrioventricular block with ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF; ST depressions in leads I, aVL, V2 through V6.
She was placed on aspirin, heparin, nitroglycerin, Lopressor, and Integrilin with near resolution of anginal symptoms.
An interventional heart catheterization was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13584**] which demonstrated a right-dominant coronary circulation with left main coronary artery with a 30% tubular ostial calcification, left anterior descending artery 70% proximal lesion, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30272**] diseased first diagonal, left circumflex with 99% long stenosis involving the origin/proximal portion of first obtuse marginal which filled retrograde by left-to-left collaterals; likely very chronic but contributory to anterolateral ST depressions noted on electrocardiograms prior to transfer.
The right coronary artery with initial TIMI-II flow, sequential 90% tubular then 90% ulcerated hazy lesions just before short posterior descending artery (with 90% ostial) and large posterior left ventricular branches.
In general, an elderly female producing pink frothy sputum, mildly uncomfortable.
No murmurs, rubs, clicks, or gallops.
Extremity examination revealed dorsalis pedis, posterior tibialis, and radial  pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
No presacral or lower extremity edema.
The right groin catheterization site was without hematoma or bruits.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with 3-mm to 4-mm ST depressions in V1 through V6 (these were dynamic changes).
At [**Hospital1 69**], she had a normal sinus rhythm with a prolonged P-R interval with normal axis.
Status post catheterization with a left axis deviation, still with 0.5-mm ST elevations inferiorly.
She was asymptomatic with no nausea, chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, palpitations, or edema.
No aortic stenosis.
The left atrium was mildly dilated with inferior wall motion abnormalities.
A chest x-ray from early on [**7-3**] showed likely congestive heart failure with a tortuous aorta, small pleural effusions (left greater than right), with pulmonary edema.
There was a discussion on [**7-2**] regarding taking the patient back to the Catheterization Laboratory for treatment of her left-sided disease.
However, it was decided that at this time the culprit lesion was indeed the right coronary artery, and the left-sided lesions would possibly be corrected at a later date.
twice per day and given some as needed medications for her gas/bloating.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acute ST elevation inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure, systolic and diastolic acute on chronic.
Coronary artery disease.
