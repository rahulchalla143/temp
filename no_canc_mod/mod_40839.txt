Admission Date:  [**2160-11-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-11-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-9-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: presenting for elective cardiac catheterization  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 74M CAD s/p CABG in [**2147**], CHF, dm2, admitted to CCU for hypotension, heamturia during elective cath procedure.
He presented for a relook cardiac catheterization and possible ICD placement since stress testing has revealed new fixed defects and recent Holter monitoring has demonstrated an increase in ventricular ectopy.
At the end of the procedure, the pt was noted to have sbp in 70s with HR 50s and was treated with atropine 0.5 mg IV x3 to treat presumed vagal reaction.
With regard to symptoms, the patient reports that in [**Month (only) 216**] he had several episodes of classic angina with exertion, responding to SL nitroglycerin.
Currently he describes intermittent chest heaviness, often occurring in the evening when climbing the stairs to go to bed.
ROS: Denies claudication, LE edema, orthopnea, PND, lightheadedness Patient reports being diagnosed with neuropathy and complains of  burning of the soles of his feet when lying down.
Cx with mild disease.
No inducible ventricular arrhythmias.
Low grade atrial ectopy noted.
Very frequent isolated VPB's noted including episodes of ventricular bigeminy, trigeminy and quadrageminy.
Ventricular ectopy has increased since Holter study dated [**2159-12-13**].
Anterior and inferior walls near akinetic with severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
1+ AI, 2+ MR, 1+ TR, moderate systolic pulmonary hypertension.
LV systolic function is slightly worse.
Impression: bilateral tibial disease with predominant involvement of the anterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries.
- [**2160-10-13**] ETT: 6.5 minutes modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, 84% max PHR,  stopping due to 3mm ST depression in the inferolateral leads.
Rhythm was sinus with frequent isolated polymorphic VPB's at rest and low level exercise.
Imaging: new moderate to severe fixed anteroseptal and moderate fixed apical  defects.
Stable mild to moderate fixed inferolateral defect.
Global hypokinesis calculated LVEF 21%.
[**2158**]: RCA stenting Ischemic cardiomyopathy Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation SVT, s/p ablation Adult onset diabetes Hyperlipidemia Seasonal allergies   Social History: Patient was born in Poland, immigrated to the US in [**2102**].
Family History: Father with an MI at age 73.
Severe aortic stenosis with Dobutamine.
Not tested b/c mild AS and recent stents RA: P=4.1, Imp=475 , <0.1 @ 0.5 RV:R=8.8, Imp=525, 0.5 @ 0.5   Brief Hospital Course: This 74-year old male with CAD history, s/p CABG ([**2147**]), AS, CHF, dm2, was admitted to CCU for hypotension, heamturia during elective cath procedure.
Cardiovascular:  Patient presented for elective cardiac catheterization for new fixed defects in the anteroseptal and apical regions, which resulted in two overlapping 2.5 mm and 3.0 mm Cypher stents.
He remained chest pain free for the duration of his admission.
b. pump: During his catheterization, patient had a brief hypotensive episode which was thought likely secondary to a vagal reaction.
From his past history, patient was known to have severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with a recent EF ~20-25% and noted to have a mildly elevated wedge pressure.
c. Valves: Patient, with known AS with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8 mean gradient 16 by echo, had a dobutamine challenge during catheterization to measure the degree of stenosis, which showed significant aortic stenosis with a low cardiac index.
d. Vasculature: PCP concern for tibial vascular disease, recommending that bed be kept in a reverse trendelenburg position at all times.
GENITOURINARY:  Upon placement of a Foley catheter s/p cardiac catheterization for feeling of bladder fullness, patient had bright red blood, which prompted urology evaluation and subsequent placement of a large bore catheter and chronic foley flushes, to be discontinued 48 hours after passage of blood clots.
Coronary Artery Disease 2.
Aortic Stenosis 4.
Non-sustained Ventricular Tachycardia 6.
Hematuria Secondary: 7.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 - controlled   Discharge Condition: Patient discharged in stable condition, with stable vital signs, oxygenating well on room air, ambulating unassisted.
Discharge Instructions: You have been evaluated and treated for your coronary disease, your irregular heart beat, and your aortic stenosis.
The testing resulted in a new stent being placed in one of your coronary arteries, a pacemaker/ICD being placed, more evidence of your heart muscle's response to the aortic stenosis.
You did develop blood in the urine during this hospitalization.
