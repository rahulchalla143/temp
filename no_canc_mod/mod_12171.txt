Trauma investigation revealed left frontal small intraparenchymal hemorrhage, right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage also small, bilateral large pulmonary contusions, tiny bilateral pneumothoraceses for which chest tubes were not inserted and a left clavicular fracture.
The patient's initial troponins were elevated up to the 30s and the cardiology consult opinion was the patient's motor vehicle accident was probably related to a primary cardiac event causing her pain and disorientation, which resulted in the crash.
Chest x-ray revealed enlarging pneumothorax for which a chest tube was placed on the right side.
The patient had a prolonged Intensive Care Unit course resulting in a very slow ventilator wean due to her bilateral pulmonary contusions.
The patient also developed ventilator related pneumonia for which she was started on antibiotics.
Pneumonia was improving and she was restarted on her Coumadin.
After several days the Coumadin was held due to increasing white count and the suspicion that the patient might have a calculus cholecystitis, however, after investigation of this proved not to be the case and she was again restarted on her Coumadin and prehospitalization medications.
By hospital day seventeen, the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs working well with physical therapy.
Catheter tip sent for culture, which had no growth.
Additionally, the patient was not restarted on her prehospitalization Diltiazem, because her blood pressures during her hospitalization were at normal levels and did not warrant an anti-hypertensive [**Doctor Last Name 360**], nor did her heart rate warrant rate control with a calcium channel blocker.
Her pulmonary status and volume status did not appear during this hospitalization to require a diuretic anti-hypertensive [**Last Name (LF) 360**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] therefore her Prinzide was also not restarted as an inpatient.
