Admission Date:  [**2111-7-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2111-7-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-12-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT GREEN TEAM  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, rheumatic heart disease status post aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement with mechanical valves on [**Hospital 197**] transferred from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital after he presented there on [**2111-7-10**] complaining of nausea, vomiting, and weakness for two days.
At the outside hospital, the patient was found to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressure to the 70s, hyperkalemic with potassium of 6.9, digitoxin toxic level of 2.9, and acute renal failure with BUN and creatinine of 96/10, and coagulopathic with an [**Year (4 digits) 263**] of 8.9.
Patient had recently been admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**7-3**] with a mild congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Patient at this time, denied other symptoms such as fever, chills, chest pain.
At the outside hospital, patient underwent a renal ultrasound which was negative for hydronephrosis or other acute process.
Patient was also given D50 +10 units of insulin, 1 amp of sodium bicarb, Kayexalate, 1 amp of calcium gluconate, all for his hyperkalemia.
Patient at this time, also complained of chest tightness and vomited once in the parking lot.
Transient ischemic attacks.
Rheumatic heart disease status post mitral valve repair and aortic valve repair in [**2110-3-10**] complicated by atrial fibrillation and asystole requiring DDD pacemaker placement, also complicated by pericardial effusion and pleural effusions.
Status post chest tube and pleurodesis as well as a pericardial window.
Congestive heart failure.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Esophageal dysmotility.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, no jugular venous distention, no bruits.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, mild expiratory wheezes.
Abdomen: Normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, and nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
No focal deficits.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  A-V paced at 70, increased artifact, but no peaked T waves.
Hypotension:  Patient is hypotensive likely due to dehydration.
Given patient's chest tightness in the parking lot, cardiac enzymes were sent and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction.
The patient was monitored closely for signs of pulmonary edema as his ejection fraction was suspected to be low.
Blood and urine cultures were also sent to rule out an infection, although the patient did not have fever, cough, or other symptoms or signs of infection.
The patient's hypotension responded well to normal saline boluses, and were in the 120 range.
Acute renal failure:  Likely combination of prerenal due to his hypovolemia as well as secondary to his high dose of Lasix, aldactone, lisinopril, and metformin at admission.
Renal consult was brought in and believed that the acute renal failure was related to medication toxicity as well as hypotension leading to acute tubular necrosis.
The patient was initially considered for possible dialysis at admission, however, his potassium and other electrolytes on repeat had improved markedly.
Starting on the second day after admission began diuresing briskly likely due to his IV fluid boluses as well as his post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis.
Nausea and vomiting:  Patient's symptoms at presentation were likely related to digoxin toxicity and acute renal failure.
Patient was given Zofran IV once at admission, and had no complaints of nausea or vomiting throughout his hospital stay.
An echocardiogram performed at the bedside in the Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, no aortic or mitral regurgitation, no pericardial effusion.
After numerous IV fluid boluses, the patient developed some crackles about half way up his lungs bilaterally.
Hematuria:  Likely due to post ATN versus trauma upon Foley placement.
The patient's hematuria decreased throughout his hospital stay and was monitored throughout.
Diabetes mellitus type 2:  Patient's fingerstick glucose remained in the 100 range throughout his hospital stay and did not require regular insulin-sliding scale.
Coagulation:  Patient's coagulopathy at admission was reversed with 6 units of fresh-frozen plasma and vitamin K IV.
The patient was maintained on a Heparin drip throughout his hospital stay as he has mechanical valves.
The patient's coagulopathy on admission was likely due to increased physiologic Coumadin due to his acute renal failure.
Patient's potassium decreased from his elevated levels to within normal limits with in one day of his hospital stay.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease versus asthma: Patient continued on his home dose of Advair throughout his hospital stay.
Patient had intermittent periods of audible wheezing which responded well to nebulizers.
Left groin hematoma developed, but was stable and was continued on a pressure dressing.
Acute renal failure.
Congestive heart failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma.
