# TCA overdose: Pt with ?EKG changes that were concerning for severe overdose (QRS only mildly widened, S:R ratio in AVR somewhat long.
ECG changes resolved and patient had no further side effects of overdose.
# SSRI overdose: treatment was same as TCA overdose above.
Do not suspect infection in this setting as he has been afebrile, WBC improving and patient is asymptommatic.
No antibiotics were given as this was felt to be secondary to pneumonitis versus possible stress leukemoid reaction and resolved by the day after admission.
# Isolated elevated bilirubin: Most likey a medication effect.
Also had aspiration of charcoal as mentioned above.
aspiration but patient asymptomatic, satting well on RA and afebrile so no antibiotics were felt to be warranted.
