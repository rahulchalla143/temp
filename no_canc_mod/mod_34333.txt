Admission Date:  [**2125-2-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-3-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-5-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: 82 year-old woman with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission last month for pneumonia (treated with Vanco and Zosyn), admitted with SOB and hypoxia to 88%.
She reports increased new lower extremity edema over the past few days.
She denies cough, lightheadeness, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or abdominal pain.
On [**2-5**], she was found to be coughing so was started on Avelox (completed [**2-13**]) for empiric PNA treatment.
At that time, she was noted to have a rash on her back and worsening LE edema.
Her CXR was difficult to interpret but showed LLL opacity with effusion and she was treated for PNA with Vanco and Cefepime.
Given her elevated LFTs, A RUQ was performed which demonstrated gallstones but could not rule out cholectysitis.
She was seen by surgery who felt her presentation was not consistent with cholectysitis (no abdominal pain, fevers) and therefor did not recommend surgical intervention.
Past Medical History: - Hypothyroidism - Obesity - Iron deficiency anemia - Thoracic aorta aneurysms - H/o gallstones - H/o pancreatic pseudocysts and radiographic evidence of pancreatitis without clinical symptoms (noted [**2125-1-26**]) - Recent LLL CAP with planned Vanco/Zosyn course to end [**2125-2-2**] - H/o renal failure in [**Month (only) **] due to "accidentally taking too much lasix"  Social History: Patient currently residing at rehab facility after hospitalization for PNA.

Large left lung base opacification, combination of consolidation and large left effusion.
Likely small right effusion.
Central venous congestion.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2125-2-19**]: IMPRESSION: The constellation of cholelithiasis, peri-pancreatic fluid, and lab evidence of pancreatitis is consistent with gallstone pancreatitis.
Diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with areas of hypodensity that could represent pseudocysts, although these are not well delineated given lack of IV contrast.
Note that a pancreatic mass cannot be excluded.
There are several focal fluid collections, likely representing pseudocysts, including within the gastrohepatic ligament, left upper quadrant, and likely splenic subcapsular.
There is small abdominal and moderate pelvic ascites.
There is apparent thickening of the distal stomach/proximal duodenum, with apparent mass effect from the pancreatic head enlargement.
Cecal and proximal ascending colonic thickening, which may be infectious or inflammatory, but ischemia cannot be excluded.
Large left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse.
Small right pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.
ECHO [**2125-2-21**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLERS [**2125-2-22**]: 1.
Left posterior tibial vein showed decreased flow consistent with thrombus.
Right and left calf veins not clearly evaluated.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year-old woman presents with gallstone pancreatitis with peripancreatic fluid with concomitant pleural effusion which is likely an extension of abdominal cavity fluid.
Other active issues that the patient presented with are acute renal failure, LLE DVT, and abnormal UPEP.
hospital course: The patient arrived in respiratory distress and hypoxic [**12-26**] CHF and pleural effusion.
A thoracentesis was performed on [**2125-2-21**] and one liter of transudative fluid was aspirated.
CT scan performed and noted that her CBD was dilated, question if this is post-obstructive changes.
Patient also had truncal rash that was non pruritic, drug rash-like, but there is not a clear offending medication.
Acute renal failure did not resolve after hydration, renal was consulted and followed noted that this is ATN with uric acid crystals.
SPEP noted to have possible polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.
After being transferred to the floor, she became tachypneic, tachycardic with mild hypotension and thus was transferred to the trauma ICU.
She was intubated on [**3-7**] and cardioverted for rapid afib and started on pressors.
She required pressors for hypotension and amiodarone for paroxysmal afib.
She continued to have a significant vent requirement with high peep due to pulmonary edema.
She had CVVH until [**3-13**] due to continued renal failure.
She was maintained on multiple abx: aztreonam for pna, flagyl for empiric cdiff, and fluconazole.
The patient was relatively stable at the end of her hospitalization, but due to her significant illness and vent dependence and poor prognosis, she made the decision to come off of ventilator support on [**2125-3-21**].
Gallstone pancreatitis without abdominal pain: Post-pyloric feeding tube removed when patient demonstrated that she could eat orally without problem.
ERCP service  considered EUS to evaluate the pancreas parenchyma or ERCP to evaluate for retained gallstones but the patient was not clinically stable enough to undergo these procedures.
Shortness of breath [**12-26**] CHF, pleural effusion, and possible pneumonia.
S/p 1 liter aspiration of pleural effusion on [**2125-2-21**].
Pleural effusion likely to reaccumulate since thoracentesis.
Cytology on pleural fluid was negative for malignancy.
Acute kidney injury [**12-26**] non-oliguric ATN, likely secondary to pancreatitis.
She was started on CVVH in the TSICU due to uremia and acidosis.
The ventilator was detached on the night of [**2125-3-21**] and the patient soon passed away due to respiratory failure on [**2125-3-22**] at 1:40am.
The surgical team took over patient's care [**2125-3-4**] for further managment of her gallstone pancreatitis.
Due to a significant luekocytosis stool camples were sent for C difficile.
[**3-6**] In the Pm of [**3-6**] Patient had preogresive work of breathing.
Due  to increasing respiratory distress she was transferred to the ICU.
[**3-7**]: Patient continued to have worsening acidosis.hypotension responding to volume.
New onset rapid afib - became more hypotensive with lopressor.
Loaded with amio x 2 to no effect.
Worsening hypercarbia (39-55).
Hypotensive post intubation, requiring dual pressors.
With worsening acidosis and elevated Cr, temp HD line placed in case dialysis.
L central aline placed and put on [**Last Name (un) **] monitor.
Shocked for unstable afib - improved rate control.
Able to remove 1L o/n from CVVH and decrease neo requirement overnight.
TF held for high residuals despite reglan.
Pt with small amount TF suctioned from mouth, but no further episodes after manual drainage.
Repeat CT scan showing loculated pseudocyst collection to liver and increased in size.
Right HD catheter removed secondary to contamination, tip sent and blood sent from site, left subclavian discontinued secondary to erthyema.
Luekocystosis presumed to be secondary to h/o PNA during hospitalization, persistent leukocytosis likely from pancreatic and splenic artery compression, also Positive for MM in UPEP/SPEP with s/p bone marrow biopsy indicative of reactive (not malignant) bone marrow [**3-17**]: Petechial rash on forearms-heparin stopped in AM.
Started topical hydrocortisone and benadryl.
[**3-18**]: Derm to eval for skin lesions - biopsied.
[**3-20**]- rash back from  path = leukocytophilic vasculitis, sending vasculitis labs, family mtg held with ethics, no conclusion reached.
