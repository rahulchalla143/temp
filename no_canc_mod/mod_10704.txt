Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size with severe global dysfunction c/w diffuse process.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2156-5-26**] 9:05 AM FINDINGS: There is a tiny filling defect in a subsegmental artery within the right middle lobe (3:41 and 403B:46).
No other filling defects are seen.
There is no dissection.
There is bibasilar atelectasis with no evidence of aspiration pneumonia.
There is no hilar, axillary, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is a nodular soft tissue density within the left breast which measures 2.0 cm x 1.3 cm.
BONE WINDOWS: There is a slight anterior cortical deformity to the sternum, seen on the sagittal reformats.
Tiny filling defect within a subsegmental pulmonary artery in the right middle lobe.
This may represent a tiny pulmonary embolism.
Bibasilar atelectasis with no evidence of aspiration pneumonia.
Soft tissue density nodule in the left breast.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2156-5-27**] 7:37 AM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is no acute fracture.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
EEG Study Date of [**2156-5-24**] FINDINGS:  SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: No true interictal epileptiform discharges were seen; most of these were detections of somewhat sharply contoured background activity.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: No true electrographic seizures were seen.
Most of these were detections of particularly rhythmic periods of a slow background.
Selected review of the video demonstrated no apparent change in the patient's clinical status in association with these detections.
CONTINUOUS EEG MONITORING: Review of time sampled excerpts of continuous EEG recording demonstrated that the background was typically of very low voltage and very slow usually in the delta frequency range although occasional intermixed theta frequency activity was seen at times.
Bursts of generalized polymorphic delta frequency slowing and theta frequency slowing were also seen.
IMPRESSION: This video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
No electrographic seizures or interictal epileptiform discharges were seen.
The background was mostly slow and disorganized throughout the day's recording suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy.
EEG Study Date of [**2156-5-31**] FINDINGS: SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: These were artifactual; no true interictal epileptiform discharges were seen.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: These were artifactual; no true electrographic seizures were seen.
At times, blunted sharp wave morphologies were seen over the occipital regions, particularly on the left, and sometimes recurred in the theta frequency range particularly over the O1 electrode.
Selected review of the video demonstrated no apparent change in the patient's appearance in association with these periods of sharp blunted theta activity.
IMPRESSION: This video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
No electrographic seizures were seen.
There were some blunted sharp waves seen over the left occipital region sometimes recurrent in the theta frequency range for a few seconds at a time and these suggested a potential focus of epileptogenesis.
For most of the recording, the background was slightly slow and disorganized, suggestive of a mild encephalopathy.
Patient had positive cardiac enzymes which were likely elevated secondary to her cardiac arrest as opposed to primary ischemic event.
ECG did not demonstrate t-wave inversions, st-elevations, or signs of ischemia, or prolonged QT interval.
An echocardiogram was done that showed normal LA, LV, RV cavity size, mild regional LV dysfunction w/ akinesis of the distal half of the anterior wall and severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 25%).
Echo findings were thought to be secondary to post-cardiac arrest vs underlying cardiomyopathy.
Continous EEG did not show evidence of seizures.
Urine/Serum tox were remarkable for elevated ETOH levels.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation was seen, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was normal.
# Neuro / ETOH withdrawal: After extubation, patient went into delerium tremors, becoming very agitated with jerky movements though responsive throughout these episodes and autonomic dysfunction.
Neuro was re-consulted who placed continous EEG monitoring that showed background slowing suggestive of mild encephalopathy but no seizure activity.
# Infection: Pt began spiking fevers on [**5-26**] to 100.8, she was pancultured and sputum culture eventually revealed coag + staph aureus.
She copmleted an 8 day course for aspiration pneumonia.
She spiked fevers again on [**5-28**].
Her central line was removed and a PICC was placed, a course of vancomycin was started but discontinued after 8 days because pt pulled out PICC line and reinsertion of line posed a greater risk for infection than truncating vanco course.
Pt was afebrile for 48 hrs prior to discharge.

Secondary: Anoxic brain injury Alcohol withdrawal   Discharge Condition: Pt's chest pain is currently mild and controlled by Ibufprofen and Oxycodone.
You were admitted to the hospital because of cardiac arrest.
