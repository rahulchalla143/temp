MULTIPLE ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
[**2170-11-30**] STOOL    FECAL CULTURE: NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE: NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
[**2170-11-29**] Respiratory viral antigen screen: Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
[**2170-11-29**] Respiratory viral culture: No respiratory viruses isolated.
[**2170-11-29**] Urine culture: No growth [**2170-11-29**] Blood cultures x 2: No growth .
EKG [**2170-11-29**]: Ventricular paced rhythm with fused ventricular premature depolarizations in a bigeminal type pattern.
CXR (portable AP) [**2170-12-2**]: In comparison with the study of [**12-1**], there is little change in the appearance of the central catheter and pacemaker device.
Increasing bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacifications, which may reflect worsening pulmonary edema superimposed on multiple areas of consolidation.
Color-flow imaging of the interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this study.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Possible very small ASD or stretched PFO.
Moderately dilately and globally hypokinetic left ventricle.
Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
The severity of mitral regurgitation has increased and mild aortic stenosis is now present.
Portable CXR [**2170-11-29**]: A bedside upright radiograph of the chest excludes the right costophrenic angle from the field-of-view.
Pulmonary edema seen previously is improved.
There is no pneumothorax.
CT head w/o contrast [**2170-11-29**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses or mass effect.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are most likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
Hypodensities within the right basal ganglia are consistent with old lacunar infarcts, unchanged.
There is dense calcification of the carotid siphons and vertebral arteries bilaterally.
There is mild mucosal thickening of the frontal sinuses and ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage.
No acute intracranial process.
Due to noncompressible vessels, no ABIs could be calculated.
IMPRESSION: Moderate bilateral tibial artery occlusive disease.

# Shock: Patient initially presented with hypotension, acute kidney injury, and low urine output consistent with hypovolemic shock in the setting of significant diuresis.
He also likely had an element of septic shock given his fevers and leukocytosis.
It was felt that his sepsis was likely due to a pulmonary source due to his h/o ESBL klebsiella pneumonia and recent Stenotrophomonas.
He also had a low central venous O2 sat and was felt to have some component of cardiogenic shock as well.
He was initially given Levophed which was weaned succesfully with fluid resuscitation.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: He was not initially complaining of dyspnea while at home.
He is noted to have a 2L O2 requirement and is currently on room air.
# Cardiomyopathy with EF 15%: The patient had repeat TTE on admission that showed EF of 30%.
He had a head CT that showed no acute process.
# Acute kidney injury:  His recent baseline Cr 1.1 - 1.3 upon discharge on [**2170-12-7**].
Urine lytes performed in ED revealed a FeUrea of 26%, consistent with prerenal azotemia.
# COPD: Unknown recent PFTs or overall disease status.
# Anemia with baseline Hct 24: The patient was transfused 1 unit of blood during this stay for anemia and volume resuscitation.
# Adrenal insufficiency: He was given high-dose steroids for three days due to acute illness and then put back on his home steroid dose.
# H/o PE, on coumadin: He was continued on Coumadin, which was held due to elevated INR for a few days during this stay, but restarted prior to discharge.
# Hypertension:  His home antihypertensives were held initially due to hypotension.
Non-invasive arterial studies showed moderate bilateral tibial artery occlusive disease.

It was thought that you had a bad pneumonia and you were treated with antibiotics for this.
In addition, you were found to have acute on chronic heart failure.
Because of your heart failure, it is going to be very important to monitor your volume status and fluid intake and output.
