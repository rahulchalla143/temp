Admission Date: [**2137-4-3**]        Discharge Date: [**2137-4-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-7-1**]        Sex:  F  Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45-year-old female patient with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, morbid obesity and PTSD/depression who was transferred from an outside hospital with massive right-sided PE.
The patient was in her usual state of health until the day prior to admission when she experienced mild shortness of breath that she attributed to the heat and a flare in her asthma.
She awoke the next day feeling "odd" with heavy bilateral lower extremities that felt like "concrete blocks."
On regaining consciousness, she describes a feeling of fatigue and mild chest pressure.
She began to experience right-sided pleuritic chest pain [**4-1**] and worse with deep breathing.
D-dimer and troponin were noted to be elevated, and the patient was evaluated with a V/Q scan, which was notable for a massive high probability right-sided PE and 2 small subsegmental left-sided PEs.
In the emergency department, the patient complained of mild right shoulder/neck/chest pain.
She also had mild left calf pain that she attributed to her varicose veins.
She denied history of clots or oral contraceptive pills.
Mild asthma.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Morbid obesity.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of clotting disorders or cancer.
General: Morbidly obese woman, lying in bed, mildly dyspneic.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No guarding or rebound.
Extremities:  No calf tenderness or asymmetry.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  EKG, sinus tachycardia at 117 beats per minute.
No acute ischemic changes.
No evidence of P pulmonale.
Chest x-ray, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
The patient was evaluated with lower extremity noninvasives that were negative for DVTs.
An echocardiogram was performed, which was significant for RV pressure overload and preserved LV systolic function.
Given persistently subtherapeutic INRs, the patient was switched from a heparin drip to Lovenox for potential discharge.
While in the medical intensive care unit, the patient was noted to have a troponin leak in the setting of right heart strain from her submassive pulmonary emboli.
The patient complained of episodic chest pain throughout her stay on the general medical floor.
She described this chest pain has a "tightness" in her left chest.
An initial EKG taken during one of these episodes was significant for Q-wave inversions in the anterior leads that was considered likely secondary to lead placement.
The patient's cardiac enzymes trended down throughout her hospitalization, and her chest pain was considered likely secondary to a submassive pulmonary emboli.
The patient was evaluated with iron studies, which suggested an iron deficiency anemia.
Multiple discussions took place with the patient and case management regarding her fear of needles given her history of childhood trauma.
Posttraumatic stress disorder.
