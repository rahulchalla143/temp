The patient states that several months ago, he developed severe RUQ/epigastric pain which initially resolved after cholecystectomy.
Hoever, approximately two weeks after cholecystectomy he began having intermittent severe epigastric pain that at first lasted only a few minutes but began lasting longer up to five minutes.
He states that he would have these episodes approximately every two -three weeks, which occured only with meals and resolved with vomiting a small amount.
On the day prior to admission, the pain began after dinner, was more severe in intensity, lasted several hours and did not resolve with trying to vomit.
At [**Hospital3 **] hospital, labs were drawn showing elevated AST/ALT/ Alkphos and T bili 1.9.
Pain resolved by the time he arrived to inpatient floor.
He noted that while the pain is usually epigastric that he had tenderness on examination of his RUQ while at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.
He denies any CP, SOB, fever or chills, no N/V/D aside from tyring to vomit to releive pain.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) Study Date of [**2200-2-8**] 11:49 AM RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver somewhat echogenic, but without evidence of a focal liver lesion.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and the common bile duct measures 6 mm.
There is no evidence of stones, mass, or hydronephrosis.
Echogenic liver, may represent fatty infiltration or more advanced liver disease.
No intra- or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
There was some self limiting bleeding from the sphincterotomy site.
3cc of epinephrine were injected for hemostasis after placement of the stent.
Otherwise normal ercp to second part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 60083**] is an 81 year old male s/p cholecystectomy and SVT ablation who presented on [**2200-2-8**] with postprandial epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, hypotension, leukostasis and a dilated Common Bile Duct concerning for cholangitis.
Hospital course by problem:  # Cholangitis: The pt reported postprandial epigastric pain and on his admission labs had an elevated alk phos and tbili as well as a low grade fever and leukocytosis which were concerning for a biliary process and infection.
The official read of of right upper quadrant U/S and CT showed no abnormalities (eg no stones or duct dilation), however, re-evaluation of the pt's CBD by the ERCP fellow and radiology revealed a borderline dilated CBD at 8.9mm.
Patient remained clinically stable and afebrile through the rest of his hospital course.
# Troponin elevation: On admission EKG the pt had T wave inversions in leads III, AVF but there was no baseline EKG in the system for comparison.
In the absense of chest pain and in the setting of SVT ablation two days ago, it is likely that this represents injury from ablation rather than an acute myocardial infarction.
# SVT: Patient reported a history of tachycardias and bradycardias and on admission was s/p ablation two days prior.
# Traumatic foley attempt: On admission ED staff were unable to pass a foley and the pt had subsequent frank bleeding.
# Hyperlipidemia:  His statin was held in the setting of elevated LFTs and should be restarted as an outpatient.
