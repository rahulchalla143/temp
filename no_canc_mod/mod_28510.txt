He feels that she seemed to understand what he was saying to her; he asked her to get in the car, and she had no trouble walking to car, and even locked door on the way out.

Occasionally closed eyes when not being spoken to, but appeared alert, with somewhat poor eye contact when being addressed directly.
Eye movements are normal, with no nystagmus.
Facial movements are diminished, with no volitional mvmt of facial mms, did not protrude tongue - no obvious asymmetry.

In the superior division of the left MCA is an abrupt cut off of signal on time-of-flight images, suggesting stenosis from embolus to this vessel.
No evidence of aneurysm.Loss of signal in the superior division of the left MCA, likely from embolus to this vessel.
EEG: This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due  to the persistent left posterior quadrant slowing and left temporal rhythmic slowing.
This suggests left posterior quadrant subcortical dysfunction, while rhythmic left temporal slowing suggests a region of cortical irritability.
No epileptiform features were noted.
Surface echocardiogram:  No PFO/ASD seen.
Mild rheumatic mitral stenosis with moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
carotid US: Less than 40% stenosis of the proximal internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: Neurology: Patient admitted for known left frontal operculum stroke s/p IV TPA likely of cardioembolic etiology.
The patient had an EEG because of first presentation of global aphasia to rule out seizure (as outside CT scan showed no evidence of stroke).
Her EEg showed no epileptiform activity that would be concerning for seizure but showed some slowing over the area of the infarction site.
Her suface echocardiogram showed the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, with characteristic rheumatic deformity.
She had mild left atrial dialtion.
No thrombus, vegetations or PFO noted.
Patient was kept on telemetry during her hospital stay with no arrhythmias noted.
In terms of exam, it was clear patient had some dysfunction of facial muscles from stroke site which limited facial expression and ability to take oral foods.
She initially failed her swallow study but on follow-up testing with bedside swallow study and video swallow study, she was cleared for regular diet and thin fluids.
She improved in terms of her ability to produce speech but speaks with hypophonic voice, and has little spontaneous speech output.
She has history of muscle aches with statins.
Has mild right facial droop.
Mild right UMN pattern right arm weakness.
