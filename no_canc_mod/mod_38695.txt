# UTI:  As like previous admissions found to have recurrence of UTI with WBC of 30 on admission.
Broad spectrum ABx with vancomycin and cefepime were initiated until the urine cx was avaiable.
Urine cultures grew pseudomonas and citrobacter both sensitive to meropenem.
Pt also to follow up with Urology for further investigation of recurrent UTIs, and pathogens consistent with possible fecal contamination (ie rule out enterovesicular fistula).
Suggest placement of gauze over catheter during day to prevent possible external contamination by patient.
# Upper extremity swelling: Noted after placement of PICC.
# Multiple Sclerosis: c/b constipation and decreased respiratory drive.
# MS change: resolved with IVF and antibiotics.
Hyponantremia returned to baseline after IVF.
# Diarrhea: resolved.
