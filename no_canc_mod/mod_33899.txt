Admission Date:  [**2191-1-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-1-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2155-8-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Drug Allergy Information on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: LUQ pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: No major surgical/invasive procedures while at [**Hospital3 **].
History of Present Illness: 35F with history of IVDU, initially admitted to OSH on [**2191-1-21**], now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management of her septic shock, endocarditis, and GI bleeding.
This was negative, but she was called back to the hospital when CT read to have possible splenic hematoma.
She has since had a very complicated OSH course with diagnosis of 3 valve endocarditis, septic shock, and more recent GI bleeding.
Patient went to OR for ex-lap and bowel resection.
Past Medical History: - Intravenous drug use - heroin, ?others - Lumbar disc disease with protrusion - Congenital single kidney  Social History: - Tobacco: ~[**1-22**] PPD per patient at presentation.
sputum cx [**1-28**]: no growth.
Possible R lateral disc herniation L4-5 with disc bulging and protrusion.
?perforated mitral leaflet.
No abscess seen.
CT abd/pelvis [**2191-1-22**]: large multi locular lesion in spleen 10x0.6x0.8.
14 mm round low denisty L adrenal mass.
Trace free fluid in pelvis.
Small to mod bilateral effusions.
CT abd/pelvis [**2191-1-25**]: new decreased enhancement throughout liver - ?acute hepatic failure.
Increased free fluid in Abd/pelvis, appears simple.
splenic lesion unchanged (dictated at 10 x 9.2).
increased wall thickening in small bowel and colon.
CT head [**2191-1-29**]: presence of air fluid levels in paranasal sinuses.
otherwise no intracranial process.
CXR [**2191-1-30**]: L sided PICC line, ET and OGT, midl central congestion, L hemidiaphragm obscured from atelectasis and/or infiltrate plus small effusion.
Mild atelectasis and/or infiltrate at R base medially.
R sided atelectasis.
Bronch report [**2190-1-28**]: moderate amount of blood in R and L mainstem bronchi, seemed to be coming from RLL and LLL.
mucosa filled up with whitish thick plaques particularly at R mainstem bronchus (concern for herpetic infection).
EKG: sinus tach at 114, NANI, low voltage, poor RWP, nonspecific T wave flattening diffusely.
Brief Hospital Course: 35F with IVDU, congenital single kidney, presenting to OSH s/p fall with subsequent development of septic shock, endocarditis, multiple sites of bleeding, with transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management.
# Septic shock.
Source thought to be endocarditis, question of other ongoing infection.
Likely with multiple sites of embolic burden - splenic abscess, ?vertebral osteo per our radiologists, ?
intraabdominal abscess collection (though per descriptions more c/w endometriosis).
# BRBPR/anemia.
# Respiratory failure.
With significant AI and MR, at risk of acute CHF once positive pressure removed.
# Endocarditis.
No organism ever isolated as above.
Known high vegetation burden with significant valvular compromise.
No known abscesses.
# Altered mental status.
No known baseline insufficiency.
Likely ATN in setting of septic shock.
# Coagulopathy.
Likely DIC plus some bone marrow suppression from severe sepsis, plus synthetic dysfunction in setting of shock liver.
History of shock liver from profound hypotension at OSH.
# Splenic abscess.
