Pt states that yesterday she felt short of breath and lightheaded ("dizzy"- which was not the room spinning) when standing up.
Pt denies recent F/C/N.
Of note, per ED note, pt states that she did have chest pain.
She denies CP/SOB/ feeling lightheaded or dizzy.
She was diuresed and it was thought to be [**2-10**] increased BPs leading to pulmonary edema in setting of other pulmonary problems.
Past Medical History: s/p THR 22 years ago complicated by clot in leg s/p cataract surgery Back pain s/p corticosteroid injections PFTs [**8-13**]- FEv1- 52; FVC- 54%, FEV1/FVC 104.
Spirometry is consistent with a restrictive ventilatory defect as   demonstrated by the reduced TLC measured on [**2152-8-29**].
The   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis   is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral   valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is   severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Family History: No heart or lung disease in family.
EOMI; sclera anicteric; OP clear without exudate.
soft, nt, nd Back: No spinal, paraspinal, CVA tenderness Ext: Trace edema b/l.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Ground-glass opacities in the lung fields with smooth interlobular septal thickening, most likely represents pulmonary vascular congestion as well as pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.
Stable but continued enlargement of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes not significantly changed.
The etiology of this lymphadenopathy is unclear, however may be in part due to congestive heart failure.
Patchy peribronchial opacities in the right middle lobe may be infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta and coronary artery calcifications.
No evidence for congestive heart failure or infiltrate.
Stable right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, better seen on the chest CT done subsequent to this examination.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 83 yo female with severe pulmonary HTN, HTN, history of bilateral PE and recent admissions for CHF and PNA who presents with lightheadedness, found to be hypoxic.
Hypoxia: Normally on 2 L NC likely [**2-10**] severe pulmonary HTN; PFTs also showed a restrictive pattern.
In the MICU, she was ruled out for MI and PE.
Given her improvement on lasix and levaquin, we felt her symptoms were related to fluid overload and an underlying CAP.
She experienced no additional dizziness during her admission.
Renal failure: Chronic renal failure with cr baseline of 1.0.
Her renal failure was thought secondary to pre-renal azotemia.
This should be addressed as an outpatient for future potential admissions.
