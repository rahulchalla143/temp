Admission Date: [**2187-10-29**]        Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:  [**2135-10-28**]        Sex:  F  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 3761**] is a 52-year-old female who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] in hyperacute fulminant liver failure thought to be secondary to either Bactrim reaction versus acetaminophen toxicity.
She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit initially and became progressively obtunded, with significant encephalopathy requiring intubation and ventilatory support.
She became progressively more coagulopathic, and it was thought that she was most likely going to need orthotopic liver transplantation for survival.
She continued to receive aggressive cardiopulmonary support with again, as noted, full ventilatory support and vasopressor support for hypotension.
COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Neurologically, as noted above the patient required placement of an intracranial bolt for ICP monitoring.
This was managed with hyperventilation and usage of mannitol and hypertonic saline.
Over the course of the next 4-5 days as her liver function improved, her intracranial pressures decreased.
She had removal of her intracranial bolt on [**2187-11-6**], and it was noted on subsequent imaging that she had approximately a 4-cm, right frontal, intracranial hemorrhage.
This was followed serially with CT scans and there was no progression of the bleeding.
The bleeding was thought to be secondary to her severe coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia in the setting of her instrumentation.
She was moving her left upper extremity and her right lower extremity with 2/5 strength and had minimal movement in her right upper extremity and left lower extremity, not following the predicted neurologic pattern if this was a deficit associated with her intracranial bleeding.
In terms of her respiratory status, it is noted that the patient required full ventilatory support and was extubated on [**2187-11-12**].
She initially did well, but, secondary to what was thought to be pulmonary edema, required reintubation on [**2187-11-13**] after failure of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.
She had some degree of what appeared to be an ARDS-type reaction or transfusion- associated lung injury requiring high amounts of PEEP and oxygenation during the initial days of her intensive care unit stay.
This resolved over the course of the next several days with diuresis and supportive therapy.
The vasopressors were weaned by ICU day 6, and there was no further requirement for this.
There were no significant dysrhythmias.
The patient's transaminases were elevated; this was thought to be secondary to a possible mild ischemic pancreatitis which might have developed during her requirement for vasopressors.
She otherwise did not seem to be symptomatic for this and was tolerating tube feeds.
This volume overload was being managed with hemodialysis daily on an as-needed basis.
In terms of her ID issues, the patient was initially started on vancomycin for prophylaxis against intracranial infection with the bolt in place.
She developed a leukocytosis, and the thought was that she may have been developing pneumonia given the persistent difficulty oxygenating her.
Sputum cultures failed to evidence any pneumonic process, and these antibiotics were discontinued.
She evidenced a consumptive coagulopathy with significant destruction of platelets.
She also developed a significant anemia without any evidence of bleeding.
This was thought to be secondary to hemolysis in the face of an elevated indirect bilirubin and a depressed haptoglobin.
Her thrombocytopenia and anemia resolved by [**11-11**], and she no longer required any transfusion of any blood products.
At the present time, the patient is requiring intensive care for management of respiratory failure and renal failure.
She is no longer in need of liver transplantation, and therefore, given her primary medical issues, she will be transferred to the medical intensive care unit.
