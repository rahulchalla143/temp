History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 y/o female with a history of hiatal hernia who presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital late [**2151-7-17**] with severe chest and abdominal pain, with approximately 1.5 liters of coffee ground vomiting and hematemsis.
She underwent a CT of the chest, which showed a large portion of the stomach in the left chest.
She then underwent an EGD, which showed incarceration of the stomach without evidence of necrosis.
No thyromegaly.
CV: Irregularly irregular rhythm.
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Pertinent Results: [**2151-7-18**] Chest CT: intrathoracic stomach, colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
[**2151-7-19**] UGI series: Normal peristaltic esophageal contractions with an intrathoracic stomach, configuration consistent with gastric volvulus.
Lack of passage of contrast from the gastric lumen into the duodenum indicating hypomotility or a component of obstruction due to the known volvulus.
[**2151-7-23**] stomach pathology specimen: Fundic segment with focally prominent submucosal edema, vascular dilation and congestion, consistent with clinical history of gastric volvulus.
Overlying mucosa with focal and mild chronic, inactive inflammation; no intrinsic mucosal abnormalities otherwise recognized.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Atrial fibrillation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**2151-7-26**] BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION Pt presents without s/sx of prandial aspiration during today's evaluation.
These results do not rule out post-prandial issues such as aspiration of reflux.
Given documentation of mild-moderately ineffective esophageal motility, pt was educated on aspiration precautions including sitting fully upright while eating and remaining upright after meals.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as a direct admit for a question of gastric volvulus after she presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital late [**2151-7-17**] with severe chest and abdominal pain, with approximately 1.5 liters of coffee ground vomiting and hematemsis.
At [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital, she underwent a CT of the chest, which showed a large portion of the stomach in the left chest, and then underwent an EGD, which showed incarceration of the stomach without evidence of necrosis.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she had green bilious non-bloody fluid draining from her NGT, and was non-tender on exam with positive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants.
Given her stable status on admission, she was initially treated with nasogastric decompression and fluid resuscitation.
She underwent an upper GI series on [**2151-7-19**], revealing a configuration consistent with gastric volvulus with lack of passage of contrast from the gastric lumen into the duodenum, indicating hypomotility.
She underwent esophageal manometry on [**2151-7-21**], revealing mild to moderate ineffective esophageal motility.
An ECHO performed on [**2151-7-27**] showed low normal left ventricular systolic function, mild to moderate aortic regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation.
