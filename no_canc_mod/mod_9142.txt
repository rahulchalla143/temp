Admission Date:  [**2103-7-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2103-7-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2029-2-9**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old woman who has not sought medical treatment in many years and had a recent fall fracturing her right humerus and soon thereafter she was noted to have some irregular heart beat.
She took some medication of a neighbor who had a similar problem and ultimately went to be treated in the Emergency Department in [**State 108**] where the patient lived.
She was found at that time to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response in the 130s.
This spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm but she has had bouts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since that time.
At that time, echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated significant mitral valve prolapse with severe mitral regurgitation and a large ventriculoseptal defect with a left to right shunt.
She was also noted to have moderate to severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for at least two previous bouts of endocarditis, one in [**2050**] and one in [**2070**] which was treated with antibiotics with no sequelae.
She has also had three uneventful pregnancies and has not taken any medications regularly and has not had any medical treatment over the past 20 years or so.
The pacemaker was ultimately turned off the following morning and she was in normal sinus rhythm with first degree atrioventricular block.
On postoperative day #2 it was noted that the patient had significant thrombocytopenia, after being started on heparin.
On postoperative day #5, the patient was noted to have some atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate between 90 and 125.
The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm later that day and had had no subsequent atrial fibrillation while on the Lopressor and the Amiodarone.
She also had symptomatic shortness of breath.
The chest x-ray from the previous day revealed a significant left pleural effusion.
On [**7-17**], she underwent a thoracentesis for approximately 400 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
The subsequent chest x-ray showed decreased pleural effusion although some residual fluid remains with left lower lobe atelectasis and no pneumothorax noted.
Her heart rhythm is regular with no rub or murmur noted.
She has no peripheral edema.
8 hours prn pain Amiodarone 200 mg one p.o.
Mitral regurgitation 2.
Tricuspid regurgitation 3.
