She was found to have adult respiratory distress syndrome requiring paralytics persistent hypotension requiring pressors on several occasions; reportedly responsive to steroids.
She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals and developed acute renal failure secondary to amphotericin.
She required an insulin drip for glucose control.
Her persistent fevers led to a repeat bronchoscopy which grew herpes simplex virus.
She had episodes of pulmonary edema but related to volume resuscitation and tachycardia.
There, she was found to be hypoxic with a bradycardic arrest which responded to epinephrine, atropine, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Pyrimethamine for toxoplasmosis history and [**Month (only) **] for her herpes simplex virus infection were continued.
Ms. [**Known lastname 9302**] decreased neurologic status was felt to be quite concerning for anoxic brain injury.

The patient continued to have fevers during the last week of [**Month (only) 1096**].
Discussions continued with the family over the level of aggressiveness the patient would want; and in the meantime, metabolic abnormalities such as hyponatremia and anemia were addressed.

He stated at that time that he wished for [**Known firstname 9300**] to have no further procedures; including no lumbar puncture, new central venous access, arterial access, lung biopsy, or blood products.
Her husband was [**Name (NI) 653**] by the pulmonary fellow (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9303**]) and informed that the patient had a lethal blood infection which could only be treated by changing her central intravenous access.
