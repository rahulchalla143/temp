Pregnancy ultimately complicated by preterm labor.
Rupture of membranes was at the time of the delivery with clear fluid.
He was noted to have persistent cyanosis in the delivery room and was transported to the newborn intensive care with blow-by oxygen.
Skin: Smooth and pink, no lesions.
Respiratory: Very shallow breaths sounds, persistent grunting with moderate intercostal retractions.
Abdomen: Soft with active bowel sounds, no masses or distention shortly after delivery.
Patent anus, hips stable, clavicles intact, spine midline without dimples or hair [**Hospital1 **].
RESPIRATORY: The infant was admitted to the newborn     intensive care unit for respiratory distress and     cyanosis.
A chest x-ray was done at that time and showed good     lung expansion with mild perihilar streakiness.
He     remained on CPAP until about mid-day on day of life 1,     at which time he was weaned to room air and found to be     comfortable with respiratory rates 40s-60s in room air,     all respiratory distress subsiding.
At time of transfer,     he was in room air with respiratory rates in the 40s-60s     range, no grunting, flaring or retracting and breath     sounds clear and equal.
Heart rate ranged from     120-140, and no fluid boluses or pressors needed for     blood pressure support.
GI: On day of life 2, it was noted that the infant had a     distended and mildly tender abdomen.
A KUB was     performed and showed distended loops of bowel diffusely     throughout his abdomen and no gas in the rectal segment.
To [**Hospital3 1810**] for barium enema and possible admission to 7-North for evaluation for lower GI obstruction or possible Hirschsprung's.
Medications: Infant upon admission to the NICU was     placed on ampicillin and gentamicin for rule out sepsis     given his respiratory distress.
Also of note, given the infant's undescended testicles, an abdominal ultrasound was performed on [**11-10**] to try and identify testicles in the inguinal canals or the abdomen.
No testicles were identified at that time.
