Pt states that he woke up morning of admission with complaint of substernal chest pain radiating to his right jaw and bilateral upper and lower extremity tingling sensation, [**6-6**] in intensity, unrelated to exertion, and lasting for approximately 6 hrs.
Patient denies ever having this type of pain before.
States symptoms with last MI in [**2157**] were more agitation (reports wandering around the hospital, very agitated).
ROS on admission: increased night sweats x 2 days, HA at back of head x 2 days intermittent with no n/v/photophobia but completely resolved today, increased yellow drainage from right nostril x 1 wk, no increased cough, no abd pain, no diarrhea.
Pt states these symptoms are not typical of his PCP infections since he usually feels sob and cough with clear sputum.
Pt remained hypotensive with SBP as low as 75/36 and lactate returned back at 4.0.
Given concern for sepsis, RIJ sepsis CVL was placed, pt was given Vancomycin 1 gm IV and Levofloxacin 500 mg IV as well as ASA 325 mg, Decadron 6 mg IV x1, 4 L IVF, and Levophed started for hypotension.
EKG showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations inferiorly - cardiology was consulted who felt that pt's EKG was similar to a previous EKG when pt had been septic.

Imaging: [**2163-2-25**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: Improving left upper lobe pneumonia.
[**2163-2-26**] ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed one vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery was without angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease.
The left anterior descending artery was without angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease in the proximal, mid, and distal vessel.
The left circumflex artery was without angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease in the proximal, mid, and distal vessel.
There was a 80% mid-RCA in-stent restenosis with extensive intracoronary thrombus (organized) proximal to the stenosis and throughout the PDA suggestive of spontaneous distal embolization.
Successful stenting of the RCA with a 3.5 mm Vision stent, post-dilated to 4.0 mm.
Increase in interval opacification within the right middle and right lower lobe, and relatively unchanged opacification within the left lower lobe.
These findings could represent progressive infectious etiology.
Increased opacification within the left upper lobe adjacent to left hilar mass also appears more consolidated, which also could represent infectious process.
Difficult to rule out pulmonary hemorrhage within these regions, given similar appearance to pneumonia.
However, no markedly fluid collections are noted throughout the lung parenchyma.
Right simple renal cyst.
Abnormal femoral head, chronic, unchanged.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent old trauma or old avascular necrosis as mentioned previously.
Interval development of bilateral infrahilar patchy opacities concerning for developing infectious process.
Left upper lobe pneumonia, unchanged.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2163-3-7**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in multifocal pneumonia of the mid and lower lung zones.
Persistent obstruction of left upper lobe apicoposterior segment bronchus.
Correlation with bronchoscopy is suggested to exclude neoplastic mass.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 15225**] is a 42 year old man with HIV/AIDS (CD4 count of 1) status post recent hospitalization for PCP pneumonia, history of multiple opportunistic infections in the past including disseminated MAC, cerebral MAC, chest wall HSV, many PCP pneumonia infections, presented with fevers, chest pain, elevated lactate, hypotension concerning for sepsis but also with EKG changes and positive cardiac enzymes.
Initially on presentation, patient had evidence of both sepsis (hypotension, fevers, elevated WBC with left shift) and of myocardial infarction with chest pain and positive cardiac enzymes .
There he was transiently on levophed for blood pressure control, but that was quickly weaned off with IV fluid hydration.
Sepsis/infectious disease issues:  As stated above, patient was thought to be septic based on initial presentation, had numerous cultures sent, including checking for opportunistic infections, and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Given his CXR findings throughout hospital course, it was thought that he likely had a pulmonic source of his infection.
Patient was started on zosyn transiently for episode of decreased O2 saturation, associated with hemoptysis (see below) to cover empirically for aspiration pneumonia.
However, he did not show further signs of infection and his decreased O2 saturation could be explained by other causes (see below) so his zosyn was discontinued.
The patient clinically improved throughout hospital course without further fever spikes, WBC remained low, no further episodes of hypotension.
He was discharged on no further antibiotics and prednisone taper to treat his pulmonary status.
Shortness of breath/hemoptysis:  The patient's infectious course was complicated by hemoptysis and decreased O2 saturation following his cardiac catheterization for his myocardial infarction (see below).
This was of unclear etiology initially, with thoughts of perhaps a recurrent pneumonia vs bleeding of an underlying pneumonia due to his anticoagulation post-cath.
Via extensive work up including repeat cultures, CXR, sputum cultures, and pulmonary consultation, it was believed that the likely scenario was that the patient had an endo-bronchial lesion (seen on previous bronchoscopy which biopsy was consistent with PCP) that likely began to bleed with his post-cath anticoagulation, and this bleeding caused is decreased oxygen saturation.
These symptoms of Shortness of breath and hemoptysis resolved on their own as he was able to come off anticoagulation (integrilin, heparin once coumadin was therapeutic).
Anemia:  The patient had an associated drop of his hematocrit with the hemoptysis experienced above.
This required a number of blood transfusions to keep his hematocrit [**Last Name (un) 15355**] above 28 given his coronary artery disease.
Work up of this Hct drop included chest/abd/pelvis CT scan to rule out a bleed, as the patient had just undergone cardiac catheterization, and therefore there was concern for retroperitoneal bleed.
Therefore, the likely explanation was that his Hct drop was due to his hemoptysis described above.
Cardiac/Myocardial infarction:  As stated above, the patient presented with chest pain and ruled in for a myocardial infarction.
The patient dose have a history of CAD (1VD on cardiac cath in [**2157**], s/p MI in [**2157**] with stent to RCA, thought possibly secondary to his lupus anti-coagulant).
Post-cath complications only hemoptysis as above.
He otherwise remained cardiologically stable throughout hospital course, without recurrent episodes of chest pain.
Diarrhea:  Patient had acute onset of copius, watery diarrhea during hospital course.
He had C diff and stool cultures sent off which were negative.
He was transiently empirically started on PO flagyl, which was discontinued once he ruled out for c diff.
HIV/AIDS:  The patient was kept on his outpatient regimen of HAART therapy along with his outpatient prophylactic medications:  Cipro, Azithromycin, and ethambutol for MAC ppx, acyclovir for HSV prophylaxis.
However, he was discharged on atovaquone prophylaxis and steroid taper.
Lupus anticoagulant:  Patient has a known history of lupus anticoagulant with history of DVT/PE last in ?[**2157**].
Also had IMI in [**2157**] with RCA stent placed (as above) that was thought possibly secondary to his hypercoaguable state.
# Renal insufficiency:  Patient has a history of mild renal insufficiency, baseline Cr difficult to assess, but ?1.1-1.7.
# Neuropathy:  Has severe neuropathy secondary to HIV.
