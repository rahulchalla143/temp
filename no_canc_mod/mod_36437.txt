Upon admission, she was made NPO, given intravenous fluids, and underwent radiographic imaging.
She was reported to have a  comminuted fracture of the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] with note of an extraperitoneal hematoma.
Because of these findings, she underwent a pelvic angiogram which was negative for extravasation and she required no embolization.

She is tolerating a regular diet and voiding without difficulty.
