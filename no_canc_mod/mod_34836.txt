Prior inferior wall myocardial infarction of undetermined age.
Poor R wave progression - consider prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction versus normal variant.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2177-8-28**] criteria for possible prior inferior wall myocardial infarction are seen as there are now probable Q waves in lead aVF.

Myocardial infarction.
Shortness of breath.
Coronary artery disease.
Left ventricular function.
Right ventricular function.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions Prebypass  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed(LVEF45%).
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
At around 1345 hours the patient was ischemic and it was associated with hypokinesia of the anterior, septal and anteroseptal walls.
The anterior septum and septum are still mildly hypokinetic.
Trivial mitral regurgitation.
Electronically signed by [**Name6 (MD) 1509**] [**Name8 (MD) 1510**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2177-8-29**] 15:37     Brief Hospital Course: Presented for cardiac catherization and was found to have coronary artery disease.
He had bronchoscopy post operatively for collapse and prolonged intubation due to hypoxia requiring increased peep.
He developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and lopressor with rate control.
