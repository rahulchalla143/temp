No new hemorrhage seen.
Slightly suboptimal opacification of the vascular structures is seen.
There is no evidence of an aneurysm, vascular occlusion, or stenosis identified.
3D reformatted images appear normal.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage at the convexity sulci.
Mild soft tissue swelling in the parietal soft tissues.
CT angiography demonstrate no evidence of vascular occlusion, stenosis, or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size, although the opacification of the vascular structures is somewhat suboptimal.
Head CT [**9-27**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the inferior right frontal lobe (2A:11) are not changed.
Also there is possible tiny hyperdensity along the right superior convexity (2A: 24), which could just represent normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter or could represent a tiny additional focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage; the former is favored as there is slight streak artifact in this region.
High density along the left parafalcine frontal region has a very straight linear configuration and could be artifactual or could represent a tiny additional focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No definite new large intraparenchymal hemorrhage is seen, nor shift of normally midline structures, effacement of the basal cisterns, hydrocephalus, or large vascular territorial infarction.
Again note is made of subgaleal hematoma along the left parietal scalp.
Also, there may be non-displaced fracture along the right frontal bone (2A:27).
IMPRESSION: Inferior right frontal small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage are as before.
Possible additional foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the superior convexity bilaterally are small and could be artifactual.
No definite substantial change.
ATTENDING NOTE: No change.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after sustaining a closed head injury after falling from a ladder at home.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
Lisinopril 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for HTN.

Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
