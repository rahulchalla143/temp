Admission Date:  [**2152-11-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2152-11-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2134-6-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Neurosurgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 18 year old with a history of a skiing accident and weakness of the right lower extremity on [**2152-11-15**], transferred from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 26522**] Center.
He fell while skiing on moguls on [**11-15**], with epistaxis times two and loss of consciousness and generalized tonic/clonic seizure at the site.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was not able to move his right leg and was found to have a weakness in the right lower extremity and complained of pain in the back and right side of the abdomen and flank area.
He was found to have a T9 burst fracture and he was put in the steroid protocol with log-rolling precautions.
ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.
Diffuse minimally tender; no localized tenderness.
Spine:  No stepoff.
Tenderness over the spine.
Pupils were 6 mm and reactive bilaterally.
He had a repeat MRI scan and thin-cut CT scan which demonstrate a right lateral T9 fracture involving the right posterior lateral vertebral body and pedicle without significant displacement of fracture fragments.
There is minimal retropulsion into the ventral epidural space.
There is narrow edema at the T8, T9 vertebral bodies, but minimal, less than 15% loss of height.
Inversion recovery sequences demonstrate mild increased T2 signal in the dorsal paraspinal muscles without compelling evidence of significant ligamentous disruption.
There is a focal area of myelomalacia and increased T2 signal at the T9 level.
Radiographically, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] feels that this represents a stable fracture with low risk of progressive kyphosis if managed with TLSO brace.
Therefore, the patient was out of bed with Physical Therapy and the TLSO brace and was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and found to require acute rehabilitation.
He had his Foley catheter discontinued on [**2152-11-23**], and was voiding spontaneously without difficulty.
He has been afebrile throughout his hospital stay.
