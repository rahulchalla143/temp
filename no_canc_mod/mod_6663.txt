Admission Date:  [**2166-6-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-7-6**]   Service:  NEUROLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 82 year old woman with hypertension and past transient ischemic attacks who was found on the floor of the bathroom alert but confused (usually oriented), in stool.
The patient denies having any hearing problems at this time.
Myocardial infarction.
Status post transient ischemic attack.
Status post hip fracture.
Mild dementia.
History of obsessive compulsive disorder and depression.
History of thyroid surgery.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
The patient is perseverative and uses words in her own new context; for example, when asked to repeat "teach, truth, chair", the patient repeated "teach" several times instead, "I ate a peach yesterday" (the previous question was "what did you do yesterday".
Cranial nerves:  Fundi could not be visualized secondary to poor cooperation and ptosis bilaterally.
Extraocular muscles are difficult to test secondary to gaze preference.
The patient could identify light touch on left, but did have extinction to bilateral stimulation.
Initially her motor examination showed decreased tone on the left.
HL four plus out of five, however, the patient deteriorated towards the end to the day and became completely hemiplegic on the left.
Sensation with positive withdrawal briskly to pain on the left.
Positive anesthesia to left pinprick in upper and lower extremities; also to light touch.
Head CT scan showed a right thalamic bleed with some intraventricular hemorrhage; no mass effect.
MRI showed right thalamic hemorrhage with considerable susceptibility abnormality but very little alteration and signal in T1 and T2 sequences consistent with recent hemorrhagic containing largely deoxy hemoglobin.
There is a slight increase in the basic edema surrounding the hematoma as compared to the CT scan and very slight displacement of the right lateral ventricles superiorly.
There is no evidence of extraocular lesion or fluid collection.
Diffusion weighted images did not show areas of particulate effusion beyond the marked hematoma.
On susceptibility sequence, there was several other very tiny foci of susceptibility noted within the parenchyma of the inferior cerebellum and of the cerebrum, especially on the right side.
This would raise the question of angiography possibly if the lesions are small cavernomas.
MRI of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] showed no evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormalities.
The patient remained stable from a neurologic standpoint while in the Intensive Care Unit, and in fact, made dramatic improvements since becoming more alert, in that her left sided neglect is improved and right gaze preference is decreasing.
The patient was noted, however, to become quite agitated at several points while in the Intensive Care Unit and was hallucinating as well.
A urinalysis was sent and was positive for urinary tract infection.
The patient had profound left neglect and left hemiplegia on the day of admission, however, by the date of discharge, the left neglect was very much decreased.
The patient continued to have difficulty with orientation as well as with recalling the reason why she was in the hospital; however, the patient did remain fluent in speech and on her left side, her leg and arm began to move very minimally, however, the left arm remained weaker than the left leg.
Right thalamic hemorrhage.
Urinary tract infection.
