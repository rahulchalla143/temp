Admission Date:  [**2199-8-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2199-8-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2143-10-8**]     Sex:  F  Service:  GREEN SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of multiple ventral hernia repairs, the latest being on [**2199-6-15**], who presents to the Emergency Room today with diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and fever.
Her abdominal wound was opened secondary to intermittent serous drainage and mild scattered erythema.
At present, she has no complaints of chest or abdominal pain.
Patient has also had some loose stoo since last night.
Multiple mesh ventral hernia repairs, last one being [**2199-6-15**], with prior panniculectomy.
Liver hemangioma resection.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Her heart examination is regular, rate, and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen is soft with mild to moderate right upper quadrant tenderness distinct from her incisional wound on the right mid abdomen.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a stable appearance of a fatty infiltrated liver with no abscesses in either the peritoneal cavity or the abdominal wall.
It also showed some stranding and soft tissue thickening adjacent to the skin defect in the right anterior abdominal wall without any associated abscess.
There is some evidence of diverticulosis and inguinal hernia on the right that was nonobstructive.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the floor for apparent sepsis without any localizing source.
On hospital day one, [**2199-8-13**], patient was admitted to the SICU with hypotension of 70s-80s systolic blood pressure.
Patient has had chronic right upper quadrant abdominal wound for multiple hernia repairs.
She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, congestion, or any blood in her bowel movements.
She also denies any stiff neck, photophobia, rash, numbness, weakness, or tingling.
She also denies any dysuria, hematuria, or frequency.
On admission to the SICU, the patient was hypotension with minimal response with fluids.
Infectious Disease was consulted and requested hepatitis serology as well as blood and stool cultures which were sent.
Patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction by electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes.
She had a liver and a gallbladder ultrasound done on [**8-14**] that was negative.
She had intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter that was self limiting.
They suggested that the LFT pattern was suggestive of sepsis of unknown etiology.
The surgical service felt that an episode of self-limiting cholangitis, given the RUQ pain, unclear source of sepsis, and previous major liver resection, was equally plausible.
She had no complaints of pain and was afebrile.
She had no other episodes of hypotension.
Patient's abdominal wound continued to be changed twice a day on the floor with Dakin solution.
