Admission Date:  [**2176-8-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-8-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-7-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Epinephrine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: transferred from OSH for [**First Name3 (LF) **]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac cath pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: The pt is a 81 yo F w/ ho of HTN, hyperlipidemia, no CAD, ?TIA presented to the OSH after developing SSCP and dizziness this am, found to have inferior lateral [**First Name3 (LF) **] with tropinin of 11.1 transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Pt developed an episode, without any radiation, N/V/Diapheresis three days prior to admission when temp was about 100F, resolved spontaneously thought was heat related.
She has subsequently been doing until late this morning after breakfast, when she felt dizzy, per pt no chest pain at the time, fell to the floor and remained there for some time.
per daughter, she found her on the floor, diaphoretic, but alert, no nausea and vomiting, complaining of a sudden onset of [**7-15**] SSCP, no radiation at the time, and no N/V, called EMS.
EMS gave her sl nitroglycerin for CP ([**10-15**]) enroute to OSH ([**Hospital3 **]), not relieved.
At the OSH [**Name (NI) **], pt had EKG showed ST elevation in inferior lateral leads (II, III, aVF, V5, V6) and corresponding ST depression in V1 V2, right sided ECG not showing ST elevation in V4R.
Pt was started on integrllin, heparin, but was D/C'ed when pt developed acute onset of L sided hemiparesis (arm and leg only), no change in speech or MS, spontaneously resolved after 1-2 hrs, head CT negative.
At the time of the cath, PCW mean 26, PA mean 22, PA (36/23) mean 28, RV (34/22) end 24, HR 75-77, CI 1.76, given equalization of filling pressure across the [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] worrisome for found tamponade, echo was done which showed moderate size pericardial effusion.
Patient underwent a fluoro guided pericardiocentesis with peridcardial pressure of 20mmHg, localized effusion with 150cc of bloody drainage with Hct of 34) worrisome for pericarditis vs localized sealed myocardial rupture.
She was back onto the CCU floor, type and crossed 6 units of blood and off pressors, put on ASA, plavix 75mg x 12 months, echo in 1 hour showed minimal effusion localized to RV (total output ~100cc), keep SBP<110 given likely rupture, hemodynamic monitoring with A-line and PA.   Past Medical History: HTN Hyperlipidima ?TIAs Asthma bronchitis (recent excerbation two weeks ago, was on levaquin x 7 days, and steroids x 2weeks, last dose three days prior) Glaucoma osteoprosis h/o TB in [**2120**]'s treated Reflux s/p slasky's ring dilation   Social History: Lives with one of her daughters, former nurse, still works at store (cashier), widowed (2 daughters), no smoking (but a lot of second hand smoking from husband), no ETOH or drugs   Family History: + CAD, +DM   Physical Exam: Admission:  Vitals: T 94.6, BP 94/51, HR 88, RR 21, 98% on 4L, Ht 5'1'', 130lbs Gnl: NAD, Alert and oriented x 3 HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, MM slightly dry, OP clear, JVP difficult to assess.
CV: RRR, Normal S1 + S2, no m/r/g, distant heart sounds; 1+ femoral, carotid, dP, Pt pulses bilaterally Resp: mild bibasilar crackles Abd: Soft, Nontender, NABS, No hepatosplenomegaly Extremities: 1+ pulses bilaterally, cool mottled skin, no c/c/e Neuro: A&O x 3, CN II-XII WNL, strenth 5-/5 thoughout, no focal neural signs.
ECG ([**2176-8-10**]): ST at 106, Left axis deviation, ST elevation 2mm at II, III, AvF, V5, V6, ST depression V1-V2, q waves II, III, AVF; Right sided ECG: decreased voltage v4-V6 .
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant sytem with three vessel coronary artery disease.
LMCA had mild disease.
The lAD had sequential 80% lesions in the proximal and mid vessel.
LCX had an ostial 60% lesion and diffused 70% OM1 diseease.
The RCA had moderate proximal disease and 90% mid vessel lesion.
Hemodynamic assessment showed elevated and equalised RA pressure, RVEDP and PCWP at 23 mm Hg.
There was 15 mm Hg pulsus on aortic pressure tracing.
4. the RCA lesion was predilated with a 2.0 balloon and stented with two overlapping 3.0 Cypher stents with lesion reduction from 90 to 0%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection and no embolisation.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection or embolisation.
The moderate pericardial effusion was drained with improvement of her hemodynamic status.
Echo ([**2176-8-12**]): Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel  CAD.
Prominent anterior fat pad (vs. hemorrhagic effusion without hemodynamic compromise).
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Carotid Doppler ([**2176-8-14**]): Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

[**Month/Day/Year **]/pericardial effsuion/hypotension - IMI with posterior extension s/p cath (three vessel disease, LAD 80% stenosis not intervened, 50-60% proximal Lcx, 70% OM1, occluded OM2 stented, mid RCA 90% stenotic, stent placed), possible small rupture causing tamponade s/p 150cc bloody pericardial drainage, likely causing cardiogenic shock.
Per instructions from placing attending, no saline or heparin flush started, as hoping not to dislodge clot and that effusion no longer collecting.
Echo on [**8-12**] to measure for effusion will help to evaluate whether the pressure equalizing is due to volume overload or reaccumulation of fluid, which showed 1 cm pericardial effusion: appears stable, more likely due to fluid overload.
On [**2176-8-15**], her A-line was pulled, and her bblock was converted to atenolol 25' and her ACEI was converted to lisinopril 5mg', she was called out to the step down unit, and continued to do well without symptoms of SOB, chest pain, or dizziness.
Tachycardia: Patient developed atrial bigeminy on the night of [**8-11**], and the morning of [**8-12**] at roughly at 730am developed tachycardia to 140s.
Tachycardia likely secondary either to post MI fluid overload or irritation from pericardial effusion.
She was given lasix IV prn for fluid overload and kept her on lopressor PO 12.5 tid which was converted to atenolol 25mg PO qday for rate control.
Her tachycardia resolved after diuresis and increased bblock dosage and her HR has been mainly in the 70-80's since [**8-14**].
SOB: Patient tend to be short of breath in the morning.
Likely her underlying COPD.
We continued advair and atrovent nebs PRN and diuresed her prn to prevent fluid overload.
Hyperlipidemia - Her lipid panel showed Triglyc-86 HDL-57 CHOL/HD-2.7 LDLcalc-82; we initially increased her statin from 10->80mg s/p [**Name (NI) **], pt unable to tolerate it, went back to 20mg PO qday which she was able to tolerate.
Glaucoma- continued her xalatan eye drops .
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5-500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for pain: hold for oversedation or RR<12.

If you stop taking these medications even for one day, you are at high risk for having your stent close off and causing a heart attack.
If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath or fevers, or any other serious medical conditions, please go to the emergency room immediately .
