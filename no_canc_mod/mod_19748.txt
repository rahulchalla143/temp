He recently underwent stress testing with was positive for ischemia.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 **] showed severe two vessel coronary artery disease.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Moderate mitral regurgitation persists.
[**2109-6-25**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound There is a widely patent right internal carotid artery and a widely patent left internal carotid artery with antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
[**2109-6-25**] Right Groin Ultrasound There is a hematoma in the right groin with a maximum diameter of 6.15 cm but no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula seen.
Large retroperitoneal hematoma mildly decreased in size extending from the right inguinal ring to the posterior pararenal space.
A small amount of hematoma tracks into the pelvis.
There is likely a small stone in the distal common bile duct.
Hyperdense lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney possibly representing a hyperdense cyst.
[**2109-7-8**] CXR Small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax is unchanged in size with apical visceral pleural line below the fourth posterior rib level.
Bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions also appear similar allowing for technical differences.
Subcutaneous emphysema in left chest wall has slightly improved.
Workup was notable for elevated liver enzymes for which an abdominal ultrasound was obtained.
This showed mild gallbladder wall thickening but no additional evidence to suggest acute cholecystitis.
A subsequent CT scan revealed cholelithiasis but no evidence of cholecystitis.
There was evidence of biliary obstruction secondary to a small stone in the distal common bile duct, however, over the next few days, his liver enzymes improved.
Cardiac enzymes on admission were also slightly elevated, but continued to trend downward.
He otherwise remained pain free on intravenous Heparin.
Due to a worsening hematoma at his catheterization site with increase complaints of pain, a CT scan was obtained which revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma.
Arterial ultrasound found no evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
Due to a gradual drop in hematocrit associated with some hypotension, several units of packed red blood cells were transfused over several days to maintain his hematocrit near 30%.
He continued to remain pain free on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery.
He required additional units of red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
He experienced bouts of atrial fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone and beta blockade.
A swallow study was performed as Mr. [**Known lastname 72912**] had some difficulty swallowing pills and coughing with thin liquids.
No evidence of aspiration was noted and he was cleared for a regular diet.
He developed rapid atrial fibrillation with hypotension and was readmitted to the intensive care unit.
Thoracentesis was attempted for a right pleural effusion however no fluid was removed and Mr. [**Known lastname 72912**] developed a small pneumothorax.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
