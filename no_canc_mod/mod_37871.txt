Admission Date:  [**2152-9-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2152-10-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2096-10-16**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 55 year-old male with a history of rheumatic heart disease status post AVR, MVR and also a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, atrial fibrillation, hepatitis C, and cirrhosis who presents with fever and change in mental status.
Patient was in his usual state of health until about three weeks prior to admission when he had a respiratory infection with a cough, sore throat.
Complained of fever and chills.
This resolved in four days, however, four or five days prior to admission patient then developed chest congestion with cough productive of yellow sputum.
The patient was noted by his wife to have decreased mental status.
He was incoherent and non-communicative, coughing and retching.
On the way to the hospital the patient was incontinent of urine and became combative and incoherent.
Per the patient's wife, the patient had been complaining of a diffuse abdominal pain for the last couple of days.
Remarkable for rheumatic heart disease, status post AVR and MVR in [**2146**].
Coronary artery disease status post two vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2146**].
Postoperative course was complicated by a sternal wound infection.
MSSA bacteremia in [**2148**] that was treated as an endovascular infection.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Hepatitis C, status post Ribavirin and treatment, which has unfortunately advanced to cirrhosis.
Ventral hernia and has Grade I - II esophageal varices on most recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2150**].
[**Name (NI) **] wife denies any history of intravenous drug use.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Patient had mildly icteric conjunctivae.
His oropharynx is clear with no erythema.
His neck had no lymphadenopathy and there was no noted jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular exam regular rate with mechanical S1, S2, no murmurs were appreciated.
Abdominal exam was remarkable for mild distention but soft and mild diffuse tenderness that did not localize.
Patient was noted to have hepatosplenomegaly and a ventral hernia.
No splinter hemorrhages or [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions were noted.
Neurologic:  The patient was oriented only to name but had no obvious focal neurologic deficits and no noted asterixis.
Chemistries were remarkable for a BUN and creatinine of 31 and 1.8, the 1.8 is elevated from the patient's usual baseline creatinine of 01.0.
Urinalysis was nitrite positive with a trace of protein, glucose and ketone negative.
A small bilirubin, 11 - 20 red blood cells, no white blood cells.
Gram stain was negative for PMNs and no microorganisms were noted.
EKG:  Showed normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation otherwise unremarkable.
Patient had a head CT Scan which showed no acute intracranial processes.
Chest x-ray showed no gross infiltrate or effusions.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed no fluid or abscess throughout the gallbladder.
In short this is a 55 year-old male with rheumatic heart disease, status post AVR, MVR, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and HCV cirrhosis who presented with fever, mental status changes prior to admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE: 1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE - because of the patient's previous history of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and his mechanical valves, suspicion of endocarditis was quite high in this patient.
Four out of four bottles of which grew coag positive Staphylococcus aureus was later identified as being methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
Patient had a TEE the day after admission which showed no evidence of valvular abscess or endocarditis.
Patient had multiple blood cultures over the course of this hospital stay all of which remained negative after the initially positive blood culture on the 5th.
Patient also had a bone scan to rule out osteomyelitis.
Because no source was located on this patient for his bacteremia, the patient was treated with oxacillin for presumed endovascular infection.
Patient will complete a six week course of antibiotics for his staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
GASTROINTESTINAL - patient had a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis with a history of Grade I and II varices on his previous esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2150**].
Patient had an occult positive blood stool after transfer to the floor.
After initial drop in hematocrit from 41 to the low 30's the patient's hematocrit stabilized in the range of 30 - 31.
Thus it was felt that there was no need at this time for esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy to evaluate the occult blood.
Patient had later stools during his hospitalization that were occult blood negative.
Thus it seems likely that the cause of his occult blood was nasal trauma secondary to nasogastric tube insertion.
His belly was much more distended than on arrival after fluid boluses for previous episodes of hypotension and hydration secondary to fever.
Patient had a brisk diuresis which was limited by an increase in the creatinine.
Patient developed abdominal pain in the setting of ascites which was localized to his right lower quadrant near McBurney's point.
Patient had no rebound tenderness, however, because of his profound tenderness a CT Scan was obtained to rule out acute appendicitis.
CT Scan showed no evidence of acute appendicitis but did raise the possibility of diverticulitis thus patient was started levo and Flagyl to treat a presumed diverticulitis.
The red blood cell count was likely due to traumatic tap.
Additionally patient had a gram stain of his peritoneal fluid which showed no organisms.
HEMATOLOGY - patient had a hematocrit that was stable in the range of 30 - 31 after his initial drop with hydration from 41 - 31.
Following his therapeutic paracentesis, the patient developed a sizable hematoma on his right flank as well as a two point drop in hematocrit.
Patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout the rest of the course of his admission and his hematoma did not expand further beyond the borders initially marked.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of coronary artery disease.
The patient did develop some demand ischemia and a troponin leak secondary to rapid atrial fibrillation which he developed during his hospital course.
The troponin leak resolved once his rate was returned to within normal limits.
Pump wise, this patient has a normal ejection fraction, however, he did have some question of failure when he developed rapid atrial fibrillation likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
Patient responded well to diuresis and had no further signs of failure or shortness of breath once his heart rate was controlled.
Rhythm wise, the patient had been in sinus on admission, however, during his hospital course he suddenly developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response up to the 200's.
He had no initial response to Lopressor thus he was started on a diltiazem drip and transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 19024**] more intense monitoring.
This was done, however, patient became hypotensive several hours after being given his beta blocker and required fluid boluses and transient dopamine for which he was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit overnight.
PULMONARY - patient had adequate O2 saturations during his admission but did have a history of using Advair and several times during admission he was noted to have bilateral wheezing.
NEUROLOGICALLY:  The patient had a history of seizure disorder.
He was initially somnolent with mental status changes and incontinent of urine and stool as he defervesced and was started on antibiotics.
His mental status improved markedly and at one point during his hospital admission shortly after leaving the ICU for the first time, this patient did have notable asterixis.
He was treated with lactulose and his mental status returned to baseline.
Rheumatic heart disease, status post AVR / NVR.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Atrial fibrillation.
