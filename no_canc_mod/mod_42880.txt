Admission Date:  [**2110-4-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2110-5-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2031-7-18**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Cardiac surgery  HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year-old female with known aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease who had several episodes of congestive heart failure, most recently admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] at the end of [**Month (only) 958**].
Echocardiogram showed 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic stenosis, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting.
2) Coronary artery disease.
3) Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
4) History of right breast carcinoma.
8) Congestive heart failure.
9) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1) Status post right mastectomy for breast cancer in [**2101**].
2) Left cataract surgery.
ALLERGIES:  Patient is allergic to sulfa which gives her a rash.
On the first postoperative evening the patient was noticed by the nurse to not be moving the left upper extremity and shortly thereafter the patient had a witnessed generalized tonic clonic seizure.
Patient went for an emergent CT scan which was negative for intracranial bleed.
Patient had another generalized tonic clonic seizure the morning of postoperative day number one for which she was given Ativan and more Dilantin.
Patient remained intubated due to her unstable neurologic status.
By neurologic examination by postoperative day number two patient was opening eyes to stimuli and was nodding her head to questions, spontaneously moving right side, right upper and right lower extremity, withdrawing her left leg to painful stimuli and no movement of her left upper extremity.
The MRI showed significant white matter abnormality suggestive of edema accompanied by sulcal narrowing and gyral fullness in the right frontal lobe as well as seizure activity.
Neurology felt that this was suspicious for an old cerebrovascular accident and not indicative of a new ischemic event.
On postoperative day number two the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation, was placed on amiodarone infusion.
On postoperative day number three patient was weaned and extubated from the mechanical ventilation without difficulty.
By postoperative day number four patient was started on a heparin drip due to the atrial fibrillation which was cleared by neurology.
Patient continued to have left sided weakness, left lower extremity more so than left upper extremity.
On postoperative day number seven it was noted that the patient had an area of warmth, erythema in the right antecubital fossa at the site of a previous intravenous thought to be due to a thrombophlebitis.
On postoperative day number eight cardiology consultation was obtained for management of the atrial fibrillation and potential cardioversion.
Patient was sedated by anesthesiology on postoperative day number eight and was cardioverted from atrial fibrillation to sinus bradycardia with significant improvement in the patient's blood pressure.
Patient has had no further postoperative seizures.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
Sternal incision is clean and dry.
There is no erythema or drainage.
Patient's right antecubital fossa is no longer erythematous.
Aortic stenosis.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Left lower extremity weakness.
Status post right mastectomy for breast carcinoma.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
