There were no paraphasic errors.
was able to name both high and low frequency objects.
Difficult to determine if field cut, appears to see in all visual fields to motion, will not pay attention for confrontation testing.

No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.

-DTRs:   [**Name2 (NI) **] Tri [**Last Name (un) 1035**] Pat Ach L  2  2    2    2   2 R  2  2    2    2   2 Plantar response was upgoing on left, down on right  -Coordination: With right hand normal FNF/HKS, unable to perform on R  -Gait: Deferred   Pertinent Results: [**7-14**] EKG Sinus rhythm with probable sinus arrhythmia and atrial premature beats.
Low amplitude lateral lead T wave changes are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2165-11-26**] atrial ectopy is present and T wave abnormalities have decreased.
[**7-14**] CT Head Acute 4 x 2 cm right lentiform nucleus hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mild adjacent mass effect, as above.
No prior for comparison.
Findings are most likely due to hypertensive hemorrhage, although underlying mass can not be entirely excluded.
Consider further evaluation with MRI if no contraindication.
[**7-15**] CT Head No interval change in right lentiform nucleus hemorrhage.
No new  hemorrhage.
[**7-18**] ECHO Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function.
[**7-19**] CT Head Unchanged right lentiform nucleus hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage or fractures.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Right polar cyst 1cm   Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: patient was admitted with R putamen hemorrhage in the setting of HTN, DM2 and medication noncompliance.
Exam was somnolent but arousable to voice, L arm weakness in UMN pattern and minimal L leg weakness.
L facial droop was present.
He had repeat CT imaging which showed no changes, and was transferred to floor.
A renal artery doppler showed moderate left-sided hydronephrosis without arterial or venous abnormalities.
A TTE showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and a calcified mitral valve.
His mild hydronephrosis (seen on Renal U/S as above) should be re-evaluated with a CT-a/p with contrast after his GFR returns to baseline.
Acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right basal ganglia hemorrhage Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Calcified Mitral Valve   Discharge Condition: LEFT-sided hemiplegia, mild right facial droop (old), and stable/baseline left anisocoria   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with weakness of the left side of your body.
This bleed was likely caused by high blood pressure over a long period of time.
