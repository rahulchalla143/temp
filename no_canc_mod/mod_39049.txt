Admission Date:  [**2201-6-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2201-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-5-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**] Chief Complaint: lethargy, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.  intubation x2 2.  exploratory laparotomy 3.  placement of R internal jugular venous catheter 4.  placement of femoral line 5.  placement of PICC line  History of Present Illness: Pt was brought to the ED with mental status changes/lethargy, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain.
He was unable to give much of a history given his mental status.
He had been vomiting and unable to keep food down for the past several days, but cannot give more specific details.
In the ED, he was found to have a BP of 50/40, with a lactate of 8.1, with guaiac positive stool and acute renal failure (baseline Cr 0.4, Cr on admission 3.9).
As there was concern for intraabdominal infection as source of sepsis, pt was taken for an exploratory laparotomy.
GERD 5.  hypercholesterolemia 6.  legally blind  Social History: He is single, smokes 1.5 to 2ppd, and abstains, after previous problems with alcoholism 11 years ago.

Evaluation of the bowel for ischemia or other pathologic process is particularly limited.
2) Dilatation of the proximal small bowel with normal-caliber distal small bowel and colon.
3) Ectatic infrarenal aorta with maximal AP diameter of 2.5 cm.
5) Probable left renal cyst.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2201-6-10**] CXR: Worsening bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation and right pleural effusion.
Increasing opacity in the left lower lobe, which may represent atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be totally excluded.
[**2201-6-15**] CXR: Bibasilar pulmonary opacities, which could be secondary to effusion or atelectasis.
Stable appearance of mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature.
1.  sepsis - Pt initially presented with fatigue/mental status changes, hypotension, acidosis, acute renal failure, and a lactate of 8.1.
Concern was for peritonitis, and pt was emergently taken to OR on [**6-3**] for an exploratory laparotomy.
No source of peritonitis was found; there was some purulent peritoneal fluid, which did not grow any microorganisms, and dusky-appearing, but viable, bowel; the duskiness was thought to be due to hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis.
He was extubated on [**6-4**], then reintubated on [**6-5**] due to mental status decline and hypoxia, as below.
2.  respiratory failure - Extubation was attempted a couple of times, which failed.
Pt was noted to have RLL collapse on CXR, and areas of consolidation vs atelectasis on CXR.
However, no microorganisms were isolated in sputum (save for MRSA, 2+ on [**6-14**] sputum, thought perhaps to be a colonizer).
Concern for increased secretions prompted consideration of trach placement, but pt was able to be extubated successfully.
3.  hyponatremia - Pt was noted to develop hyponatremic around [**2201-6-12**].
4.  seizure disorder - Pt was placed on IV dilantin starting on [**6-18**].
5.  anemia - Pt's Hct remained stable without evidence of GI bleed or other source of bleed.
Workup revealed that this was most consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Of note, TSH has been <0.02, but this was checked in the setting of acute illness.
7.  acute renal failure - Pt's Cr on admission was 3.9.
ARF thought most likely to be due to prerenal azotemia in the setting of shock and hypoperfusion, and it corrected easily with IVF.
8. s/p exploratory laparatomy - as mentioned in HPI, pt had ex lap for concern of intraabdominal infection which was unrevealing except for some evidence of small bowel ischemia which was thought to be in the context of hypoperfusion due to sepsis.
Pt has had no further abdominal symptoms.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for thrush.
Heparin Sodium (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) injection Injection TID (3 times a day): may discontinue if pt walking consistently.
