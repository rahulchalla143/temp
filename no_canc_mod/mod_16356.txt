Admission Date:  [**2188-9-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2188-9-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2126-11-6**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post right coronary artery stent secondary to myocardial infarction.
The patient without history of coronary artery disease presented to outside hospital with complaints of chest pain.
The patient noted that he felt lightheaded and called EMS to be transported to outside hospital.
Initial laboratories there showed a troponin I of less then 0.04.
Electrocardiogram with bradycardia, left axis deviation and ST elevations in 2, 3 and AVF, V3-V5 and ST depressions in AVL, V2, V1 also with a right bundle branch block.
In the [**Hospital1 190**] the patient was sinus tachy, normal axis, normal intervals, 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevation in inferior leads and anterior leads.
Catheterization wet read showed a three vessel disease with left anterior descending coronary artery totally occluded, left circumflex was 40% lesion and right coronary artery with a 95% mid vessel lesion thought to be the culprit lesion.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with myocardial infarction and mother with myocardial infarction and brother with myocardial infarction at the age of 59.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Chest x-ray showed EP tube in right main, opacity in retrocardiac, possible atelectasis versus pneumonia and on arrival his electrocardiogram was pending.
His EF was 39% with hypokinetic anterolateral apical and inferior walls.
For his coronary artery disease three vessel disease.
His beta blockers were initially held secondary to bradycardia and negative inotropic effects.
He had an elevated AST, slightly elevated ALT at which point Lipitor was not started, but the day of discharge Lipitor was started given that his AST rise was most likely secondary to his myocardial infarction insult.
He had an atropine at bedside for possible bradycardia and secondary hypotension secondary to bradycardia, which was not used and his beta blockers as we noted earlier was held on the first day and later on started as he tolerated it.
The day after admission he was started on Levaquin for presumed right lower lobe consolidation secondary to community acquired pneumonia.
The patient did well and has been afebrile and white blood cell count decreasing daily since transfer to the floor.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Inferior myocardial infarction status post right coronary artery stent.
