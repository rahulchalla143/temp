HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted on [**3-15**] to the Emergency Department complaining of acute shortness of breath with chest pressure, diaphoresis, and nausea.
In the Emergency Department, he was noted to have ST depressions in V5, V6 and a question of ST depressions in lead I.
He ruled in for a myocardial infarction with his peak creatine kinase of 311 and a troponin level of 35.
At that time he received aspirin, Lovenox, nitroglycerin paste, Lopressor 50 mg p.o., and Lasix 40 mg intravenously for hypoxia and a chest x-ray which was consistent with congestive heart failure.
He had mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
In [**2161-2-6**], his exercise MIBI was 53% maximum predicted heart rate, but no symptoms of chest pain, and no electrocardiogram changes.
He had global hypokinesis, fixed moderate lateral basilar inferior defects.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.3 to 2.5.
In [**2157**], he had a colonic resection for adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.
In [**2158**], he had prostate cancer, and he had radiation and transurethral resection of prostate procedure.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post right femoral-popliteal.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was positive for diabetes and prostate cancer.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
He underwent an endoscopy and was found to have angioectasia in his stomach.
He also underwent cauterization with epinephrine and had no further bleeding episodes.
From a cardiac standpoint, he ruled in for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
He had no further chest pain, and on [**3-16**] he underwent an echocardiogram (please see report for full details).
In summary, the echocardiogram revealed severe global hypokinesis with severe inferolateral involvement.
In summary, the cardiac catheterization revealed a 40% occlusion of right coronary artery, 80% occlusion of the left main, 90% occlusion of circumflex, with an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%.
The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm with brief bursts of atrial fibrillation and some ventricular ectopy which resolved with electrolyte replacement and Lopressor.
Over the next few days, the patient was noted to have some confusion and agitation which was treated with Haldol with good effect.
He occasionally became disoriented but easily reoriented.
Once transferred to the floor, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course.
He continued to have some episodes of confusion but was easily reoriented.
He had no carotid bruits, and no jugular venous distention.
Chest was clear with fine crackles in the bases.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Skin revealed sternal wound was intact with no drainage, and the EVH incision performed on the left thigh was intact, slightly scabbed over.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times two.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.3 to 2.5.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Status post colonic resection for adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.
Peripheral vascular disease.
