The patient continued to have thick sputum exhibited from his tracheostomy.
From a cardiac standpoint, the patient was weaned off almost all of his intravenous Lopressor and had to be started on a diltiazem drip and titrated up to a maximum dose to decrease his heart rate.
Unfortunately, on [**12-9**], the patient had a systolic blood pressure in the 70s and an increased heart rate.
The patient's heart rates ranged in the 120s, and the patient spiked a fever of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
The patient had all of his lines changed out, was pan-cultured, as well as sputum and urine being sent.
Following this episode of sepsis, the patient was once again seen by the Infectious Disease Service who recommended tapping his effusions and ascites to rule out peritonitis.
After multiple images, it was determined that the patient had bilateral watershed strokes.
An electroencephalogram was done at this time which indicated that the patient had a very depressed responsiveness and poor brain activity.
The patient was continued on his hemodialysis for acute renal failure.
The formal read of the electroencephalogram done on [**12-15**] demonstrated diffuse delta slowing; indicative of an encephalopathic appearance.
There was no clear cut evidence for seizures at this time.
The patient's head computed tomography did reveal bilateral watershed infarctions but did not affect the hypothalamus.
It was determined that an acute stroke was not the cause of the patient's poor responsiveness at this time.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient continued to be tachycardic in the range of 100 to 100s and slightly hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of up to 190 mmHg.
The patient did not have any overt aspiration, but it was determined that the patient had presented at significantly high risk to advance him to oral intake without a video swallow first.
The patient underwent the video swallow on the subsequent day, which indicated that the patient had moderate pharyngeal dysphagia.
From a respiratory standpoint, the patient had coarse breath sounds in his upper lobes and diminished at the bases.
The patient's ileostomy produced red/golden drainage and positive flatus.
Continuous venovenous hemofiltration dialysis with multiple catheter placements.
Ischemic bowel.
Acute renal failure.
Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus wound infection and bacteremia.
Coccyx decubitus ulceration.
Occipital decubitus ulceration.
Right antecubital phlebitis.
Hemoptysis secondary to tracheostomy.
Pericardial effusions.
Artificial Tear ointment.
