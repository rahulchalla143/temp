Admission Date:  [**2120-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-1-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-7-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 663**] Chief Complaint: fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 18093**] is a 70 year-old-male with DM2, HTN, Crohns s/p ileostomy, who was scheduled for total knee replacement at NEBH but was discovered to have a UTI (at NEBH) on routine pre-operative clearance.
He reported fevers, chills, decreased PO intake (especially fluid intake), nausea, and increased urinary frequency.
In the ED, he had elevated serum bilirubins and RUQ tenderness concerning for colangitis.
Ultrasound showed evidence of cholecystitis, thickened GB, moderate GB thickening with son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign; he also had [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign on examination.
He was given metoprolol 5 mg IV X1 for both hypertension and tachycardia.
The rest of his hospital course is significant for ERCP that did not show any evidence of clear obstruction; however a stent was placed in an area of stenosis with adequate biliary drainage.
Amylase and lipase were negative currently, though the patient was thought to have evidence of mild post-ERCP pancreatitis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
There is no exertional buttock or calf pain.
Denied SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea or vomit.
Right knee replacement.
Sclera anicteric.
Lungs: + crackles in the bases Abd: Obese, distented, no tenderness to palpation.

URINE CULTURES: [**2120-12-30**] URINE CULTURE-FINAL NO GROWTH [**2120-12-31**] URINE CULTURE-FINAL NO GROWTH [**2121-1-3**] URINE CULTURE-FINAL NO GROWTH .
Cholelithiasis, moderately distended gallbladder and moderate gallbladder wall thickening, but no pericholecystic fluid.
Son[**Name (NI) 930**] reports focal tenderness while scanning over the gallbladder.
In concert, these findings are suspicious for acute cholecystitis.
Enlarged, coarsely echogenic liver; while this may represent generalized fatty infiltration, [**Name (NI) 13416**] cannot exclude other forms of severe or diffuse hepatic disease, such as cirrhosis and/or fibrosis.
Mild peripancreatic inflammatory change corresponding by imaging with mild acute pancreatitis.
Moderately distended gallbladder with wall edema and pericholecystic fluid in addition to multiple small stones present within the neck relatively unchanged in appearance compared to the ultrasound from one day prior.
Status post total colectomy with right lower quadrant ileostomy.
No intra-abdominal abscesses or fistulae noted.
ERCP [**2120-12-31**] IMPRESSION: Gallstones, with no filling defect, stricture, or dilation of the cystic duct, common bile duct, or intrahepatic biliary system.
Successful cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotomey using a free-hand technique.
No evidence of cholangitis  .
The lungs are clear except for right lower lung linear atelectasis most likely related to suboptimal inspiratory efforts and relatively low lung volumes.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with right lower lobe linear atelectasis.
Healed left rib fracture.
Old inferior infarct Early R wave progression - consider posterior myocardial infarct.
Minor bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions were present.
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent minor basilar atelectasis.
TTE (Complete) [**2121-1-3**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
CHOLECYSTITIS/SEPSIS Rigors and hypotension were likely due to cholecystitis as there was no evidence of other source of infection to explain her fevers/rigors/hypotension.
There was no evidence of cholangitis on ERCP; however, a diagnosis of cholangitis unclear as patient's total bilirubin decreased with biliary stent placement.
He was transfered to medicine when he was felt to be afebrile and hemodynamically stable; the presumed diagnosis at the time of transfer was urosepsis.
Though he was +10 L in unit, he had no signs or symptoms of overload (i.e., minimal change from chronic peripheral edema).
Cholecystitis was diagnosed by review of prior RUQ ultrasound showing gallbladder wall thickening, prior CT scan showing pericholecystic fluid, and positive son[**Name (NI) 493**] and physical examination [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy was placed by interventional radiology on [**2121-1-3**] with 200 cc of bile immediately drained; bile cultures grew Klebsiella sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
ERCP + stent: Per ERCP patient did not appear to have cholangitis; bilirubins trended down post-procedure.
The patient also had subclinical pancreatitis after the ERCP per labs but minimal epigastric abdominal/back pain; he complained of more RUQ pain consistent with cholecystitis.
He had no signs of active thrombosis.
Thrombocytopenia was most likely related to infection or medications, e.g.
# HTN: Continued atenolol.
# BPH: Contined Doxazosin .
# ARF: Creatinine was elevated on admission, likely due to dehydration.
ARF resolved with aggressive fluid resuscitation for sepsis in ED.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued simvastatin.
