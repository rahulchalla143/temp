She also has a very long atrioventricular conduction time, which is also detrimental to optimal hemodynamics.
An attempt was made to place a lead transvenously however this was not possible due to technical issues having to do with coronary sinus anatomy.
Her functional status continues to decline and she currently complains of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion after approximately 1 block of walking.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Dyslipidemia 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2098**] treated in the past with sotalol and dronedarone, both of which were discontinued due to inefficacy as well as post-cardioversion bradycardia.
- Persistent atrial fibrillation since [**2108-11-27**] despite two cardioversions attempts, maintained in sinus rhythm now on amiodarone 200 mg a day.
- Coronary artery disease bypass grafting x3 with a LIMA to the LAD and reverse saphenous vein graft to the RCA and marginal branches (Left internal mammary artery graft to left anterior descending, reverse saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and the marginal branch.)
- Chronic left bundle-branch block with mild-to-moderate AR and trivial MR. - Status post St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] and Anthem RF dual-chamber pacemaker implantation in [**2109-12-28**] with capping of the LV port given the absence of satisfactory CS anatomy.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - hypercholesterolemia - osteoporosis - multifocal papillary thyroid cancer, small cell variant, s/p 150 mCi I-131 in [**2103**] - basal cell carcinoma - [**Last Name (un) 8061**] syndrome - s/p cataract extraction OU - macular degeneration - R lung nodule - s/p TAH  Social History: She is a retired dental office administrator.

Stable-to-slightly increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
On POD3 the patients axillary arterial line was removed, and she was then noted to have numbness and loss of pulse on right hand, she was seen by vascular surgery and ultimately brought to the operating room for brachial artery exploration and  embolectomy, see operative note for details.
Her numbness resolved and she had doplerable ulnar pulse.
