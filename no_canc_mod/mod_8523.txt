Blood Cx: [**9-29**]- negative, final Cdiff toxin [**2125-10-1**] -negative, final Urine Cx [**2125-10-4**]- yeast, final  Brief Hospital Course: 86F a history of RA on Humira and dementia who presents from her [**Hospital1 1501**] with pneumosepsis.
She was presented with a CXR showing a left pleural/parapneumonic effusion that quickly worsened to complete white-out of this lung, likely secondary to a post-obstructive pneumonic process.
She was covered for HCAP with Vancomycin and Zosyn, extended past the typical 8-day coverage due to the severity of her pneumonia and extremely high O2 requirement of 6L NC and high-flow O2 through the mask.
She then developed RML collapse and she was unable to wean off any of this oxygen.
Her severe conjunctivitis was treated with erythromycin ointment on admission and improved markedly over her hospital course.
She then developed progressive acute kidney injury, with urine sediment confirming acute tubular necrosis.
BiPAP was initiated without benefit, though orotracheal suctioning seemed to stimulate her cough and wake her up.
Follow-up CXRs showed progression of her disease bilaterally and her O2 saturations dropped into the 70s.
