He has a long history of severe symptomatic left aorto-iliac disease thigh and calf claudication with ambuation, L>R.
He has had significant improvement in his claudication symptoms since his surgery, however he has had progressively increased swelling of his graft site since surgery.
He was recently discharged for increased swelling of the graft site for concern of graft site infection v. seroma v. allergic reaction, and was on IV anti-biotics.
-systolic congestive heart failure recurrent with ejection fraction of 20%.
- hypertension, controlled - bilateral renal artery stenosis status post renal artery stenting bilaterally.
- hypercholesteremia -  subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to cerebral aneurysm s/p aneurysm clipping in [**2163**].

Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave changes.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPERSSION: Severe global hypokinesis with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
Diastolic dysfunction.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation with an eccentric jet due to tethering of the posterior mitral valve leaflet by the infarcted infero-lateral wall.
T wave inversions in the lateral leads.
Possible right ventricular hypertrophy.
Possible left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-1-10**] there is no significant change.
ECG Study Date of [**2176-1-12**]  12:50:16 PM Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.
Possible biventricular hypertrophy with extensive ST-T wave changes secondary to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-1-11**] there is no significant change.
FINDINGS: There is a tortuous thoracic aorta.
No radiographic evidence of pneumonia present.
No effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2176-1-12**] 9:07 AM Final Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of Swan-Ganz position.
Bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged.
No edema or pneumothorax is present.
Brief Hospital Course: [**2176-1-10**] Patient admitted for increased swelling of Axillary to femoral bypass graft, seroma versus infection, claudication.
Pre-op EKG-Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave changes.
Pre-op CXR-No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
Pre-op and consented for abdominal aortogram and pelvic runoff, right common iliac artery stent, right external iliac artery stent, right to left femoral to femoral bypass and removal of axillary to femoral bypass graft.
[**2176-1-11**] TTE ECHO-that showed severe global hypokinesis with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
Diastolic dysfunction.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation with an eccentric jet due to tethering of the posterior mitral valve leaflet by the infarcted infero-lateral wall.
Taken to OR and underwent Ultrasound-guided access for vascular imaging,aortic catheterization with abdominal aortogram and pelvic runoff, right common iliac artery stent, right external iliac artery stent, right to left femoral to femoral bypass,removal of axillary to femoral bypass graft.
Pain control.
Tranferred to VICU [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 w/ telemetry for further monitoring.
Pain managed w/ prn.
PA line changed to tripple lumen line-placement confirmed by CXR- also showed no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and no signs of new parenchymal infiltrates.
[**2176-1-15**] Patient's fever is now coming down, T maxed 99.9.
