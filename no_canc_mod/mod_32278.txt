Mr. [**Known lastname 19420**] was re-admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**1-9**] for worsening encephalopathy.
The patient has multiple admits for encephalopathy (5 since [**8-27**]).
He was hospitalized from [**Date range (2) 77415**], during which time he had recurrent episodes of encephalopathy requiring MICU admissions, w/ one of them to be secondary to possible aspiration with poorly-fitting CPAP mask.
During this most recent admission, he likewise required MICU level care for encephalopathy and respiratory compromise when even a single Lactulose dose was delayed.
He has demonstrated that he is exquisitely sensitive to any decrease in frequency of lactulose administration, and the results of delayed or missed doses lead to severe obtundation.
Past Medical History: - HCV and EtOH Cirrhosis with ascites and edema, biopsy diagnosed in [**2139**], last vl 32,600 copies; last MELD 24.
- h/o SBP early [**7-27**] on cipro prophylaxis - Grade II esophageal varices - Recurrent hepatic encephalopathy of unclear precipitant - Pulmonary HTN - Hypothyroidism - Anxiety disorder - h/o EtOH abuse, IVDU - osteoperosis of hip and spine per pt - Anemia w/ hx of guaiac positive stool.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 42 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH + HCV,  history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, who has had multiple hospitalizations for encephalopathy who presented with mental status changes again consistent with  encephalopathy.
Within 24 hours of admission patient was transferred to the medical ICU for worsening encephalopathy and witnessed vomiting/aspiration while on CPAP.
The patient was transferred to the MICU again approximately 24 hours later for repeat altered mental status and unresponsiveness without witnessed aspiration or known cause.
He was kept for 60 hours for monitoring wherein he developed an additional episode of somnolence that resolved with continued lactulose administration.
# Aspiration: Two of patient's transfers to the MICU were related to concern for aspitation.
Patient felt to develop an aspiration pneumonitis  versus pneumonia.
Sputum gram stain showed gram positive cocci in clusters, chains and pairs.
Cx growing only oropharyngeal flora.
# Attempt at Spleno-renal Embolization: Patient underwent IR guided spleno-renal embolization in an attempt to embolize shunts in his liver which could be contributing to his encephalopathy.
# End Stage Liver Disease: Secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C. Patient required two therapeutic paracentesis which yielded 4liters and 3.5 liters respectively.
Lasix was held given episodes of hypotension while in the MICU and was not restarted given patient achieved a degree of stability on his medication regimen while lasix held.
Patient continued on daily cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
# Anemia: Likely a combination of anemia of chronic disease and mild blood loss anemia given chronically guiac positive stools.
Would recommend an outpatient colonoscopy to assess for source of GI bleeding.
# Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to liver disease.
Lactulose Sixty (60) ML PO Q2H as needed for confusion.
