Diffuse increased signal intensity and patchy heterogeneous enhancement in the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, soft tissues of the right carotid space, extending into the right parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal spaces as well.
To correlate with color Doppler ultrasound to assess for patency.
Small T2 hyperintense foci in the right lobe of thyroid- need further evaluation with ultrasound.
After initially having persistent fevers on Vanc/Unasyn, she was switched to Vanc/Zosyn per ID recs.
During this period, she was noted to be transiently leukopenic/neutropenic, with a dropping white count along with functional neutropenia and atypical cells.
Heme/onc was consulted; review of her smear revealed large atypical cells, consistent with a possible viral infection.
HIV Ab and VL returned negative and EBV and CMV serologies were consistent with prior infection.
After ~2 days without fever she again became febrile with elevated temperatures (as high as 105).
Thus, she underwent repeat MRI on [**2170-1-14**] showing worsening of the soft tissue disease including increase in retropharyngeal fluid and necrotic lymph nodes.
She was taken to the OR by ENT on [**1-14**] for drainage of neck collection and debridement of necrotic cervical lymph nodes and surrounding tissue.
Intra-op findings notable for necrosis of the medial surface of the mid one third of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, primarily involving the fascia with involving some muscle fibers deep to the fascia, also some necrotic tissue of the carotid sheath fascia as well as of the fat medial to the carotid sheath and of some lymphadenopathy in the mid jugular chain around level 3.
Over the ensuing two days she developed worsening odynphagia and fevers again re-developed to Tm 105 on [**1-16**], concerning for persistent infection.
She had a penrose in place to drain the retropharynx and a three gauze in place in her neck wound.
She underwent a repeat CT on [**1-18**] which should no reaccumulation of fluid or necrotic debris.
She underwent twice daily dressing changes initially with three gauze soaked with  1/2 strength dakin's solution which was diluted eventually to single saline gauze s her wound showed progressive healthy granulation tissue without further evidence of necrosis.
She was then gently diuesed to alleviate tongue swelling and subsequently extubated on [**2170-1-23**] without difficulty.
Further details of her hospital course reviewed below by systems:  Neuro:  CV:  Endocrine: on imaging, she was noted to have thyroid nodules/abnormal TSH.
MRI of the neck to have a small hyperintense focus of the right lobe of the thyroid.
This finding is not interpretable in the setting of acute illness.
