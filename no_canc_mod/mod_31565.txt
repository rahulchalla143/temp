Admission Date:  [**2129-3-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-3-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-3-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: E-Mycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**] Chief Complaint: Disabling left leg claudication, status post prior ligation of popliteal artery aneurysm  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2129-3-14**] Left superficial femoral artery to posterior tibial artery bypass graft using 6 mm ringed Propaten  [**2129-3-15**] Cardiac Catheterization with PTCA [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 96769**] stents(x3) to the mid to ostial RCA   History of Present Illness:  The patient is a male who had an arm vein bypass femoral-popliteal done approximately 17 years ago for a large popliteal aneurysm.
In addition, there would be no percutaneous measure because the aneurysm was ligated.
The patient has no veins whatsoever and did not have this similar anomaly in his left arm with essentially 2 brachial arteries.
He understands that his only option other than PTFE would be either an arterial construct which would be very difficult to harvest or thigh femoral vein which would also be very challenging.
He understands the risk of graft failure either acutely or shorter long-term as well as graft infection and consents to go forward with the procedure.

Cannot rule out ST-T wave abnormalities.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal inferoseptal and apical hypokinesis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with overall normal systolic function.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal inferoseptum, inferior wall hypokinesis.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-3-15**], the region of hypokinesis in the distal inferoseptum has decreased.
He was found to have a low h/h and was hypertensive post operatively.
A heparin gtt was also initiated post op given his arterial disease.
On [**3-15**], pod 1 the pt experienced some chest pain and a cardiac work up was started.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) was consulted to see the pt and felt the pt was having an acute MI.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken urgently for a cardiac cath with the following findings: LMCA was calcified with minimal disease.
The LCx had minimal disease.
His hct remained slightly decreased and on [**3-21**] it was recommended to transfuse 1 unit of prbcs.
He was tolerating a po diet, ambulating without assistance and voiding without difficulty.
He will need cardiology follow up and will inevitably need CABG for his LAD disease at some point in the future.
[**Last Name (STitle) 131**] and he will see the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes team for further evaluation of his diabetes in the next few weeks.
