HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and tobacco use who presented to the Emergency Department with a 7-day history of worsening dyspnea on exertion, a cough productive of yellow sputum, fevers, chills, as well as left-sided pleuritic chest pain.
The patient had presented to his primary care physician with similar symptoms in [**Month (only) **] and [**2139-9-18**] and was treated with a course of azithromycin for presumed bronchitis; reportedly without symptomatic improvement.
The patient denied recent travel, sick contacts, headaches, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, as well as urinary symptoms.
The patient was noted to using accessory muscles with coarse breath sounds throughout.
The initial chest x-ray was without evidence of infiltrate; however, a computed tomography angiogram was obtained given the patient's complaint of primary care physician and evidence of sinus tachycardia.
The computed tomography angiogram demonstrated a left lingular infiltrate, and the patient was started on levofloxacin and nebulizer treatments.
Shortly thereafter, the patient became progressively hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s with worsening shortness of breath.
The patient was electively intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure with an arterial blood gas of 7.22/50/407 on assist-control, tidal volume of 700, respiratory rate of 12, and FIO2 of 100%.
While in the Emergency Department, the patient received a total of 8 liters of normal saline without significant blood pressure response, and the patient was subsequently started on blood pressure support.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient reports a one pack per day tobacco history of 18 years (currently using) with social alcohol.
In mild distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Arcus senilis bilaterally.
The oropharynx was erythematous with no exudate.
No lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention noted.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no extra heart sounds appreciated.
Pulmonary examination revealed diffusely scattered wheezes and rhonchi anteriorly and posteriorly.
Abdominal examination revealed soft, nontender, and nondistended.
No masses were appreciated.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories and studies on admission revealed complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 18.8, hematocrit was 43.6, and platelets were 195.
Microbiologic studies notable during this admission included a sputum culture from [**2139-11-27**] with moderate streptococcal pneumococci.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Radiologic studies of note included a chest computed tomography on admission which was notable for left lingular infiltrate with no evidence for pleural effusion of pericardial effusion, and no evidence intraluminal filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolus.
A repeat chest computed tomography on hospital day six (on [**2139-12-2**]) demonstrated ground-glass opacification and consolidation in the lung apices with additional patchy areas of opacification in the periphery of the right middle lobe and lingua.
Small right and moderate left pleural effusions, and several small pathologic mediastinal lymph nodes.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin a multilobar pneumonia with a septic physiology.
The vancomycin was discontinued after one day, and following the results of a sputum culture from admission with evidence of moderate pneumococci, the Levaquin was discontinued after completion of five days.
For the first eight days of the hospitalization, the patient demonstrated a persistently elevated white blood cell count with bandemia (maximum white blood cell count was 16.6 with 26% bands) and persistent fever (ranging from 100 to 103).
All blood cultures were without growth including multiple catheter tip cultures.
The persistent fever was concerning for a line infection, and vancomycin was restarted on [**12-3**].
Clostridium difficile colitis (given several days of diarrhea) as well as empyema (given small bilateral pleural effusions) were also of concern.
However, the patient defervesced without the addition of new therapy.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient was intubated for multilobar pneumococcal pneumonia secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The patient required frequent suctioning for copious secretions as well as frequent albuterol nebulizer treatments for bronchospasms.
Serial chest x-rays demonstrated improving multilobar pneumonia with development of very small bilateral pleural effusions.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient initially required blood pressure support for hypotension in the setting of sepsis.
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient has a known diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and presented with hyperglycemia and mild diabetic ketoacidosis.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was noted to be significantly lethargic with episodes of physical agitation following extubation.
While intubated, the patient had received significant sedation for suctioning.
The patient underwent a diagnostic head computed tomography without evidence of pathology.
Multilobar pneumococcal pneumonia.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
