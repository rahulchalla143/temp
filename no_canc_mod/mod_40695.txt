Admission Date:  [**2118-6-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-3-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Shellfish Derived / Codeine / Colace / Phenergan / Reglan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Concern for Endocarditis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TTE I+D of L ankle lesion  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 15849**] is a 73 year old gentleman tranferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED with concern for bacteremia/endocarditis.
His story begins 4-5 days ago when he stepped with his L foot on a splinter while barefoot.
He developed increasing pain, and sought medical advice while at Tanglewood at the EMT tent.
Over the next day or so, he developed chills and worsening pain, erythema and presented to an outside ED.
D-Dimer was checked and elevated, leading to a CTA which demonstrated diffuse nodules with concern for septic emboli with effusions.
He was also found to have new pleural effusions.
He denies other complaints.

Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2118-6-17**]):    NO GROWTH.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2117-4-19**] there is no change.
Echo [**6-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis in reasonable quality study.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal biventricular systolic function.
Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis with trivial aortic regurgitation and mildly increased transvalvular gradients.
If clinically indicated, a TEE may better assess for vegetations.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets appear normal No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetation seen on the aortic, mitral, tricupid or pulmonic valves.
No paravalvar abcess.
CT Chest: CT OF THE CHEST: Bilateral peripheral solid nodules with ground-glass halos are noted scattered throughout the lungs, the largest in the left upper lobe, measures 13 x 9 mm.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with adjacent bilateral compressive atelectasis.
There is bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; left hilar lymph node measures 24 x 18 mm (2, 46).
Multiple lymph nodes within the prevascular space, measured up to 8 mm (2, 37).
There is a small hiatal hernia.
There is apparent diffuse thickening of the esophagus.
Axillary lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver and gallbladder appear unremarkable.
Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically with no hydronephrosis.
A 55 x 49 mm hypodense lesion arising from the interpolar region of the left kidney likely represents renal cyst.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The bladder, distal ureters, rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable.
Pelvic lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is no free pelvic fluid.
Retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel appear within normal limits.
There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Multilevel degenerative changes are noted, but there are no focal lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy.
Peripheral and bilateral solid nodules with ground-glass halos are noted scattered within bilateral lungs.
Differential diagnosis includes septic emboli versus multifocal BAC versus metastases versus multifocal infectious process such as coccidioidomycosis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia versus lymphoma versus rheumatoid nodules.
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Small hiatal hernia.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Left renal cyst.
There is no evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage.
There are several scattered foci demonstrating high signal intensity on FLAIR and T2-weighted images in the periventricular and deep white matter, most consistent with sequelae of chronic microvascular disease.
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest an acute infarct.
There is no abnormal marrow signal present.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of an acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarct.
Scattered foci of high signal intensity on FLAIR and T2-weighted images are most consistent with sequelae of chronic microvascular disease.
Brief Hospital Course: A 73 year old gentleman admitted to the MICU for cellulitis, concern for endocarditis/septic emboli given initial imaging.
# Septic emboli - The patient was asymptomatic during his hospitalization.
He had a TTE and TEE, both which showed no evidence of vegetations/infection in the heart.
He had two nodules on his medial left ankle that were felt to be emboli as well as there was no other obvious source for the nodules.
ID felt the septic emboli were due to an endovascular infection secondary to the cellulitis.
A CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis with contrast was obatined which showed the septic emboli, but no evidence of abdominal symptoms.
The patient was initially started on vanco/rifampin/gentamicin as ID wished to treat the infection as endocarditis.
# Chest pain - The patient complained of left shoulder/chest pain that was pleuritic in nature, worsening when he took a deep breath.
An EKG was checked and was unchanged from prior and showed no ST-T wave changes.
This pain was attributed to the septic emobli causing pleuritic pain.
You were admitted with bilateral lung nodules in your lungs that were suspicious for bacterial emboli.
The original source of the bacteria was thought to be from a skin infection on your left foot.
You had an echocardiogram that showed no infection in the heart and a CT scan that showed no infection in the abdomen.
You developed diarrhea as well.
This was checked and did not show any signs of an infectious diarrhea.
