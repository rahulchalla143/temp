You had a stone in one of your ducts which was causing you to experience fatigue, jaundice and nausea/chills.
An ultrasound performed at [**Hospital6 **] showed the presence of a clot in your portal vein (a vein that supplies the liver).
Since this takes time to become effective, we have started you on another medication at the same time called lovenox or enoxaparin.
3) We have added a new medication to your current regimen, called acyclovir for the rash around your mouth.
