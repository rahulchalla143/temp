Admission Date:  [**2114-3-21**]       Discharge Date: [**2114-3-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2056-1-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU/Medicine Acove Team  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia, status post pulmonary vein atrial fibrillation, isolation procedure.
The patient notes being in his usual state of health post ablation in normal sinus rhythm until [**3-20**], at noon when he noted the onset of acute shortness of breath, wheezing and marked dyspnea on exertion while visiting his family in [**Hospital1 **] [**State 350**].
Of note, he had no associated chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, palpitations, nausea or vomiting at the time.
An electrocardiogram at that time showed a sinus tachycardia with ST depressions in leads V5 through V6 at a ventricular rate of 114.
A computerized axial tomography scan was performed and was negative for pulmonary embolus or evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis.
BMP level was drawn, not suggestive of congestive heart failure.
The patient was given intravenous fluids, given history of chronic renal insufficiency and chest x-ray demonstrating bilateral infiltrates thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
Clindamycin was added to his regimen initially given his bilateral infiltrates and concern for aspiration pneumonia.
A repeat electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 83 beats/minute with no ST or T wave changes.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for management of aspiration pneumonia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal for the past 15 to 20 years with persistent atrial fibrillation for the past seven months, status post failed cardioversion, now status post pulmonary vein ablation on [**2114-3-19**] at [**Hospital6 256**].
He did tolerate the intubation well and was extubated without complications.
Question of coronary artery disease, however, normal exercise treadmill test with MIBI imaging in [**2112-5-23**], going 9.5 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol with an ejection fraction of 61% and normal perfusion of the imaging portion.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.1.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for multiple relatives with coronary artery disease, further details unknown.
He is responsive to voice and external stimuli.
He is in moderate respiratory distress with accessory muscle use.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, extraocular movements intact, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, moist mucous membranes, no evidence of jaundice.
No evidence of rub, clicks or gallops.
There is a faint I/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border without radiation.
Abdomen, moderately distended with decreased bowel sounds, soft and generally nontender.
Extremities, 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities with dopplerable pulses bilaterally.
Chest x-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates in all lung fields.
A computerized tomographic angiography of the chest demonstrated no filling defects in the pulmonary arteries or veins.
Evaluation of left atrium and pulmonary veins demonstrates two major pulmonary veins in both the right and left side, pulmonary vein draining the right middle lobe, draining into the inferior most right pulmonary vein.
Mild approximately 0.
Given the fact that he was febrile and the infiltrate was most prominent in the right middle lobe, it was felt that the respiratory failure was secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
He was placed on a regimen of Clindamycin, Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for coverage of anaerobes as well as community-acquired pathogens.
Other possibilities in the differential diagnosis would include congestive heart failure, given the patient's known 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation and the incidence of approximately 3% of congestive heart failure post pulmonary vein atrial fibrillation ablation, it was felt the patient may have been in congestive heart failure.
Pulmonary embolus, the patient had a computerized tomographic angiography which was negative for pulmonary embolus.
It is possible, however, that he did have a pulmonary embolus which had dissolved, however, this is rather unlikely given that the patient was still markedly hypoxic and dyspneic throughout his hospital course.
The next possibility would include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, given wheezing on examination and emphysema by chest x-ray.
He was placed on nebulizers which seemed to have minimal effect throughout his hospital course.
Other considerations would include intra-abdominal bleed, status post right and left heart catheterization with a mild hematocrit drop compared to his baseline and moderate intra-abdominal swelling, post procedure, however, this did not seem to be a likely cause at least at the time of the dictation.
Thus, it was felt that the cause of the respiratory distress was most likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia with superimposed congestive heart failure in the setting of mitral regurgitation and new onset of normal sinus rhythm.
Coronary artery disease, the patient did have ST depressions on an outside hospital electrocardiogram.
However, serial electrocardiograms in-house seemed to show no evidence of ST depressions.
Mitral regurgitation, he had 2+ mitral regurgitation noted on echocardiogram on [**2114-3-21**] with an ejection fraction of 55%.
Neck fracture, status post failed cervical fusion, according to the orthopedics recommendation from Intensive Care Unit he should retain a hard collar while ambulatory, but a soft collar while in bed.
He was continued on Valium for muscle spasm and it should be noted that he will need a fiberoptic intubation if he is to be intubated.
Chronic renal insufficiency, the patient's creatinine remained stable at the time of dictation.
Anemia, iron studies were drawn and were consistent with an anemia of chronic disease with an elevated ferritin.
He was typed and screened and all stools were guaiaced and were guaiac negative.
