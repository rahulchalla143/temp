Total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy.
History of Present Illness: 70yo man with history of chronic EOTH abuse (sober X 2yrs) and remote smoking history, who intially presented to [**Hospital1 59561**] in [**2104-1-10**] for painless jaundice and generalized pruritus.
He also reported rust colored urine and white colored stool.
An abdomainl US demonstrated intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary duct dialtion.
An MRCP demonstrated moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dialtion with an irregular fillign defect in the proximal common bile duct.
Four attempts at ERCP have failed secondary to agitation, sheduling difficulties/inability to tolerate procedure without general anesthesia, bigeminy and hypotension respectively.
He developed leukocytosis from 8 -> 19 -> 21 on [**2-4**].
Initial CT abdomen - diffuse small bowel thickening - started on cipro/flagyl.
CT abd then read as dilated colon with fecal matter and air suggestive of ileus vs. SBO.
He has been eating well with no complaints.
No further abdominal pain.

There are small amounts of fluid in the  abdomen and pelvis as described.
[**2104-2-9**] CT Abdomen:Slightly increased amount of fluid around the liver and deep  within the pelvis.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than  left, that are slightly increased in the interim.
There is an air-fluid level within the esophagus, not seen on yesterday's CT.  Clinical correllation recommended.
Contrast  within the gallbladder, but no evidence of contrast leakage.
Slight increase  in volume of ascites since the prior exam.
2) Atherosclerotic disease.
3) Nonobstructing bilateral renal stones.
[**2104-2-15**] Abdominal XRay: Portable view of the abdomen again shows a markedly dilated colon from the  cecum to the splenic flexure of the transverse colon.
There is an opacity at the right lung base,  which could represent atelectasis or consolidation.
No free air is detected.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 96013**] is a 70-year-old gentleman who presented to the care of General Surgery with a month long history of treatment for biliary duct obstruction at an outside hospital.
He had a prior history of a Billroth II gastric resection for peptic ulcer disease.
Evaluation of his biliary duct disease indicated a stricture in the mid duct and this was drained percutaneously at the referring hospital prior to his transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Subsequent to this, he developed evidence of systemic infection and subsequent multi-system organ dysfunction.
He had an MRSA septicemia.
There was evidence of C. diff.
toxin positivity 4 days prior to this procedure, although his clinical course did not suggest overwhelming infection in that he did not have major diarrhea, nor was his colon inflamed on CAT scan.
However, he deteriorated rapidly over the next [**12-20**] days and maintained a persistent elevated white count at 30 to 40 thousand.
He had multi-system organ failure involving his pulmonary, renal and cardiac systems.
With this precipitous decline over a short period and the new evidence of diarrhea, it was thought that me might have fulminant C. diff.
Abdominal x- rays showed a massively dilated colon on the morning of [**2104-2-15**] and a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed at the bedside.
Given all of these findings and the patient's instability without improvement with maximal support, he was taken to the operating room on [**2104-2-15**] with the goal of performing a total abdominal colectomy for fulminant C. diff.
The patient's family and health care proxy wished to intervene with this procedure in order to sustain Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 97518**] life, but they understood the extreme risks of this operation with his cardiac and respiratory instability as well as the slim likelihood that there would be a positive ultimate outcome.
