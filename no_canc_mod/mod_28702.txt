HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male who was transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**], with a history of right axillobifemoral bypass with a right fourth toe amputation in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year, who developed difficulty with ambulation over the last 3 weeks with progressing to cessation of his ambulation 2 days ago which is associated with leg fatigue and cool feet.
Daughter brought the patient to [**Hospital6 5016**] where he was treated for dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, bilateral renal artery stenosis status post renal artery stenting bilaterally in [**2177-6-8**], chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine at 2.0-4.0, Alzheimer's disease, carotid stenosis with a totally occluded left internal carotid artery, and the right carotid is 70%, atrial fibrillation with paroxysmal episodes since [**2177-6-8**].
General appearance: Alert, oriented x3 in no acute distress.
Heart has a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub.
Patient has bilateral inguinal scars which are well-healed.
Extremities show no open wounds or ulcers.
There is absent sensation.
The right foot is hyperemic from midfoot with diminished sensory.
The patient underwent an urgent bilateral fem patch angioplasty with bilateral kissing common iliac angioplasty and stenting with ligation of the axillobifemoral graft at the common femoral arteries, bilateral profunda femoris and left superficial femoral artery and graft thrombectomy with bilateral 4-compartment fasciotomy.
The patient required vasopressor support for low urinary output.
The blood and urine was cultured which were no growth.
They felt that his acute renal failure was secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy and rhabdomyosis.
His CKs which peaked at 7161 began to show a downward trend to 4107.
His blood and urine cultures were no growth.
His chest x-ray noted increase in the left lower lobe consolidation, and he was continued on his current antibiotics.
On postoperative day 9 and 4, he had an episode of hyperkalemia of 6.6 which was treated with Kayexalate.
The patient was begun on Epogen for his chronic anemia of chronic disease.
On [**12-21**], postoperative day 16, 11 and 6, he had increased mental status changes.
They felt that the changes were secondary to his metabolic state and history of alcoholism and would just monitor him closely.
The wound care service saw the patient for his gluteal decubitus on the left, and specific recommendations were made which were instituted.
A rectal tube which had been placed on [**12-9**] for multiple loose stools was discontinued.
He had VRE and MRSA surveillance cultures done which were negative.
The patient did not demonstrate any signs of aspiration.
It was determined to monitor his oral intake and to see how he does and then reconsider a PEG if necessary.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Lower extremity postoperative extremity ischemia, postoperative pneumonia secondary to aspiration, postoperative blood loss anemia--transfused, postoperative acute tubular necrosis secondary to rhabdomyosis with contrast-induced acute tubular necrosis, postoperative acute renal failure status post continuous [**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemodialysis, postoperative hypertension secondary to hypovolemia--corrected, postoperative failure to thrive status post tube feed total parenteral nutrition.
