The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension   Brief Hospital Course: 1) Bradycardia - sinus arrest but qrs narrowed and p waves returned as flecanide wore off, symptomatic with confusion/CHF/weakness, possible etiology from poor renal clearence of flecainide and BB, r/o'ed out for MI.
2) Afib - Pt had a few episodes of WCT which appeared to be A. fib.
Pt bounced back and forth from WCT to bradycardia and then HR eventually stabalized.
2) CHF due to diastolic dysfxn w/ pulm edema causing hypoxia- hypertensive.
CXR initially was consistent with pulmonary edema.
3) Renal Failure - chronic w/ RAS s/p failed stent.
4) Anemia - likely secondary to CRI and Waldestrom's.
Pt got 2 units of blood and iron workup was consistent for anemia of chronic disease.
5) Confusion - ?
Delerium from hypoxia vs. Atropine.
Pt got head CT which showed no acute bleed.
6) leukocytosis and fever.
Pt was given Vanc/Levo for possible aspiration pna.
CXR suggested possible aspiration PNA in LLL.
