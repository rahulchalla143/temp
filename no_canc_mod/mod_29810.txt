Admission Date:  [**2186-4-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-4-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ipratropium  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**] Chief Complaint: lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R PICC placement  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]M with h/o CRI, CAD, dementia, presented to the ED from [**Hospital3 2558**] with 1 day of lethargy.
He was brought to the ED for further evaluation given his lab abnormalities and altered mental status.
CXR showed bibasilar infiltrates, UA dirty.
CT head with only chronic microvascular changes.
CAD- h/o AMI [**2175**] s/p PCI to LAD 3.
CHF- TTE [**2183**] with EF 25% including apical akinesis, 1+ MR, 2+ TR, moderate PA systolic HTN 4.
HTN 5.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS 97.9 122/71 120/70 85 94%3L GENERAL: NAD, lying in bed HEENT: EOMI, OMMM NECK: Supple, no LAD CARDIOVASCULAR: S1, S2, reg, no MRG LUNGS: Soft occ rhonchi ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, ND, no rebound or guarding.
No hemorrhage or mass effect.
Moderate-to-severe chronic periventricular white matter hypodensities consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
Chronic lacunar infarcts.
Air-fluid level in the right maxillary and left sphenoid sinuses consistent with acute sinusitis.
Probable COPD and pulmonary hypertension.
Increased retrocardiac density - - question collapse and/or consolidation versus hiatal hernia.
Patchy opacity right mid zone - - question scarring versus infiltrate.
Compared with [**2184-5-19**], the right cardiophrenic opacity is new and therefore more likely to represent an infectious infiltrate or aspiration.
Imaging: CXR [**2186-4-4**] 2:52 PM: Persistent atelectasis and/or consolidation left lung base.
Possible subtle parenchymal infiltrate in right lower lung.
Video Speech and Swallow Evaluation [**2186-4-7**]: Pt demonstrates a mild oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced bolus formation and control, prolonged mastication of all textures, mild swallow initiation delay, and reduced valve closure.
His EKG was thought to have slight changes in the STE V1-V3 and troponin was slightly elevated at 0.08-- Cardiology reviewed his EKG and felt there was no significant change.
In the MICU, treated w/ vanco/levo/flagyl, given insulin gtt and fluid resuscitated.
Although pt apparently passed bedside swallow w/ nectar thickened, pt has continued to have evidence of aspiration while eating/drinking/meds.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: [**Age over 90 **]M with h/o CRI, CAD, dementia, initially admitted to MICU for HONC (FSBS 700s), severe hypernatremia (174), UTI and PNA treated w/ vanco/levo/flagyl.
# SEPSIS: The patient presented from NH with elevated WBC and dirty U/A and started on levoquin.
# HYPERNATREMIA/ELECTROLYTES: Appeared to have nongap acidosis, probably initially related to dehydration and later attributed to NS given for fluid rescuscitation.
# ASPIRATION: There was evidence of clinical aspiration.
# CHF: Systolic CHF with EF 25% and grossly volume overloaded by exam plus O2 requirement likely [**3-10**] fluid administration for sepsis.
# DM: The patient presented with elevated blood glucose in the 700s, he was initially started on an insulin drip and transitioned to insulin subq.
He did not previously have a diagnosis of diabetes, but on review of CCC shows multiple hyperglycemic episodes while here, so probably undiagnosed DM.
# DEMENTIA: As above, Aricept and namenda were initially held whil NPO, then restarted prior to discharge.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Sepsis - Hypernatremia - Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state .
Secondary diagnosis: - Chronic renal insufficiency - Coronary artery disease - Congestive heart failure - Hypertension - Dementia   Discharge Condition: Stable, breathing well on room air   Discharge Instructions: You have been admitted to the hospital with sepsis, high blood glucose, and high sodium.
