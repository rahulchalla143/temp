The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy.
There is prior right parietal lobe infarct with expected hypodensity.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive in detection of acute ischemia.
Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic changes and old right parietal infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 yo woman w/Afib and history of recent right temporo-parietal infarct presenting with seizure.
As she had a history of a stroke in [**Month (only) 216**], and had recently been restarted on Coumadin, there was some concern that she may have developed hemorrhagic conversion of her prior stroke, however she had a head CT with no sign of hemorrhage.
Later that evening she developed increasing respiratory distress, and a repeat chest x-ray showed near collapse of her left lung, which was suspected to be due to mucous plugging.
At this time she also became febrile and hypotensive, and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
