Admission Date:  [**2116-9-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-9-20**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization via left radial artery Right PICC line placed and discontinued prior to discharge  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 12163**] is an 86 yo man with extensive hx of CAD as well as severe AS, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] this morning after having chest pain overnight.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12163**] has chest pain at least once weekly, which usually resolves with one Nitro.
Last night developed CP while in bed, took Nitro x3, pain resolved each time but when pain came back the fourth time he became concerned and drove with wife to [**Name (NI) 620**] [**Name (NI) **].
No SOB, no diaphoresis.
At baseline, patient lives with wife, can walk around and climb stairs without chest pain.
Arrived in [**Location (un) 620**] ED with chest pain and EKG at 330 showed sinus rhythm with rate of 130, left axis deviation, LAFB with RBBB, ST depressions in V3-V5.
No ST elevations were noted.
Patient became CP free and EKG showed improvement in ST depressions in V4-V5 with continue depression V3.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU patient was pain free.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG:  CABG in [**2104**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM) -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: RCA stent x2 in [**2105**], SVG-OM (3.5 x 18mm cypher) stent placed in [**2110**] Type II DM Right Kidney removed years ago Prostatectomy Tonsillectomy Appendectomy Hernia x2  Social History: Retired, lives with wife.
-ETOH:  occasionally -Illicit drugs:  Denies  Family History: Father died of CAD at the age of 57.
One brother died of pancreatic cancer in his 70's, the other of unknown cancer, also in his 70's.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block.
Right bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-5-22**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Echocardiogram [**2116-9-14**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with only the lateral wall having relatively normal function.
There is an anteroapical left ventricular aneurysm.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-7-19**], there are more extensive wall motion abnormalities (suggestive of interim LAD ischemia/infarction).
The degree of aortic stenosis may be underestimated on the current study (low output - low gradient aortic stenosis).
The distal LAD filled via the LIMA and was a small, 1.5mm vessel with diffuse disease and a 60-70% apical stenosis that was unchanged from the catheterization of 6/[**2115**].
The RCA had mild luminal irregularities with serial calcific 30-40% stenoses.
There was a diffusely diseased PDA branch with 80% stenosis unchanged from prior.
Arterial conduit arteriography demonstrated a widely patent LIMA-LAD.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated left-sided filling pressures with LVEDP 32mmHg.
There was minimal gradient across aortic valve (peak to peak 20 mm Hg).
Markedly elevated left-sided filling pressures  CXR [**2116-9-19**] A right subclavian PICC line is present.
Possible minimal change in position compared with the film from [**2116-9-16**].
No pneumothorax is detected.
There are bibasilar opacities, similar to [**2116-9-16**], though the degree of opacity in the left cardiophrenic region is greater on today's exam.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Otherwise, no new infiltrate.
No pneumothorax detected.

He was medically managed for his NSTEMI with a heparin drip, metoprolol, lisinopril, crestor, plavix, and full dose ASA.
The echocardiogram also demonstrated a new left ventricular aneurysm.
In the setting of the new hypokinesis, the patient also intermittently complained of chest/jaw pain and anginal symptoms responsive to SL nitro with reversible new ischemic changes in the lateral leads.
The patient's jaw/chest pain was subsequently deemed to be the result of demand ischemia in the setting of bigeminy; BB was uptitrated and he was started on long acting nitro.
The patient will be evaluated as an outpatient for the possibility of aortic angioplasty or further intervention.
He is discharged on maximal medical management for NSTEMI as well as isosorbide nitrite, amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month with plans to taper to 200 mg daily, and warfarin for anticoagulation in the setting of apical hypokinesis.
WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: As noted above, on [**2116-9-15**] the patient complained of chest pain and was noted to have a wide complex tachycardia with heart rate in the 140s that resolved with IV lopressor.
The patient was evaluated by EP who thought the rhythm was more likely to be a supraventricular tachycardia then ventricular tachycardia.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Reduction in EF from 50 to 25-30% and new left ventricular aneurysm on TTE.
The patient was bridged on warfarin therapy with goal INR of [**1-8**] due to new LV aneurysm and the inability to exclude a clot.
VASCULAR ACCESS: a left side hematoma developed after infiltration of the IV in which heparin was being administered on [**9-14**].
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY HEMATOMA.
His hematoma on his left upper extremity remained stable throughout his hospital course.
HYPERLIPIDEMIA: The patient was started on simvastatin on admission which was changed to crestor secondary to starting amiodarone.

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a small heart attack.
We did various studies of your heart and did not think that there were new areas of blockage to your coronary arteries.
Here we controlled your chest pain and initiated optimal medical management of your disease.
We discussed your case with cardiac surgery for treatment of your coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis, but you have decided not to pursue surgery at this time.
