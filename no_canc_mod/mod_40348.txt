There is an acute fracture involving the left humeral neck with impaction and slight medial displacement of the distal fracture fragment.
No additional fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION: Left humeral neck fracture.
There is an acute fracture involving the left humeral neck with a slightly impacted appearance and medial displacement of the distal fragment.
Patient is rotated to left with a marked scoliotic deformity, which limits evaluation through the chest, though there is no definite evidence of lung consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Left humeral neck fracture.
Otherwise, no acute findings.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-2-1**] at 9:42:07 AM The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with vigorous left ventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2146-2-2**] 7:47 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-1**], there is little interval change on this somewhat limited study.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with bibasilar atelectatic change.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD, critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates.
# Hypotension: Patient was found to be hypotensive in the ED after coming back from radiology study.
The etiologies for her hypotension were thought to be related to pain-medications and critical AS.
Because of hypotension, she developed acute renal failure rapidly (creatinine bumped from 0.9 to 2.9 in 2 days).
Patient declined hemodialysis, also denied AVR or valvuloplasty, so after extensive discussions with patient's HCP (her son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 10166**]), decision was made to make patient comfort measures only.
She expired on day 3 of her hospital stay from acute renal failure and electrolyte abnormalities.
She underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
She declined AVR or valvuloplasty.
She expired on [**2146-2-2**] in the setting of critical AS, hypotension and acute renal failure.
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from labs but appeared to be around 0.6-0.7.
No recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins, and no symptoms of UTI with benign UA.
The most concerning possibility was that patient's AS led to syncope due to hypoperfusion.
Patient underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Patient's pain was well-controlled on the above regimen.
# Rhythm: Patient was in atrial fibrillation, and not anticoagulated.
She was not on aspirin or coumadin because of a previous GI bleed.
She went into VT followed by asystole minutes before she expired, likely secondary to hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure.
# Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology, though rapid increase and lack of fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggested possibly leukemoid reaction in the context of fracture and injury.
# Anemia: Patient had history of normocytic anemia, baseline around 29-20.
She had no signs of active bleeding.
Patient had some cardiac enzyme leaks during her hospital stay, likely in the setting of hypotension and decreased blood supply to coronaries.
# PPx: Patient was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
