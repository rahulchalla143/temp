Admission Date:  [**2125-7-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2125-7-7**]   Service:  [**Hospital **] Medical  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers and hypotension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old man with complicated past medical history including coronary artery disease, status post MI, CHF with an EF of approximately 35%, history of seizure disorder, cerebral palsy and mild mental retardation, who was referred from the [**Hospital6 459**] for evaluation after he was noted to have fevers, be hypotensive with increased lethargy and guaiac positive stools.
The patient was noted to have fevers approximately one day prior to admission and was noted to be hypotensive the morning of admission.
He also apparently was noted to have loose guaiac positive stools on that morning.
Of note, the patient is status post prolonged hospital stay at the [**Hospital1 69**] from [**2125-5-8**] to [**2125-5-25**] for gallstone pancreatitis status post ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone removal.
At that time he required temporary ICU stay for hypotension and possibly sepsis.
He was, at that time, started on Dopamine at 7.5 mcg and required neo as he became acutely hypertensive.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As follows: Cerebral palsy, mild mental retardation, history of polio with left upper extremity and left lower extremity hemiparesis, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2115**], congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction, EF of 35%, lone AF in 5/00, history of seizure disorder, secondary hypoparathyroidism, history of Barrett's esophagus with stricture status post periodic dilation, history of aspiration pneumonia in the setting of esophageal stricture, history of MRSA pneumonia in 5/00, status post ileocecectomy in [**2122**], status post right CHR, SBO status post lysis of adhesions in 5/00, history of open cholecystectomy, history of gallstone pancreatitis as noted in HPI, osteopenia with compression fracture, asthma, cataracts.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General, he was a lethargic appearing elderly man in no acute distress.
His HEENT exam was significant for a surgical pupil on the left, minimally reactive on the right.
His oropharynx was dry without lesions.
His neck was supple with no JVD or lymphadenopathy.
His lungs had coarse breath sounds bilaterally with crackles at the bases and rhonchorous upper airway sounds.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, distended, diffusely tender, especially in the right upper quadrant with mild periumbilical pain and a 3 by 3 cm incisional hernia which was easily reducible and nontender.
Extremities had left upper extremity and left lower extremity with contractures.
Chest x-ray was rotated and showed mild CHF but no obvious infiltrate.
His EKG was sinus tachycardia at 108 with borderline PR prolongation, left axis deviation, borderline left anterior fascicular block, ST depressions of 1 mm in V4 through V6.
Cardiac:  The patient was initially noted to have elevated CKs, however, the MB fraction was low.
A rule out MI protocol was followed and serial CKs did not show evidence of myocardial infarction.
Pulmonary:  The patient was noted to have bilateral wheezing which resolved with Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.
He also had coarse upper airway breath sounds.
Chest x-ray was not consistent with pneumonia, however, during this hospitalization there was a question of possible microaspiration.
Gastrointestinal:  Although guaiac positive stools were documented at the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, no such stools were documented at the [**Hospital1 69**].
Thus, the differential is quite large including ischemic colitis, diverticulitis, infectious colitis or other sources of colonic or upper GI bleeding.
Given the patient's rapid turnaround and non elevated LDH, ischemic colitis was thought to be unlikely.
This, instead, may have represented an infectious colitis which spontaneously resolved or may represent other source of gastrointestinal bleeding which is intermittent.
Infectious Disease:  Given the patient's urinary analysis and urinary cultures, it was thought that the patient most likely suffered from urosepsis.
As such, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin were initially started given his history of MRSA colonization.
A midline IV was placed for completion of a 10 day course of Vancomycin for treatment of his MRSA urosepsis.
Renal:  Initially the patient was noted to have an elevated creatinine of 5.5.
As such, the patient's ACE inhibitor was restarted without difficulty.
Mild mental retardation.
Coronary artery disease status post MI.
History of gallstone pancreatitis.
History of guaiac positive stools.
