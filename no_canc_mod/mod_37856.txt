SINGLE SEMI UPRIGHT AP BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: All invasive lines and tubes have been removed including right-sided chest tube.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Lung volumes are low and retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis in this postoperative patient, though consolidation is also a possibility.
Moderate left pleural effusion is new.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
Moderate left pleural effusion and retrocardiac opacity (likely atelectasis in this postoperative patient) are new compared to [**2169-4-3**].

No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Moderate symmetric LVH.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.

No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed globally.
No aortic insufficiency seen.
Chest tubes removed without incident.
He had fevers of unknown source post op, all his workup was negative.
He had some atrial fibrillation which converted to normal sinus with beta blockade.
