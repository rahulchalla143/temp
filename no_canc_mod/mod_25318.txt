Patient reports that he was gardening with his wife at 11:30, and he almost fell due to right leg weakness.
He went into the house to sit down and was initially feeling a bit better, but his wife was very concerned, so she took him to his PCP.
He noted that as he was waiting to see his primary care physician he continued to have mild difficulty walking and right leg weakness.
He denies any difficulty understanding questions.
In addition to his speech, language, and weakness issues he also notes that in the past he has had long-standing issues with discoordination possibly due to a "mini-stroke," and this was also worse today while in general it had been improving over the past few years.
He was noted to have elevated blood pressure with SBP around 180, but since he was improving neurologically, they did not lower it.

Brief Hospital Course: 84-year old man with complex past medical history including cardiac disease status-post pacemaker, porcine aortic valve replacement, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia presenting with onset of right leg weakness and right facial droop with subsequent non-word speech and possibly right leg tingling now with symptoms improving, exam notable for right word-finding difficulties and low-frequency naming difficulty, right facial droop, and trace right pronator drift but no obvious weakness.
CT head from OSH reveals right basal ganglia bleed differential diagnosis includes amyloid, unlikely because not lobar, tumor, or arteriovenous malformation, but far more likely hypertensive given known history of hypertension and classic location of bleed.
Lisinopril 5 mg PO daily   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Diversified VNA and hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: 12 x 10 mm hemorrhagic stroke in the left basal ganglia.
High blood pressure Diabetes Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.
