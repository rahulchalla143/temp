Preop workup included an echocardiogram which demonstrated critical aortic stenosis and a cardiac catheterization was scheduled.
This confirmed severe Aortic stenosis with moderate mitral regurgitation also.

Dense aortic valve calcification, in keeping with known aortic stenosis with moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic calcification in the thoracic aorta.
Dense mitral annular calcification.
Enlarged pulmonary arteries, most likely in keeping with pulmonary hypertension.
Tiny pulmonary nodules in the right lung as described above.
Nonspecific, hypodense lesions in the caudate lobe and segment II of the liver.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild to Moderate mitral regurgitation.
the mitral regurgitation was felt to be not sever enough in the Operating [**Last Name (un) **] after aortic replacement to warrant surgical repair.
The Coumadin was resumed for atrial fibrillation and she was transferred to the floor.
