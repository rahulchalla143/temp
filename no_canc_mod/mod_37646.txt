The patient received multiple shocks to achieve a stable rhythm and was intubated for respiratory failure.
On day 2 of hospitalization there was 24hour period of sepsis physiology requiring a brief period on pressors and broad antibiotic coverage.
The patient was treated empirically for C. difficile infection and received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator on [**2108-10-17**].
CARDIAC Long QT: During investigation of the etiology of the patient's cardiac arrest, it was noted that he had a prolonged QT interval on ECG.
Additionally an old ECG shows a long QT interval.
A tox screen was positive for opiates and THC, however it is known the patient takes methadone for low back pain.
As Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with hypokalemia and required regular supplementation, he was started on standing potassium.
In addition, an ICD was placed for prevention of recurrence.
The procedure went well and no hematomas developed.
During the hospitalization he required olanzapine for agitation secondary to anoxic brain injury.
Pump:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with cardiogenic shock.
A v-gram showed possible takatsubo on the night of admission however an echocardiogram on [**10-8**] was essentially nl.
PULMONARY Respiratory Failure:  The reason for intubation was thought to be due to acute asthma.
ABG on admission showed respiratory acidosis and elevated lactate.
The diagnosis of PE was also considered.
He was given nebulizer treatments for acute asthma and completed a course of vanco/zosyn for concern of aspiration pneumonia.
He has a known history of rectal fistula.
Cultures for C. diff were sent which were negative, however based on the frequency of diarrhea and his elevated white count, he was started on flagyl for empiric treatment of C diff.
Of note, per pt, he is hepatitis C positive.
A hepatitis C RNA by PCR test was pending at discharge.
FEN: As the patient presented with hypokalemia and has been having frequent loose stools, he will require close potassium monitoring given long QT syndrome .
NEURO The patient suffered from a possible anoxic brain injury of unclear extent.
A head CT done on admission shows an old infarct with no acute changes.
Of note, the patient was taking xanax as an outpatient so at the onset of the delirium the differential included ICU delirium vs. steroid induced vs opiate/benzo withdrawal.
ID Leukocytosis: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an elevated WBC count during the admission which was felt to be due to c. diff vs. prednisone (WBC demarginalization) vs. UTI.
He finished a course of vanco/zosyn for aspiration pneumonia and is currently being treated empirically for C. diff.
Code: Full Code  Medications on Admission: Xanax 2 mg three times a day Prednisone PRN Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently started) Advair 50/500 Albuterol PRN Aciphex 20 mg QD Methadone for back pain (40/30/30)   Discharge Medications: 1.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 25759**] & Rehab Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Ventricular Fibrillation Cardiac Arrest  Secondary: Long QT syndrome Hypokalemia   Discharge Condition: Good, stable, ambulating independently.
Discharge Instructions: You had a sudden cardiac arrest related to a rhythm disturbance within your heart and possibly made worse by a diarrheal illness.
