No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 1. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response -- Monitored on telemetry throughout course.
She had appoximately one episode of atrial fib daily, with rates up to 130s, but asymptomatic.
A TSH was normal, and free T4 slightly low, but unlikely a cause of her arrhythmia.
2. acute renal failure -- multifactorial from Bactrim and prerenal on admission, resolved quickly with fluids.
4. diarrhea -- may also have been related to Bactrim, as she did not have diarrhea after transfer to the floor.
5. duodenitis -- incidental finding on CT imaging on admission.
The trauma surgical service was consulted in the ED, and felt no intervention was necessary.
Initially, there was some concern this may be related to c. difficile, however there was little clinical evidence as diarrhea resolved and WBC count normalized.
No oxygen requirement or dyspnea.
PCP notified of radiographic finding.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**1-18**] inhalations Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response 2. acute renal failure, resolved   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were brought to the emergency room with rash, diarrhea and fatigue.
You were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), as well as acute renal failure.
While on coumadin, you are at increased risk of bleeding, so it is important not to fall, participate in contact sports or games, and follow up with a doctor if you have any evidence of bleeding.
Please call you primary doctor with any questions or concerns, and return to the emergency room with any chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, mental status change, or other concern.
