Admission Date:  [**2185-7-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-8-12**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: Intracranial hemorrhage - transfer from [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 47**]   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 85 yo Russian speaking only man w/ PAF, HTN, chronic anemia, recent E. coli sepsis presenting with ICH in the setting of altered mental status earlier today.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital6 1109**] [**7-14**] with fever and found to be septic w/ E-coli.
This afternoon he had a change in MS from being completely alert and oriented to starting to talk to himself.
Non-contrast head CT was done at 3pm to assess the change in mental status and found intracranial hemorrhage in the R hemisphere measuring 3.7 x 6.6 cm with associated midline shift at the OSH.
During his work up for a source of bacteremia he had an abdominal CT w/ possible air behind duodenum.
No source for sepsis has been found but given possible GI source, his ABX was switched to Unasyn as of [**7-18**].
Paroxysmal Atrial fib - in sinus whole hospitalization - Not on Coumadin for unclear reasons 2.
Hypertension 3.
Chronic anemia 4.
Dementia 8. s/p appendectomy  Social History: Lives at home with wife.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam: T C HR /min, RR/min  BP / mmHg Pulse ox 100%RA Gen:  Awake - talks to himself but unclear if dysarthria present  or fluent given only in Russian.
Neck: Supple, no meningismus.
CVR: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Lung: Clear Abd: +BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended.
Extrem: No edema  Neuro: MS - Awake and continually talks to self but unclear if speech coherent, fluent or dysarthric since only in Russian.
Impression:  Patient is a 85 yo Russian-speaking man initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] with fever and found to be septic who was improving with IV ABX but found to have change in ME with NCHCT revealing R tempo-occipital hemorrhage.
On exam, patient appears confused and does not follow commands although there is a severe language barrier.
No clear difference in tone but L side reflexes > R.     Pertinent Results: CT CNS w/o contrast: 06/ 30 There is a very large lobar-type hematoma spanning the right parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, with internal layering of blood products suggesting a hematocrit effect.
Surrounding edema is relatively mild, given the size of the hematoma.
There is associated 2-mm left shift of the third ventricle and inferior anterior falx, as well as mild narrowing of the right limb of the quadrigeminal plate cistern.
Extracranial soft tissue structures and bones are unremarkable.
CT abd/pelvis [**2185-7-21**];  A 6 x 7 mm ground-glass nodule in the right lower lobe.
Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
Sigmoidal colonic wall thickening without signs of acute inflammation indicative of circular muscle hypertrophy associated with diverticulosis.
Sigmoidal diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Gas in the bladder likely secondary to Foley instrumentation.
EEG [**2185-7-26**] BACKGROUND: There is a localized posterior quadrant polymorphic delta slowing of [**2-23**] Hz on the right that seems to obliterate the occipital region on the right.
There is a 10 Hz posterior predominant rhythm seen in the left hemisphere.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the localized posterior quadrant slowing on the right with associated obliteration of the occipital rhythm which suggests cortical involvement.
There was no seizure activity detected.
A CT of the head was obtained on [**2185-7-19**], which revealed a large lobar hematoma in the right cerebral hemisphere.
Given the patient's age, it was felt to be most likely secondary to amyloid angiopathy.
This unfortunately revealed significant motion artifact.
In regards to further evaluation for his etiology of bleed, MRI brain could not be obtained due to his pacemaker.
On [**7-21**] patient was found to have temp of 100.6, leukocytosis, worsening mental status, and possible nuchal rigity on examination.
He had been completing a course of unasyn for e coli bacteremia noted from outside hospital.
He was empirically treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin due to suspicion of meningitis.
An LP was not performed due to the large hemorrhage and mass effect on CT head.
Blood cultures, urine culture, and CXR, as well as CT abd/pelvis showed no obvious infectious source.
On [**7-26**] AM patient was noted to have brief episode (20 seconds) of left gaze deviation, decreased responsiveness and rhythmic eye blinking.
The patient was also started on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
He has not shown any further activity concerning for seizure since this episode.
He had a repeat CT head which showed no new hemorrhage and x-ray of rib and R shoulder which did not show a fracture.
His pain has resolved with tylenol, and he is currently pain-free.
Patient will be discharged home on aspirin and keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for stroke.
Hospital Bed Diagnosis; right-sided temporal occipital stroke Reason for hospital bed; the patient has very limited movement of his left arm and leg.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) R temporal occipital hemorrhage, likely secondary to amyloid angiopathy.
2) HTN 3) Dementia   Discharge Condition: Awake, arousable to voice, follows commands and verbalizes.
Pinpoint pupils, moves all extremities against gravity (but minimally on left), increased tone L > R, mild left sided neglect.
Please return to the emergency department immediately for any changes in mental status, speech, or motor function.
