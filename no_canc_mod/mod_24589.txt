Per patient had been in USOH when developed worsening of breath over the last 3-4days.
Developed in the setting of rhinorrhea so patient thought symptoms reflective of URI so treated symptomatically.
In last 2 days developed worsening dyspnea on exerion with labored breathing after walking only a block.
He reported associated chest tightness, pleuritic CP with deep breath as well as diaphoresis.
Symptoms prompted presentation to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3011**].
Patient received Lovenox 100mg in setting of arrhythmia and instructed to present to the ED.
CTA with PE involving RUL, RML, RLL, lingula, and LLL - no evidence of pulmonary infarct or R heart strain.
Due to c/o SOB and labile HRs decision made to admit to the MICU overnight for monitoring.
On arrival to the MICU, patient with continued complaint of chest tightness and intermittent SOB.
Both thromboembolic events occurred in the context of lower extremity surgeries.
No B sx with excpetion of sweats in acute setting.
No recent immobilizations, recent car trips.
Past Medical History: DM c/b neuropathy HTN OSA HL History of DVT status post left knee total replacement right fasciotomy of four compartments right knee replacement three times   Social History: Retired construction worker Lives in [**Location 5028**] with wife - [**Name (NI) 1139**]: 1yr hx 50yr ago - Alcohol: case of beer/week - Illicits: denies  Family History: No h/o of clot disorders or malignancies   Physical Exam: admission exam HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: tachycardic, irregularly irregular, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait deferred, finger-to-nose intact .
Possible inferior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Poor R wave progression, probably normal variant.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Extensive pulmonary emboli as described above without evidence of right heart strain or pulmonary infarct although perfusion abnormalities are suspected in each lung.
(Filling defects are present in the segmental and subsegmental branches of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery, lingular branch of the left upper lobe pulmonary artery, branches of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery, right middle lobe pulmonary artery and right upper lobe pulmonary artery.)
Right upper lobe ground-glass nodule of 13 mm and additional smaller nodules.
Suspected bony demineralization and mild loss in height among several lower thoracic vertebral bodies.
LENIs: IMPRESSION: Near occlusive left popliteal venous thrombosis.
TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%) secondary to very mild global hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No significant valvular disease.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild ascending aorta dilatation.
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Image quality was suboptimald - poor esophageal the patient.
TEE [**4-7**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s).
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 65YM h/o DVT, DM c/b neuropathy presenting with DOE found to have multiple pulmonary emboli, course complicated by atrial flutter requiring cardioversion.
Largest risk factor is history of previous DVT.
In addition patient obese with relative immobility in setting of chronic lower extremity pain; however lacks recent surgical interventions, recent long travel, or hx of malignancy to additionally predispose.
His CT angiogram did not show signs of right heart strain and after a brief episode of hypotension on arrival to the ED he was hemodynamically stable.
# Atrial flutter: Likely triggered by pulmonary emboli resulting in acute stretch of right atrium.
He underwent an attempted TEE guided cardioversion which was unsuccessful on [**4-4**] (could not get good visualization of heart to r/o thrombus).
He subsequently underwent a second attempt on [**4-7**] which successfully ruled out thrombus and he was cardioverted to sinus without any complications.
# HTN: Lasix (which he does not take anyway) and lisinopril initially held in setting of acute clot.
CHRONIC INACTIVE ISSUES:  # Hyperlipidemia: on simvastatin 80 mg on admission, however this was decreased to 10 mg in the setting of starting diltiazem, given increased risk for rhabdomyolysis.
# GERD: continued omeprazole  # Chronic LE pain: continued cymbalta and PRN tylenol  TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: # Anticoagulation: will need to have INR followed at his PCP's office for titration of his coumadin dosing.
[**Month (only) 116**] consider hypercoagulable work up as an outpatient # Lung opacity:  CTA chest showed right upper lobe ground-glass nodule of 13 mm.
You were found to have blood clots in your lungs.
