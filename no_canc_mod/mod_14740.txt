CXR: Limited study, with findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema; the right-sided predominance raises the possibility of underlying mitral valvular disease, particularly regurgitation .
No central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
Multifocal airspace opacities and consolidations, most prominent in the right upper lung.
Findings are most consistent with an infectious process, and PCP and other opportunistic pathogens should be considered given the patient's immunosuppressed status.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions, but no septal thickening or other evidence of pulmonary edema.
Lower extremity U/S from [**7-5**]: No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.

HR PR QRS QT/QTc  P QRS T 73 160 98 422/444 45 13 48     Brief Hospital Course: # Upper lobe infiltrates/PNA: Pt was transfered with fever, mental status changes & hypoxia/hypercarbia.
CTA showed upper lobe infiltrates and pt was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including Bactrim for possible PCP.
Pt was noted to desat when sleeping thought likely due to apneic episodes and she was offered BiPAP as tolerated when sleeping.
Ultimately, pt was switched to Levofloxacin 750mg daily to complete a 10 day course of treatment for community acquired pneumonia.
PT was consulted and her ambulatory sats improved and pt was encouraged to continue with home PT & albuterol/atrovent nebs as needed for wheezing and SOB.
# Hypoxia: Pt presented with community acquired PNA and has a signficant restrictive defect on PFTs.
However, pt likely has some component of pulm HTN from obesity/hypoventilation & untreated OSA.
# HIV/HCV: Pt has co-infection with HIV/HCV and has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**], ID was consulted on admission.
However, CD4 percentage preserved at 25% suggesting that this number is falsely depressed due to her acute infections.
Pt had an MRI performed for question of subacute mental status changes that was read as normal.
Pt was also noted to have an outbreak of HSV2 genital lesions, this was treated empirically with Acyclovir for a 7 day course and symptoms/lesions resolved.
# Chronic Pain: Pt has a long history of chronic pain thought due to neuropathy that has been managed most recently on Methadone.
The methadone dose was decreased and pt was continued at Methadone 45mg TID with oxycontin increased to 30mg [**Hospital1 **] and Oxycodone 5-15mg prn severe breakthrough pain.
The goal is for the patient to be weaned slowly from methadone given that this pain regimen has not been very effective for her and she had signs of prolonged QT on admission likely due to her methadone regimen on admission.
QTc remained stable in the 420-440ms range for the week at Methadone 45mg TID  and pt is scheduled to follow up with chronic pain clinic on [**7-12**].
# Mental Status Changes: There was concern on arrival from the OSH for ongoing mental status changes.
# BRBPR: Pt reported having BRBPR & scant red blood was seen around anus, guaic positive stool apprec on rectal exam.
Pt has history of hematochezia thought due to internal hemorrhoids vs diverticulosis.
