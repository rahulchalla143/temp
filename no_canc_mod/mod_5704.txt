Admission Date:  [**2141-3-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2141-3-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-5-21**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Chronic renal insufficiency, status post MI, status post CABG x5, hypertension, and dyslipidemia admitted with hypotension, acute renal failure, and altered mental status for approximately three days.
The patient was recently diagnosed with pansensitive E. coli UTI on [**2-27**].
Several days prior to admission, the patient reportedly developed rhinorrhea, myalgia.
No cough or fevers, however.
She received IV fluids, Solu-Medrol, and empiric ceftriaxone.
Renal ultrasound did show mild right hydronephrosis.
Systemic lupus erythematosus.
Remote history of lupus nephritis.
Chronic prednisone.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
CAD status post CABG in [**2136**].
Peripheral vascular disease status post right BK to peroneal.
Type 2 diabetes diet controlled.
Glaucoma eyedrops.
Extremity examination:  Notable for ulnar deviation as well as prominent metacarpophalangeal joints.
No joint swelling or pain noted.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
She rapidly responded to IV fluid hydration in both her blood pressure as well as her renal function.
Her hypotension was likely related from hypovolemia in addition to her poor p.o.
intake as well as diuretic therapy possibly also relating to her borderline adrenal insufficiency upon presentation in the setting of acute URI.
There was no evidence of sepsis, however, based on the patient's laboratory data and her overall improvement without antibiotic therapy, the patient was able to take p.o.
She was given IV fluids on a prn basis and her hypotension resolved quickly.
Acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient was presenting with a BUN and creatinine well above her baseline.
Question was could this have been related to Bactrim-induced ATN versus ischemic injury in the setting of hypotension or possibly dehydration in the setting of diuretic therapy.
Delta MS:  The patient had a head CT without any acute changes.
There is no evidence of any cardiac or pulmonary complications relating to her lupus.
She had a minimal insulin requirement.
CAD:  The patient had an elevated CK on admission, however, she did have myalgias as well as a URI recently, which could have contributed to this as well as being on a statin.
She did not have any evidence of acute ischemic injury on EKG and with followup cardiac enzymes.
Hematologic:  The patient presented with a 6-point hematocrit drop in the setting of hemodilution as well as thrombocytopenia with a platelet nadir of 96,000 on admission.
Patient remained guaiac negative.
Heparin was discontinued for DVT prophylaxis in the setting of her decreased platelet count.
Acute renal failure.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Lupus nephritis.
