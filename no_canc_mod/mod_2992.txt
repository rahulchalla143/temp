Type A aortic dissection originating from the aortic root near the origin of the right coronary artery, extending through the ascending aorta to terminate proximal to the origin of the right innominate artery.
There is aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta and thoracic arch with extensive mural thrombus and atheromatous ulceration.
A small amount of hemopericardium is associated.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications and mural thrombus involving an aneurysmally dilated abdominal aorta, with the infrarenal aorta measuring up to 3.8 cm.
Ectasia of the common iliac arteries bilaterally and aneurysmal dilatation of the right common femoral artery to 2.4 cm.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis.
Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3904**] DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] Approved: MON [**2188-5-5**] 8:27 AM    Imaging Lab  Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small inferolateral pericardial effusion.
If clinically indicated, a follow-up study be laboratory son[**Name (NI) 16272**] may be able to better clarify the severity of aortic stenosis.
Detailed discussion held with family given extremely high risk for surgery.
On hospital day three while walking with physical therapy he had pain in upper chest and throat.
Pain continued to persist adn after discussing it with him, morphine was given for pain.
