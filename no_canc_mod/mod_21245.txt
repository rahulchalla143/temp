He was combative and fighting against daughter, [**Name (NI) 63094**], and eventually EMS interventions.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
Per his daughter, he was recently feeling well with no fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, visual changes, previous speech or language disturbances, numbness, weakness, incoordination.
Hypertension 2.

No carotid bruits.
No rebound or guarding.
No obvious lacerations or injuries.
No obvious neglect.
Could not assess doll's eyes due to cervical collar.

Right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
The differential diagnosis for etiology of intraparenchymal hemorrhage includes traumatic hemorrhage (contusion) or primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage, including hemorrhage due to vascular malformation or neoplasm.
Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage and probable subdural hemorrhage within the right middle cranial fossa and adjacent to the tentorium.
No hydrocephalus.
Abnormalities suspected in the temporal lobes, left occipital lobe and pons raising the question of posterior circulation infarct or contusion.
--- Head CT:Stable appearance of intracranial injury.
No hydrocephalus or midline shift --- CXR [**11-9**]:FINDINGS: The aorta is tortuous and there are associated mural calcifications.
Again noted are bilateral multifocal opacities involving the right upper lobe, right lower lobe, and left lower lobe, which have worsened slightly in the interval, consistent with progressive multifocal pneumonia.
Also noted is perihilar opacification and small bilateral pleural effusions consistent with a component of heart failure.
There is dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was transferred here and found to have an ICH as well as SAH.
Unclear if this was all predicated by patient's fall or if hemorrhage secondary to underlying vascular malformation(aneurysm or AVM) or hemorrhagic malignant lesion with subsequent fall.
He had no history of malignancy though.
He developed a bilateral multifocal PNA.
We assume this is due to aspiration and probably occured before admission.
He also developed a troponin leak(accentuated by his ARF) that continued to fise slightly until his death.
Despite aggressive treatment, he continued to worsen medically, as a result of his PNa mainly and with contributions from his ARF, new ICH, new temporal strokes seen on repeat CTs.
On the day of his death, he was worsening from a pulmonary status.
His heart then began to have asystolic periods for 1-2 hours.
