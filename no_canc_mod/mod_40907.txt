There has been interval decrease in blood products seen layering posteriorly within the occipital horns of lateral ventricles (2:16).
No acute hemorrhage or large vascular territorial infarction is seen.
Focal hypodensities along the periventricular white matter (2:20, 21) and within a large area along the ACA territory bilaterally (2:10) are unchanged, compatible with encephalomalacia and chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
There is no acute fracture.
A large scalp lipoma overlying the left calvarium (2:19) is again seen.
There is mild mucosal thickening within the right ethmoid air cells.
Decreased intraventricular hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage.
Bifrontal ACA distribution infarcts superimposed on chronic microvascular ischemic changes within the periventricular white matter.
Additional right and left oblique reconstructions were performed for further evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature.
A ventriculoperitoneal shunt transverses along the right chest wall (2:31).
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications are seen throughout the thoracic aorta which is normal in caliber.
No intramural or intramural hematoma is detected.
There is no dissection.
Previously seen bilateral pulmonary emboli are no longer visualized to the subsegmental levels, although evaluation of the lower segmental and subsegmental branches is limited due to patient motion.
There is persistent moderate right basilar atelectasis with air bronchograms (3:56, 58); an early consolidation in this region cannot be excluded.
A trace right pleural effusion is decreased in size.
Scattered opacity is new in the left lower lobe posteriorly(3:52), concerning for aspiration and/or early pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no acute fracture.
No concerning blastic or lytic lesions are identified.
Interval resolutino of pulmonary emboli.
New left lower lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.
Interval decrease in trace right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 84M with recent admission for SAH secondary to aneursym s/p coiling, intraventricular shunt, trach and PEG ([**Date range (1) 91301**]), and bilateral PEs (12/12-15/11) presenting from rehab with tachypnea and found to have pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.
Active Issues: # Healthcare Associated Pneumonia: Likely secondary to aspiration event from tube feeds.
# Multiple Pulmonary Emboli: Patient had RUL,RLL, LUL and left lingula lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli at last hospitalization 12/12-19/11 and was started on coumadin with lovenox bridge.
Elevated INR likely related to metronidazole and levofloxacin use.
# C. diff: Diagnosed [**12-2**] at rehab and started on oral metronidazole which was continued during this admission.
No further diarrhea by time of admission here on [**12-8**].
# ARF: Presented with acute renal failure (creatinine elevated to 1.1 from baseline 0.5), likely prerenal [**1-17**] infection, which resolved with hydration.
Foley was placed during admission [**10/2176**], and family understands the benefit in setting of sacral ulcers.
He was treated with vancomycin and cefepime as above for pneumonia.
Chronic Issues: # Hx SAH: Patient was admitted on [**10-28**] w SAH and IVH now s/p ACOM coiling, VP shunt placement, tracheostomy and PEG placement.

You were also started on an oral antibiotic (metronidazole) for an intestinal infection called C diff.
You were also seen by the neurosurgery service while you were here because of your history of a brain hemorrhage.
