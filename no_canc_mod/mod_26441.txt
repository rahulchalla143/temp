Admission Date: [**2126-8-3**]        Discharge Date: [**2126-8-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-7-29**]        Sex:  F  Service:  Neonatology  ID: [**Known firstname 37958**] Girl [**Known lastname **] is a 1 month old former 36 [**5-23**] wk twin with a history of intraventricular hemorrhage and seizures who is being discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU.
Pregnancy complicated by IVF dichorionic, diamniotic twin gestation, and was also notable for advanced maternal age and gestational diabetes which was diet controlled.
Rupture of membranes of twin B was at delivery.
In the delivery room, twin B was noted to be hypotonic with respiratory distress.
HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE AT [**Hospital6 **]: Initial hospital course at [**Hospital **] Hospital was notable for: - Discordant twin size, with this twin growth restricted at less than 10th percentile and other twin appropriate size for gestational age; - Mild respiratory distress and oxygen requirement that resolved over first 12 hours of life, most consistent with TTN; - Initial hypoglycemia, treated with intravenous glucose with a maximum of D-15 concentration; - Polycythemia with variable hematocrit values, with initial hematocrit of 64% and reaching 73% by day of life 3, prompting partial exchange transfusion; - Mild thrombocytopenia with platelet counts 70-80s, diminishing to 50s following exchange transfusion; - Sepsis evaluation on two occasions, with initial treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin and subsequent reinitation of ampicillin and cefotaxime, with both blood cultures negative; - Mild hypocalcemia, which resolved; - Mild hyperbilirubinemia which treated with phototherapy (infant blood type B-, coombs -).
On day of life 5, infant was noted to have generalized tonic clonic seizure activity.
Head CT performed shortly after admission to [**Hospital1 **] revealed a large right intraventricular hemorrhage with parenchymal involvement.
Well perfused but pale pink, mild jaundice.
Right upper quadrant mass, distinct from liver, egg-shaped, palpable, no apparent hepatosplenomegaly.
Normal female genitalia with edematous labia.
Skin:  No apparent petechiae, bruising, purpura on examination, except evidence of site of multiple needle sticks, no apparent bleeding.
Respiratory:  The infant was stable throughout admission, breathing comfortably in room air without apnea or desaturation episodes.
Cardiovascular:  The infant was stable throughout admission, without evidence of hemodynamic instability.
As described below, the infant underwent evaluation for the abdominal mass palpated on admission, thought to be most consistent with duplication cyst.
Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary:  Abdominal mass palpated on admission.
Ultrasound was performed on [**8-5**], demonstrating a cystic mass in the mid upper abdominal region to the right of the midline measuring 3 x 3 x 3.5 cm, separate from the liver and adjacent to the gallbladder.
Differential diagnoses included duplication cyst, mesenteric cyst, and less likely a choledochal cyst or macrocystic lymphatic mass.
The mass was followed clinically at first, but due to issues with vomiting with introduction of enteral feeds, further evaluation was performed with repeat ultrasound and upper GI study, performed on [**2126-8-14**] at [**Hospital3 1810**].
Repeat ultrasound suggested the mass was most consistent with duplication cyst, and upper GI study showed displacement of the duodenal loop but no evidence of obstruction of flow.
She required treatement for hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy for several days after transfer.
On admission to the [**Hospital1 69**], she had a platelet count of 43 and was given a platelet transfusion.
Head CT was performed on [**8-3**], demonstrating bilateral germinal matrix bleed with extension into the ventricular and peri-ventricular matter on the right side.
There was no ventricular dilatation.
Clinical seizures resolved, and EEG on [**8-8**] demonstrated no seizure activity.
Multiple head ultrasounds showed expected evolution of the right-sided intraventricular hemorrhage, with gradual cystic changes noted in the periventricular areas bilaterally.
Head MRI was performed on [**8-28**], and revealed bilateral right greater than left multicystic encephalomalacia, primarily in the periventricular areas but also extending slightly beyond.
Hemorrhagic changes were seen within the damaged white matter areas, with a large subependymal hemorrhage in the right lateral ventricle.
Overall these findings were thought to be most consistent with a prior hypoxic ischemic injury, with secondary hemorrhage.
Repeat EEG was also performed on [**8-23**], secondary to persistent limited PO feeding, and revealed a generally normal background without seizure activity.
Occupational therapy has been following the infant throughout, and has noted increased tone diffusely.
Intraventricular hemorrhage.
4  Rule out sepsis with antibiotics.
