Usually the patient has a baseline cough with white sputum.
He states he has been getting short of breath in just walking around a room, or talking while standing at work.
No hematemesis.

Compared with [**2155-7-22**], no significant change is detected and no superimposed infiltrate is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo man with h/o bronchiectasis presents with increased shortness of breath and sputum production.
Shortness of breath: The patient was afebrile and did not have an elevated white count.
His CXR was not remarkable for infiltrate, but note that it is a difficult CXR to read given his large R mediastinal shift with a heart that is now almost entirely R sided.
Notably, on the pt's last admission, his sputum grew out pseudomonas, but it is unclear whether this is a colonized state for the patient, as he has had bronchiectasis since he was a child, or whether this represented a pneumonia.
The patient stated that his dyspnea felt much improved.
