3) No evidence of pneumothorax  Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2180-2-16**]  10:36:32 AM Sinus tachycardia.
Modest diffuse ST-T wave changes with slight ST segment elevation - could be due to early repolarization pattern but consider also, possible pericarditis.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief HPI and Hospital Course Overview (details are subcategorized after overview):  Ms. [**Known lastname 976**] is a 38 year old femal with a recent HIV diagnosis (CD4 200, VL High), H/O Childhood Rickets who had a prolonged (three months) ICU course for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, presumed secondary to multilobar PNA and then ARDS.
She was febrile and hypoxic with impending respiratory failure and multilobar infitrates on chest imaging.
Given her declining respiratory status, she required nontraditional maneuvers for oxygenation including an abdominal binder/proning, and neuromuscular paralysis.
There were multiple unsuccessful attempts at weaning from steroids, which seemed to support her oxygenation despite negative PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] etiology of her respiratory failure was not found, but possibly illicit drug-induced lung disease with superimposed PNA.
Called-out to Medicine: The patient had no further events other than paroxysms of anxiety.
1) Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient initially pt had multilobar pneumonia that evolved into ARDS.
She was put on multiple antibiotics, including levoquin, vancomycin, zosy, levoquin, meropenem, ambisome, and bactrim plus solumedrol for empiric PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] BAL was done which was unremarkable, as were the other two done during her admission.
Her respiratory status declined progressively during admission, and she required nontraditional maneuvers for oxygenation including an abdominal binder and proning, and neuromuscular paralysis with cisatracurium.
An esophageal balloon was placed which revealed elevated intrathoracic pressures and her PEEP was increased accordingly.
She had multiple unsuccessful multiple attempts at weaning from steroids due to oxygenation problems despite negative PCP.
She had multiple episodes of agitation where she became tachypnic, tachycardic and diaphoretic without spiking a fever, which in retrospect were likely due to both pain and anxiety.
The exact cause of her respiratory failure was never clear, but was likely from underlying drug induced lung disease with superimposed pneumonia.
At d/c, she must continue prednisone 40mg daily for control of her respiratory disease.
She was on and off many empiric antimicrobial agents for multiple fevers.
She had a culture/ID history directed microbial therapy summarized as follows: Positive culture history: OSH: positive HIV antibody test [**1-4**]: HIV-1 positive VL [**1-11**]: 3/4 bottles coag neg staph with line tip positive [**1-13**]: Lip sore: HSV-1 [**1-22**]: UrCx: VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **] [**1-24**]: catheter tip coag neg staph [**2-2**]: CMV viral load 1320 copies per ml, [**2-5**] 1080.
[**2-11**]: UrCx: VRE [**2-13**]: UrCx: VRE [**2-17**] Urine: Citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa (both [**Last Name (un) 36**] zosyn and ceftaz) [**2-18**]: Blood Cx: budding yeast [**2-19**]: UrCx: no growth [**2-20**]: G tube swab: coag neg staph, yeast Treatments:  *Yeast - The patient had a single positive in fungal isolator [**2-18**].
After another urine culture was positive for VRE on [**2-12**], her foley was replaced and changed to 3 day course of daptomycin for better urinary penetration.
On [**2-17**] she was found to have citrobacter and pseudomonas in her urine which treated with 3 days of ceftaz then zosyn.
*CMV viral load - This was found to be low level positive at 1320 copies.
She had an opthalmologic exam which was negative for CMV.
* diarrhea - multiple stool cultures, and A dif A and B toxin were checked and persistently negative.
* finger necrosis - she developed dry gangrene of her left distal digits ([**1-8**]).
The etiology was unclear, but was likely via clotting from sepsis/DIC or septic emboli.
However, she had no clear signs of endocarditis and had no vegetiations on ECHO.
On discharge, she was pain free with decreased distal sensation.
She says that there were from pain and anxiety over her condition.
The pt is NOT to be given benzodiazepines per Psych consultant, as she does not have anxiety disorder requiring these medications and reintroduction of benzodiazepines may create drug dependence.
She is to be given seroquel 25mg TID prn for anxiety, in addition to her standing seroquel dose.
5) abdominal pain - The patient had multiple episodes of abd pain but two separate CT scans of her abdomen negative.
The first time her amylase and lipase were slightly elevated (315 and 156 peak, respectively) but CT showed no pancreatitis.
Her LFT's were slightly elevated during admission but hepatitis antibodies were negative.
The second time she had abdominal pain she was felt to have gas pain or pain from atovaquone and was started on simethicone after abdominal CT was negative.
6) Magnesium requirement - The patient has an unusually large magnesium requirement, which is thought to potentially be from rebuilding her muscle.
7) EKG changes - The patient was noted to have new T wave inversions on EKG with possible slight ST elevation on [**2-9**] which was new since [**1-29**].
8) Anemia - The patient was noted to have chronic, stable anemia, and required 4 units of blood total.
She was given reglan for gastric motility as she had high residual volumes after G tube feeds.
