Right internal jugular temporary HD line ([**2163-9-27**])   History of Present Illness: Briefly, Mrs. [**Known lastname 9037**] is a 62 year old female with a past medical history significant for ESRD on MWF HD, DM 2, HTN, COPD, carotid stenosis s/p PCI and PVD admitted for fever and found to have MSSA bacteremia from an infected AV graft s/p AVG revision.
The patient underwent "jump graft" procedure on [**2163-9-26**] that was complicated by edema and bleeding.
In addition, her hospital course has been complicated by a new O2 requirement felt to be atelectasis versus volume overload.
Past Medical History: -ESRD, secondary to HTN and DM, on HD M/W/F via left upper arm AV graft created [**2162-11-30**], considering transplant with extended criteria donor -Type 2 DM, c/b nephropathy and retinopathy -HTN -Anemia -PVD, s/p left extremity arteriography, left superficial femoral artery, popliteal and anterior tibial angioplasty -Hyperlipidemia -COPD -s/p PCI of carotid stenosis with stent to L ICA, on ASA and plavix -s/p cholecystectomy -s/p C-section -s/p surgery for retinopathy, cataracts   Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 9037**] is married and lives with her husband and daughter.
Physical Exam: VS: Tc 98.5, Tm 99.3, 142/44, 80, 18, 97%1L GA: awake, NAD HEENT:  EOMI, PERRL, minimally reactive pupils, b/l lens transplant, MMM, oropharynx clear without erythema or exudate, no LAD, no JVD, neck supple, no conjunctival hemorrhage CV: RRR, nl S1+S2, no M/R/G Lung: CTAB, no wheezes, rales or rhonchi Abd: soft, NT, ND, +BS, no rebound or guarding, no HSM Extremities: W/WP, no C/C/E, 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally, LUE with dressing w/serous drainage in place over AVG revision Skin: warm, dry and intact with no rashes.
L knee with hypopigmented area from fall Neuro/Psych: A+Ox3.
CN II-XII grossly intact with no focal deficit.
Mild perinephric fat stranding bilaterally, without hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
Small right upper lobe pulmonary nodules.
These may represent the residual of consolidation which was previously present in that location.
Nevertheless, followup to exclude pulmonary nodules is recommended with a dedicated CT scan of the chest in approximately 6-12 months.
Atherosclerotic disease.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
[**2163-9-29**] TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHO: IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis.
No finding to suggest thoracolumbar vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis or paraspinal, or epidural fluid collection or abscess.
T8-9 and T9-10 left paracentral and foraminal protrusions, respectively, without spinal cord or exiting neural impingement.
Normal thoracic spinal cord caliber and intrinsic signal intensity.
L4-5: Disc degeneration with moderate bulging and bilateral subarticular zone stenosis without definite neural impingement.
Brief Hospital Course: # MSSA Bacteremia/AVG infection: Ms. [**Known lastname 9037**] was transferred to the MICU shortly after admission for hypotension, fever and altered mental status concerning for sepsis.
The source was felt to be an infected AV graft in her left arm.
On Tuesday [**2163-9-27**], she had a hemodialysis session through a temporary HD line in the right IJ.
During this HD session, she felt unwell with abdominal pain and developed a fever shortly thereafter.
TTE from [**2163-9-27**] and TEE from [**2163-9-29**] showed no evidence of endocarditis.
She intermittently complained of back and neck pain similar to her previous arthritis pain, but an MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine showed no evidence of thoracolumbar vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, or paraspinal or epidural fluid collection or abscess.
# ESRD: Patient initially had a right internal jugular temporary line but had repeated problems with clotting of the line.
# HTN: Home antihypertensives were held during most of the admission, but the patient began to have SBPs in the low 200s.
# Hypoxia: Likely secondary to atelectasis.
Denied any shortness of breath on discharge.
# DM2: Patient's disease c/b nephropathy and retinopathy.
# COPD: Continued ipratropium-albuterol nebs as needed for shortness of breath.
# Arthritis: Patient had intermittent neck and back pain and was treated with tramadol 50 mg q6h prn.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Tramadol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for back pain.
[**Month/Day/Year **]:*QS * Refills:*2*  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus sepsis Arteriovenous graft infection End-stage renal disease  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for a fever and found to have an infection in your blood from your infected A-V graft.
You had ongoing bleeding from the site of your A-V graft revision and this was followed by the transplant surgeons.
