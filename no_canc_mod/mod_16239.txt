[**2188-11-17**]: CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Large hypodense focus in the left MCA distribution likely represents cystic encephalomalacia from prior infarct and is associated with ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is likely the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemia.
Posterior right cerebellar hypodensity is associated with dystrophic calcification and likely the sequelae of prior insult.
Mild mucosal thickening and small air fluid level noted in the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Chronic left MCA infarct with encephalomalacia.
[**2188-11-17**] PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely unchanged, allowing for positioning with atherosclerotic mural calcification of the thoracic aorta again noted.
There are bilateral parenchymal opacities projecting over the lower lungs.
There is no evidence of large effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: 1) New bilateral lower lung opacities likely represent multifocal consolidation, including aspiration pneumonitis.
2) Gas-distended stomach and bowel loops may benefit from nasogastric tube decompression.
Intraventricular conduction disturbance.
Non-specific St segment depressions in leads V3-V4 with T wave inversions in these leads.
QS deflections in leads III and aVF compatible with transmural inferior wall myocardial infarction - old.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-2-7**] atrial fibrillation with continuous ventricular pacing at rate 60 was previously present.
Pacemaker is currently inhibited because of rapid atrial fibrillation.
[**2188-11-19**]: VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  Reason: difficulty swallowing  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 year old man with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: difficulty swallowing INDICATION: CVA with difficulty swallowing.
There was significant delay of the oral phase and moderate delay of the pharyngeal phase with premature spillover of all consistencies but worst with thin liquids.
There was impaired palatal elevation and premature upper esophageal sphincter closure.
Minimal residue was seen in the piriform sinuses.
There was no penetration or aspiration with barium of any consistency.
Moderate delay in pharyngeal phase.
Impaired palatal elevation with premature upper esophageal sphincter closure.
Minimal residue in the piriform sinuses.
No penetration or aspiration with any consistency.
US doppler: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT involving the right or left lower extremity.
Residual bilateral interstitial infiltration is stable since [**11-19**], improved on the right since [**11-17**].
Moderate cardiomegaly stable.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  Reason: r/o obstruction  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 M with abdominal distension REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o obstruction ABDOMEN, [**11-23**]  HISTORY: Abdominal distention.
IMPRESSION: Two views of the upper supine abdomen show generalized gaseous distention of the colon.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are extensive multifocal, ill-defined opacities present at the lung bases.
Small pleural effusions with associated atelectasis are also noted.
Detailed assessment of the intra-abdominal cavity is somewhat limited secondary to streak artifact from the patient's right arm.
A smaller laterally located low- attenuation lesion measuring approximately 9 mm likely represents a simple renal cyst but is poorly characterized on this evaluation (2:31).
Note is made of an IVC filter located within the inferior vena cava.
The stomach and small bowel appear unremarkable.
There are no distended loops of small bowel.
Once again, the colon is noted to be markedly distended and several air-fluid levels are seen throughout the abdomen and pelvis.
A small area of narrowing at the splenic flexure is present but no definite transition point or mechanical obstruction is identified, and may be positional.
There is diffuse thickening of the wall of the descending colon which appears new compared to the previous evaluation.
There is no evidence of free air or free fluid present within the abdomen.
Low attenuation fluid-like material is noted within the rectum and sigmoid colon.
A 9 mm left ureterovesicular junctional stone is again noted and essentially unchanged in position compared to [**2188-7-30**].
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are present.
Degenerative changes are noted throughout the spine.
Prominently dilated colon without evidence of mechanical obstruction/transition point although there is some narrowing noted at the splenic flexure.
Findings again suggest functional pseudo-obstruction and are similar to the CT evaluation of [**2188-7-30**] with overall decreased colonic distension.
The visualized portions of the small bowel appear overall unremarkable.
New interval development of multifocal opacities present within both lung bases worrisome for aspiration.
XR abdomen: FINDINGS: Please note overall examination is limited due to marked respiratory motion artifact.
Overall size of redundant dilated colon may be slightly decreased within the descending colon measuring approximately 5 mm today from 7 mm yesterday with overall size of the cecum likely not significantly changed.
Positioning of the IVC filter, pacemaker leads, and nasogastric tumor are stable.
IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in cecal distension with perhaps slight decrease in descending colon distention.
No evidence of pneumatosis or free air.
Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient was continued on Levaquin and Flagyl to complete a 14-day course for aspiration pneumonia on [**2188-12-1**].
Colonic obstruction: Hospital course complicated by colonic pseudoobstruction.
Over the next few days, patient's abdominal distention resolved as he continued to have very large bowel movements and the rectal tube had significant drainage.
Patient should be given atleast over 500 ml of free water to drink between meals to prevent hypernatremia from recurring.
He will require help on part of the nursing staff at NH to make sure he has access to enough water to prevent volume depletion and hypernatremia.
Lasix was held at discharge as patient was already hypovolemic.
Initially, the patient did go into acute heart failure due to aggressive volume resuscitation in ICU.
Lisinopril can be restarted if BP rises at NH.
Repeat UA is recommeded to make sure that the hematuria has resolved (results above).
Further testing may be needed if hematuria persists at the discretion of PCP.
_ ________________________________________________________________  Swallow evaluation:" SUMMARY / IMPRESSION: Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) **] is at risk for aspiration [**2-22**] his severe oral deficits and mild delay in swallow initiation.
Pt will benefit from oral care prior to POs to reduce the risk of infection from aspiration of oral bacteria.
