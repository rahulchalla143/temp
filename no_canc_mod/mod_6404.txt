The patient was last seen in the Emergency Room on [**2180-10-26**] for "COPD exacerbation" after he ran out of nebulizers and being exposed to smoke in a kitchen.
At this time, he started noticing increased worsening of his dyspnea and a productive cough of white yellow sputum.
At 6:30 a.m., on the day of admission, he ran out of nebulizers and called EMTs.
He desaturated from 90% to 60%, but refused intubation, so he was placed on heliox without any improvement.
He had decreased appetite.
He denied any fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
He sleeps on three pillows and has no orthopnea.
Coronary artery disease:  Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction on [**2180-2-19**].
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55% at that time with right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation of the right ventricle with global hypokinesis of the right ventricle and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Atopic dermatitis.
Chronic anemia.
He denies any recent alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Noticeable for diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
Denies history of cancer or heart disease.
In general, he was in mild distress using sternocleidomastoid, pursed breathing in between words and sentences.
His neck showed no jugular venous distention.
His chest showed moderate air movement with expiratory wheezes and hyperresonant to percussion.
His heart was tachycardic, but regular, normal S1 and S2 with a positive S4, no murmurs or gallops.
He had no costovertebral angle tenderness.
He had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema on his extremities, but they were cool.
Chest x-ray done showed no CHF or focal consolidation, but evidence of hyperinflation consistent with emphysema.
EKG shows sinus rhythm at 97 beats per minute with atrial premature beats, which were new since the last tracing of [**2180-3-27**], normal axis, normal intervals, and no ST segment changes.
COPD exacerbation with acute respiratory failure:  Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was started on 2 liters nasal cannula of oxygen and prednisone of 60 mg p.o.
During the next couple days, series attempts were made at weaning off the nebulizer treatments and spacing them out, however, the O2 saturations dropped and the patient continued to complain of shortness of breath.
Lung nodule ?
:  On chest x-ray, the patient was found to have a lung nodule on the right middle lobe measuring 3 mm.
Per PCP's recommendations, a chest CT was ordered which showed severe bullous emphysema with large bullae at the left apex and no pulmonary nodule or mass corresponding to the abnormality described by the chest x-ray.
However, several small opacities in both lungs were noticed and recommended that it should be re-evaluated in three months.
Coronary artery disease:  EKG showed new onset of atrial premature beats.
No events during hospitalization.
Acute respiratory failure secondary to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Acute bronchitis.
