The patient presented to her PCP earlier today with chest pain and SOB.
In the ED, her chest pain resolved quickly and the initial plan was to admit her to the cardiology service for ROMI.
Upon further questioning the patient was more short of breath than she has been at baseline.
Of note, the patient has been admitted to the MICU multiple times for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
She was noted to become more somnolent and ABG showed an elevated PC02.
Past Medical History: 1)Obstructive Sleep Apnea on home CPAP, 16cm H20 2)Obesity Hypoventilation - Multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure; PFT's  consistent with a restrictive defect - PFTs: FVC 39%, FEV1 37%, FEV1/FVC 96%, TLC 59%, DLCO reduced  3)ASD with right-left shunt (12% shunt fraction documented in nuclear study from [**2116-3-30**]) 4)Pulmonary artery hypertension: Echo in [**10/2118**] demonstrated a TR gradient of 33mmHg ??????

There is acute kyphosis and extensive degenerative change in the lower thoracic spine as well as the thoracolumbar junction.
2)ECHO ([**8-22**]): Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Left atrial dilation with moderate diastolic LV dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53yo female with PMH as listed above who presents with 2 week history of worsening dyspnea and chest pain.
1)Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient presented with 2 week history of worsening shortness of breath.
She was found have an elevated PC02 of ~80 on an ABG.
She has been hospitalized multiple times for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
She does admit to some daily green sputum production, which was suggestive of a possible underlying infection.
2)Chest pain: She presented with 2 week history of chest pain, which resolved quickly in the ED.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x3, ECG was normal, and there were no events on telemetry.
3)Leukocytosis: Patient presented with mild leukocytosis of of 12.5.
She has history of UTIs on prior admissions but U/A on this admission was w/o WBCs.
She also denies any urinary frequency or burning.
No evidence of pneumonia on cxray but given history of green sputum production, she may have some tracheobronchitis.
She does not appear volume overloaded on exam.
She underwent an ECHO which showed an increase in her pulmonary pressures from 33-->50.
5)Panhypopituitarism: Thought to be secondary to "empty sella".
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) nebulizer treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Hypercarbic respiratory failure Obstructive sleep apnea Diastolic heart failure  Secondary Diagnoses: Pan-hypopituitarism   Discharge Condition: Stable-- breathing more comfortably on room air; feeling better and less short of breath.
You should use the CPCP breathing machine at night-- it will help your lungs and breathing and will help you not feel short of breath.
If you have severe chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, severe lightheadedness/dizziness, please come back to the hospital.
