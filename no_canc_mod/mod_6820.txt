Admission Date:  [**2111-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-12-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2029-12-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation/Extubation   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 5749**] is an 81F h/o dermatomyositis, HTN, dCHF, COPD presents with SOB.
Her daughter notes that she had developed a URI 2 days ago w/ rhinorrhea and mild cough.
She was sent from nursing home for evaluation as today at 10am developed SOB and desats to the 70s.
No documentation in chart from nursing home.
Exam with decreased bilat breath sounds with basilar rales.
Initially thought CHF exacerbation.
Review of CXR then did not appear to be CHF but rather possible infiltrate consistent with pneumonia so gave ceftriaxone 1g, vancomycin 1g, and levofloxacin 750mg.
Finally, they did not believe that the pneumonia on CXR could explain her hypoxia, thus a CTA chest was performed to r/o PE which showed no PE but multifocal PNA.
After some discussion, the family decided to reverse DNR status and therefore she was intubated for respiratory distress and hypercarbia, with post-intubation ABG 7.62/38/487 (550x18/5/1.0).

Right lower hemithorax opacity with unusual configuration.
There may be a component of pleural effusion, and if present, likely loculated.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Left lower lobe consolidation, right upper lobe bronchiolar pattern and peribronchial opacity in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe suggest multifocal aspiration or multifocal pneumonia.
Collapse right middle/lower lobes without obstructing mass.
Aortic, mitral annulus, and coronary artery calcifications.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: hyperdynamic left ventricle with significant diastolic dysfunction; mild aortic stenosis .
[**2111-12-5**] CXR: Limited assessment of left lower lobe - left lower lobe consolidation cannot be excluded.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 5749**] is an 81 F w/ pmh of dermatomyositis (on steroids), HTN, AS (unknown valve area), presents w/ hypoxic, hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# Respiratory failure:  Initially thought to be secondary to bilateral LL PNA seen on CT scan, and given Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Levofloxacin in the ED, however the patient did not have clinical evidence of pneumonia.
She did not have a cough, leukocytosis, increased sputum production.
More likely the etiology of the respiratory failure was multifactorial with underlying low lung volumes from elevated hemidiaphragm, URI, respiratory muscle weakness and +/- aspiration pneumonitis.
She was extubated after two days on the ventilator without difficulty.
She was afebrile without cough or sputum production.
# Dermatomyositis:  Diffuse muscle weakness contributing to respiratory failure.
Both teams recommended intensive physical therapy but no other changes in her regimen.
# Left Hip Dislocation:  The patient does not have pain from her hip dislocation that has probably been present for at least months.
# Urinary tract infection: Positive UA with catheter in place.
UA also notable for large blood with no RBCs - this was attributed to underlying dermatomyositis.
# Diastolic CHF:  The patient did not require diuresis.
# HTN: Initially held amlodipine, metoprolol and lisinopril given questionable sepsis.
# Aortic stenosis: Echo done here showed mild aortic stenosis, valve area 1.2-1.9cm2.
Hyperglycemia is likely from steroids.
# Chronic pain: Continued oxycontin, lidoderm patch, nortriptyline .

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with difficulty breathing.
It was felt that this was likely related to underlying weakness of the diaphragm and possibly an upper respiratory infection.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection.
If you have any further chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms please call your doctor or go to the Emergency Room.
