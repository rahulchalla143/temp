Admission Date:  [**2185-8-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-8-30**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**] Chief Complaint: N/V, poor PO intake x2-3 days  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 10446**] is an 84 year old woman with severe aortic stenosis and subsequent diastolic and systolic CHF, also with Rheumatoid Arthritis, coagulopathy on standing vitamin K, who presented on [**8-25**] with nausea, vomiting, and poor PO intake.
In the ED, she was found to have stable vital signs but acute renal failure (creatinine 3.4), hyperkalemia (5.8), and acutely elevated LFT's (ALT 1253, AST 2409, LDH 2200).
Ultrasound was consistent with acute hepatitis, without evidence of vascular throbmosis or cirrhosis.
KUB was without evidence of any bowel obstruction.
Her hyperkalemia was managed with insulin, calcium gluconate, kayexalate and albuterol nebs.
Surgery team evaluated the abd CT which did not show evidence of obstrucion or ischemia despite elevated lactate of 5.
Renal was also consulted and thought her renal failure might be AIN given her ingestion of NSAIDs prior to admission, and by report they saw Eos in her urine.
Past Medical History: -Severe Aortic stenosis [Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate (2+) AR] -Moderate to severe MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to severe TR -H/O small bowel obstruction s/p resection [**2185-5-11**] -dCHF and mild sCHF with EF 45-50% [Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Mild global LV hypokinesis].
Hepatic congestion from R sided heart failure -Anemia of chronic disease baseline HCT 28-30 -coagulopathy on chronic Vit K -hyponatremia -CRI (Baseline Cr 0.6-2.0, last Cr 0.8 [**2185-6-11**]) .
Reduction of small bowel volvulus.
Small bowel resection, primary anastomosis.
Family History: n/c  Physical Exam: VS: T 95.9 BP 110/37 HR 62 RR 13 94%RA GEN: NAD HEENT: Dry MM, slightly icteric sclera RESP: CTABL with inspiratory crackles at R base, no wheezing CV: Reg Nml S1, S2, 3/6 SEM at loudest LUSB radiates throughout precordium, no carotid bruits or extension of murmur ABD: soft, distended, NT on palpation, no rebound, no guarding, diminished BS throughout.
EXT: no peripheral edema, warm 1+DP pulses b/l, no tremor NEURO: A&O x3, no focal deficits, 5/5 strength throughout, normal sensation throughout  Pertinent Results: [**2185-8-25**] ADMISSION LABS: CBC: WBC-12.3*# RBC-3.22* Hgb-10.6* Hct-30.9* MCV-96 MCH-32.8* MCHC-34.1 RDW-19.0* Plt Ct-215 .
[**2185-8-25**] Liver U/S: IMPRESSION: Mild hyperemia and gallbladder wall thickening of a non-distended gallbladder is likely secondary to hepatitis or third spacing.
No frank failure or consolidation noted.
No dilated loops of small bowel are evident.
There is minimal stool noted likely in the region of the cecum.
IMPRESSION:  No free air.
Liver demonstrates diffuse hypodensity.
However, since the ultrasound performed on [**2185-8-25**], did not demonstrate any fatty change within the live, this appearance is suggestive of hepatitis.
Generalized anasarca is also visualized.
This appearance might be due to intramural hematoma or due to inflammatory changes in adjacent structures like pancreatitis/hepatitis.
Small hypodense area between pancreatic head and duodenum likely representing a tiny amount of fluid.
Stable appearance of calcified mesenteric cyst within the right lower quadrant area.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Severe degree of mitral annulus calcification.
LFTs: ALT-882* AST-676* LD(LDH)-366* AlkPhos-78 TotBili-1.6*  [**2185-8-26**] 02:58AM BLOOD [**2185-8-28**] 03:43AM BLOOD  Brief Hospital Course: AP: 84 yo F with severe AS, mod-severe MR/TR, diastolic CHF c/b hepatic congestion but with preserved EF (45-50%), now presents with N/V, poor PO intake x 2 days, found to have acute hepatitis and acute renal failure.
ARF: Pt with acute renal failure in setting of poor PO intake and persistent lasix use (prerenal picture) vs. ATN with low UOP vs. possible post obstructive etiology.
Per pt she denied any excessive NSAID use, she had been taking about 3 advils for her back pain but nothing excessive.
She was unable to take any meds 2-3 days prior to admission due to persistent N/V.
A renal U/S did not show evidence of hydronephrosis.
She was started on phos binders for elevated Phos.
She initially received insulin, calcium gluconate, and kayexalate for HyperK-her EKG did not show hyperacute T waves and she had no dysrhythmias on tele.
Hepatititis:  With levels that peaked at AST 3300, ALT 1700, this differential diagnosis is narrow: Acute viral hepatitis vs. toxic idiosyncratic drug reaction vs. tylenol overdose vs. ischemia vs. autoimmune hepatitis.
Pt with prior diagnosis of hepatic congestion from CHF, so this may confound the picture.
She did not appear to be in decompensated CHF and transaminases were markedly elevated, so this is less likely secondary to pure congestive hepatopathy.
A liver U/S with doppler was negative for arterial or venous ischemia/thrombus.
She also has a family history of autoimmune disease.
The patient was not amenable to a biopsy, but we decided not to pursue this, or steroid treatment, but rather to observe her to see if the LFTs normalized.
Severe AS: Not surgical candidate due to several comorbidities based on surgical evaluation from last admission.
No peripheral edema but with some basilar rales developed during this admission.
Nausea/Vomiting: Likely multifactorial and related to acute renal failure and acute hepatitis.
Had a distended stomach with gas but no evidence of obstruction on KUB.
# Elevated Blood Glucose: patient with no history of DM.
Was not given steroids or other hyperglycemic agents.
This most likely represents an acute hepatic abberation of glucose regulation in the setting of a severe acute hepatitis.
She did not have any hyperacute T waves or QRS changes on EKG, no dysrhythmias on tele in the MICU, and was initially managed with insulin, calcium gluconate, kayexalate and albuterol nebs.
Diuretics were held and she became eunatremic.
# Follow-up: arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1147**] on [**2185-9-9**].
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute Renal Failure Acute hepatitis .
Secondary: Rheumatoid Arthritis Aortic Stenosis distolic CHF mitral and tricuspid regurgitation   Discharge Condition: good, improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted ot the hospital with nausea and vomiting.
You were found to have acute renal (kidney) failure, as well as some acute damage to your liver.
We eliminated many possible diagnoses regarding the damage to you liver, including tylenol toxicity, viral hepatitis, hypoperfusion/shock, or venous clotting.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1147**] refer you for a liver workup and possible biopsy.
You blood sugars were slightly elevated on this admission.
If you feel any additional nausea or vomiting, or if you have any other complaints that are disturbing to you, please call your doctor or go to the ER.
