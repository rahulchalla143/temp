Admission Date:  [**2104-4-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2104-5-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2029-8-6**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension requiring pressors.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post CABG x2, aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement on Coumadin with recent prosthetic valve thrombosis, status post TPA thrombolysis, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20% with 2+ mitral regurgitation, and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and history of ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring pacemaker and ICD placement, now presents from rehabilitation with acute renal failure and hypertension requiring pressors.
The patient is status post a prolonged hospital course from [**Month (only) 404**] to [**2104-3-15**] for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction requiring a redo CABG.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by renal failure requiring CVVH, worsening heart failure requiring intra-aortic balloon pump complicated by rectus sheath hematoma, failure to wean from the ventilator requiring tracheostomy placement, atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone, ventricular fibrillation arrest, requiring ICD placement, and prosthetic aortic valve thrombus requiring TPA thrombolysis complicated by ICD pocket hematoma.
The patient was discharged to rehabilitation early [**Month (only) 958**], however, returned to the hospital from [**Date range (1) 31609**] for ICD pocket infection with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by congestive heart failure and the patient was discharged to rehabilitation on [**4-15**] on diuretics including Zaroxolyn, Lasix, and aldactone, as well as oxacillin to complete a three week course.
The patient was doing well initially at rehabilitation, however, several days postdischarge, was noted to have progressively increasing BUN and creatinine (creatinine 3.4, BUN 106), and hyponatremia with confusion.
The patient's diuretics were initially reduced, however, the patient's renal failure was thought to be secondary to worsened congestive heart failure with a total body volume overload and ineffective renal perfusion.
More aggressive diuresis was attempted, however, with minimal effect.
The patient subsequently became hypotensive and was brought to an outside hospital Emergency Department, where she received normal saline boluses, and was started on dopamine secondary to systolic blood pressures in the 60s.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department, where a chest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates consistent with worsened heart failure.
The patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization on [**2104-2-9**] for acute graft closure with PTCA and stenting of the LIMA to the left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the diag.
Congestive heart failure with biventricular failure, ejection fraction less than 20% with severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Ventricular fibrillation arrest [**2104-2-16**] status post ICD placement with dual pacer.
Bilateral carotid endarterectomy.
Diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease.
ICD pocket infection status post ICD and pacer removal.
Hypothyroidism secondary to amiodarone.
Aortic stenosis status post bileaflet aortic valve (St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] replacement) complicated by valve thrombosis requiring TPA thrombolysis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Anicteric sclerae.
Neck examination supple with no jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac examination: 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating to the neck, otherwise normal S1, S2.
No wheezes or rales appreciated.
Abdominal examination is distended with normoactive bowel sounds, soft, no rebound or guarding.
PEG tube in place with guaiac positive rectal examination.
Extremities:  Cool with no edema appreciated.
Skin examination:  ICD pocket dressing in place, clean, dry, and intact with left thigh dressing in place secondary to a saphenous vein graft harvest site infection with failure to heal.
Minimal serous drainage and pressure ulcers on bilateral heels.
White blood cell differential with 93% polys, 3.3% lymphocytes, 3.2% monocytes, and no eosinophils.
In addition, urinalysis with large blood, trace leukocyte esterase, greater than 50 red blood cells, 21-50 white cells, many bacteria, no yeast, and [**3-19**] squamous cells (chronic Foley).
Chest x-ray with diffuse patchy infiltrates, no pneumothorax and right IJ and PICC line in place.
Portable abdominal x-ray with no dilated loops of bowel.
Was complicated by hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart failure and concomitant pneumonia requiring continuous ventilatory support, sepsis requiring pressors, and acute persistent renal failure.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on [**4-21**] for hemodynamic monitoring with evidence of increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, decreased vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output consistent with concomitant sepsis and heart failure.
The patient was continued on oxacillin for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis, and placed on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis of unknown etiology.
On presentation, patient was noted to have a lower gastrointestinal bleed thought secondary to mesenteric ischemia in the setting of hypotension.
On [**4-23**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate and hemodynamic compromise.
Secondary to excessive intravenous fluid boluses in the setting of sepsis, the patient became totally body volume overload with increasing oxygen requirement.
On [**4-29**], the patient complained of abdominal pain with increasing abdominal distention and decreased bowel sounds.
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan was obtained with evidence of new large rectus sheath hematoma with bladder compression.
On [**5-1**], the patient developed ventricular fibrillation arrest at a rate of 200 with no detectable blood pressure.
After approximately 45 minutes of ACLS, the patient developed sinus rhythm with a systolic blood pressure in the 150s on dopamine, amiodarone, as well as Morphine.
After 20 minutes, however, the patient again developed ventricular fibrillation.
The code was called by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2146**] secondary to refractory ventricular fibrillation.
At 10:05 am, on [**5-1**], the patient ceased spontaneous breathing and expired.
