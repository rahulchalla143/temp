for HCV cirrhosis, complicated by h/o variceal bleed, diuretic-resistant ascites, hepatic encephalopathy with suicidal and homicidal ideations who presented to OSH with complaints of dizziness and home BP [**Location (un) 1131**] of 70/30.
VS at OSH ED 97.8 P 106 BP 85/37 RR 20 100% on RA; he was found to be hyponatremic to 120 with new ARF with Cr 3.
Sigmoidoscopy initially showed clotted blood; follow up colonoscopy the next day showed ulceration, friability and abnormal vascularity in the proximal ascending colon compatible with ischemic bowel.
A biopsy of the colon was also consistent with ischemia.
The pt was treated with ceftriaxone empirically for SBP (a paracentesis was not performed) and discharged on cipro for ppx.
His cirrhosis has been complicated by variceal bleed ([**2138**]) and banding last in [**11-24**], ascites on diuretics, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy.

FLUCONAZOLE SENSITIVITY REQUESTED BY DR.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
SENT TO THE [**State 15238**] FOR SENSITIVITY TESTING.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

New free air since prior study, likely due to recent paracentesis.
Thickened jejunal loops with equivocal lucencies in the wall versus the lumen and some greying of the mesentery.
These findings may reflect bowel wall edema in the setting of hypoalbumenia, however ischemia cannot be excluded as discussed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10269**] with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 21082**] on the evening of the study.
Massive ascites, nodular shrunken liver and splenomegaly persist.
Small bilateral effusions with adjacent atelectasis bilaterally.
Coarsened liver echotexture with no focal masses.
Trivial size perihepatic collection appears unchanged from the prior CT. 2.
His condition deteriorated there requiring pressors and the working diagnosis was not a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis but an intra-abdominal cause for his peritonitis.
At surgery, it looked like there was a colon perforation from the peritoneal tap requiring a right colectomy, end ileostomy and a [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] procedure and complicated by significant blood loss.
His hospital course has been significant for worsening renal function requiring hemodialysis, then rapid recovery of renal function, rising bilirubin.
However, on [**4-16**], he developed worsening espiratory distress, acidosis and was transferred back to the ICU and intubated.
He had a repeat CT scan which was not indicative of an acute problem.
Over the course of the hospitalization, he received multiple blood transfusions for the slow GI bleed, multiple units of platelets to correct his thrombocytopenia, and multiple units of FFP in an attempt to correct his coagulopathy.
The outputs from his drains were repleted appropriately with crystalloid and this effectively served as peritoneal dialysis.
He was also on an octreotide drip in an effort to decrease his GI outputs.
On [**5-17**] a white vac was placed over the incision that had been leaking out ascites and when opened at the skin level, bowel was encountered.
On [**5-24**] the patient developed worsening hypotension, levophed was added to neo, and the patient was pan cultured and his clinical situation progressively worsened over the course of the night.
Early on [**5-25**] the patient was intubated for worsening hypoxia and vasopressin was added for worsening hypotension.
His peritoneal fluid grew out coag negative staph and he was restarted on broad spectrum antibiotics for a diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
The following day, the pt started bleeding from his varices and was having bright red blood come out of his OG tube.
