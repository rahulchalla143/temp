Admission Date:  [**2132-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-12-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-10-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4071**] Chief Complaint: Acute loss of consciousness and respiratory failure .
EMS was called and found the patient diaphoretic and unresponsive sitting in chair.
While in ambulance, he had tonic clonic motions which were felt consistent with possible seizure activity.
At the OSH there was concern for PE but due to an iodine dye allergy a CTA chest could not be performed, but a CT chest w/o contrast was done which was unremarkable.
A chest x-ray showed pulm edema, no effusion, and a retrocardiac opacity.
He had a bedside echo which showed a pericardial effusion, and cardiology was called who repeated the echo at the bedside, and felt the effusion to be small and not likely new.
His urine tox screen was positive for opiates and amphetamines.
ROS: Family states he had some chest congestion the day prior to admission.
He has a chronic smoker's cough which in unchanged.
Denies fever or chills but pt not likely to have complained of these things.
Past Medical History: DM 2 Hypertension CAD s/p 3 MIs, last 3 yrs ago CHF, reported EF 15% Ankylosing spondylitis Hyperlipidemia .
No h/o ETOH withdrawl.
Per family no illicits.
B/l wheezes and occasional rhonchi Heart: RRR nl S1S2 no M/R/G Abdomen: +BS, soft, mild distention, non-tender Ext: trace LE edema b/l Neuro: sqweezes hands b/l, [**4-13**].
[**2132-12-7**] CXR (portable) - Increased interstitial marking of pulmonary edema.
No acute intracranial pathology including no intracranial hemorrhage.
Old encephalomalacic changes of the posterior portion of left occipital lobe as described.
[**2132-12-8**] Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right or left lower extremity.
[**2132-12-10**] ECHO - There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the inferior wall., distal LV and apex.
An aortic dissection is not seen but cannot be excluded on the basis of this study (TEE or CT recommended).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence for dissection or aortic pathology.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis with new ground-glass opacities near the lung apices, which may relate to fluid overload, or multifocal areas of pneumonitis.
Developing pneumonia is a consideration.
Two small right sided pulmonary nodules as described, follow up in 6 months advised, although these are likely representative of loculated fluid.
[**2132-12-16**] CXR (PA and lateral) - ICD leads in appropriate position without pneumothorax.
There is no pulmonary congestion.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system  revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no signficant disease.
The LAD was totally occluded just after a high diagonal.
The RCA had diffuse mid vessel disease with a 50-60% stenosis in large vessel.
Two vessel coronary artery disease .
Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old man with history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and ankylosing spondylitis, who presented to an outside hospital with respiratory failure and hypotension, was intubated for airway protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
The leading diagnosis was pulmonary edema related to decompensated CHF.
He was treated for CHF medically with afterload reduction and diuresis as below.
# Hypotension: He was initially hypotensive on admission and briefly pressor-dependent.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF: His initial presentation was felt to be secondary to pulmonary edema causing acute respiratory failure, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure and loss of consciousness.
During his ICU stay, he had several episodes of chest pain, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath in the context of significant hypertension.
He had no EKG changes and cardiac enzymes were negative, so pulmonary edema due to decompensated heart failure was felt to be the most likely cause.
The nitro drip was quickly titrated off as his BP would drop after the episode was over.
ECGs did not reveal any ichemic changes.
He underwent an echocardiogram which revealed a depressed LVEF (25-30%).
No history chest pain prior to admission.
No ECG changes.
While in the ICU, he had several episodes of chest pain, diaphoresis, shortness of breath associated with hypertension.
After transfer to the floor, he had several episodes of chest pain/pressure/tighthness associated with hypotension which was concerning for possible angina, despite no EKG changes and negative CE.
Suspicion for cardiac ischemia was high enough that he underwent cardiac catheterization.
The LAD was totally occluded just after a high diagonal and the RCA had diffuse mid vessel disease with a 50-60% stenosis in large vessel.
More likely he was experiencing symptoms from demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and hypoperfusion of his coronary arteries.
No intervention was performed.
# Rhythm: He had one episode of non-sustained VT, symptomatic with palpitations in the neck.
He also had a number of asymptomatic NSVT on telemetry.
Given his ischemic cardiomyopathy and poor EF, he qualifies for ICD for primary prevention.
He had an ICD placed during this hospitalization without complication and will follow-up with EP device clinic at [**Hospital1 18**].
Metformin and glyburide were discontinued as they are contraindicated in heart failure patients.
# AMS/unresponsive: Felt to be secondary to the pulm edema, resp failure, and poor perfusion of brain.
See above for managmenent of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 6138**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) Flash pulmonary edema 2) Aspiration pneumonia .
Secondary: 1) Systolic CHF secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy 2) Coronary artery disease 3) Diabetes mellitus 4) Hypertension 5) Hyperlipidemia .
No chest pain.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after you became unresponsive at home.
We think this was most likely secondary to your congestive heart failure.
While here, you had an implantable defibrillator device implanted to protect you in the event that you go into cardiac arrest.
You were also treated for pneumonia.
You blood sugars were very elevated during your hospitalization and you have been switched to insulin for your diabetes management.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or persistent fever > 101, please return to the nearest emergency room.
