She had not feeling well, with shortness of breath on even minimal exertion for the last two days.
She thought she was coming down with something because she had decreased appetite.
She had had heartburn but no actual abdominal pain.
No fevers, chills, vomiting, dysuria or chest pain.
After her stroke she has residual R sided weakenss, but is living at home.
She developed retrosternal chest pressure getting up to go to the bathroom, so was transferred here.
Given cipro for GI bleed prophylaxis.
CT abdomen showed a bleed in the 4th portion of the duodenum.
She did not have any further maroon bowel movements.
On the floor, patient has not had chest pressure since about 3pm.
She denies abdominal pain, and has not had further melena since arrival the [**Hospital1 18**]   Past Medical History: - s/p R cerebellar infarct [**2129-8-20**].
Found to have aortic plaque, started on coumadin - Hyperlipidemia.
- Hypertension.
- Diabetes mellitus.
- Atherosclerosis of the lower extremities.
- s/p dilatation and curretage c/b respiratory arrest   Social History: Patient lives at home with her husband.
Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: T: BP: P: R: 18 O2: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place.
R-sided groin line c/d/i Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: aaox3, CNs [**1-22**] intact, strength and sensation grossly nl.
Small area of active bleeding within the fourth portion of the duodenum.
No evidence of active lower GI bleeding.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Left adnexal cyst measuring 1.5 x 1.1 cm.
Stomach:  Lumen: A small size hiatal hernia was seen.
Mucosa: Erythema and erosion of the mucosa were noted in the stomach body consistent with NG tube trauma.
Duodenum:  Mucosa: Multiple nodules were seen in the duodenal bulb with overlying abnormal mucosa.
These lesions appeared endoscopically consistent with Brunner's gland hyperplasia.
After the EGD scope was passed to the second part of the duodenum a colonoscope was inserted to visualize the distal duodenum to assess the area bleeding that was suggested on CT scan.
No blood was seen in the duodenum and no lesion was seen that could account for the bleeding.
Impression: Small hiatal hernia Erythema and erosion in the stomach body Abnormal mucosa in the duodenum likely Brunner's gland hyperplasia Otherwise normal EGD to fourth part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings do not account for the symptoms Plan for capsule study after EGD Patient should have a repeat EGD to biopsy nodules seen in duodenal bulb .
Mucosa: Erythema and erosion of the mucosa were noted in the stomach body consistent with NG tube trauma.
Duodenum: Mucosa: Multiple nodules were seen in the duodenal bulb with overlying abnormal mucosa.
These lesions appeared endoscopically consistent with Brunner's gland hyperplasia.
jejunum: The endoscopic was advanced into the 4th duodenum / proximal jejunum - detailed exam was not possible due to patient intolerance / discomfort with procedure.
No large lesions or blood was noted.
Impression: Small hiatal hernia Erythema and erosion in the stomach body suggestive of [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube trauma.
Abnormal mucosa in the duodenum bulb - likely Brunner's gland hyperplasia.
Limited exam of the third / fourth part of the duodenum - no bleeding lesions were noted.
Further options include capsule study, repeat push enteroscopy with anetheisa or single balloon/spirus enteroscopy.
Brief Hospital Course: 68yo female s/p recent cerebellar infarct on coumadin, who presented with a duodenal bleed.
# GI bleed: The patient experienced a significant bleed with a Hct drop of approximately 10 points(28->19) in the setting of INR 7.
He then underwent CTA showing active bleeding within the fourth portion of the duodenum.
She underwent capsule endoscopy showing multiple angioectasias in the small bowel.
# Chest pressure: The patient complained of chest pressure on admission,  concerning for demand ischemia in the setting of severe anemia.
She did have transient ST depressions related to this demand, but Troponins were negative and ECG changes resolved.
On recent admission, patient was to undergo cardiac cath, but this was stopped because she was found to have significant atheromas in her Aorta.
After resolution of her bleed, the patient was started on plavix for both coronary protection and secondary stroke prevention.
# Diabetes: Given CT angiogram, metformin was held and pt was covered with HISS.
The patient was started on plavix in-house without any signs or symptoms of bleeding for > 24 hours.
# Glaucoma: Alphagan and Latonprost were continued.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Duodenal bleed in setting of supratherapeutic INR   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
The capsule endoscopy did show that you have something called arteriovenous malformations, which are blood vessels that have a tendency to bleed in the bowel.
