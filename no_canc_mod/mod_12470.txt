Admission Date:  [**2139-7-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2139-7-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-9-9**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Surgery, Blue Team  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old white woman with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, multiple sclerosis, and hypercholesterolemia who presents with lethargy and purulent discharge from her vagina.
She was evaluated at the [**Hospital6 33**] at which time there was a high suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis in her right lower lobe.
The patient's husband reports that the patient headache a dilatation and curettage one month ago, and for the last 10 days the patient has had poor oral intake and worsening lethargy.
Coronary artery disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history is significant for coronary artery bypass graft.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
She did not have any jugular venous distention on examination.
Her abdomen was soft, tender in the lower quadrants with no evidence of guarding or palpable mass.
No palpable masses were noted.
No mass was palpated.
The patient was noted to have palpable dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibialis pulses on presentation.
No evidence of congestive heart failure.
No evidence of effusion.
No evidence of cardiomegaly.
A CT of her abdomen was noted to have free fluid in her pelvis.
No evidence of free air in the peritoneal cavity, and there was a thickened portion in her right colon.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 61-year-old woman transferred from an outside hospital and noted to have purulent discharge from her vagina and likely necrotizing fasciitis in her right thigh.
Intraoperatively, it was noted that the patient had a perforated sigmoid in the posterior aspect of her sigmoid colon.
The patient was also noted to have a necrotic appendix that was perforated.
The patient was also noted to have focal peritonitis, and there was some purulence found in her fascia in her right thigh.
At that time, an echocardiogram was obtained as well as an electrocardiogram which all showed that the patient had recently suffered an acute myocardial infarction.
The patient also became more and more acidotic requiring ampules of bicarbonate as well as a bicarbonate drip.
The patient's renal function also deteriorated, and she became oliguric.
Subsequently, the patient was taken back to the operating room and underwent a exploration of her right thigh in addition to a counter incision made in the lateral aspect of her right thigh opening extra pockets of pus and abscess.
The next day, the Renal Service was consulted for her oliguria and her persistent acidosis.
The whole time, the patient was receiving total parenteral nutrition, and her clinical condition appeared to improve slightly.
After multiple transfusions of platelets, the patient had likely developed anti-platelet antibody and was able to continually drop her platelets despite multiple transfusions.
This lasted for a few days until [**7-12**] when the patient suddenly developed an episode of bradycardia and almost asystole.
Although, the patient's heart rate spontaneously returned to her baseline, her blood pressure remained low requiring increasing her dopamine drip from an initial renal dose to up to 10, even as high as 15.
Her lactate had increased up to 10, and her base deficit had increased to greater than 12.
There was also evidence of some bleeding.
Moreover, she was noted to have a large ecchymotic area in her left flank, showing a possible retroperitoneal bleed as well.
After refloating the Swan-Ganz catheter, the patient was noted to have adequate platelets, however, she became progressively oliguric.
On [**7-14**], it was also noted that the patient's pupils had now become fixed and dilated, with a very slow and sluggish in her left pupil, indicating that the patient most likely may bled to her head, herniating her brain on the right.
Neurology attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**] evaluated the patient, and it was determined that the patient very likely had herniated her brain with very minimal brain stem activity.
Perforated sigmoid colon.
Sepsis/sepsis shock.
Multiorgan failure which included kidney failure and possibly liver failure as well.
