He reports having a cough with yellow sputum which occurred shortly before he noticed his increased abdominal size.
he denied ever feeling palpitations or chest pain, but did report shortness of breath with the cough.
he took robitussin and his shortness of breath and cough resolved.
He was given lopressor 5mg IV X1 without effect, followed by adenosine 12mg which broke his rhythm and showed atrial flutter with 4:1 block.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema b/l.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.
If clinically feasible, consider PA and lateral views in the Radiology Suite for a more sensitive evaluation.
[**2104-9-10**] EKG: Atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 139.
Marked J point elevation with early repolarization in anterior precordial leads.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities elsewhere.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
A probable thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Probable thrombus in left atrial appendage.
Severely depressed [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function.
Brief Hospital Course: 52M with no past medical history presenting with new onset systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with alternating 4:1 and 2:1 block.
# Atrial Flutter: His atrial flutter may have begun nearly two weeks ago when he first developed cough and increased abdominal girth.
An electrophysiology consult was obtained and the plan was to proceed with TEE to rule out atrial clot prior to ablation of the circuit.
A TEE was performed which showed probable thrombus in the left atrial appendage and the ablation was therefore cancelled.
He was also digoxin loaded, but the digoxin was discontinued because he had 2 prolonged pauses in his rhythm with the vagal stimulation of passing gas and it was felt that digoxin was making this more pronounced.
He will follow-up with electrophysiology in 1 month as an outpatient for repeat TEE and possible ablation if there is no clot seen.
# Acute Systolic Congestive heart failure:  He appears to have predominantly right sided heart failure with absence of crackles, along with presence of JVP, abdominal edema, and increased abdominal girth.
Etiologies may include cardiomyopathy induced by alcohol, viral infection from previous upper respiratory infection, or tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy.
# Coronary artery disease prevention: Will start on aspirin 81mg.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a rapid heart rhythm called atrial flutter and congestive heart failure.
You will be given a prescription to have these labs drawn.
