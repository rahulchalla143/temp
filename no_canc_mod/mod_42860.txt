Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 101760**] is a 51-year-old woman with history of ESRD s/p renal transplant [**2151**], PVD, CAD who presented to the Emergency Department this morning with complaints of fever to 103.0 at home, RLE pain, and chills.
Patient also began to complain of right foot pain, swelling, and redness, which she had not experienced prior to this morning (may have had some heel pain 2 days PTA, but unclear if this is new or old).
Reports chronic LE issues secodnary to [**Name (NI) 1106**] insufficiency, but pain and erythema are new.
Wound swab grew coagulase positive staph and Enterobacter cloacae.
No further pus drainage, differential according to OMR note was blister drainage vs. gout vs. local pus collection.
On review, patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, or diaphoresis.
Lactate was 1.7, she was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime for presumed sepsis from RLE.
CXR without infiltrate.
Past Medical History: # SLE # End stage renal disease s/p transplant [**2158**] now with chronic allograft nephropathy # Dilated cardiomyopathy, EF 35% # Peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease, s/p right first toe amputation, s/p # Bilateral femoral popliteal bypass.
# s/p multiple AV fistula revisions # s/p colectomy with end ileostomy secondary to perforated ischemic transverse colon # Coronary artery disease, s/p perioperative myocardial infarction # History of MRSA wound infection # Positive Hepatitis C # Hemachromatosis from mult transfusions # Anemia of Chronic Inflammation # Hyperparathyroidism s/p parathyroidectomy 10 yrs ago # Avascular necrosis of hips  Social History: Denies tobacco, Etoh, drugs.
Family History: No history of CAD or malignancy.
+ h/o DM in her mother.
Physical Exam: VS: T 97.8; BP 101/78; HR 76; RR 14; O2 98% 1.5L NC GEN: Lovely middle-aged woman in NAD HEENT: PERRL.
Op clear CV: III/VI systolic murmur LUSB LUNGS: CTA B/L ABD: colostomy bag on RLQ without erythema or drainage.
Hand: 4th digit on left hand with crusted lesion on distal aspect of palmar side - no pus, erythema, or other signs of active infection NEURO: AO x 3.
No focal deficits except decreased LE ROM [**2-19**] pain.
RLE duplex ([**2162-8-9**]): IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT involving the right lower extremity.
On today's exam, there is more pronounced focal osteopenia along the plantar medial aspect of the distal 1st metatarsal -- if this corresponds to a site of ulceration, then this could represent early osteomyelitis.
No cortical interruption or periosteal new bone formation is identified at this site or elsewhere in the foot.
There is diffuse osteopenia and dense [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcification.
There is some increased density in the middle phalanx of the second digit, unchanged compared with [**2162-3-18**].
No acute fracture and no dislocation is identified.
Linear right basilar atelectasis is noted.
No large pleural effusions are present.
There is no evidence of CHF.
Aortic knob calcification is present.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, with right basilar atelectasis.
Amorphous soft tissue calcifications are seen at the level of the middle and distal phalanges.
IMPRESSION:  As seen on the study from [**2158-5-10**], there is profound osteopenia with extensive [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcifications.
There are more extensive amorphous fourth finger soft tissue calcifications than on the prior study.
Marked cardiomegaly including evidence of left atrial enlargement is present as before.
There is some upper zone redistribution pattern, but no conclusive evidence for interstitial or alveolar edema is noted.
Linear atelectasis exists bilaterally but the lateral pleural sinuses remain free.
No pneumothorax is present.
When direct comparison of the lung fields is made with the previous examination, there is slightly more increased perivascular haze and also the heart size appears to have increased slightly.
No new discrete parenchymal infiltrates are identified.
IMPRESSION:  Further progression of cardiomegaly and now some mild congestion.
No evidence of pulmonary edema as yet.
Had cotrosyn stim test to test for adrenal insufficiency as a cause of hypotension; was normal.
Hypotension possibly related to patient being on BB with worsening renal failure but may also have been due to sepsis although blood culutures did not grow out positive.
Pt swelling, pain and redness with great improvement; pt was therefore transferred to the floor on CC7.
Pt continued to improve on the floor; her renal function quickly returned to [**Location 4222**] with a creatinine of 1.8; she remained afebrile for the remainder of the stay.
A source of infection was never clearly identified.
Bladder and respiratory infections were thought very unlikely given normal studies.
Pt had no GI sx's.
ID thought source of fever was most likely the L 4th finger with a gout lesion that was superinfected.
Since cultures of this had grown out enterobacter and MSSA (although a hx of MRSA) vanc and meropenem was continued.
Cellulitis of the R leg was thought possible although less likely as a cause of fever.
Pt had expressed discontent with numerous thing during the hospitalization up to this point, one of them being the experience with the plastic surgery team during their visit (recommended soaking the finger qid for 15 minutes in warm water and taking off ring).
You will need to have MWF blood counts to monitor your platelets with your VNA until one week after you finish your linezolid dosing.
We also strongly recommend that you schedule an MRI for your finger to make sure there is no osteomyelitis as well as an echocardiagram to make sure you do not have endocarditis.
