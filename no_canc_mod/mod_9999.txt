Admission Date:  [**2162-6-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-6-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-9-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ivp Dye, Iodine Containing / Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: SOB and fatigue x 1 week  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: DDD pacemaker placement  History of Present Illness: This patient is a 65yo F with a PMH of DMII, obesity, HTN, MS, and hypothyroidism presenting with a 1 week history of fatigue/ SOB.
Symptoms occurred with minimal exertion, as patient is wheelchair bound and thus limited in her daily activities.
She also c/o occasional palpitations and clammy/ cool extremities intermittently over the past week.
On arrival to the floor, the patient felt well with no complaints.
She denied any F/C, CP, SOB, or palpitations.
Past Medical History: HTN obesity hyperlipidemia DM II - hgb A1c 6.5% MS - not currently on medication h/o kidney stones  Social History: lives with her husband.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: 2+ pitting edema to knees b/l, chronic skin changes c/w lymphedema.
[**6-15**] CXR: prominent hila bilaterally, L hemidiaphragm obscured; Limited exam, findings concerning for mild cardiogenic edema .
[**6-15**] TTE: nml left ventricular cavity size with hyperdynamic systolic function (EF>75%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: This patient is a 65yo F with a PMH of DMII, obesity, HTN, MS, and hypothyroidism presenting with a 1 week history of fatigue/ SOB found to be in heart block.
On [**6-15**] a DDD pacemaker was placed without complication and the patient continued to do well throughout the remainder of her hospital course.
Etiology of heart block was most likely age/idiopathic; however, lyme titers were checked and found to be negative.
#) Chest pain:  No history of CAD per patient report; she has had a prior cath without intervention and reports a "negative" stress test within the past 5 years.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 2, and ischemia was ruled out as etiology of chest pain/ SOB.
On [**6-17**] the patient experienced a 10 minute episode of anginal-type pain (substernal heaviness/ pressure radiating down both arms reaching [**7-23**] before subsiding on its own).
VS were stable and EKG, while showing V pacing, did not show any significant EKG changes.
Upon further questioning the patient recalls having similar experiences at home over the past few months.
#) ?UTI: The patient has an indwelling catheter due to MS and is on chronic macrobid therapy.
Evidence of bacteria on UA was therefore treated with home dose of macrobid.
#)The patient had a cardiac, diabetic diet and was maintained on a bowel regimen, heparin subQ, and a PPI while in house.
She was discharged to rehab because PT evaluation indicated that she was functioning below her baseline and she could use further PT to aid in her transfering given mobility restrictions in left arm abduction after the pacemaker was placed.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: [**12-16**] Tablet, Sublinguals Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Disp:*5400 ML(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: heart block secondary: HTN, obesity, DMII, hyperlipidemia, history of kidney stones   Discharge Condition: good; afebrile, VSS   Discharge Instructions: You were diagnosed with heart block, which resulted in a low pulse rate.
