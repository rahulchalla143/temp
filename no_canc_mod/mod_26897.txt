Her vitals were stable and she was in no distress.
She had no signs or symptoms of infection or preterm labor.
Neurology consulted and her exam was notable for UMN pattern of weakness in the arms and legs, normal sensation, normal tone and dropped reflexes at triceps and right brachioradialis, which was suggestive of a cervical cord process.
An MRI was obtained and ruled out an epidural abscess, hematoma, and transverse myelitis.
Fetal testing was reassuring and there were no obstetric concerns.
Her ABG showed a respiratory alkalosis which was likely physiolgic secondary to pregnancy.
Additional labwork revealed an elevated CK 5683 and an elevated ESR 35.
A lumbar puncture was done and was negative for infection.
She had some mildly elevated blood pressures up to 130-140s/80-90s and elevated LFT's.
Neurology felt that she had periodic limb paralysis from hypokalemia, possibly [**Doctor Last Name 65597**]-Tawill Syndrome (a variant of hypokalemic periodic paralysis).
They felt that she did not have the EKG changes or cardiologic manifestations that would go with this disorder.
