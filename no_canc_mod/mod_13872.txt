She began vomiting and was intubated for airway protection.
She was given narcan with no response.
CT head showed no acute pathology.
VS were: 97.8 rectal HR 110 BP 112/palp RR 16 Sat 100%   Past Medical History: Asthma - per mother no hospitalizations, no intubations  Social History: + tobb and etoh per mother   Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: PE (at 3am): 96.1 145/90 104 21 97% on AC/20/450cc/FiO2 of 50% Gen: intubated unresponsive black female, some fasciculations Chest: rhonchorous CV: RRR no murmurs Abd: BS hypoactive, soft, no guarding.
Extrem: cool, DP pulses 2+, radial pulses 2+, no edema Neuro: unresponsive, pupils pinpoint and unreactive, no doll's-eye reflex.
No intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or fracture.
Mucosal thickening and fluid within the left maxillary sinus.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Streak artifact due to body habitus and atelectasis at the lung bases compromised the diagnostic ability of the scan, within these limitations, there is no central pulmonary embolism.
There is no aortic dissection.
Bibasal effusions and pericardial effusion are present.
Atelectasis is present at both lung bases with patchy opacities in the lung parenchyma, likely infectious or inflammatory.
Difficult cross-match: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 59365**] has a new diagnosis of an anti-E antibody.
Anti-E antibody is clinically significant and is known to cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemoluytic disease of the newborn.
<br> MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2153-9-4**] 4:38 PM There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute infarcts.
There are several scattered small FLAIR/T2 bright periventricular white matter lesions, consistent with chronic small-vessel angiopathy.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is a mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
There is mucosal thickening of several ethmoid air cells.
No evidence of acute ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage.
Several small (less than 5 mm) periventricular white matter lesions consistent with chronic small vessel changes.
Mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus and several ethmoid air cells.
<br> CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-9-1**] 4:29 AM FINDINGS: The examination is limited by motion and exclusion of a portion of the right hemithorax.
The heart size and mediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, as are bilateral interstitial and bibasilar opacities and small left pleural effusion.
The right pleural effusion is not evaluated due to exclusion of a portion of the right hemithorax.

CT of the head was negative for hemorrhage or mass.
CXR and urine were without evidence of infection.
She received one dose of activated charcoal given her positive toxicology screen and concern for other ingestions.
She was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam given concern for withdrawal.
She was changed to propofol as this would allow for rapid reversal and extubation.
Her agitation improved and on the medical [**Hospital1 **] she did not require any sedatives for agitiation.
# Ataxic gait, dysarthria, disconjugate gaze and mild fine motor deficits of right hand: After extubation she was noted to have some difficulty managing to eat with her right hand, slurred, dysarthric speech, and disconjugate gaze.
These were of unclear chronicity as she had been unresponsive on presentation.
On arrival to the medical [**Hospital1 **] after extubation, these issues persisted despite mild improvement in functionality and ambulation/mobility, and the patient had continued slurring of speech and disconjugate gaze; she was also noted to have a an ataxic gait.
had difficulty in feeding self (also dysarthric with rt.
The patient completed 15 minutes of the planned 60 minute MR of the brain with and without contrast, and then refused to continue due to anxiety in the MR scanner.
Some DWI images were obtained, and the read of the MR was negative for acute ischemia.
There were only noted to be multiple, small, chronic microvascular changes.
The neurology team felt that her exam was most consistent with an anoxic brain injury which was unmasking latent neurologic symptoms possibly including the disconjugate gaze on an unclear history or baseline of neurologic function.
There was no evidence of acute or subacute infarct.
Infectious etiologies were entertained, but without contrast MR, this could not be reliably evaluated radiographically.
She was aferbrile and had no headache or fever to suggest ongoing infectious processes, off of all antibiotics.
Given the history of her presentation, anoxic brain injury as a result of respiratory failure from ethanol and other illicit substance intoxication was felt to be the most likely etiology of her dysarthria and disconjugate gaze and ataxia.
No acute intervention was felt indicated, and given the lack of clear evidence of an acute or subacute infarction, no anti-platelet therapy was indicated (and the patient's mother reported a history of allergy to aspirin).
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient presented intubated and sedated.
Immediately after extubation she became more tachypnic and had evidence of CO2 retention.
Repeat CXR revealed the presence of bilateral infiltrates concerning for ARDS in the setting of likely aspiration.
She was subsequently ventilated per ARDSnet protocol with reduced tidal volumes.
It was felt that bronchospasm secondary to her asthma was also contributing and she was treated with aggressive albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments.
She was started on levofloxacin and flagyl for presumed aspiration pnuemonia and this was switched to zosyn and vancomycin for broader coverage.
Patient also has a history of asthma and was treated with inhaled bronchodilators.
She received a short course of IV steroids both for asthma exacerbation and for given possible septic shock (see below).
finger stick glucose was elevated in this setting, but resolved once steroids stopped.
# Sepsis: On hospital day three the patient was noted to be febrile, tachycardic and hypotensive to the 80s systolic.
By the following morning her hypotension had resolved and she was no longer febrile.
# Anemia: On admission the patient's hematocrit was 36.
On hospital day two it had decreased to 31 and eventually was as low as 26.4 with fluid rehydration.
It was felt that the most likely etiology was anemia secondary to chronic malnutrition and ethanol use.
#Amylase/Lipase elevation: Patient will elevated lipase and amylase on admission with triglycerides of 566.
At no time did she have abdominal pain on exam.
#Hypercalcemia Patient was hypercalcemic to a high of 12, with correspondingly elevated ionized calcium.
This began to trend downwards on transfer from ICU; and on the medical [**Hospital1 **] was only slightly elevated.
#Anti-E-Antibody During cross-match, pathology found that the patient had anti-E antigen antibody and made the recommendations below: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 59365**] has a new diagnosis of an anti-E antibody.
Anti-E antibody is clinically significant and is known to cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemoluytic disease of the newborn.

Disp:*qs Packets* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Polysubstance abuse/intoxication with resultant respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and likely anoxic brain injury as a result of multiple drug intoxication and respiratory failure; associated pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
