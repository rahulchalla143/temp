Admission Date:  [**2110-2-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2110-2-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2050-11-22**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Congestive heart failure and acute non ST elevation myocardial infarction status post catheterization.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old female with a past medical history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal insufficiency, [**2104**] stent to the left anterior descending coronary artery, in 8/99 rota of the obtuse marginal, and [**9-/2106**] percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LPDA, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the obtuse marginal one, status post unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal obtuse marginal one, [**10-24**] cipher to the circumflex who awoke from sleep today with 8 to 10 anginal equivalent pain, nonradiating and positive shortness of breath, positive diaphoresis with the pain that was nonpleuritic.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Diabetes mellitus.
Carpal tunnel surgery.
Peripheral neuropathy.
Chest x-ray was consistent with failure.
PERTINENT PREVIOUS STUDIES:  In [**2104**] stent to the left anterior descending coronary artery, [**2104**] rota of the obtuse marginal and [**9-/2106**] percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LPDA and a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the obtuse marginal one.
Her left main coronary artery showed no obstruction.
Her left anterior descending coronary artery showed mild disease, left circumflex showed subtotal obtuse marginal severely diseased before stenting and with current collateralization.
Her right coronary artery showed small nondominant 50% occlusion in the middle vessel and the recommendations status post catheterization were medical management.
She was an elderly female lying in bed in no acute distress.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Bilateral crackles [**1-23**] of the way up.
1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.
Groin site with no hematoma or oozing.
The patient also suffered from nausea during the first evening on the floor, which resolved with the application of Zofran and Ativan.
The next day after arrival to the floor it was noted that the patient's urine output had decreased and the patient's creatinine had bumped from her baseline around 2 to over 3.
The Renal Service was consulted and they felt that the patient would require emergent hemodialysis to combat the acute renal failure.
The first day 4.7 liters of fluid were removed from the patient and on the third day an additional 2 liters were removed from the patient.
During her time in the unit the patient had one bout of chest pain 4 out of 10, which lasted approximately 20 minutes, which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
At this point the patient had no other complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills and began to put out better urine output.
Their thought was that her acute on chronic renal failure was probably secondary to contrast nephropathy, which resulted from the contrast dye given during catheterization.
Non ST elevation myocardial infarction:  The patient arrived without chest pain, but had a history of chest pain, electrocardiogram changes and positive enzymes.
She also had multiple risk factors as well.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization (see report above), but no intervention occurred during the catheterization.
The following two days the CK and troponin both went back down with no further chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient's initial chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.
Her clinical examination has drastically improved from admission with only very small crackles at the bases remaining.
This most likely was secondary to congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema.
After the significant diuresis by dialysis as well as the good urine output over the last few days of her hospital stay the patient continues to sat well on room air with no other respiratory issues.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient's creatinine is slightly up from baseline, however, she continues to have good urine output and his Lasix responding.
Her creatinine appears to be stable and slightly decreasing now at a level near 3.5.
Her control was adequate during her hospital stay with no need for any acute intervention.
Non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Acute renal failure.
Congestive heart failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
