Admission Date:  [**2178-11-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-11-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2129-8-29**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Neurology HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year old right handed female with a history of multiple strokes in the past, who presents for further evaluation.
Mrs.[**Hospital 46766**] medical history goes back to [**2170**], when She was evaluated by a CT scan at that time and was told that she had several mini-strokes in addition to a large stroke that was responsible for her left-sided weakness.
She also had an angiogram which showed that the right internal carotid artery was occluded completely with a high grade stenosis on the left side.
[**2178-2-27**], had a left carotid endarterectomy.
About two weeks prior to admission, the patient had right-sided weakness and dropping of her right foot.
A magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed several left-sided centrum semiovale strokes consistent with watershed strokes.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has been transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further stroke workup and evaluation for carotid endarterectomy and possible angiogram.
Left carotid endarterectomy.
Hypertension in the 200s.
Question of polycystic ovarian syndrome.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  Small, thin middle-aged female in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, no murmurs.
Extremities:  2+ pulses, no edema.
Neurologic examination:  Alert and oriented times three, language fluent with good comprehension and repetition, registration and coding [**3-1**], recall [**2-1**] with cuing, clock is perservative with poor planning, cube is two dimensional, no neglect, she can do simple calculations, can do days of week backwards but months of year backwards; cranial nerves, visual acuity 20/25 both eyes, visual fields full, extraocular movements intact without nystagmus, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light, facial strength and sensation intact, hearing intact, tongue and palate symmetric; on power testing, she has bilateral upper motor neuron pattern with trace weakness, right more weakness than left; reflexes brisk throughout and toes downgoing bilaterally; sensation is intact to pain, touch, proprioception throughout; coordination, finger-to-nose with slight action tremor on left, heel-to-shin intact, rapid alternating movements slow bilaterally (right more than left).
There is a 100% right carotid stenosis.
Head magnetic resonance imaging scan from [**2171**]-97 showed old right-sided macrovascular infarctions in the centrum semiovale; [**2177**] showed left-sided MCA/ACA watershed infarctions.
She had a carotid angiogram on [**2178-11-17**] that showed critical stenosis of the left internal carotid artery which is complex and described as long and unable to be intervened upon by carotid endarterectomy.
There were also findings suggestive of moyamoya variant and complete occlusion of the right carotid artery also noted.
On [**2178-11-19**], the patient had a carotid angiogram with angioplasty and stenting of the left internal carotid artery.
It was complicated by postoperative hematocrit drop down to the mid-20s, which is presumably to a groin hematoma.
These did not demonstrate retroperitoneal bleed or pseudoaneurysm.
This presumed to be secondary to improve flow and decreased autoregulation producing normal blood pressure.
She will also follow up with her primary care physician for further evaluation of her anemia.
She has had several iron studies and hemolysis labs sent during this hospitalization; the hemolysis labs are negative for hemolytic anemia.
Workup for iron deficiency is still pending.
