There has been placement of staples overlying the anterolateral left chest.
IMPRESSION: Comminuted fractures of the proximal left humerus, not significantly changed.
[**2108-7-1**] Shoulder X-ray: LEFT HUMERUS, PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW: The severely comminuted fracture of the humeral head and neck, with marked medial displacement of the humeral shaft is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Comminuted fracture of the left humeral head and neck.
Please refer to subsequent CT for additional details.
[**2108-7-1**] CTA OF THE LEFT SHOULDER AND PROXIMAL HUMERUS: Comparison is made with a left humeral radiograph from earlier the same day.
FINDINGS: There is a comminuted fracture of the left humeral head and neck with dislocation of the left humeral head fragments from the glenoid fossa.
No additional fractures are seen.
In the included portion of the left lung, hypoventilatory changes are noted without frank consolidation or effusion.
There is no pneumothorax or rib fracture.
There is a truncated appearance of the distal aspect of the left axillary artery at the level just distal to the origin of the posterior circumflex humeral artery.
There is a small collateral vessel along the medial left humerus, which is contrast-filled and this likely represents the ulnar collateral artery.
There is no extravascular pooling of contrast to indicate active extravasation.
Thrombosis of the left brachial artery at the level just distal to the origin of the posterior circumflex humeral artery.
Comminuted fracture of the left humeral head with associated dislocation.
[**2108-7-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) The right subclavian line tip is at the right atrium and should be pulled back for about 2 cm to secure its position at the cavoatrial junction or low SVC.
There are no areas of consolidation worrisome for interval development of pneumonia.
Minimal opacity at the left lung base is unchanged and most likely representing area of atelectasis.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or peumothorax.
The patient is after recent surgery of the left arm, most likely related to left humerus fracture.
Enchondroma of the right humeral head is noted.
Known left humerus fracture.
Enchondroma of the right humerus.
There is no evidence of right-sided pneumothorax after pacemaker implantation.
No evidence of overhydration, no pleural effusions.
Known bilateral shoulder pathologies.
======================== TTE [**2108-7-6**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
She underwent Left axillary to brachial artery bypass with reversed right greater saphenous vein by vascular surgery and open reduction left proximal humerus fracture with manipulation by orthopedics.
Patient's pain was very well controlled with standing tylenol 1000mg TID.
Electrolytes repleted and pain controlled prior to transfer.
Her rate initially had to be controlled on a diltiazem drip; when the diltiazem drip was used in combination with oral nodal agents, there were apparent attempts to self-cardiovert with conversion pauses of 2 to 3 seconds and brief episodes of sinus bradycardia in the 30s.
During the first couple of days, she had conversion pauses lasting up to 4.7 seconds; however, the patient was soon mostly controlled in sinus bradycardia with rate in the 50s with frequent PACs and PVCs.
She did have multiple brief episodes of atrial fibrillation into the 120s-140s, but these were easily controlled with 5mg IV metoprolol; the IV metoprolol would slow her rate down enough to allow it to convert itself back to sinus bradycardia.
The pacemaker was not placed until the urinary tract infection had completely cleared.
# Urinary Tract Infection: Mrs. [**Known lastname 82945**] was found to have a positive urine analysis and treated accordingly with cephalosporins.
Sulfa drugs were avoided due to a reported allergy; fluoroquinolones were avoided because the patient had a prolonged QT initially.
The urinary tract infection was likely largely contributing to the altered mental status of the patient on admission and post-operatively.
# Bright Red Blood Per Rectum: The patient had 1 episode of [**12-16**] teaspoons of bright red blood per rectum, likely from hemorrhoids.
The patient appears to have a problem with constipation, so she was given an escalated bowel regimen.
# Dementia: Patient had significant sundowning and delirium/agitation.

Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day): hold if loose stools.
