There is no biliary ductal dilatation with the common duct measuring 3 mm.
Multiple echogenic gallstones are again noted within the gallbladder lumen, which does not display any significant distension.
In addition, there is moderate amount of layering echogenic sludge.
Mild persistent wall thickening in the region of the fundus measuring slightly greater than 4 mm is little changed from [**2124**] exam and may represent underlying adenomyomatosis.
No significant edema or pericholecystic fluid is noted on today's exam.
Trace amount of ascites as well as small right pleural effusion noted.
Left kidney measures 10.2 cm and right kidney measures 10.8 cm with no hydronephrosis or stones noted.
The echogenic focus noted in the right kidney on the prior ultrasound is not appreciated on today's examination; the kidneys appear mildly echogenic which could partly be related to technique.
Moderate amount of atherosclerotic disease is again noted within the aorta, which remains non-aneurysmal.
Persistent cholelithiasis with moderate amount of biliary sludge.
Mild wall thickening within the fundus persists which likely reflects fundal adenomyomatosis.
No secondary findings of acute cholecystitis on today's examination or biliary ductal dilatation.
Aortic atherosclerotic disease.
There is no pneumothorax.
The pulmonary edema has significantly decreased compared to prior with minimal vascular engorgement and small residual pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Interval removal of the bilateral chest tubes.
No pneumothorax.
Decreased pulmonary edema now minimal.
Small residual pleural effusions, right greater than left.

No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Conclusions PRE-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Critical aortic stenosis is seen, estimated [**Location (un) 109**]=0.5cm2.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is systolic doming of the anterior mitral leaflet.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear slightly redundant.
The annulus is mildly dilated.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
A small paravalvular leak in the area adjacent to the interatrial septum was initially seen but this is no longer observed after completion of protamine.
There is no aortic insufficiency.
The LV systolic function remains normal; the chamber size is small, consistent with relative hypovolemia.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
Brief Hospital Course: Presented with chest pain, and underwent evaluation which including ruling out for myocardial infarction.
Post operatively she was transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative management on milirone for heart failure but was weaned off in 48 hours.
Within the first twenty four hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and extubated without complications.
However she developed respiratory distress not responsive to bipap and was reintubated on [**2-25**].
Additionally she had episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation treated with betablockers and amiodarone.
She also had bilateral chest tubes placed on [**2-25**] due to respiratory distress and bilateral effusions.
She was improving however and was extubated [**2-26**], but creatinine increased to 1.9 peak [**2-27**] - acute kidney injury, and has trended down with creatinine 1.3 on discharge, which ace inhibitor was not initiated and should be considered as an outpatient.
She continued to make progress however had nausea with vomiting, and not tolerating oral intake.
Surgery was consulted for evaluation due to known hernia and there was no acute processes and lever functions were normal.
She was resumed on liquid diet and advanced to regular diet with medications time spread out without any further nausea or vomiting.
She was ready for discharge to rehab on postoperative day eight with coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
