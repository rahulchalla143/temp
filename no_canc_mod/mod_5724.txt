Admission Date:  [**2155-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-2-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ceclor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**] Chief Complaint: Pleural effusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 34521**] is a 85 yo F with history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, CAD and PAF with recent PPM placement s/p lead revision who presents with fevers, SOB, and pleuritic chest pain.
Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 427**] for pericardial effusions and was found to have small RV perforation during initial PPM placement.
Patient was initially off of warfarin given concern for hemorrhagic conversion of pericardial effusion but was restarted on warfarin prior to discharge.
At discharge, patient continued to complain of SOB and pleuritic chest pain but these were felt to be related to being in Afib given the presence of her debilitation and pleural effusions/atelectasis.
Last CXR on [**7-23**] prior to discharge showed small L pleural effusion and trace R pleural effusion.
She then continued to have chills, began having fevers up to 101.3, developed a productive cough with greenish sputum and felt more SOB.
Of note, she has also been having CP on inspiration but this has been going on since her procedure.
CXR showed L pleural effusion and bedside echo showed a small pericardial effusion that was measured as 0.4cm.

# Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Her systolic blood pressure during this admission ranged from 90s-140s.
She did have episodes of chest pain on the floor with unchanged EKG's and flat cardiac enzyems that responded to another dose of IV lasix.
Her EKG is notable for a prior LBBB as well as a wide QRS complex and atrial fibrillation.
Her fluid overload symptoms resolved prior to hospital discharge, and she was started on a low dose ACE-inhibitor as indicated per her EF.
# Pleural effusion: Patient had a small left pleural effusion prior to discharge last hospitalization on [**7-23**] which was enlarged on film on admission.
Initially a Diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis was deferred because of her elevated INR =3.7 on admission, and she was treated for possible pneumonia.
Analysis of the pleural fluid revealed a exudative effusion with lymphocytic predominance.
This would be inconsistent with parapneumonic effusion, but could be consistent with her prior ventricular disruption from prior pacer wire procedure.
Cytology showed mesothelial cells, but no malignancy.
# Fevers: Her fevers at rehab and new leukocytosis were concerning for infection likely pulmonary source.
On arrival to the floor she was on Vancomycin and Zosyn for antibiotic coverage and her symptoms of cough and fever subsided.
We felt these fevers were most likely due to her pleural effusion rather than a pneumonia.
The pleural fluid was sent for culture and was finalized with no bacterial growth.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Her INR on admission was supratherapeutic.
# Normocytic Anemia: Likely mixed picture with iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease based on iron studies done last admission.
# Dyslipdemia: Continued pravastatin.
# GERD: Omeprazole and sucralafate were continued.
# Panic attacks: Continued sertraline.
She will need to be followed for possible recurrence of her effusion.

Outpatient Lab Work Please draw INR and fax results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27542**], the fax number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34527**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Nursing Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Pneumonia with Exudative Pleural Effusion  Secondary Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation Congestive Heart Failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We have determined that you had a pneumonia and we have treated you with antibiotics.
We have now restarted Coumadin for you diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and you will have to have your INR checked regularly to insure you are on the appropriate dose.
