Patent portal vein and no evidence of biliary dilatation.
Other forms of advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded, purely by imaging appearance.
Massive bilateral hydronephroureter and bladder distention, consistent with outlet obstruction.
Echogenic material in the right collecting system, compatible with debris.
Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2138-11-22**]):       GRAM POSITIVE ROD(S) CONSISTENT WITH CORYNEBACTERIUM OR                            PROPIONIBACTERIUM SPECIES.
2 sets blood cultures [**2138-11-21**] no growth Blood cultures from [**2138-11-22**] pending, NGTD  transfusion reaction workup: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname 91069**] experienced a six-degree F temperature rise while asymptomatic within the first fifteen minutes of a leukoreduced, compatible red cell transfusion.
Laboratory work-up revealed no evidence of hemolysis and the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
However, the patient has since had fevers up to 101 F without associated transfusion and is currently being worked-up for infection.
Given the above and that leukoreduction significantly decreases the incidence of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, the patient's fever is most likely due to the patient's underlying condition and not the transfusion.
No change in transfusion practice is recommended at this time in this patient.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 27yoM with history of chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction/CIP (congenital) s/p small bowel transplant x2, both complicated by rejection now with gastric pouch remaining who is on chronic TPN, s/p vfib arrest in [**8-/2138**] s/p ICD placement and recent fungemia presenting to ICU for management of esophageal clot.
He was transferred to the MICU for EGD under anesthesia with intubation.
He continued to have voluminous output from his G tube which was replaced to keep his systolic blood pressures greater than 90.
In ICU pt was monitored overnight post-procedure for anemia requiring blood transfusions.
Also noted to have fever to 103.3 during initial transfusion, and workup for transfusion reaction was negative.
Pt c/o severe pain in his esophagus exacerbated with cough, swallowing and [**11-17**] at rest.
Also continues to have RUQ pain that is stable from before.
# Esophageal Clot: [**3-12**] severe erosive esophagitis from reflux.
Most likely cause is severe and prolonged reflux of gastric secretions.
pt recieved a 3rd unit PRBCs on return to the floor for HCT drop with nadir at 22.2.
On discharge, HCT was 26 down from admission of 31 but remained relatively stable for several days and no further evidence of blood in Gtube output.
EGD was notable for portal gastropathy, large mucosal congestion.
Also discussed was the fact that most of our intestinal organs (saliva, pancreatic and biliary output) secrete mulitple liters of fluid each day which could account for the majority of large Gtube output.
We spoke with pt's GI doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1926**] who also stated they had never exactly figured out what caused occasionaly high output from g-tube.
GI was consultued, among other things they suggested consideration of octreotide initiation if high output continues.
#cholestasis/?cirrhosis: ALT and alk phos were elevated on admission, increased somewhat and then continued to downtrend slightly but remained stably high on discharge.
High suspicion for cirrhosis as pt has intermittent jaundice, pancytopenia, now with portal gastropahty on EGD, known to have splenomegaly and lifelong TPN.
Most likely liver disease [**3-12**] cholestasis from chronic TPN.
RUQ ultrasound shows no biliary dilitation and pt is s/p cholecystectomy.
Possible that patient had hypotension leating to ischemic insult, but aminotransferases would likely be more elevated.
No h/o viral hepatitis and serologies for Hep A, B, and C checked and were negative.
It was suggested pt be referred to liver clinic as an outpatient for likely biopsy to demonstrate presence of suspected cirrhosis.
Pt complained of severe itching and was started on cholestyrmine.
#fever - temp spiked to 103 in MICU s/p 2units PRBCs, fever began during transfusion and persisted for another day.
Pt was started on 7 day course of ceftriaxone given high concern for cirrhosis in setting of severe esophagitis/UGIB now with persistent fever.
WBlood cultures showed no growth.
Concern that fevers could be aspiration pneumonitis after EGD but could also be translocation secondary to esophagitis.
Given the friable and denuded mucosa of his esophagus and the epinephrine administration during EGD CT chest/neck with contrast was considered to evalute for possible mediastinitis but pt's fevers resolved.
Of note, pt did have 1/4 bottles grow Gm positive rods c/w corynebacterium or propionibacterium species, but we felt this was a contaminant as his fevers were subsiding and all other blood cultures showed no growth.
Likely related to volume status v. pain v. agitation from intubation.
Patient appears hypovolemic on exam and takes TPN and fluids at home on regular basis.
Tachycardia resolved with aggressive fluid hydration, TPN and pain control.
# Dehydration/Acute renal failure: Most likely pre-renal in the setting of increased g-tube output.
# Right sided abdominal pain: Appears chronic in nature.
Unfortunately patient has history of dilaudid dependency which develops during his hospitalizations, at one point requiring rehab to wean himself from the medication.
# bilateral hydronephroureter: As per patient he has congenital enlargement of bladder/this is known problem.
[**Name (NI) **] is urinating without problem.
# Thrombocytopenia: Possibly in the setting of marrow supression [**3-12**] to malnutrition.
Patient also with splenomegaly seen on abdominal ultrasound, he may have distributional thrombocytopenia from the splenomegaly.
Disp:*60 Recon Soln(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY dehydration gastrointestinal bleed  SECONDARY chronic TPN dependence elevated liver enzymes, cholestasis increased G tube output anemia abdominal pain   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with dehydration and increased G-tube output.
We did an endoscopy and found that you had some bleeding in your esophagus, which was treated and we also gave you some blood through a transfusion.
