HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic cough, who presents with increased shortness of breath and cough for a few days.
Patient reports that she has had a dry cough occasionally productive of clear sputum for approximately one year.
However, in the days prior to admission, she had a dramatic increase in her shortness of breath and cough.
Denies any fever or chills.
No orthopnea or PND.
No chest pain or swelling of legs.
Husband has had a cough, but the patient has no other sick contacts.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially hypertensive with low oxygen saturation.
Chest x-ray in the ED revealed a right lower lobe and left retrocardiac opacity and possible congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic cough.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No apparent distress.
Dry mucous membranes.
Lungs:  Scattered large wheezes with crackles at the bases approximately [**2-1**] of the way up bilaterally.
Scattered rhonchi throughout.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Nontender and nondistended.
Extremities:  No edema.
2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Chest x-ray:  Collapse and consolidation of the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac region with mild pleural effusions bilaterally.
Hazy opacity in the right lower lobe.
Right lower lobe opacity consistent with pneumonia or lung mass.
EKG:  Sinus rhythm at [**Street Address(2) 55867**] depressions in I, aVL with biphasic T waves.
Poor R-wave progression.
Repeat EKG showed sinus rhythm at [**Street Address(2) 55868**] changes resolved.
Pulmonary:  Initially on admission, the patient was in respiratory distress felt to be most likely secondary to pneumonia and superimposed congestive heart failure.
Patient continued to have significant wheezing early in admission, and was felt to have a strong component of reactive airway disease.
By [**2121-6-5**], her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally, and she no longer felt short of breath.
Cardiac:  Patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and her EKG on admission showed ST changes in the setting of hypertension and tachycardia.
These changes resolved with resolution of the patient's hypertension.
However, the patient did have elevated cardiac enzymes with troponins of 0.02, 0.12, and 0.07.
She had no chest pain during admission.
Further cardiac issues included new onset of atrial fibrillation on [**2121-6-3**].
This is also important as her echocardiogram showed severe pulmonary hypertension and patient should also be anticoagulated for this reason.
Moderate mitral annular calcification was visualized with 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Two plus tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
The patient will need a repeat echocardiogram in [**5-6**] weeks to determine her baseline PA pressures once her congestive heart failure has completely resolved.
Acute on chronic renal failure:  Patient with mildly elevated creatinine on admission.
It continued to be elevated throughout the admission ranging from 1.2-1.6.
Heme:  Patient with low-grade anemia.
Her hematocrit was followed closely during the admission, and she required no blood transfusion.
Blood pressure:  Patient was initially hypertensive and then hypotensive on admission.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease.
Acute on chronic renal failure.
