Admission Date:  [**2197-3-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2171-4-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2147-6-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  GENERAL SURGERY  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is status post ventral hernia repair, panniculectomy and liposuction and this was complicated by acute renal failure, congestive heart failure and requirement of ventilatory support/slow vent wean/trach.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 49-year-old man with past medical history significant for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who is status post a DDD pacer in '[**84**] which was replaced in the year [**2195**].
He also is status post a gastric bypass in [**2193**] for morbid obesity and his postoperative course at that time was complicated by a trach for ventilatory support.
He has a history recently of atrial fibrillation since [**12-31**] followed by the EP service and his history of pulmonary hypertension and overall hypertension.
Gastric bypass as noted before 2.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
The patient's interoperative course was thought to be uncomplicated, during which he received 1400 cc of crystalloid, had an estimated blood loss of 100 cc and made reportedly 640 cc of urine output.
His postoperative course, however, was significant for oliguria which became anuria x5 hours despite Foley irrigations and manipulations.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for a PA catheter placement and volume resuscitation after this persistent oliguria despite fluid challenges.
The renal assessment was that most likely the patient's preoperative usage of NSAIDS, indomethacin, in addition to the postoperative relative hypotension resulted in renal hypoperfusion and subsequent urinary suppression.
The renal service believed that with increased systolic blood pressure the patient would resolve his transient ATN and acute renal failure and the key would be to support him during this transient period.
The congestive heart failure service, who was familiar with the patient, also saw him during this time and agreed with our cardiac medications.
They also suggested the addition of renal DOPA to help with fluid overload even though would not necessarily help with overall renal function.
The EP service also saw this patient with regards to his atrial fibrillation and they recommended cardioversion during this admission if at all possible.
Oxygenation with his congestive heart failure was initially a significant challenge to the surgical house staff, but with Lasix the patient did maintain urine output and began to auto diurese somewhat.
In terms of the patient's general systemic function, the other challenge at this time besides optimizing this cardiac and renal function was an underlying infectious process which seemed to be taking place and that he began to become febrile to 102??????
The patient had some bilateral atelectasis on CT scan, but no free air, no abscess and no large soft tissue collection.
Eventually, one of the patient's BAL cultures grew out a multi resistant Enterobacter which the infectious disease people were not sure was colonized or not, but approved imipenem and blood cultures from [**4-9**] grew out Staphylococcus coagulase negative which were actually off of an A-line but this line was changed and the patient was started on vancomycin.
The patient completed a 14 day course of both imipenem and vancomycin and at the end of this time really was afebrile and with a normalized white blood cell count.
The captopril was increased during his hospital stay per the congestive heart failure service.
It should be noted that his wound actually was well healed at the time of discharge as well and both his JPs which had been in the subcutaneous tissues post surgery had been discontinued for some time by the plastic surgical team.
His spironolactone which he had been on preoperatively had been held to this point and would be incorporated as needed per the congestive heart failure service.
