Admission Date: [**2168-12-19**]        Discharge Date:[**2169-1-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2168-12-19**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NB   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] is the 1525 gram product of 33 and [**3-16**] week gestation, born to a 36 year old gravida IV, para III, now IV, mother by cesarean section for nonreactive fetal heart tracing.
The pregnancy was complicated by maternal diagnosis of repeated episodes of tachycardia which failed therapy with Labetalol but were successfully treated with Atenolol.
Mother also has asthma and anemia.
Mother also had a prenatal screen that revealed an abnormal AFP-3 with an increased risk of trisomy-21 that was 1:73.
The baby had a biophysical profile of two out of eight on the day of delivery and so was delivered by urgent cesarean section secondary to that status in addition to a nonreactive fetal heart rate tracing.
At delivery, Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] emerged with minimal tone and no respiratory effort.
He was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for prematurity, hypotonia, and respiratory distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination reveals anterior fontanelle that was soft and flat, an edematous face, and intact palate, and mild micrognathia.
His eyes had a prominent pupillary membrane.
His breath sounds were slightly course but with good air entry bilaterally and no retractions or grunting on continuous positive airway pressure.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border.
His abdomen was soft, with no masses, no distention and normal bowel sounds.
Genitourinary examination revealed a somewhat underdeveloped scrotum with no testes palpable bilaterally and a small but normal penis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory:  After requiring positive pressure ventilation for several minutes in the delivery room, Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] continued to have respiratory distress.
His initial chest x-ray showed streaky hazy lung fields bilaterally and very small bilateral pleural effusions.
He was placed on continuous positive airway pressure with improvement of his respiratory distress.
He required continuous positive airway pressure for the first 36 hours of life, then was able to transition to room air and has had no respiratory difficulty since that time.
The pleural effusions were again seen and were small on an initial abdominal ultrasound which was performed on [**2168-12-21**], day of life two.
Cardiovascular:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] initially had somewhat decreased perfusion on admission and therefore received a normal saline bolus.
He has had normal blood pressure and perfusion since that time and no murmur is currently evident on examination.
Feeds were also initiated on day of life two and were advanced relatively slowly secondary to abdominal ultrasound which had revealed some ascitic fluid.
He occasionally was noted to have visible bowel loops on his abdominal examination but these were always soft and reassuring.
He stooled normally and had no emesis or aspirate during his feeding advance.
There was one additional period of low blood glucose that occurred on day of life four, requiring two D10 boluses but thereafter blood sugar was completely stable.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed on day of life two as part of a genetic evaluation.
This revealed normal kidneys but moderate free fluid in the abdomen, seen between the bowel loops, a thickened edematous gallbladder, and small bilateral pleural effusions.
The explanation for the thickened gallbladder was not evident, but repeat abdominal ultrasound one week later on [**2168-12-28**], was completely normal with resolution of the ascitic fluid, the pleural fluid and the gallbladder thickening.
Infectious disease:  In light of his prematurity, respiratory distress, and nonreassuring fetal status, Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] underwent sepsis evaluation at birth.
His initial white blood cell count was 7.9 with 26 percent polys and no bands.
As evaluation for his small size and history of decreased fetal movement for two weeks, Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] had CMV sent.
Neurologic:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] initially had marked hypotonia on admission.
Genetics:  In light of Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 59000**] soft dysmorphic features, including neck swelling and undescended testes, and low set ears, he was evaluated by genetics.
He was not felt by the genetics team to have features consistent with any particular syndrome, but they plan to follow him as an outpatient during his first year of life.
Genitourinary:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 58999**] was noted on his initial examination to have undescended testes.
Testes were not seen in the abdomen or the inguinal region on either of his abdominal ultrasounds.
Discharge DIAGNOSES :  Prematurity at 33 and 4/7 weeks gestation.
Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
