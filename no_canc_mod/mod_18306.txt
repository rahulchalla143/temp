For this pregnancy the last menstrual period was [**2189-3-19**] for an estimated delivery date of [**2188-12-24**] and an estimated gestational age at delivery of 27 and 1/7 weeks.
However, cervical dilation progressed and the mother proceeded to spontaneous vaginal delivery.
There were no maternal fevers or other clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis.
Rupture of membranes occurred at delivery yielding clear amniotic fluid.
The infant cried at delivery with resuscitation and required facial CPAP and free flow oxygen for respiratory distress and central cyanosis.
Initial physical examination revealed a nondysmorphic infant with an intact palate, bilateral red reflex, moderate nasal flaring and retractions with decreased breath sounds bilaterally, regular cardiac rate and rhythm with no murmur.
However, after having increased apnea of prematurity he returned to CPAP on day of life 12, but was able to be subsequently weaned off of CPAP into room air by day of life 18.
[**Known lastname **] was started on caffeine for presumed apnea of prematurity on day of life one.
His apnea of prematurity has resolved.
On day of life 66, [**2189-11-30**], otolaryngology (ORL) from [**Hospital3 1810**] visited [**Known lastname **] for consultation for desaturations and intermittent stridor, sometimes associated with feedings.
A bedside examination revealed laryngomalacia and findings consistent with gastroesophageal reflux (full erythematous arytenoids).
ORL suggested a modified barium swallow and a direct laryngoscopy/bronchoscopy to follow-up on potential additional pathology, however, due to [**Known lastname 43967**] improvement we did not perform these procedures during this hospital stay.
However, these procedures can be considered in consultation with ORL if [**Known lastname 43967**] clinical course were to change or if new clinical concerns were to arise.
He will currently have intermittent stridor especially with activity, however, this does not cause any cardiorespiratory compromise and he has been without any cardiorespiratory events or desaturations over the past five days.
He has not required volume or vasopressor support.
An echocardiogram done on day of life seven revealed no patent ductus arteriosis.
The murmur did persist and is thought to be consistent with a peripheral pulmonic stenosis murmur or a PPS murmur.
There have been no significant problems with feeding intolerance.
Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname **] was started on a 48 hour sepsis evaluation upon admission for prematurity and respiratory distress.
There have been no further infectious disease concerns.
Neurology:  Because of prematurity [**Known lastname **] had a head ultrasound on day of life seven, which showed a left grade one germinal matrix hemorrhage.
Repeat head ultrasounds on day of life 14, 30 and lastly on [**2189-11-30**] all showed resolution of this germinal matrix hemorrhage with no evidence of periventricular leukomalacia.
In addition, due to his prematurity he was evaluated by ophthalmology for retinopathy of prematurity.
The first two on [**10-27**] and [**11-15**] revealed immature retinas.
On [**2189-11-30**] mild retinopathy of prematurity was noted - right eye stage one zone and three eye remained immature in zone three.
His final examination in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit on [**2189-12-14**] revealed mature retina bilaterally with no evidence of retinopathy of prematurity.
Routine health care maintenance:  State newborn screenings were sent per protocol with no concern of abnormalities on his most recent evaluation.
He will need to have Synagis administered on a monthly basis throughout the RSV season, which is considered to be through [**2190-2-18**].
Parents would like [**Known lastname **] circumsized, however, due to scrotal edema, this was deferred to be evaluated as an outpatient at a later date.
State newborn screening was sent per protocol with no persistent abnormalities.
Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet of any of the following three criteria, (1)[**Month (only) **] at less then 32 weeks, (2)[**Month (only) **] between 32 and 35 weeks with two or three of the following; day care during RSV season, smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings, or (3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunizations should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Apnea of prematurity.
Anemia of prematurity.
Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia.
Retinopathy of prematurity.
Intermittent murmur consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
