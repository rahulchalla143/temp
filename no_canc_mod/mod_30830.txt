This AM she was found by family in bed, with urinary incontinence and not responding.
Past Medical History: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (s/p permanent pacemaker, anticoagulated with warfarin) Diabetes Mellitus type 2 Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Recurrent UTIs (E coli and GNR in recent past)  Social History: Married, her husband has advanced [**Name (NI) 5895**].
-Tobacco history: denies -EtOH: denies -Illicit drugs: denies   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: At admission: Vitals: T:  P: 85 R: 18  BP: 194/95 SaO2: 100% on NRB  General: unresponsive HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Pulmonary: lcta anteriorly Cardiac: RRR, S1S2 Abdomen: soft, nondistended, +BS Extremities: warm, well perfused  Neurologic: no eye opening, no commands.
L pupil 1 mm and nonresponsive to light.
No spontaneous movements.
Brisk withdrawal of LE b/l to nailbed pressure.
Makes purposeful movements with all extremities and withdraws to noxious stimuli x 4.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2165-11-11**] no change.
[**7-5**] Head CT and Head and Neck CTA: FINDINGS: HEAD CT: Mild edema is visualized in the parietal lobe which may represent edema from an ischemic event in the proper clinical setting.
However, there is no evidence of mass effect, hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or large vessel territorial infarction.
No fracture is identified.
However, the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent with no evidence of stenosis.
Mild atherosclerotic disease is visualized.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormality.
Mild edema is visualized in the right parietal lobe and may represent edema from an acute ischemic event in the proper clinical setting.
Recons are pending, but no evidence of distinct vascular occlusion or aneurysmal formation.
There are extensive changes of subcortical white matter hypodensity suggesting chronic small vessel ischemia.
There are no findings to suggest acute infarction.
There are scattered cortical calcifications that may reflect old granulomatous disease.
There is an infundibulum at the origin of the left posterior communicating artery.
No evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
There is a pacemaker seen with wires in the atrium and ventricle.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
A left-sided pacer terminates with its leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
Otherwise, good lung volumes without focal radiopacities.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
[**7-13**] Portable CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**7-10**], the patient is somewhat oblique, which limits evaluation of the heart and lungs.
In addition, there are extensive pacemaker and other leads, obscuring the chest.
Nevertheless, there is no definite evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient Is a 69 year old woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on warfarin, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who was found unresponsive on the morning of [**7-5**] with at least 12.5 hours of depressed level of awareness, likely due to acute cerebral infarction affecting bilateral thalami from a cardioaortoembolic event while supratherapeutic on warfarin.
On exam, she would grimace to noxious stimuli and withdraw in all extremities but not follow commands or verbalize.
On noncontrast head CT, she was found to have likely bilateral thalamic hypodensities and possibly a pontine hypodensity, however no brainstem lesion was seen on repeat imaging.
NEURO: For her bilateral thalamic infarcts, she was started on a heparin infusion to anticoagulate her for prevention of further thromboembolism.
ID: The patient was mildly febrile and developed a leukocytosis.
She was initially treated with Bactrim for Proteus but when she continued to have low grade fevers and leukocytosis, she was re-cultured on [**7-12**].
Leukocytosis and fevers have resolved since on the CTX.
GI: The patient has had somnolence and decreased cough and gag reflex that has required an NGT, and then a PEG for tube feeds and medication delivery.
SOCIAL ISSUES: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by a visitor suspected of inappropriate behavior with the patient.
Also there was concern for long term guardianship and the legal process in appointing a guardian has been initiated during this hospitalization.
11. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
14. glucagon (human recombinant) 1 mg Recon Soln Sig: One (1) mg Injection Q15MIN () as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
15. dextrose 50% in water (D50W)     Syringe Sig: 12.5 gram Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute ischemic stroke (bilateral thalamus)  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Speaks short words and phrases, dysarthric.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for decreased level of arousal and found to have strokes in bilateral thalami.
The most likely cause of this was a clot from your heart given your history of atrial fibrillation with a subtherapeutic warfarin level.
