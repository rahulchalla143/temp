Admission Date:  [**2116-11-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-11-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2035-12-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfonamides / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Influenza Virus Vaccine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**] Chief Complaint: Found down, hypotensive in the ED   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 80 yo man with history of neuroendocrine tumor s/p colostomy and chemotherapy, paroximal atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presents being found down by wife.
Currently, reports persistent bilateral proximal upper extremity weakness x 1-2 weeks.
Did not note increased pain immediately, but in the days following.
No head pain, no meningismus, no photophobia.
POS rhinorrhea but no cough, URI-like sx.
No increased diarrhea or constipation.
Prostate cancer status post definitive radiation treatment from [**1-/2113**] to 05/[**2112**].
Atrial fibrillation, s/p pacemaker, on coumadin 4.
Diverticular disease status post a diverticular stricture status post low anterior resection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] here at [**Hospital1 18**] 6.
Neuroendocrine rectal cancer dx [**2115-6-29**].
However, the nature of this recurrence was not clear, and he recently underwent a biopsy of a pelvic mass which does not show any evidence of malignancy.
His father had esophageal cancer but was a heavy smoker.
BS+ NT ND, no hepatomeg, no rebound EXT: no edema, DP 2+ bilat, no palpable cord or assymetry GROIN: erythematous rash w satellites SKIN: no hematomas.
[**2116-11-19**] 9:34 AM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C CHEST: Note is made of goiter with calcification and multiple small nodules, unchanged since prior study.
The lymph node in pretracheal measures 12 mm in short axis, and the right hilar node measures 22 mm in short axis, and subcarinal node measures 42 x 26 mm.
The heart is moderately enlarged, and there is dense calcification of the coronary arteries.
There is small bilateral pleural effusion, new since prior study.
Calcified pleural plaque is again noted, suggestive of prior asbestos exposure.
There is a large hiatal hernia.
In the lung window, note is made of new patchy consolidation in the right lower lobe, associated with interlobular septal thickening and faint ground-glass opacities, suspicious for pneumonia or aspiration/aspiration pneumonia or hemorrhage if the patient has hemoptysis.
There are several patchy nodules without calcification measuring up to 8 mm in the right upper lobe, overall unchanged since prior study.
No endobronchial lesion is noted.
However the evaluation for these liver lesions is limited on this single-phase study.
There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
Pancreas is atrophic, with prominent main pancreatic duct measuring up to 3 mm, unchanged since prior study.
Gallbladder is contracted without evidence of calcification.
There is no ascites or fluid collection.
There is no significant lymphadenopathy in the abdomen.
There are multiple hypoattenuating foci in the kidneys, likely representing cysts, without hydronephrosis or suspiciously enhancing mass.
The visualized portions of large and small intestines are within normal limits with ileostomy.
There is a 2.0 cm enhancing nodule in the right subcutaneous tissues in the back at the level of L2, representing increased metastasis.
PELVIS: Again note is made of large heterogeneous masses lateral to the right psoas muscle measuring 88 x 69 mm, and other mesenteric metastasis on the left measuring 39 x 37 mm (series 3: image 89), increased in size since prior study.
There is no free fluid or significant lymphadenopathy.
There are tiny bladder diverticula with air in the diverticula and in the urinary bladder.
There is severe scoliosis.
Again note is made of thickened trabecula and cortex in the right ilium and sacrum, as seen since [**2112**], consistent with Paget disease.
In the region of Paget disease, it is difficult to exclude new metastasis, however, otherwise, no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion is noted.
Slight increase in size of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as well as increase in size of intraperitoneal metastatic masses.
2.0-cm subcutaneous nodule in the posterior right back at the level of L2 increased in size since prior study, also representing metastasis.
New bilateral pleural effusion with underlying calcified plaques, and new patchy consolidation in the right lower lobe with surrounding faint ground- glass opacity, suspicious for pneumonia or aspiration versus aspiration pneumonia, or hemorrhage if the patient has hemoptysis.
Overall unchanged noncalcified small nodule in bilateral lungs, measuring up to 8 mm.
Degenerative changes and Paget disease in the pelvis.
With the underlying Paget disease, it is difficult to exclude new metastasis in this location, however, no obvious suspicious new lytic or blastic lesion is noted.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 80yo man with hx of neuroendocrine colon ca s/p resection and chemo now with recurrence, prostate cancer, atrial fibrillation on coumadin here with 1-2 weeks of proximal UE weakness, decreased PO x 4 days, and hypotensive episode in the ED.
# Hypotension: Transient (<1h) in the ED but after having a fever to 102.4.
Infectious etiologies possible and initially no localizing symptoms.
Assessed for adrenal insufficiency (but denies history of steroid use), cardiogenic (but no CP, SOB and EKG reportedly unchanged), allergic (no new medications), hypovolemia [**1-31**] poor intake, blood loss (hct at baseline).
CT evaluation revealed probable pneumonia, and was treated with antibiotics.
Given history of colon ca, found down, and INR 2.4, head CT performed and revealed no evidence of hemorrhage.
States he has unsteady gait, with both cane and walker at home, which he doesn't use.
# Fever: Negative ROS for localizing symptoms.
[**11-17**]: Spiked temp with some rigors.
Blood cx with 1/4 bottles GPC indicating likely contaminant but given hypotension and fever, started Vancomycin despite minimal bottles being positive.
Speciation of blood cultures consistent with contaminant.
CT findings suggestive of PNA though continued to have minimal symptoms.
# Atrial fibrillation - s/p pacer on coumadin.
Lisinopril held due to hypotension and poor renal function.
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.3, elevated on admit.
Urine lytes sent for confirmation.
# Proximal muscle weakness: For 1-2 weeks s/p mechanical fall and catching himself with his arms extended.
Elevated ESR & CRP.
Suspect likely due to deconditioning.
CT torso completed to assess for further metastases, and new lesions were seen.
# Groin rash: Noted on admit, stated to have been there for [**12-31**] weeks.
Treated with miconazole cream PRN with improvement.
# Anemia: HCT stable.
Will work-up various etiologies including decreased production; lysis or loss.
Stools were guaiac negative, no evidence of lysis on labs.
# History of prostate cancer: Flomax held on admission given hypotension, but restarted when became normotensive.
Unclear whether lesions on CT represent recurrence of prostate cancer or neuroendocrine tumor.
Disp:*1 Tube* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA caregroup  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Mechanical fall, pneumonia Secondary: Prostate cancer, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, diverticular disease, neuroendocrine rectal cancer s/p LAR   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile and ready for continued outpatient PT   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after being found down, after falling.
You were found to have an episode of low blood pressure which resolved with fluid administration.
You were also evaluated by CT imaging for extension of your cancer, you should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further evaluation of this ongoing issue.
Please return to the ED or contact your regular physician if your notice worsening cough, bloody sputum, fevers/chill, vomiting, loose stools or for any other symptom which is concerning to you.
