Admission Date:  [**2177-5-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-5-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-12-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization  History of Present Illness: 76-yo-woman referred from [**Hospital3 3583**] w/ NSTEMI.
She was feeling well until 20 hours ago, when she developed subacute onset substernal chest pain radiating to both shoulders, L>R, w/ no dyspnea, palps, nausea, or diaphoresis.
The pain persisted throughout the day, prompting her to present to [**Hospital3 3583**] 12 hours ago.
There, she was found to have ST depressions on EKG leads V2-V6, CK 1000 w/ elevated trop I.
Concern for possible aortic dissection precluded further anti-platelet therapy, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Chest pain resolved w/ medical therapy, and she is now admitted to the CCU for ongoing management.
Currently, she denies any chest pain, palps, dyspnea.
ROS reveals no fever, chills, weight loss, abd pain, hematuria, diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia.
She does have intermittently productive cough for 6 weeks, which seems to have started after she began lisinopril therapy.
Past Medical History: - HTN - hyperlipidemia - chronic kidney disease: unknown baseline renal fxn - COPD - Hypothyroid - PVD: s/p LE PCI - GERD   Social History: smoked 50 pack-years, but quit 1 year ago.
Retired Accounts Payable manager for Ocean Spray.
Family History: Father had MI in his 40s; no h/o sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, no JVD.
CV: irreg irreg s1/s2, no s3/s4/m/r Pulm: poor air movement throughout w/ diffuse exp wheezing b/l, no crackles.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: warm, dopplerable PT pulses b/l w/ dopplerable right DP, left DP not dopplerable, no edema.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated systemic arterial pressures.
Initial access was attempted via the right femoral artery, but this was unsucessful due to severe PVD.
The right radial artery was then prepped and accessed without incident.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal and mid-segments of the inferior, inferolateral and lateral walls (left circumflex coronary artery distribution).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg) and Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
There is mild valvular aortic stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9 cm2).
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate calcification of the posterior mitral annulus and moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae, but no mitral stenosis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the CCU following her cardiac catheterization for a circumflex artery ST elevation MI.
She had minor probelms with oxygenation secondary to volume overload from intra and post-cath IV fluids as well as COPD.
There was some concern on an OSH chest X-ray for a pneumonia, but she was not initiated on antibiotic therapy as clinically she did not appear to have a pneumonia.
She had a 12 hour long episode of atrial fibrillation 2 days prior to discharge.
She was loaded on amiodarone, given and taught how to use lovenox, started on coumadin, and discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of hearts monitor to test for recurrent Afib and assess her QT interval.
On the day of discharge the patient's creatinine was slightly elevated from baseline at 2.1.
This was likely related to contrast nephropathy and aggressive diuresis.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every 6-8 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 2203**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Posterior ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction - note that the EKGs showed ST depression in the anterior leads, but that these are actually posterior elevations.
Patient is chest pain free.
Please return to the hospital if you should have chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or any other concerning symptoms.
