Initial transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia improved during hospital course (on discharge AST/ALT 44/62, TBili 3.5.
Elevation was thought to be [**3-15**] evolving hepatic injury vs. cholestasis/ductal obstruction.
After discussion with the GI service, it was felt that the patient was safe to return home with close PCP f/u and re-check of alk phos within 5 days (appointment has been scheduled).
CKD likely [**3-15**] HTN vs. ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF.
#Heme: Normocytic anemia likely [**3-15**] AOCD vs. CKD.
There was no evidence of bleed or hemolysis.
Available data suggests thrombocytopenia is chronic (baseline 100-130s).
There was no evidence of DIC, though admission thrombocytopenia below baseline was presumed [**3-15**] septic physiology.
No clear mechanism of marrow hypo-proliferation or destruction.
Given known chronicity, and stability of thrombocytopenia during hospitalization, there was low concern for HIT.
#AF: Initial rate-control [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (Metoprolol) was held [**3-15**] hypotension on admission.
#Hypoxemia: Thought to be [**3-15**] aggressive IVF (+TBB 8L in ICU) in the setting of poor underlying respiratory substrate ([**3-15**] COPD).
