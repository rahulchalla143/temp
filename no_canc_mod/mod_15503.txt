Admission Date:  [**2175-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-8-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-7-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Shellfish Derived  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pulmonary vein isolation/ablation Intubation  History of Present Illness: 84 y.o male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation, status post failure of amiodarone and direct cardioversion x3 who was admitted to the hospital 2 days ago for a pulmonary vein isolation procedure.
He initially converted to sinus rhythm, however reverted to atrial fibrillation subsequently.
The day after his procedure, he developed some worsening shortness of breath and on chest x-ray was found to have some pulmonary edema.
This morning, he got up to go to the bathroom and suddenly developed acute onset left sided hemiparesis.
A code stroke was called he underwent emergent CTA of the head and neck, which showed no demonstrable clot but high grade right ICA stenosis with poor flow.
Given his anticoagulation and recent procedure he was not a candidate for TPA per neurology.
He then developed worsening shortness of breath and desaturation on the floor, and was then intubated on the floor prior to transfer to the CCU.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Positive for hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ICD placed initially 15 years ago (unclear reason) Dual chamber ICD upgraded [**3-4**] COPD CAD s/p stent [**79**] years [**Doctor First Name 51161**] Hospital CHF vs altitude sickness Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Cholecystectomy Gun shot wound to leg 30 years ago- s/p arterial repair left leg; Bullet still in leg Bladder spasm   Social History: Works as an optometrist 5 days per week.
ETOH: 1 glass of wine with dinner Tobacco: no   Family History: Not obtained  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION on Admission: Gen: intubated male in no acute distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
CARDIAC: Crescendo decrescendo [**1-28**] murmur heard best at RUSB consistent with aortic stenosis.
normal s1, 22 LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Head CT shows chronic infarct in the cerebellum, but no evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect seen.
CT perfusion demonstrates no definite perfusion defect.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates 60-70% stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery but the evaluation is somewhat limited secondary to exuberant calcification adjacent to the area.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates mild atherosclerotic disease at the left vertebral artery and proximal basilar artery with some dolichoectasia of the left vertebral artery.
Head CT shows chronic infarct in the cerebellum, but no evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect seen.
CT perfusion demonstrates no definite perfusion defect.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates 60-70% stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery but the evaluation is somewhat limited secondary to exuberant calcification adjacent to the area.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates mild atherosclerotic disease at the left vertebral artery and proximal basilar artery with some dolichoectasia of the left vertebral artery.
Interval development of hypodensity in the right centrum semiovale, compatible with acute-subacute lacunar infarct.
No intracranial hemorrhage or large vascular territory infarction.
Diffuse mucosal thickening involving the paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and ethmoid air cells.
CAROTID U/S [**8-22**]: Impression: Right ICA stenosis 60-69%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.

Major and Active Problems during hospitalization: # Stroke: Evidence of high grade internal carotid stenosis on CT scan.
Furthermore, there was no evidence of a clot.
A carotid US demonstrated stenosis: R 60-69%, and L stenosis < 40%, but an endarterectomy is not warrented at this time.
# Congestive heart failure: The patient had acute pulmonary edema currently which is likely the cause of his hypoxia on the floor.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Due to his stroke his blood pressure was allowed to rise, and his rate was difficult to control.
# Acute kidney injury: He had an elevated Cr that was thought to be scondeary to decreased forward flow.
