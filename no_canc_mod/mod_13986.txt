No change in apical and anterior components.
Pneumomediastinum is no longer visible.
Small right-sided hydropneumothorax with dependent atelectasis/consolidation.
Multiple hypoattenuating areas throughout the kidneys, some of which are hyperdense, likely representing multiple cysts.
Simple cysts also identified within the liver and this raises the possibility of a polycystic kidney disease variant.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Mild soft tissue stranding surrounding the right common femoral artery and presumed arterial puncture site with mild displacement of the surrounding muscles.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse of the posterior leaflet and borderline prolapse of the anterior leaflet .
Severe (4+), eccentric, anteriorly directed mitral regurgitation is seen.
Systolic flow reversal is seen in the right upper pulmonary veins.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately thickened and there is at least mild to moderate leaflet prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Other findings are unchanged  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 60083**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2148-5-8**] for elective surgical management of her mitral valve disease.
A small pneumothorax was noted on her chest x-ray and her chest tube was left in place for an extra day and then removed.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 60083**] noted some right leg numbness which was attributed to irritation of the femoral nerve with groin cannulation.
This revealed no evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma, multiple renal cysts, some simple liver cysts and a small right-sided hydropneumothorax.
Physical therapy continued to work with her and her numbness continued to improve.
As a follow-up chest x-ray showed a persistent small right pneumothorax and pleural effusion, thoracentesis was performed.
350cc of serous fluid were drained as well as pockets of air.
