Cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion.
Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could represent pleural effusion or subpulmonic effusion.
Retrocardiac opacity could represent atelectasis and pleural effusion, however, cannot rule out consolidation.
Interval development of right upper pole complex solid and cystic mass,concerning for malignancy.
Further evaluation with CT of the abdomen and pelvis utilizing renal protocol (if renal status allows) or MRI is recommended.
Echogenic renal parenchyma bilaterally, likely as a result of underlying medical renal disease.
Likely right lower pole hyperechoic lesion, which could represent an angiomyolipoma.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior report of [**2141-8-17**] (stress echo), the findings are new and c/w a cardiomyopathy.
The patient exercised for 6 minutes of a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol and was stopped for fatigue representing a fair functional capacity for her age.
No neck, arm, back, or chest discomforts were reporte throughout the procedure.
The rhythm was sinus with occasional isolated PACs and PVCs.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG in the setting of LBBB at the achieved workload.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with HTN, DM, CKD who presented with a CHF exacerbation and hypertensive urgency.
Pt's HTN has been better controlled, fluid taken off, and no longer requiring supplemental oxygen.
Elevated troponins were thought to be secondary to kidney disease.
Patient had a negative fluid balance daily.
Patient was placed on a diabetic and low salt diet.
3.CKD-Thought to be likely due to HTN and DM.
Patient was able to be successfully diuresed with IV lasix and therefore no acute dialysis was needed this admission.
She had a renal ultrasound which showed medical renal disease, a suspicious mass at the upper right pole, and a angiomyolipoma at the lower right pole.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 4849**] is her nephrologist and she will follow up with him as an outpatient so that she and her family can decide on a plan of action Re: suspicious renal mass.
This is thought to be due to CKD, there was question of the patient undergoing a HCT drop or was this due to mobilization of fluids secondary to diuresis.
Anemia work up revealed anemia of chronic disease.
However, these were discontinued during her hospitalization for concern of worsening/contributing to heart failure.
