Admission Date:  [**2120-2-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-3-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-11-29**]      Sex:  M  Service:  MICU ORANG  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  45-year-old male with history of cerebrovascular accident ([**6-/2119**]) with SVP in 240s, left-sided weakness, word-finding problems, [**Name (NI) 7344**] abuse (cocaine, heroin), noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hepatitis C sent to Emergency Department from halfway house for change in mental status and lethargy.
Arrives in Emergency Department with slurred speech, unresponsiveness, and occasional atypical shaking.
Narcan given with no effect.
Urinalysis negative.
Head CT negative for new infarct.
Acute on top of chronic renal failure.
Altered mental status.
Found to be Helicobacter pylori positive.
Also noted was a non-actively bleeding ulcer.
No further evidence of bleeding during rest of hospital course.
Change in mental status/shaking/questionable seizure: Patient presents to Emergency Department with altered mental status with baseline function unknown.
In the Intensive Care Unit patient developed diffuse uncontrollable shaking/seizure-like activity.
Likely explanation per Neuro was diffuse anoxic brain injury from the gastrointestinal bleeding.
Patient was started on a course of Haldol to minimize his agitation and to facilitate treatment.
However, sedation was quickly weaned in order to obtain a better picture of his mental status.
Respiratory/intubation:  Due to patient's altered mental status and uncontrollable shaking/agitation, patient was intubated for airway protection.
However, intubation course was prolonged due to his 1) altered mental status prolonged agitation and 2) high volume of secretion.
Attempted extubation failed due to agitation and inability to control secretions.
Acute and chronic renal failure:  Likely etiology was prerenal/hypovolemia from the gastrointestinal bleed.
Electrolytes/fluid volume was closed monitored.
Troponin rise:  Likely due to demand ischemia/ hypovolemia.
Troponin peaked on hospital day number two, down trended thereafter with continued elevated values attributable to the renal failure.
Concern was for ventilatory-acquired pneumonia versus sinusitis.
Sputum sample showed gram positive cocci and enteric Vancomycin was also started.
Urinalysis revealed possible urinary tract infection.
Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressure remained very resistant to medication.
Outpatient treatment with Cozaar was held due to the acute renal failure.
Patient's blood sugar levels were well controlled and at one point required no insulin.
PROCEDURE:  Tracheostomy without complication.
MRI [**2120-2-22**] IMPRESSION:  The findings described above could be secondary to ischemia or demyelinating disease.
Although involvement of corporis callosum favors demyelinating process evidence of chronic blood products in basal ganglia lacunas, favor ischemia.
CT HEAD [**2120-2-22**] FINDINGS:  Demonstrates multiple chronic lacunar infarction within the basal ganglia and periventricular white matter regions of both cerebral hemispheres as well as the cerebellum on both sides.
The fourth ventricle is moderately enlarged, presumably a consequential atrophic changes arising from the infarct.
No definite interval change suggests the appearance of new infarct at this time.
No interval appearance of intracranial hemorrhage.
