He developed a mild occipital headache/neck pain 3 days ago.
He described the pain as a dull ache.
He noted no photosensitivity but did notice worsening if he stood up to walk, improved if he lay down.
He reported no fevers but a chill Tuesday night when the headache started.
He noted no neuro deficits.
Because the pain had only worsened and had lasted 2 days despite OTC analgesics, he went to [**Hospital6 76854**] yesterday.
He got 8 mg IV Vitamin K, stopped before 10 mg b/c he reported nausea and diaphoresis.
CSF gram stain showed no WBC and no organisms; culture is pending at [**Hospital3 **].
Here, CTA head was preliminarily read as showing no aneurysms (final recons still pending) but showing generalized edema.
MRI was subsequently performed and showed diffuse subdural pachymeningeal enhancement and T2 hyperintensity but no blood on GRE, no edema, no DWI lesions.
He continues to have a headache that is worsened if he sits up.
On neuro ROS, he denies loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
Denies difficulties producing or comprehending speech.
No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
He denies recent fever.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

No known neurologic disease.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx.
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
Reports mild meningismus on formal testing, although he flexes and rotates his neck freely during casual conversation.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
There were no paraphasic errors.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No dysmetria on FNF or HKS bilaterally.
Pertinent Results: 140  103  19  155 3.6  25   1.1  WBC: 7.8; Hct: 36.5; Plt: 256  PT: 17.1  PTT: 26.8  INR: 1.5  EKG: NSR at 80 bpm, no ST-T changes (non-specific T wave flattening in III).
Radiologic Data: MRI head: "Bilateral subdural fluid collections that demonstrate duffisue pachymeningeal enhancement with no evidence of associated blood products.
SD effusions associated with meningitis.
[**2-4**] viral meningoencephalitis."
Differential diagnosis includes subdural effusions, empyemas, or sterile subdural fluid from recent lumbar puncture, or due to intracranial hypotension.
Although the differential diagnosis based on CT findings alone would also include chronic subdural hematomas, the recent MRI from [**2108-11-30**] noted no evidence of blood products.
Loss of sulcal definition, but similar in appearance from [**2108-11-29**] CT.
In the appropriate clinical setting, this could again denote generalized edema, or the effects of the contiguous subdural collections.
No new acute intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Obstructing 4 mm calculus in the distal left ureter with mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
Bilateral subdural fluid collections appear similar in size but slightly more dense since prior study.
Differential diagnosis includes subdural effusions, empyema, or sterile subdural fluid from recent lumbar puncture, in the setting of intracranial hypotension.
Effacement of the sulci is unchanged, and may represent mass effect from the contiguous subdural collections.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage  MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**12-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
L5-S1: Degenerative disc disease, with small central disc protrusion, causing mild indentation on the ventral thecal sac.
Blood with dural patch in the spinal canal from Ll5-S2 levels as described above, encasing the roots and mildly reducing the potential space available in the canal.
No obvious fluid collections noted in the posterior spinous soft tissues.
Increased signal in the interspinous ligaments at L3-4, L4-5 and slight extent at L5-S1 levels can relate to recent procedure.
When this seemed unlikley and his MRI showed bilateral subdural effusions, he was transferred to neurology.
The initial assessment suggested that he likely had an intracranial hypotension and a low-pressure headache aggravated by his recent LP.
He ended up receiving a blood patch, although no obvious dural tear was detected.
He had a lumbar spine MRI which showed changes consistent with his recent LP and blood patch.
He was tried temporarily on ultram and fiorecet, but there was concern for ultram interacting with his psych meds (the combination with wellbutrin was concerning for lowering seizure threshold) and the fiorecet was being overused, so it was DC'd out of concern for generating rebound headaches.
Venlafaxine was tried as well temporarily and ultimately switched for nortriptyline.
His pain was mildly better controlled on discharge.
It was felt that a large component of his pain may be related to decompensation of his underlying anxiety/depression.
While on Neurosurgery he had an episode of hematuria, left flank pain and hematemesis.
He had a CT Abd/pelivs which showed a 4 mm kindey stone in the left ureter.
It was felt that his hematuria was related to his renal stone.
GI was consulted & an EGD was performed which only showed small hiatal hernia and no source of bleed.
His synthroid was also increased in light of his elevated TSH and he was told to get repeat TFT's in 3 months.
