She also has increased pain and mottling of the BLE R>L which is new.
She has multiple open wounds on her legs and feet including a large R heel ulcer which reportedly developed while being in a walking boot or immobilizer.
She has a history of an aortobifemoral stent which was placed endovascularly in [**2156-5-23**] for aortic thrombus as well as bilateral femoral artery cutdowns with thrombectomy for clot at the same time.
She denies any other vascular procedures but neither she nor the husband are positive and the records from the outside facility are incomplete.
She is transferred emergently from [**Hospital 189**] Hospital for evaluation of the pulseless legs.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: aortobifemoral stent placement, CHF (last EF <45%), PVD, HOLD, HTN, CKD, COPD, afib on coumadin, previous aortic clots  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: bilateral total hip replacement, bilateral total knee replacement, endovacular aortobifem stent, bilateral femoral artery cutdowns    Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY: denies tob/etoh/illicits   Family History: non contrib  Pertinent Results: CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC RUNOFF W/W&WO C AND RECONS Study Date of [**2156-6-29**]  CT CHEST:  The thyroid gland appears heterogeneous, possibly containing subcentimeter hypodense lesions inferiorly (2, 12), which could be assessed by ultrasound if not already performed.
There is moderate-to-severe diffuse atherosclerotic calcification.
The heart demonstrates severe biatrial enlargement and multivessel coronary arterial calcifications as well as mitral annular and aortic valve calcifications.
A moderate-sized pericardial effusion is present inferior to the heart.
A small epicardial lymph node is calcified.
There is pretracheal and precarinal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 14 mm.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left, with associated compressive atelectasis.
Mild bronchiectasis is seen in the right lung base.
Patchy peribronchovascular opacities in the right lower lobe, in combination with layering fluid in the upper esophagus, suggest aspiration.
CT ABDOMEN:  Note is made of reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins, compatible with right heart insufficiency.
The liver demonstrates no focal lesion.
The left kidney demonstrates delayed nephrogram and scattered areas of wedge-shaped transcortical hypoattenuation, consistent with renal infarction.
There is no free air or free fluid.
Prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes are noted.
CT PELVIS:  Assessment is highly limited due to streak artifact from bilateral hip arthroplasty.
CTA:  There is moderate amount of thrombosis within the proximal left subclavian artery near the origin (3A, 1).
The aorta is normal in caliber without dissection or aneurysm.
There is diffuse severe atherosclerotic disease.
Although not tailored for assessment of pulmonary embolism, there are no large filling defects to suggest central pulmonary embolism.
There is high-grade narrowing of SMA origin with patent distal vessel.
The left renal arterial origin appears narrowed; however, distally, the left renal artery is opacified.
No inferior mesenteric artery is visualized.
Distal to the renal arterial origins, there is complete thrombosis of the aorta, with thrombus extending to the level of distal common iliac arteries.
Multiple soft tissue ulcers are seen along bilateral lower extremities.
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY:  On the right, there is reconstitution of flow in the distal right common iliac artery and external and internal iliac arteries via the inferior epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries.
There is minimal trickle flow in the common femoral artery and proximal superficial femoral artery, which attenuates within the mid superficial femoral artery.
From the mid superficial femoral artery distally, there is complete non-opacification of distal arterial branches including trifurcation of anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, which is likely related to slow flow, though high grade  obstruction proximally is not excluded.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: On the left, there is similarly reconstitution of the distal common iliac artery and opacification of the internal and external iliac arteries by retrograde filling via inferior epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries.
From the level of mid superficial femoral artery distally, there is complete non-opacification of arterial branches, including trifurcation into the anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal arteries to the level of the ankle.
This is likely related to slow flow, and less likely due to proximal occlusion.
No underlying vascular stent or graft is noted.
BONE WINDOW:  There is diffuse osseous demineralization.
There is high-grade L1 wedge compression deformity with greater than 60% loss of height.
Severe discogenic osteoarthritis is present at L4-L5 with endplate sclerosis and vacuum phenomenon.
A large expansile lytic lesion within the left ischial tuberosity is incompletely assessed and could be correlated with prior exam and clinical history.
Complete occlusion of the infrarenal aorta with non-opacification of proximal common iliac arteries.
Bilateral distal common iliac arterial reconstitution via circumflex iliac and inferior epigastric arteries, opacifying proximal superficial femoral arteries.
From the mid superficial femoral arteries on, there is complete non-opacification bilaterally, most likely due to slow flow though a high grade occlusion cannot be excluded.
Diffuse severe atherosclerotic disease, coronary arterial disease, biatrial enlargement.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
Right lower lobe aspiration.
Hypoperfused left kidney with left renal infarcts, and possible right inferior pole renal infarct.
Severe biatrial cardiomegaly and diffuse severe atherosclerotic disease.
Heterogeneous thyroid gland with possible subcentimeter hypodensities, which could be assessed by ultrasound if not previously performed.
Left ischial expansile lytic lesion of unclear source with mediastinal adenopathy.
Recommend correlation with prior imaging and clinical history.
Bilateral lower extremity ulcerations.
No pulmonary embolism.
The distal end of the left external iliac stent and junction with the left common femoral graft is not adequately evaluated due to streak artifact from the adjacent hip prosthesis.
High grade stenosis of the proximal right common femoral artery.
Unchanged right internal iliac and left profunda femoris arterial occlusion.
Unchanged high-grade stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery with no evidence of bowel ischemia.
Right lower lobe ground-glass opacity with secretions at the right lower lobe bronchi, could represent a small amount of aspiration.
Moderate left and small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
No intra-abdominal contrast leak to suggest visceral perforation.
Stable b/l pleural effusions with punctate old hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 91103**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2156-6-29**] from an OSH for lower extremity pain where she was found to have b/l pulseless lower extremities.
She was found to have an occlusive thrombus in her previously placed endovascular stent-graft.
She was heparized and emergently taken to the OR for thrombectomy, [**Hospital1 **]-iliac stenting, resection of L CFA aneurysm with PTFE interposition grafts and b/l LE fasciotomies.
On POD 1 she was noted to have a painful dusky left hand.
Arterial duplex demonstrated a likely chronic subclavian stenosis.
She was continued on antibiotics and on POD6/4 she underwent debridement of her R leg and heel and was noted to have extensive necrotic/nonviable muscle.
Lather that day she became hypotensive requiring pressors and was noted to have an altered mental status.
A TTE was performed showing a large mobile right atrial thrombus and loculated pericardial effusion with tamponade.
On POD 22/20/16/15/7 she suffered PEA arrest x 2 with return of spontaneous circulation.
A CTA torso at this time showed no pulmonary embolism, but did show a high grade stenosis of her SMA.
On POD 32/30/25/24/17/2 she had a respiratory arrest and became severely hypoxemic.
She was reintubated and underwent bronchoscopy showing mucous plugging and very friable and hyperemic tracheal and bronchial mucosa.
The following day she became hypotensive, transiently requiring pressors and a BAL was performed showing pseudomonas, and she was noted to have cellulitis of her LLE and she was restarted on antibiotics.
She improved and was transiently weaned to PSV, however due to concern over her multiple cardiac and respiratory arrests and her multiple intubations, she underwent tracheostomy placement by ACS on POD 39/37/32/31/24/9.
Two days later (POD 41/39/34/33/26/11/2) her PEG tube became dislodged and fell out.
A CT abdomen was performed and she was noted to have continued free air, but no extravasation of contrast.
Due to concern for tracheo-innominate fistula, her trach was removed and she was reintubated and taken emergently to the OR by thoracic surgery for neck exploration, where she was found to have arterial bleeding from her thyroid.
However, that evening, she suffered from a VFib arrest and was unable to be resuscitated.
