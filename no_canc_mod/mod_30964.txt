There is a non-obstructive bowel gas pattern.
Moderate colonic fecal loading is seen throughout.
No evidence of free air is seen.
Amorphous calcification projecting over the right renal shadow could be artifactual, however, raises concern for possible staghorn calculus.

Pt does have hx of pancreatitis and pt has elevated lipase.
Lipase, however, is not sensitive for pancreatitis in the setting of DKA, and pt has no clinical signs of pancreatitis (no abd pain to palpation).
No e/o cardiac ischemia as pt has neg trop x1 and EKG w/ non-specific changes.
On admission, pt has anion gap of 34, ketones in urine and a HCO3 of 5.
Anion gap has closed and patient is no longer acidotic.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and sent an anti-GAD ab to discern type I vs type II.
# Tachycardia: pt w/ sinus tachycardia to 150 on day of admission, which quickly responded to IVF.
# Constipation: Pt states hasn't had BM in at least 5 days, per pt.
Likely secondary to combination of gastroenteritis and poor fluid intake.
# hypercholesterolemia: restarted simvastatin .
# Abdominal calcification -- confirmed w/ PCP office was not a new finding.
Raises question of staghorn calculus, though urine not suggestive and patient without recurrent UTIs typical of this.
No e/o infection this admission.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis after a few weeks of abdominal symptoms.
You were found to have anemia, and this should be addressed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
