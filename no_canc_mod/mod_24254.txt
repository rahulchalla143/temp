The patient presented to his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2108-3-9**] with a chief complaint of malaise.
The patient was recently treated for an episode of possible bronchitis at the end of [**Month (only) 404**] with a course of moxifloxacin.
He reported he felt persistent productive cough since that time.
Over the past two days prior to admission he reported worsening fatigue and malaise as well as dyspnea on exertion.
He reports this episode was very similar to when he presented with a wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].
He denies any orthopnea or PND.
He denies any chest pain or palpitations.
DC cardioversion was discussed, however a TEE showed evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].
Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the patient has a history of WPW with wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].
The patient was also found to be febrile, have leukocytosis and productive cough.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous  thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

Also, as the patient had evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] on TEE, we refrained from DC or chemical cardioversion with procainamide especially since patient was stable on admission.
Likely febrile illness and over treatment with levothyroxine for Hashimoto's thyroiditis contributed to patient's a fib with rapid ventricular rate.
The patient then spontaneously converted into sinus rhythm with a wide QRS indicative of a right posterior/inferior bypass tract consistent with WPW.
The patient was discharged on propranolol, as there is a possibility thyrotoxicosis could have initially contributed to the A fib with RVR, and coumadin for management of his A fib.
He will be seen as an outpatient to discuss the possibility of ablation of the WPW bypass tract to prevent further episodes of wide complex tachycardia.
# [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:  The patient presented with a TEE done at [**Hospital 1474**] hospital which showed evidence of a left atrial appendage thrombus.
A TEE was done here which showed no thrombus.
# Febrile Illness:  Fever, leukocytosis and productive cough likely secondary to respiratory illness.
As the patient has had cough, malaise and general body weakness flu was on differential, however ruled out during hospitalization.
The CXR on admission showed possible LLL and RLL infiltrate, thus the patient was started on doxycycline and ceftriaxone for CAP.
The patient also had a UA which showed possible evidence of a UTI however the urine culture was negative.
# Hypertension:  Initially held antihypertensives in the setting of A fib with RVR with episode of hypotension at OSH in order to up-titrate beta blocker for control of AF as much as possible.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Lipids checked and were not elevated despite lack of statin therapy.
# Hashimoto's Thyroiditis:  Pt's TSH at OSH was 0.07, however free T4 and T3 within normal limits.
# Depression:  Continued sertraline.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: - Atrial Fibrillation - [**Doctor Last Name 13534**] Parkinson White syndrome - Bronchitis/Community Acquired Pneumonia .
Secondary Diagnoses: - Hypertension - Hashimoto's Thyroiditis - Morbid Obesity   Discharge Condition: The patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable prior to discharge.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a fast heart rate and respiratory illness.
You were found to have atrial fibrillation and an accessory pathway in your heart called [**Doctor Last Name 13534**] Parkinson White.
You were also thought to have a clot in your heart.
A repeat echocardiogram was done here which showed no clot in your heart.
You were also treated with antibiotics for your respiratory illness.
If you experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills or any other worrisome symptoms please seek medical attention.
