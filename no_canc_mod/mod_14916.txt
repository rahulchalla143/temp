Unfortunately due to recurrent IVDA, he developed recurrent endocarditis.

Family History: Denies premature coronary artery disease  Physical Exam: Admission: Vitals: T 98.2, BP 124/75, HR 80, RR 18, SAT 97% on room air General: well developed male in no acute distress HEENT: oropharynx benign, Neck: supple, no JVD, Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, [**5-13**] holosystolic murmur Lungs: clear bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Ext: warm, 1+ edema bilaterally, no varicosities Pulses: 2+ distally(bounding) Neuro: nonfocal  Discharge: VS T 97.5  HR 82 SR  BP 115/80  RR 18  O2sat 97% on room air Gen NAD Neuro A&Ox3, non focal exam Pulm CTA- bilat CV RRR, sternum stable, incision with steri strips-CDI Abdm soft, NT/ND/NABS Rt groin incision with steri strips-CDI Ext warm, trace edema   Pertinent Results: [**2140-3-7**] Admit chest x-ray: Diffuse enlargement of the cardiac silhouette consistent with cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
The lungs remain clear with no evidence of acute infiltrate, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
[**2140-3-8**] Brain MRA: No enhancing lesions.
Encephalomalacia of the right parietal lobe from a prior infarct.
Minimal chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
No acute infarct or evidence of mycotic aneurysm.
[**2140-3-10**] Cardiac Catheterization: Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no significant epicardial CAD.
The LMCA, LAD, LCX, RCA and their branches had no angiographically apparent disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial central normotension.
Supraaortic aortography revealed severe AI.
CHEST (PA & LAT)[**2140-3-16**] Reason: evaluate pleural effusions [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 25 year old man s/p avr, asc ao replacement REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate pleural effusions STUDY: PA and lateral chest, [**2140-3-19**].
Evaluate pleural effusions.
The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged but stable since the previous studies.
There is some streaky density seen at the left mid lung field consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with a small pleural effusion.
Impression: Cardiomegaly with likely a small left-sided pleural effusion.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D  images.
Severely dilated LV cavity.
Severe global LV hypokinesis.
Severely depressed LVEF.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior  - hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal -  hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; basal inferior - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo; RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.
Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Abnormal motion of AVR leaflets/discs.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An aortic annular abscess is seen.
There are other echolucencies consistent with perivalvular abscess seen nera both coronary artery takeoffs.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is still at least moderate if not moderate to severe global hypokinesis.
There is a bileaflet prosthesis in the aortic position.
Can not rule out a small perivalvular leak.
Brain MRI/MRA imaging was obtained which showed no acute infarct or evidence of mycotic aneurysm.
It was however notable for encephalomalacia of the right parietal lobe from a prior infarct, and minimal chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was also obtained which confirmed severe aortic insufficiency.
The left ventricle was severely dilated with mildly depressed left ventricular function.
Right ventriclular systolic function was likely depressed but hard to evaluate given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation which was [**2-9**]+.
There was 1+ mitral regurgitation and only trivial pulmonic insufficiency.
Prior to surgery, TEE was performed which revealed severely dilated right and left ventricles with severely depressed right and left ventricular function.
Cardiac catheterization was obtained to exclude a possibility of a coronary embolus.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from inotropic support without difficulty.
The pain service was consulted to assist in the postoperative management of his incisional discomfort.
His heart failure regimen was optimized.
He spiked a fever on postoperative day four for which pan cultures were obtained and empiric antibiotics were given.
