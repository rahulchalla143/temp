The patient's post transplantation course was complicated by reactivation of hepatitis C and persistently elevated liver function tests and bilirubin for which the patient was recently hospitalized in the month of [**2148-4-1**].
The patient also had left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis for which he was placed on Coumadin and was being followed as an outpatient.
The patient was being tested routinely for his laboratory studies including INR and was discovered to have an elevated INR to 5.1 and increased alkaline phosphatase.
The patient was contact[**Name (NI) **] by the Transplant Office and was advised to be hospitalized for a normalization of the INR and for further work-up of elevated alkaline phosphatase.
The patient denied having any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, nor any fevers or chills.
The patient denied having any hematemesis nor bright red blood per rectum nor melena.
End stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C. 2.
Cirrhosis status post orthotopic liver transplant on [**2148-3-5**] complicated by reactivation of hepatitis C and biliary stricture status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and stent; status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and removal of biliary stent.
Prior to his transplant, the patient has had a history of portal hypertension, gastric varices.
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis for which he was placed on Coumadin.
ALLERGIES:   The patient denies any allergic reactions to medications.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, afebrile with temperature 98.8 F.; heart rate of 84; blood pressure 141/92; respiratory rate of 20; 99% on room air.
The patient was alert and oriented times three, in no apparent distress; jaundiced with mildly icteric sclerae.
Cardiovascular examination is regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs were appreciated.
Abdomen was soft, mildly tender at epigastric lesion.
No rebound, no guarding.
Extremities were without any edema, bilateral dorsalis pedis were two plus bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted for observation because of his elevated INR and obviously decreased hematocrit.
The patient did not have any melena or bright red blood per rectum and did not drop his blood pressure.
The patient underwent ultrasound guided biopsy of the liver to rule out acute cellular rejection and there was no evidence of acute cellular rejection.
Given the patient's history of low platelet count, the patient was observed over the next few days to make sure that his thrombocytopenia did not suffer too greatly and he no longer had further episodes of bleeding.
Given the fact that the patient had recently undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography two times in the month prior to this admission, a repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was not warranted.
End stage liver disease.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis status post orthotopic liver transplant.
History of deep vein thrombosis on Coumadin with elevated INR and liver function tests.
No evidence of acute cellular rejection.
No evidence of cholangitis.
