Admission Date:  [**2177-7-25**]       Discharge Date: [**2177-9-8**]   Service:  Medicine woman with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal up on the day of admission with severe chest pain radiating to her neck with shortness of breath.
She was given oxygen, and EKG was obtained, which showed PR prolongation and inferior ST segment changes.
Her chest pain continued.
Echocardiogram at that point 45% to 50%, [**12-21**] mitral regurgitation and a aortic sclerosis.
Aggrastat was started for unrelenting chest pain with good result, and she also received Morphine sulfate.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**], where she arrived with no chest pain, diaphoresis, or shortness of breath, but did have nausea and vomiting.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 45% to 50%.
Coronary artery disease.
Degenerative joint disease.
Chronic peripheral edema.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  History is significant for coronary artery disease.
GENERAL: In general, she was an obese white elderly woman lying on a stretcher, in no acute distress.
CARDIAC:  Examination reveals a [**12-24**] early systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, [**11-23**] at the lower left sternal border with normal carotid upstroke, no S3, no S3-4, normal S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen was obese, positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
She had 1+ pitting edema of the left lower extremity and 2+ of the right.
Neurological examination was significant for the patient being alert and oriented times three with no focal deficits.
The EKG showed sinus rhythm with a normal axis, T-wave inversions inferiorly with flattened V3 and V4.
In summary, she is a 78-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions as described above.
She ultimately had a four-vessel CABG followed by persistent lower extremity wound infections, acute renal failure, and persistent anxiety.
Cardiac catheterization performed on the day of admission reveals severe left main coronary obstruction and severe obstructions to the left anterior descending, first and second diagonal, first and second circumflex marginal and right posterior descending coronary arteries.
The patient developed recurrent angina while receiving nitroglycerin and an antiplatelet drug, IV Aggrastat, was started.
However, twenty-four hours later, the patient developed massive hematoma of the left thigh and inguinal region, which could not be controlled by direct compression.
Hypovolemia shock ensued, and the patient required infusion of three units of packed red blood cells.
In addition, there was evidence of myocardial ischemia.
It was also noted at that point that she had bilateral pleural effusions bilateral chest tubes were placed.
She had a difficult extubation, and she was weaned gradually to extubation on the 13th.
The remainder of her stay was only notable for two episodes of anxiety and shortness of breath, which resulted in the cycling of cardiac enzymes despite low suspicion to rule out any myocardial infarction or ischemia.
The shortness of breath was felt to be directly caused by her fluid status and anxiety.
Throughout the hospital course, after her surgery, she had no complaints of chest pain.
The EKGs remained without changes.
Renal failure.
The Renal Consultation Service was consulted and it was felt that her rising creatinine was probably due to pre-renal ischemia in the setting of poor cardiac output and poor intraaortic balloon pump function.
Throughout the remainder of her hospital course, her creatinine remained elevated ranging from approximately 2.0 after her Intensive Care Unit stay up to 2.4.
Fluid overload was a significant problem and felt to impeding wound healing, as well as contributing to the patient's ongoing shortness of breath.
The Renal Consultation service felt that this likely represented a new stable endpoint for her and that the point of maximum diuresis had been reached.
The patient's coronary artery bypass graft required the dissection of the saphenous vein from bilateral lower extremities with a wound incision from approximately upper thigh through lower calf.
Upon her transfer to the Medicine Service on [**2177-8-14**], it was noted that the left thigh wound had a large necrotic area with deep tracking of the wound at the superior venous graft site.
The cardiothoracic surgery team debrided the wound and cultures were sent.
She was started on empiric treatment with Vancomycin and Flagyl to cover the possible MRSA or skin pathogens or possible anaerobic organisms.
However, the wound continued to appear erythematous at the edges.
Her right lower extremity wound began to also appear erythematous with a dehiscence at the knee.
resulting in improved control of her wound infections.
Over the course of her subsequent stay, both of her lower extremity wounds continued to heal, with decreasing erythema surrounding the wound edges and gradual closure and scar formation.
The Plastic Service again was asked to comment, as was Cardiothoracic Surgery, and it was felt that with appropriate wound care, dressing and expression of the material, as well as the continuation of the Vancomycin and Levofloxacin, the wound would not require further debridement.
A wound Vac is in place in her left thigh.
Throughout the hospital course, the patient remained with subjective and objective signs of shortness of breath, notable for an oxygen saturation rate ranging from approximately 92 to 96% on an average of two liters of oxygen by nasal canal.
It was felt that her shortness of breath was due to primarily volume overload.
Chest x-rays obtained showed evidence of volume overload with infiltrates in both lung fields inferiorly.
There was no evidence for pneumonia on these films.
There was a question of bilateral pleural effusions, which probably remained after her cardiothoracic surgery and it was felt that these effusions would gradually resolve over time, and that there was no role for chest-tube drainage.
Also contributing to the patient's shortness of breath was anxiety, which will be covered in a separate item.
Given her persistently elevated BUN, in the setting of her improved creatinine, it was thought that this might represent a small intermittent GI bleed, which should be addressed as an outpatient.
There was no evidence at any time for significant blood loss.
Throughout the course of her stay, the patient had intermittent episodes anxiety requiring the administration of benzodiazepines usually 0.5 mg of Ativan for control of her symptoms.
for control of her symptoms and that the use of benzodiazepine should be minimized to prevent acute confusion.
She also complained of depressive symptoms, and she was started on Paxil 10 mg p.o.q.d.
The Nutrition Service was consulted and felt that her wound healing could be improved by the addition of protein in the form of supplement shakes.
Diabetes mellitus.
Due to her weight, it is difficult to move her to a chair.
The patient had a vaginal bleed in the setting of her anticoagulation on coumadin.
The source of the bleeding could not be localized on speculum exam.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary catheterization, status post coronary artery bypass graft times four vessels.
Postoperative wound infection in left and right lower extremities.
Acute renal failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
Atrial fibrillation 6.
Vaginal bleed 7.
Bilateral pleural effusions 8.
Anxiety and depression.
