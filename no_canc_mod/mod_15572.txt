Subglottic stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of polio, Crohn's disease, breast cancer, with a history of a tracheostomy placement in [**2101-11-20**] status post a prolonged hospitalization for pneumonia with failure to wean at [**Hospital6 41256**] from [**2101-12-5**] to [**2102-1-5**].
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] from [**2-13**] to [**2-13**] to evaluate a left main stem after a rigid bronchoscopy on [**2-3**] showed some mild irregularities with a reportedly negative workup.
Per the patient, the patient had been experiencing increased difficulty speaking and respiratory failure.
She had noticed an inability to speak for two to three minutes and "increased pressure."
She also has increasing pain and irritation around the tracheostomy site with pruritus and bleeding from the inferior aspect of the tracheostomy site and the development of blebs and/or granulation tissue.
The patient denies any other symptoms including fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, abdominal pain, melena, or hematuria.
She notes no emesis or change in mental status.
Admission from [**2-13**] to [**2-13**] for a rigid bronchoscopy for increased shortness of breath and cough at [**Hospital1 69**].
Crohn's disease, status post multiple abdominal surgeries.
Breast cancer in [**2095**] with a history of lumpectomy and radiation therapy; currently on Tamoxifen.
Admitted from [**12-5**] to [**1-5**] to [**Hospital3 48960**] Hospital with a history of pneumonia; during course intubated secondary to respiratory failure with failure to wean.
Medial moderate stenosis of bronchus.
FAMILY HISTORY:   She has an aunt with breast cancer and a parent with colon cancer.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Imaging on [**2102-4-17**] showed high-grade stenosis of the airway at the level of the insertion of the tracheal tube, likely extensive granulation tissue.
A computed tomography of the chest from [**2102-2-12**] showed trachea course altered secondary to marked kyphoscoliosis, narrow AP dimension of thorax at the thoracic inlet, and aberrent calcification of airway noted particularly left main stem and lower bronchi), dependent right pleural effusion.
Chest revealed ground-glass opacification, tracheal septal line, with possible congestive heart failure, slight narrowing of the left main stem bronchi in region with exuberant calcifications of the trachea and cartilage, right upper lobe volume loss and scarring.
A bronchoscopy on [**2-3**] showed irregularity in the middle main stem bronchi.
In general, in no acute distress.
The inferior portion of the tracheal site with slight erythema with clear yellow discharge.
Lungs with scoliosis with evidence of a surgical scar along the entire fascia with spinal stenosis.
Abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds.
Nontender and nondistended with evidence of vertical surgical scars.
SPEECH LOSS:  The patient was admitted for evaluation of speech loss.
A chest computed tomography showed high-grade stenosis of the airway above and at the lateral insertion of the tracheostomy tube; likely due to extensive granulation tissue (performed on [**2102-4-18**]).
The rigid bronchoscopy showed complex tracheal stenosis with slit like lumen located 2.5 cm below the vocal cords with an estimated length of a few millimeters.
Dilation with Jacksonian dilators was performed with minimal improvement, and the recommendation was for Thoracic Surgery to assess for surgical resection.
CROHN'S DISEASE:  The patient with a history of Crohn's disease.
