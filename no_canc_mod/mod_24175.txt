Note is also made of bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
There is no pulmonary edema.
Tagged RBC scan [**2156-6-25**]:  No active GI bleeding through 101 minutes.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with diffuse biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Superficial thrombosis of the left upper extremity basilic and cephalic veins.
[**7-4**] Head CT: WNL  Micro: [**6-30**] Blood culture x 2: enterobacter cloacae (sensitive to ciprofloxacin) [**6-26**], [**6-30**] blood cx x 2: negative [**6-26**] stool culture: C.diff negative   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old woman with PMH s/f UGI bleeding, multiple DVTs, CAD s/p CABG, Afib/flutter, COPD, DM, s/p aortobifem bypass, ischemic colitis s/p colectomy, who was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 35589**] for UGI bleed and RUE DVT, presented on [**6-25**] with recurrent upper GI bleed, and whose hospital course has included Afib/flutter, persistent tachycardia, RUE and RLE DVT and LUE and LLE superficial thrombophlebitis, worsening CHF, UTI, delirium and diarrhea.
#) GI Bleed: The patient had a recent h/o GI bleed with visualized duodenal ulcers.
She initially presented with hematemesis and melana.
An EGD showed no active bleeding and 2 healing duodenal ulcers.
A tagged red cell scan was negative for active bleeding.
She refused gastric lavage, but it is presumed this was an upper GI bleed.
Her anticoagulation was stopped and should be restarted in 4 weeks to treat her R UE DVT, R LE DVT, and likely PE.
# DELIRIUM: The patient was diagnosed with hypoactive delirium by psychiatry.
They recommended environmental modifications for delirium (dark, quiet room with minimal disruptions at night; awake during day), the avoidance of deliriogenic medications (ie, benzos, opiates, Benadryl, etc).
EKG and telemetry showed atrial flutter.
She has had no recent events of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response on telemetry.
Recent C. Diff colitis: For the patient's reported history of C.diff colitis during her last admission in early-mid [**May 2156**], the patient has completed a course of PO vancomycin and flagyl.
She did not have diarrhea after transfer to the floor and her C.diff toxin was negative.
Unfortunately, the patient cannot currently receive anticoagulation due to her recurrent GI bleeding.
In 4 weeks, the issue of restarting anti-coagulation should be re-visited (~[**7-27**]), likely with a lower INR goal.
CHF: Repeat Echo showed worsening heart failure with an EF of 30%, down from 55%.
This was likely a result of her PE/DVTs as well as volume overload.
#Poor nutrition: The patient denied nausea but stated that she had little interest in food.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Country Rehabilitation and Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 5028**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: CHF DVT PE GI bleed UTI Hypoactive delirium Atrial flutter w/ SVT  Secondary: DVT Ischemic Colitis s/p R colectomy ([**2155-8-28**]) CAD s/p CABG Afib SVT s/p ablation PPM COPD DM Carotid Endarterectomy PVD HTN Hyperlipidemia CKD baseline Cr 1.1   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were diagnosed with a Gastrointestinal Bleed that was, in part, due to your taking blood-thinning medication for the known blood clot in your right arm.
In addition, you were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm with a fast heart rate that was treated with medication.
Additional studies showed blood clots in your right leg and also in your lung.
You also had a scope to look into your stomach to try and see the cause of your vomiting blood.
No obvious cause was seen, but the bleeding was likely caused by your known ulcers and the blood thinning medication you were on.
It was also discovered that you had a urinary tract infection for which you received antibiotics.
Recommend checking Chem10 every 3 days and uptitrating Lasix if volume status worsens.
