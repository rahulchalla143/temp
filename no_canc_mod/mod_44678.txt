Name:  [**Known lastname 1763**], [**Known firstname 1764**]                  Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 1765**]  Admission Date:  [**2177-7-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2177-8-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2097-7-19**]     Sex:  F  Service:  #58  ADDENDUM:  The patient remained at [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2177-8-1**] secondary to right upper extremity pain and edema.
This was thought to be a hematoma secondary to blood draws.
A right upper extremity ultrasound was performed to rule out deep vein clot, superficial clot, or phlebitis.
For her right upper extremity hematoma, please apply warm compresses and elevate.
Of note, the patient had mild hematuria at discharge.
A pelvic examination was performed and this bleeding does not appear vaginal; however, it is unclear as pelvic examination was extremely difficult, due to patient's pelvic immobility due to arthritis.
Of note, the patient is status post a total abdominal hysterectomy, unclear if ovaries remain.
Thus uterine bleeding is not possible unless the patient has cervix remaining.
It was felt that as bleeding was mild and hematocrit stable, that this could be evaluated as an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1767**], for a possible cystoscopy and GYN examination.
As the patient with massive bilateral pulmonary emboli, it was felt that inpatient cystoscopy is not possible in light of need for probable anesthesia sedation in order to perform either cystoscopy or GYN examination appropriately.
