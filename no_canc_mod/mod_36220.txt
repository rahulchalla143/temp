He was transferred to rehab where he spent a good deal of time with multiple readmissions for various infections and chronic GI Bleeds.
In [**2153-8-15**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for PNA and found to have MRSa bacteremia.
Was readmitted later that month for a GI bleed.
On that admission he was diagnosed with concurrent Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI and treated with Meropenam.
Given his persistent MRSA bacteremia he was switched from Vancomycin to daptomycin.
There was no bleeding at the lumen of the site.
There were no exacerbating or relieving factors.
There was no known preceding trauma to the G-tube.

# Brief Hospital course: Patient was initially admitted for infectious w/u due to fevers, and was found to have MRSA bacteremia (chronic, likely [**2-16**] seeding of ICD), and Klebsiella/Pseudomonas UTI.
He subsequently developed bleeding at his G-tube site as well as increased dark output from ostomy bag.
GI performed 3 EGDs that large amounts of blood and an ulcer with visible vessel around peg insertion site; An initial attempt at clipping the ulcer caused bright red blood, confirming that this was likely the cause of the patient's recent bleed.
Because of his chronic MRSA bacteremia (thought likely [**2-16**] ICD seeding), TPN was not an option and family felt that a feeding tube would cause him too much discomfort.
