Admission Date:  [**2124-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-1-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-4-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**] Chief Complaint: R Lower extremity DVT, Pulmonary embolism.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a previously healthy 21 yo gentleman with no significant past medical history who presented to [**Hospital 4683**] hospital with a three week history of SOB, cough, intermittent chest pain and a three day history of right leg pain.
He initially attributed these sxs to URI because his SOB started with cough and fever therefore he treated with aleve and mucinex.
He has no history of recent trauma or prolongued periods of inactivity.
ECG at that time showed new right bundle branch block compared to prior.
CT showed massive bilateral pulmonary embolism involving both arteries.
He was then started on heparin and was noted to be subtheraputic prior to episode of pleuritic chest pain [**12-30**] in right lower back radiating to the shoulder.
Patient's pain was treated with 6mg morphine iv and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] ICU for [**Hospital 35455**] medical care.
No known family history of clotting disorders.
Physical Exam: Vitals: Tm 98 BP 131/58 HR 90 RR 20 02 sat 92-98% RA General: NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear Neck: no LAD, supple Heart: RRR, 1/6 systolic ejection murmur Lungs: CTAB no wheezes, crackles, rhochi Abd: +BS, NTND, soft Ext: 1+ pitting edema on the R side to mid-calf.
Possible small pulmonary infarctions of R lung.
Premature appearance of microbubbles are seen in the left atrium with cough (but not with rest or post-Valsalva release).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is atleast mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with severe free wall hypokinesis.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Right lower extremity occlusive thrombus extending from the mid superficial femoral vein to the popliteal vein.
No evidence of DVT involving the left lower extremity.
His condition continued to improve with no worsening of symptoms and improving oxygen saturations at rest and with exertion.
He was observed for 3 days without worsening of symptoms or complications.
His EKG showed evidence of right heart strain and a S1Q3T3 pattern on EKG.
Anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated with INR monitoring as described below:  [**1-4**]: 7.5 mg [**1-3**]: 7.5 mg [**1-2**]: 10 mg [**1-1**]: 10 mg  [**2125-1-4**] INR(PT)-2.8* [**2125-1-3**] INR(PT)-2.0* [**2125-1-2**] INR(PT)-1.4* [**2125-1-1**] INR(PT)-1.5* [**2124-12-31**] INR(PT)-1.7* [**2124-12-31**] INR(PT)-1.4*  On the day of discharge he was ambulating without difficulty and maintaing sats of 92-98% on room air while ambulating.
His echo findings did reveal a moderately hypokinetic right ventricle.
Compression stockings Graduated compression stockings, > 30mm Hg   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
Please return to the emergency room if you experience additional SOB, chest pain or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
