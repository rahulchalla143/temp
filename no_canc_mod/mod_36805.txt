Patient also reports two weeks of bilateral lower venous thrombosis which was negative.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No chest pain, no jaw or neck pain.
No viral syndrome.
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Patient was initially treated with nebulizers for exacerbation with small improvement.
He was also treated with intravenous Oxacillin for question of cellulitis and Lasix 40 mg intravenous for lower extremity edema.
Chest x-ray and CT angiogram showed no pulmonary embolus.
Cardiac echocardiogram was obtained and showed ejection fraction of less than 20 percent with severe global LVHK, RVHK and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Asthma childhood, no intubation.
2) Hypertension times three.
5) GERD/peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No other drugs.
Father had abdominal aortic aneurysm.
No history of premature coronary artery disease.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: mucous membranes moist, elevated jugular venous pulses, exophthalmus.
Decreased breath sounds at the left base.
Cardiac: soft systolic murmur at the apex and a positive S3.
Chest x-ray showed prominent central pulmonary artery, possible emphysema, possible early pneumonia.
CT of the chest showed no pulmonary embolus, left apical opacity, question of fibrosis, 5 mm nodular density in the left lower lobe, borderline mediastinal adenopathy.
Echocardiogram:  ejection fraction of less than 20 percent, mild left atrial dilatation, mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy, moderated dilated left ventricle, severe global LVHK, moderate global right ventricle, free wall HK, 3+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ moderate tricuspid regurgitation, moderate [**Last Name (un) 6879**], no effusion.
Electrocardiogram: ST at 115, LAD, intraventricular conduction delay, no ST wave abnormalities, T wave flattening laterally in L and V6.
Patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed no coronary artery disease.
2) Ventricular function..
The patient had early decreased ejection fraction on admission found to be in severe congestive heart failure.
Throughout the hospital stay a work up was done which included checking thyroid function tests which were normal, checking VMA and metanephrine for pheochromocytoma which were normal.
At time of discharge it was unclear what had caused the patient's severe cardiomyopathy thought to be secondary to possible autoimmune disease with longstanding history of child asthma and history of atopy.
Patient was in the Cardiac Care Unit for dobutamine secondary to decreased pulmonary artery venous saturation of less than 40.
This was continued for several days as patient continued with diuresis and hemodynamic monitoring through right internal jugular Swan.
His dry weight ended up being around 182 pounds and patient was informed to call or page one of the heart failure nurses if his weight increased greater than two pounds over this dry weight.
Patient had episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia while on the milrinone.
After his milrinone was stopped the patient's episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia also stopped.
The patient had a goal hematocrit throughout his of greater than 30.
Patient's hematocrit rose to the 37 - 38 range while an inpatient after diuresis and patient did not require transfusion for this hematocrit.
The etiology of his anemia remained unclear at discharge.
The patient was originally started on Oxacillin at admission for question of cellulitis.
The cellulitic changes likely represented chronic right sided heart failure.
Patient never had any signs of clinical infection and his antibiotics were stopped after a seven day course.
Most of patient's shortness of breath was thought to be cardiac in origin although there did not seem to be a bronchospastic component with occasional wheezes on examination.
This was thought to be all secondary to prerenal azotemia.
Patient has history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease and on Prevacid and was switched to Protonix which he will continue as an outpatient.
Patient had small 5 mm nodules per chest CT in his left lower lung.
Patient was seen by psychiatry for increasing frustration over his fluid restriction.
They recommended using Ativan .5 mg for anxiety and Trazodone for sleep.
Fortunately this was not necessary as the patient's issues around his fluid restriction seemed to resolve as the seriousness of his disease and his ability to come to grips with his diagnosis was achieved.
Patient had episodes in the last week of his admission of a watery type diarrhea.
It was thought that his diarrhea was secondary to his diet which improved once he was on the floor.
To be seen by [**Hospital6 1587**] of [**Location (un) 86**] Heart Failure Service.
To follow up in two weeks in congestive heart failure clinic and to contact one of the nurse practitioners of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the heart failure clinic if patient's weight increases from dry weight of 182 pounds.
Congestive heart failure.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Supraventricular tachycardia and nonsustained         ventricular tachycardia.
