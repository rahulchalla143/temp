Admission Date:  [**2163-10-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2163-10-17**]   Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Substernal chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85 year-old female with known coronary artery disease status post an inferior myocardial infarction in [**2161**], hypertension, increased cholesterol, tobacco, who presented with three days of substernal chest pain.
She was chest pain free throughout her primary care physician's visit.
She was sent to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room, where she had increasing chest pressure 7 out of 10 substernally with associated diaphoresis, sinus bradycardia at 45 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70s and her electrocardiogram was notable for 2 to [**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in V1 through V6 and additionally reciprocal T wave inversions in 2, 3, and AVF.
There she was found to have left main coronary artery disease that was short, a left anterior descending artery that had a proximal tubular lesion to 80% prior to diagonal, mild to moderate diffuse disease, mid left anterior descending coronary artery, TIMI two flow slowly distally.
The left circumflex had diffuse disease to 40% involving CX and obtuse marginal, collateral to right coronary artery.
The right coronary artery was mildly calcified, tubular 80 to 90% proximal to the mid stenoses, competitive flow seen in RPL, diffuse disease in the mid right coronary artery.
There was no residual stenosis, TIMI two fast flow was observed.
The cardiac catheterization was also notable for a cardiac output of 2.7, cardiac index of 1.8, wedge pressure of 29, elevated filling pressures with a PA diastolic pressure of 26.
In general, the patient was talkative and in no acute distress.
Her oropharynx was clear without lesions.
She had no JVD.
No carotid bruits.
She had a regular rate and rhythm with mild 2 out of 6 early systolic ejection murmur at the bilateral sternal borders as well as a positive S3.
She had normoactive bowel sounds and no organomegaly.
Her right groin had a small hematoma without a bruit.
The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with an myocardial infarction in [**2163**].
She remained chest pain free subsequent to her initial presentation in the Emergency Department.
She had no further dynamic electrocardiogram changes throughout her stay.
Given the minimal CK leak presumably the patient had an interrupted acute myocardial infarction that was amenable to angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery.
Pump; the patient was noted to have high filling pressures intracath.
She had moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, inferior severe hypokinesis.
Also the ascending aorta was noted to be mildly thickened.
Rhythm; the patient had some episodes of sinus bradycardia during sleep as low as 40 beats per minute.
These sinus bradycardic episodes were asymptomatic and resolved with awakening and activity.
Pulmonary:  The patient had no supplemental oxygen requirements during her hospitalization and did well from a pulmonary standpoint.
ALLERGIES ON DISCHARGE:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
