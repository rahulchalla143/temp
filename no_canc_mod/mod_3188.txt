Admission Date:  [**2166-3-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-3-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-8-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 17862**] is a 77 yr old woman with history of hyperlipidemia, COPD and asthma who presented to the [**Location (un) **] ED with crushing chest pain starting [**2165-3-13**] at 1130pm and ending at 6am today after taking sudafed.
She was found to have inferior Q waves on EKG with trop of 14 and CK 948.
She had an angioseal in her right groin.
During the procedure, she had transient hypotension on NTG that resolved with 0.5 mg atropine.
On the floor, she had two further episods of hypotension with blood pressure going to 54/37.
She had nausea and emesis.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Dyslipidemia 2.
Pleasant, conversant, telling jokes, but in intermitting pain and nausea.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No murmurs LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
A Choice PT ES wire crossed the stenosis with some difficulty.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI III flow.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
Moderate-sized acute right-sided retroperitoneal hemorrhage which is seen tracking along the right paracolic gutter and dependently layering in the presacral space.
Superimposed patchy opacification in right lower lobe over chronic interstital process could relate to infection or aspiration.
Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
Diminutive size of the spleen and relative flattening of the IVC can be seen in setting of known hypotension.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-3-14**], no major change.
CXR [**3-15**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: There is a severe distortion of pulmonary architecture with marked scarring upper lobe retraction large cystic cicatrices throughout the lungs and right perihilar opacification.
Interpretation of the significance of these findings would depend upon comparison to prior chest imaging, but all the abnormalities could be stable over many years due to scarring from sarcoidosis or a combination of emphysema and pneumoconiosis.
The asymmetric appearance of the hila, with opacity marginating the lateral aspect of the right is the radiographic finding of most concern, and could be pneumonia or adenopathy, as well as conglomerate scarring.
A scan of the abdomen showing the lower chest, on [**3-14**] showed no right pleural effusion so the right pleural abnormality is thickening not fluid, but also showed an 8-mm partially ground-glass nodule in the right lower lobe (2:3) and a moderate hiatus hernia.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 F with COPD/Asthma, HL presented with recurrent vasovagal episodes following POBA to diag for NSTEMI.
# HYPOTENSION:  Patient had an RP bleed on CT likely related to intervention.
Other potential sources for hypotension include septic and cardiogenic shock.
However, she was afebrile and echo did not suggest cardiac source.
# CORONARIES:  Patient presented with NSTEMI, attived with inferior qs, 8 hours after onset of chest pain.
# PUMP:  Patient appeared hypovolemic on admission.
Her volume status normalized the next day after 2u pRBC and IVF, and she had no signs of heart failure.
# POSSIBLE UPPER GIB: She had gastrocult positive brown emesis on floor.
Was thought to be likely stress ulcer or MW tear.
Disp:*90 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Nursing Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (heart attack)  Secondary: pulmonary sarcoidosis   Discharge Condition: Good, hemodynamically stable.
However, after this procedure you had a complication where you had bleeding into your back.
