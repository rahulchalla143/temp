Admission Date:  [**2186-11-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-1-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-6-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Benzocaine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9824**] Chief Complaint: Left foot swelling x 2 weeks  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Incision and dranage and debridement of ankle  Thoracotomy, Left, with Debridement and Internal fixation and grafting L1-L2, partial vertebrectomy  Posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation T8-L2   History of Present Illness: 59 yo NIDDM with left ORIF (25 years ago), chronic BLE edema, chronic back pain s/p hardware placement and neuropathy who presented with left medial malleolus pain x 2 weeks.
He states that he has chronic LE edema, but awoke this AM with increased pain and swelling in his left leg and was unable to bear weight on the leg.
Has had fevers at home to 101.
Subsequent TTE and TEE were negative for endocarditis.
- [**12-15**], the pt had an episode of desaturation and methemoglobinemia during TEE secondary to the use of benzocaine.
L spine films obtained on [**12-21**] were highly suggestive of osteomyelitis/diskitis at L1-2 with accompanying indistinct appearance of the vertebral bodies from L2 to S1.
- [**1-9**], the pt was taken to the OR for hardware removal from the back secondary to these findings.
- [**1-10**], he became tachypnic when his sedation was decreased.
Pt was seen by the pain clinic at that time and he was changed to a dilaudid drip for pain control.
- Uneventful post op course until [**1-23**] PM when he was found transiently unresponsive, hypotensive and hypoxic - all of which spontaneously resolved within minutes.
Hypertension 3.
Mild anemia 5.
Lower back pain s/p multiple back surgery (L4-S1 fusion '[**80**], [**4-/2183**] he had a L3 laminectomy and medial fasciectomy with L3 to L4 bilateral fusion with pedicle screws and bone grafting.
Dyslipidemia 7.
Hypertension 8.
S/P retinal detachment repair in [**2176**]   Social History: Lives alone, denies etoh, rare pipe, no illicit drug use   Family History: Father w/ MI at age 72  Physical Exam: T 98.6  (Tm 103.6 in ED)  BP 130/84  HR 96  96% RA  General: NAD Pulm: cta B CV: s1 s2 reg Abd: NABS, soft, NT Ext: no edema 2+ DP on right and 1+ on left.
Old fractures of the distal tibia and fibula.
Marked abnormality of the tibiotalar joint which requires additional clinical information for full assessment.
Differential diagnosis includes posttraumatic, Charcot neuropathy, and changes related to infection and inflammation.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
4.The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
TEE IMPRESSION: Mild aortic valve sclerosis.
Trace aortic regurgitatio.
No echo evidence of endocarditis.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] IMPRESSION: Abnormal signal at the L1-L2 level and within the L1 vertebral body with abnormal enhancement in the adjacent psoas muscles, consistent with a [**Name13 (STitle) 97910**]/osteomyelitis with adjacent psoas infection.
Limited evaluation of the spinal canal suggests epidural infection at L1-2.
If there is a decline in neurologic function, a repeat study is recommended.
Erosion of the anteroinferior aspect of the body of L1 likely relates to infection and is unchanged in appearance.
Paraspinal collection in the posterior paraspinal soft-tissues, unchanged.
No hip effusion.
2) Erosive and destructive changes involving the distal tibia and fibula, talus, and calcaneus; osteomyelitis is not.
In particular, there are foci of gas and fluid in the lateral aspect of the foot (distant from the VAC dressing), raising the concern for presence of a gas-producing infection or abscess formation.
3) Scattered tiny pockets of fluid with no drainable fluid collection.
[**1-23**] CT LE IMPRESSION: 1) Erosive and destructive changes involving the ankle, which may be consistent with the stated history of osteomyelitis.
No discrete fluid collections are identified.
The soft tissue defect at the medial malleolus is grossly unchanged when compared to the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: Ankle and Lumbar Spine Osteomyelitis The patient initially presented with what was thought to be a left ankle cellulitis and was started on unasyn with vancomycin given risk for MRSA.
He had hardware in place from a prior injury of his left ankle.
He continued to have fevers and given staph bacteremia was at risk of osteomyelitis or hardware seeding.
Orthopaedic service consulted and proceeded with a left ankle I&D with removal of hardware on [**12-4**]; wound cultures grew out MSSA.
The wound was kept open with temporary VAC dressing and plastics followed the patient during hospitalization; he will follow up after discharge for VAC removal and flap coverage.
The patient was also thought to have osteomyelitis of L1 based on MRI and underwent debridement and spinal fusion of T12 to L2 on [**1-9**]; vertebral tissue sent from the OR was consistent with infection.
He was treated with oxacillin and rifampin added per ID recommendations for osteomyelitis in his ankle as well as his spine.
CV Pt with h/o hypertension and had been on univasc at last visit.
He had an episode of hypotension on [**2187-1-23**] that spontaneously resolved after minutes.
But given flattening of T waves laterally on EKGwith this, he was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with three sets of cardiac enzymes.
Other ID issues The patient had diarrhea off and on during his hospitalization; c difficile toxins were negative consistently.
Heme Pt with anemia of unclear cause.
Because of his history of transfusion reactions, he was not transfused but rather was started on tid iron supplementation.
Derm Pt with right arm and bilateral thigh (left > right) ulcers and excoriations.
Dermatology consulted who were of the impression that the lesions were consistent with neurotic excoriations and purigo nodules from chronic excoriation.
Psychiatry The patient had a h/o depression treated with home regimen of Paxil 30mg po qd.
After that surgery, once extubated his diet was advanced without difficulty.
Proph The patient was maintained on a PPI; DVT prophylaxis; bowel regimen; and the pain service followed him to ensure appropriate pain control.
Access The patient had a CVL and arterial line while in the ICU; he then had a PICC inserted for long term IV antibiotics and was discharge to rehab with this in place.
Imodium 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO four times a day as needed for diarrhea.
