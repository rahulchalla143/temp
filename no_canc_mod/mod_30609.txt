Admission Date:  [**2143-3-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-3-25**]   Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Tetracycline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: Left sided weakness, gait instability  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2143-3-20**]: Right sided craniotomy for evacuation of subdural hemorrhage   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old female presented to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-19**] with left sided weakeness and gait instability.
At that time she was seen in the local ER and did not have any imaging.
She has has increasing difficulty walking and she has noticed that her left arm is "clumsy."
Past Medical History: pacemaker placement 14 years ago tonsillectomy age 21 appendectomy age 14 carotid endarterectomy left side 10 years ago Meniere's Disease - had a procedure in the right ear Right ear complete hearing loss Left ear partial hearing loss Bilateral cataracts removed several years ago   Social History: Has son who accompanied her on admission, and a fiancee.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
VIII: Hearing loss in left ear.
Total hearing loss right ear.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Left pronator drift.
The density within the fluid collection increases dependently suggesting a hematocrit effect.
Apparently increased hypodensity (series 2, image 13) is probably due to technical factors and intreval development of septations.
There is a prominent extra-axial space adjacent to the right cerebellar hemisphere.
No definite new intracranial hemorrhage.
Subdural hematoma layering over the right frontoparietal curvature producing 7 mm of leftward shift.
More conspicuous hyperdensity within this collection is likely technical in etiology and hematoma septations.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance.
The aorta is slightly tortuous.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
An old left posterolateral third rib fracture is present.
Degenerative changes are noted within the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

Provisional Findings Impression: IPf [**Doctor First Name **] [**2143-3-21**] 4:33 PM [**Year (4 digits) **]: No significant interval change.
Final Report HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with new lethargy, status post craniotomy for acute on chronic subdural hematoma.
Evaluate for acute changes.
The right subdural hemorrhage in the right frontal convexity has a similar appearance compared to prior scan, with a small dense collection measuring up to 8 mm from the inner table.
There is no evidence of herniation.
There is no evidence of parenchymal hemorrhage or acute infarct.
IMPRESSION: Stable size of right-convexity subdural hematoma and mass effect with a small high-density component remaining in the extra-axial space post- subdural evacuation.
Differential includes retained high-density material within a septation, epidural hematoma, or residual subdural hematoma.
Provisional Findings Impression: GWp MON [**2143-3-25**] 11:52 AM No significant interval change.
No significant interval change.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5206**] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] entered: MON [**2143-3-25**] 11:52 AM    Imaging Lab    Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]F s/p mechanical fall earlier this year, who presented to PCP after experiencing left sided weakness and increased clumsiness.
Her PCP sent her to an OSH for imaging, where a sizable right subdural hematoma was noted.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive neurosurgical care.
Her pre-operative labs revealed a urinary tract infection, and she was started on a course of Cipro.
Additionally, due to her chronic ASA use, she was administered platelets prior to surical intervention.
Alprazolam 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for sleep / anxiety .
