Admission Date:  [**2130-1-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-1-22**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: subarachnoid hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]yo woman with history of Alzheimer's dementia fell from standing position and hit head on a bed post at her ALF the night prior to admission.
Per report patient initally complained of head and right hip pain after the fall.
She was initially evaluated at [**Location (un) 620**] and found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage on head CT. VS at [**Location (un) 620**] were T 98.4/HR88/RR15/BP134/73/O296%RA with GCS of 13.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was seen by Neurosurgery who did not feel there was any surgical intervention.
She was described to variably answer simple yes and no questions.
She was treated with Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and she was given Morphine IV prn for pain; nursing reports that she had pain behavior consisting of moaning and grimacing that responded well to prn Morphine.
Additionally, she developed an inferior ST elevation MI with markedly positive cardiac biomarkers and associated bradycardia/hypotension.
The caretaker was informed of all this, and decision was made to only provide minimal supportive care.
Specifically, there would be no aggresive therapy (ASA, heparin, etc) for her STEMI given her overall poor prognosis and also her intracranial hemorrhage.
Past Medical History: Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline MS alert to person only Hypothyroidism Right hip replacement   Social History: Lives at [**Hospital3 **]  Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: Vitals (on transfer to floor): T 96.3, BP 90/62, HR 43, RR 16, 96% RA General: Sleepy but arousable, NAD; opens eyes to command, pupils small, minimally reactive HEENT: hematoma over right temple CV: RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur Lungs: Clear bilaterally (anteriorally) Abdomen: Soft, nondistended, nontender, +BS Extremities: warmth/erythema/edema in RUE at previous IV site Neuro: arousable to voice and painful stimuli; moves all 4 extremities to painful stimuli, not giving verbal answers to questions.
EKG (admission)- NSR @ 78 bpm, 1mm ST depressions in 1 and avL.
Repeat EKG demonstrates several mm ST elevation in inferior leads w/ reciprocal changes.
[**2130-1-12**] cxr: Mild cardiac enlargement consistent with systemic hypertension but no evidence of CHF or acute infiltrates .
[**2130-1-12**] Head CT - right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage; right temporal bone fracture .
Stable appearance of subarachnoid blood, subdural blood, and intraventricular blood as described.
No new blood noted.
Revisualization of multiple opacified right mastoid air cells and nondisplaced right longitudinal temporal bone fracture.
Increased air-fluid level as described.
[**2130-1-12**] Right Knee - No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
[**2130-1-12**] Right Femur - No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
[**2129-1-12**] Right Hip - No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2130-1-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo with Alzheimer's dementia initially treated in the MICU for subarachnoid hemorrage and inferior ST elevation MI, called out to the floor, was kept comfortable with basic measures, eventuall died on [**2130-1-22**] at 6.20 AM.
SAH/s/p fall: Pt has suffered a significant intracranial hemorrhage, and has severe impairments on account of this.
Overall, her prognosis was very poor soon after the event, and Neurosurgery has indicated that there is no role for surgical intervention.
It was decided not to do further imaging, to continue Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and prn Morhpine for pain control.
STEMI: Pt had ST elevation in inferior distribution and marked cardiac enzyme elevation.
No further intervention given her intracranial hemorrhage and per discussion with guardian.
