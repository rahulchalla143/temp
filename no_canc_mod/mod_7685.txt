Admission Date:  [**2104-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-8-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-6-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 5188**] Chief Complaint: Pancreatitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 7046**] is a 61 year old female with a PMH significant for chronic RUQ abdominal pain and pancreas divisum admitted to the Surgical service and now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for tachycardia and an increased oxygen requirement.
The patient reports that she developed acute onset [**11-15**] epigastric pain on the evening of [**8-17**] described as constant dullness or aching with intermitent sharp/stabbing pain made worse with movement with associated SOB from abdominal pain with inspiration.
Onset of pain was preceded by nausea and NBNB emesis.
The patient was brought to the OSH ED, where she was found to have a lipase of 6000 and a RUQ U/S that was negative for cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.
She also had a CTAP that was suggestive of necrotizing pancreatitis, and she was transeferrred to the [**Hospital1 18**] surgical service for further management this afternoon.
Of note, the patient reports a 30+ year history of RUQ abdominal pain of unclear etiology.
Pain is described as intermitent achiness somewhat similar to her current symptoms but in a different location and much lower in intensity.
Approximately 10 years ago, she presented to an OSH ED for these symptoms and was diagnosed with pancreas divisum on ERCP.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was placed on a dilaudid PCA with improvement in her pain control.
She was noted on the floor, however, to be in sinus tachycardia up to 140 with an SaO2 that decreased to low 90s on RA from mid to high 90s on initial presentation with a venous lactate of 3.7.
Pain is well controlled on PCA.
No rebound or guarding.
There is evidence of gallbladder sludge, but no evidence of chololithiasis.
Small right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 7046**] is a 61 year old female with pancreas divisum and acute pancreatitis transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for tachycardia and increasing O2 requirement.
# Acute pancreatitis: Pain much improved with dilaudid PCA.
Given elevated venous lactate and UOP ~30 cc/hr, patient was intravascular volume deplete upon admission to ICU.
Only risk factor for acute pancreatitis at this time is pancreas divisum.
Currently low suspicion for necrotizing pancreatitis although outside hospital CT could not exclude, so will repeat RUQ ultrasound this AM per surgery recs, and hold prophylactic abx for now.
# Sinus tachycardia: Likely multifactorial in etiology including pain and intravascular volume depletion in setting of third spacing from pancreatitis.
Given temporal association with acute pancreatitis, less likely to be hyperthyroid or PE.
No indication for AV nodal blockade at this time as tachycardia is likely compensatory and she has no cardiac history, and will follow on telemetry.
# Respiratory: Patient with mildly increased supplemental oxygen requirement now on 3L nc.
Likely from large volume IVF in setting of pancreatitis and third spacing, although CXR without significant pulmonary edema at this time.
Patient also with small bilateral pleural effusions and rapid shallow breathing from pain may also be leading to some atalectesis.
Low suspicion for developing ARDS from pancreatitis at this time.
If O2 requirement and tachycardia does not improve can also consider PE, although it less likely clinically at this time.
There is also a small likelihood that this could be an inflammatory pancreatic cancer, in which case the patient could be hypercoaguable.
Again, at this time we will watch clinically, wean O2 as tolerated, and encourage incentive spirometry.
