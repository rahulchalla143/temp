[**Known lastname 47549**] was born to a 36-year-old gravida 1, para 0 now 1 woman whose past medical history was noncontributory and pregnancy was uncomplicated preterm contractions.
The rupture of membranes occurred 14 hours prior to delivery and the mother received one dose of betamethasone prior to chorioamnionitis as evidenced by leukocytosis.
She required bagged mask ventilation and intubation.
Anterior fontanel is soft and flat, nondysmorphic features, intact palate, moderate subcostal and intercostal retraction with spontaneous breaths.
Fair breath sounds with scattered-coarse crackles.
Femoral pulses normal, no murmur present.
Soft and nondistended abdomen.
No organomegaly.
She was treated with caffeine citrate for apnea of prematurity from day of life 22 to day of life 58.
Her last episode of desaturation occurred on [**2157-2-3**], and it was associated with a feeding.
Diuril was begun on day of life 35 for chronic lung disease, and she continues on that medication at the time of discharge at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two doses with potassium chloride supplementation.
An echocardiogram on day of life #7 revealed a patent ductus arteriosus, and she was again treated with a second course of indomethacin.
Her murmur persisted and a followup echocardiogram on day of life #12 showed no patent ductus, but left peripheral pulmonary stenosis.
Continued respiratory symptoms prompted another echocardiogram on [**11-30**] again showed a small to moderate PDA and a patent foramen ovale.
A followup echocardiogram on [**12-3**] showed a small 1-1.5 mm patent ductus.
Followup echocardiogram on [**2156-12-10**] showed again a small patent ductus with left-to-right flow.
Her last echocardiogram on [**2-3**] again showed a small persistent patent ductus arteriosus.
They felt that there was little flow through this PDA and it was therefore unlikely to be a significant factor in her continued pulmonary symptoms and did not require treatment.
She currently has a grade 1-2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Gastrointestinal status:  She was treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity from day of life one until day of life 19.
Infectious disease status:  [**Known lastname 47549**] was started on ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission to the NICU for sepsis risk factors.
On day of life #8, she had a clinical decompensation and was started on Vancomycin and gentamicin.
She remained off antibiotics until day of life 22, when she again had a clinical decompensation and was started on Vancomycin and gentamicin.
Neurology:  On day of life #7, her first head ultrasound showed a grade I germinal matrix hemorrhage and bilateral periventricular cysts.
Followup head ultrasound revealed a resolution of the germinal matrix hemorrhage.
On [**2157-12-7**], her head ultrasound showed that the periventricular cysts were will present and there was a slight prominence of the left lateral ventricle.
No other parenchymal abnormalities and extra axial fluid normal.
Ophthalmology:  Eyes were examined most recently on [**2157-2-15**] revealing regressing retinopathy of prematurity as compared with her previous examination which was Stage I retinopathy O.U.
In [**Location (un) 86**], Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  1) Born at less than 32 weeks, 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for daycare during RSV season, with a smoker in the household, or with preschool siblings, or 3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Oxygen saturations will be set with pulse oximeter limits being a low saturation of 90 and a high saturation of 99.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome.
Status post apnea of prematurity.
Status post exaggerated hyperbilirubinemia.
Anemia of prematurity.
Retinopathy of prematurity.
