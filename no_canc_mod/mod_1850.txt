He reports having (+) dry cough x several days, (+) waxing-[**Doctor Last Name 688**] confusion for 2 days prior to admit.
Received Lopressor 5 mg IV X 1, Tylenol, levoquin 500 mg IV X 1, Flagyl 500 mg IV X 1, Vanco 1 g IV X 1, and 1L NS * ICU Course: On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was hemodynamically stable without complaint.
He was continued on Vancomycin briefly for a history of mechanical valve.
Vancomycin was discontinued and remained afebrile with levofloxacin only.
Past Medical History: 1) AF 2) s/p MVR (mechanical) 3) CMP (EF 15%) 4) HTN 5) mult CVA (last [**2119**]) 6) Hypercholesterolemia 7) Type II DM 8) Multiple prior UTI   Social History: At baseline ambulates with cane Lives with wife no [**Name2 (NI) 11324**] no etoh   Physical Exam: T 104.8 - 100.5 HR 113 BP 140/60 RR 22 O2Sat 94% GEN: Awake, slightly dysarthric and confused but in NAD HEENT: NC/AT, anicteric sclera, PERRL, +visual grasp but with intact EOM, +right side visual field deficit.
No rubs, or gallops.
Pertinent Results: ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND STUDY: The liver is of increased echogenicity consistent with fatty infiltration.
No focal liver abnormalities identified.
There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
There is no ascites.
No gallstones, pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall thickening is identified.
No abscesses or fluid collections are identified.
No renal masses, stones, or hydronephrosis.
The right kidney measures 10.6 cm in length with mild to moderate cortical atrophy, without hydronephrosis or renal calculi.
Within the lower pole of the right kidney, there is a 0.9 cm anechoic lesion with increased through transmission consistent with a simple cyst.
IMPRESSION:  1) No abscess, ascites, or perinephric fluid collections.
2) No cholelithiasis or son[**Name (NI) 493**] signs of acute cholecystitis.
3) No intrahepatic ductal dilatation or common bile duct dilatation.
4) Fatty infiltration of the liver.
Other forms of liver disease including cirrhosis cannot be fully excluded based on this study.
Brief Hospital Course: 1)ID: Patient presents with sudden onset of fever, chills, and hypotension with 3/4 bottles positive gram negative bacteremia.
The culture eventually grew E. Coli that was pansenstive and the serial culture remained negative.
ID was consulted and felt that it is very unlikely for this E.Coli to come from the mechanical valve as it was transient and did not have serial positive blood culture.
The source of the E. Coli remains unclear as he had a clean UA, nontender prostate, and negative RUQ and renal ultrasound looking for stones as the possible source.
3) CV: He has a severe systolic dysfunction of EF 15% likely fromhis valvular disease.
He had a lateral ST depression on EKG from demand ischemia in a setting of a-fib with RVR.
4) Confusion: He was initially confused which was likely toxic-metabolic in a setting of fever/infection superimposed on underlying vascular dementia.
Head CT showed multiple old infarcts but no new lesion.
E.Coli sepsis Secondary: 2.
CAD 3.
DMII 4. s/p CVA 5. mechanical MVR   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, negative blood cultures  Discharge Instructions: If you experience fevers (> 101.5), chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain; please call your primary MD or go to ER.
