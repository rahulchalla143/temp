The patient was in his usual state of health until the day prior to admission, when he woke up with L arm pain in addition to weakness and achiness in his legs bilaterally.
His left arm pain resolves with 2 tablets of nitroglycerin.
He also reports feeling "rotten" with general fatigue.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that the patient's appearance and symptoms were significantly off of baseline and found the patient to be hypotensive and sent him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Of note, the patient has had several other symptoms off of his baseline recently.
In addition, he reports in the past 3-4 weeks developing mild chest pain with exertion such as lifting objects and climbing stairs which resolves with rest.
He also develops leg achiness after prolonged walks.
Of note, patient also had a brief 20 minute of L-sided weakness on awakening about 3-4 weeks ago for which he was going to get a head MRI later this week.
No fever, chills, night sweats, n/v/d, cough or URI symptoms, abdominal pain, changes in bowel/bladder habits.
Patient also denies any history of thyroid disease, headaches, rashes or other skin changes, any new or changed medications or any deviation from his normal medication regimen/adherence in the past weeks/months.
Because of concern for stroke, the patient had a CT Head which was negative for acute intracrnial process.
Shortly after arrival to the ED, the patient became hypotensive to the 70-80's with some latered mental status.
The patient also receieved 4.5g IV Zosyn while in the ED and a CT Thoarx which showed no acute processes.

SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..     Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2198-3-20**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
= = = = = = = = = = = =================IMAGING======================================== CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2198-3-19**] 4:25 PM FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no edema or mass effect.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process; please note MR is more sensitive for the detection of acute infarct.
There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Exam is somewhat suboptimal due to patient body habitus.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The aorta is of a normal caliber along its course with mild calcified atherosclerotic disease at the aortic arch branch origins.
Calcified atherosclerotic disease is also noted in the coronary arteries.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
Mild bibasilar atelectasis is seen.
There is a small hiatal hernia.
ABDOMEN: Within the limits of a non-contrast study, the liver demonstrates no focal abnormality.
The gallbladder is distended with a small amount of dense material that may represent sludge or small stones; there is no pericholecystic stranding or fluid.
The pancreas and adrenal glands show no masses.
The kidneys demonstrate no hydronephrosis or perinephric fat stranding.
A small fat density in the right lower pole is most consistent with an AML.
Calcified atherosclerotic disease is seen in a tortuous splenic artery.
Calcified atherosclerotic disease is also seen throughout the abdominal aorta and into the iliac branches.
The small and large intestine show no evidence of obstruction.
There is no free air or free fluid.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
The bladder and rectum appear grossly unremarkable.
BONES: There are no aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Lucency is seen about the right femoral component, concerning for loosening.
Additionally, a lucent line may represent a periprosthetic fracture of indeterminate age.
Right femoral periprosthetic lucency, concerning for loosening or even periprosthetic fracture - dedicated radiographs/orthopedic evaluation recommended for better assessment.
Right thyroid nodule - nonemergent ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.
No CT findings to explain hypotension.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Increasing prominence of the pulmonary vessels suggests elevated pulmonary venous pressure with left basilar atelectatic change.
Of incidental note is an impression on the lower cervical trachea on the right, raising the possibility of a thyroid mass.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis in either the left or right lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITALIZATION COURSE: Mr. [**Known lastname 4281**] is a 56 year old male with a history of CAD s/p DES x2 (LCx and mLAD), DM, OSA, CHF and HTN who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED after 1 day of fatigue, bilateral leg pain and left arm pain found to have hypotension with response to IV steroids.
ACTIVE ISSUES: #Hypotension: Patient presented with hypotension of unclear etiology.
Sepsis, cardiogenic and hypovolemic causes were quickly ruled out.
While in the MICU patient received IV steroids for possible adrenal insufficiency which improved hypotension.
Endocrine was consulted to address of question for cortisol insufficiency.
Endocrine postulated that it may be chronic suppression of the adrenal access from chronic opioid use.
# Hypoxia: Patient developed hypoxia in setting fluid overload on top of chronic hypoxia from severe OSA.
# Bradycardia: In setting of placing central venous catheter, patient had vagal episode resulting in bradycardia requiring atropine.
After readjusting CVL, patient no longer had bradycardia .
# Acute Renal Failure: Patient had elevated Cr in setting of hypotension with fluid resuscitation and improvement of hypotension, Cr returned normal.
# Hypertension: Given presenting hypotension, anti-hypertensives were held on admission.
No changes in medications or interventions were necessary: # Chronic Leg pain # Hyperlipidemia # Obstructive Sleep Apnea  Medications on Admission: Certirizine 10mg daily Plavix 75mg daily Lipitor 20mg daily Bumex 2mg daily Baby aspirin daily Lisinopril 5 mg daily Ativan 5mg [**Hospital1 **] Hi-CAl ORal Liqud daily Folic ACid 1mg [**Hospital1 **] Dilaudid 4mg PO q6-8h PRN Ritalin 10mg TID Magnesium 200mg [**Hospital1 **] Gabapentin 300mg TID Metopolol succinate 50mg daily Omeprazole 40 mg daily Potassium chloride 20mg daily Metformin 1000mg daily Vitamin B6 100mg daily Celexa 20mg daily Lantus 6u qHS  Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO DAILY (Daily).
16. diazepam 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for muscle spasm.
You should notify your physician or call 911 immediately if chest pain continues.
Outpatient Lab Work Chem-7 on [**3-28**] and fax results to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11145**] attn: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11139**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 6011**] Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Adrenal Insufficiency .
Secondary Diagnoses: Diabetes Mellitis Coronary Artery Disease Obstructive Sleep Apnea   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Vital Signs Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you had very low blood pressure with leg weakness.
We think that your low blood pressure was from a low steroid level in your body.
If you experience a change in greater than 3lbs, please call your doctor.
