Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Hemodialysis Lumbar puncture under fluorscopic guidance Pulmonary intubation for respiratory distress   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 12731**] is an 83 year old man with a past medical history of multiple medical problems including ESRD on HD, CAD s/p MI, GIBs, Afib not on anticoagulation, multiple previous [**Known lastname 12916**] (MRSA, ESBL E. coli, VSE) s/p fall with C2 fracture [**4-28**].

He was recently readmitted ([**Date range (3) 12950**]) for treament of iliac crest bone graft site infection and discharged to rehab on a six week course of ertapenem.
He presents today from dialysis with reports of intermittent confusion and drowsiness at HD followed by a short episode of tremor/shaking with decreased responsiveness.
Patient's family and rehab reportedly endorsed a history of intermittent confusion over the last few days.
His exam revealed no new focal neurologic deficits and no evidence of confusion.
He denies feeling any confusion now and is oriented x 3.
He is unaware of any recent changes in his medications.
He denies any falls or traumas.
He reports his pain is well controlled.

Lives with wife [**Name (NI) **], daughter lives downstairs, h/o smoking [**12-21**] PPD for 50 years, quit 20 years ago, occasional beer, none recently, no drugs.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
NECK: soft collar in place, appropriate erythema and induration surrounding posterior neck incision site, no drainage.
No thrills, lifts.
+ bs EXTREMITIES: Trace edema bilaterally, no clubbing, no cyanosis.
1+DPP SKIN: Scattered small ecchymoses, no rashes, no erythema LINES: L subclavian HD cath with dressing c/d/i.
EKG [**2127-9-17**]:  Probable sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature beat.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Modest low amplitude right precordial lead T wave changes are non-specific.
Allowing for this limitation, there is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline structures or edema.
Bifrontal CSF spaces remained prominent, consistent due to frontotemporal predominant parenchymal atrophy.
Periventricular regions of hypoattenuation are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
A right maxillary sinus anterior retention cyst is unchanged.
No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
There is a left subclavian dialysis catheter in place, which is unchanged from prior exam with tip in the expected location of the superior vena cava.
There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Mediastinal contour is prominent, though this is stable and likely due to an unfolded thoracic aorta.
IMPRESSION: No acute findings.
No evidence of pneumonia.
There is sclerosis at the fracture site with increased osseous bridging since the prior study from [**2127-8-18**].
Osteophytes are present at C4-5 and C5-6 with loss of disc height.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 year old man with a past medical history of multiple medical problems including ESRD on HD, multiple previous [**Year (4 digits) 12916**] (MRSA, ESBL E. coli, VSE) s/p fall with C2 fracture [**4-28**] with progressive collapse s/p ORIF C2 and posterior instrumentation C1-C5 and left iliac crest bone graft placement [**7-31**].
He was recently admitted ([**Date range (3) 12950**]) for treament of iliac crest bone graft site infection and discharged to rehab on a six week course of ertapenem.
He presented from HD after reported intermittent confusion and brief episodes of shaking.
He progressed to respiratory distress during fluroscopic guided LP, which required a transfer to the MICU for respiratory assistance, then returned to the general medical floors with resolution of respiratory issues.
Altered mental status: On admission Mr. [**Known lastname 12731**] was mildly agitated but communciating and AOx3.
He had a workup consisting of CT head, EKG, troponins, CXR, UA with UCx's and blood cx's, all which were negative for any new acute pathology.
Electrolytes at baseline were within normal limits and the patient did not have a fever.
Initial thoughts were possible seizures vs medication (ertapenem/meropenem) side effect, as he recently started taking ertapenem for his iliac crest infection on [**2127-8-29**].
The patient's symptoms progressed on HD2, with increased shaking, agitation and slurred speech.
He was also found to have a fixed dilated right pupil.
Patient scheduled for head CT angio, neck CT for possible pharyngeal abscess, and IR guided LP for r/o meningitis.
Stat CXR showed worsening consolidation, especially in the patient's right lung.
MICU consulted and patient transferred for management of respiratory distress from the IR suite.
MICU Course: Patient was intubated for respiratory failure and airway protection.
Back on the general medical floor, the patient's mental status had drastically improved.
His PICC line became displaced requring reinsertion on [**2127-9-26**].
The patient did have episodes of mild sundowning/delirium, but was easily reoriented and never required sedating medications.
His acute mental status changes were felt to be due to administartion of carbopenems, given his rapid recovery off these medications.
Switched to meropenem on HD2 due to potential for seizure activity/neurologic complications with ertapenem.
No focal erythema or signs of gross infection seen.
Mental status drastically improved, and patient continued to be afebrile and without leukocytosis.
Patient had no evidence of active bleeding or clotting and no further inpatient workup was pursued.
# Depression: No active symptoms currently.
# CAD s/p MI: No recent anginal symptoms.
No issues during hospitalization.
Rec'd albuterol/ipratropium nebs PRN for respiratory congestion.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for changes in mental status.
You were at your rehabilitation center when you started becoming confused, agitated, and having a hard time communciating.
You also began having muscle twitches throughout the day in your leg and arms.
For future reference, you should inform your health care providers about this reaction you have had to ERTAPENEM so in the event you get an infection, other antibiotics can be employed if possible.
