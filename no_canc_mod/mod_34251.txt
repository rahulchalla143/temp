She reports that on the evening  prior to presentation she developed fever to 102 and swelling of her left knee.
Two days prior to that she reports falling out of a car and cutting her hand on the ground which became progressively more swollen and painful.
She also endorses history of cellulitis in her left leg two months ago at [**Hospital **] hospital for which she was treated with antibiotics.
She had drainage of a 2x2 cm abscess on her left hand which was packed in the ED.
She was evaluated by orthopedics due to concern for septic joint and she had drainage of reportedly purulent material from her left knee.
Past Medical History: Severe persistent asthma - multiple intubations chronic sinusitis opiod dependence s/p bilateral knee replacements for osteonecrosis [**2-26**] long term prednisione use (R knee [**9-1**], left knee [**1-1**]) hypogammaglobulinemia hepatitis c tobacco abuse -spontaneous PTX in [**5-2**] -s/p R VATS/bleb resection and pleurectomy at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital in [**2141-6-25**] osteopenia by xray  Social History: She endorses recent injection of heroin in the past week and reports that prior to this she had been clean for about two years.
Family History: Mother - breast cancer [**Name (NI) **] - asthma and hyperthyroidism  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.1 BP: 92/64 P:95 R:21 O2: 97% RA General:  awake, alert and oriented HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, oropharynx clear, no roths spots Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: decreased air movement, scattered squeaks in the upper air fields, no crackles CV: regular, tachycardic(after nebs), normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: left knee with clean dry surgical site with staples in place.
Mild tenderness to palpation.
Pertinent Results: [**2142-10-2**] knee X ray: In comparison with the study of [**8-29**], there has been placement of a total knee prosthesis without evidence of hardware-related complication.
There is substantial soft tissue swelling in the suprapatellar region.
It is unclear whether this could merely represent postoperative change, since the date of the surgical procedure is not known.
If postoperative changes should have been resolved by this time, the possibility of an acute inflammatory process must be seriously considered given the clinical history.
[**2142-10-2**] chest x ray pa / lat: No acute intrathoracic process.
If this patient has no underlying obvious etiology, the differential would include osteogenesis imperfecta.
[**2142-10-3**] transthoracic echocardiogram: Suboptimal study due to patient decision not to allow for study completion.
Possible very small vegetation on the posterior mitral leaflet.
If clinically indicated, a follow-up transthoracic study with color Doppler and apical images and/or a TEE is suggested to better assess the possible posterior mitral leaflet abnormality  [**2142-10-3**] transthoracic echocardiogram:  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]).
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation is now seen (not previously assessed).If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE would be better able to define the mitral valve morphology and severity of mitral regurgitation.

MODERATE GROWTH.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Clindamycin was in case she had toxic shock, this was discontinued on [**2142-10-6**] as she was no longer pressor dependent.
Her L knee joint fluid and L thumb abscess also grew group A strep.
She had a TEE without evidence of endocarditis.
POLYSUBSTANCE ABUSE: The patient was initially noted to be extremely agitated with acute illness.
ASTHMA: Asthma exacerbation on admission.
Severe persistent asthma with multiple (> 20) intubations in the past.
She is not compliant with her meds and was intubated due to respiratory failure.
Consider repeating MRSA screens x 3 to remove precautions.
Hepatitis C chronic: antibody +, VL 7700. will f/u with ID.

Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: septic arthritis, prosthetic joint   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: Patient was admitted with group A strept infection of her prosthetic knee.
