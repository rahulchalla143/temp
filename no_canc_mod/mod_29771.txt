MICROBIOLOGY: MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2116-11-9**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Lungs are essentially clear except for bibasilar linear opacities, most likely consistent with atelectasis.
No interval development of pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Looking through past [**Hospital1 18**] admits, he has had hallucinations before, but no documented seizures.
# Angina - Patient has had repeated admissions over past few months for chest pain, most recently twice in [**2116-8-24**].
Had intermittent symptoms of [**2115-1-27**] chest pain, often sharp and midline, throughout his hospitalization and was seen to have EKG's unchanged from prior, and pt had [**Date Range 20003**] out for MI with cardiac enzymes.
His chest pain was likely related to his anxiety but possibly from hypetension as well, for which his Imdur was increased to 90 mg daily.
Should he continue to have chest pain at the rehab, would give sublingual nitroglycerins, check blood pressure and if elevated consider giving an extra Metoprolol; also consider relaxation techniques given self reported anxiety.
# Shortness of [**Last Name (un) 1440**]: As above, likely a large component of anxiety; however pt also with COPD at baseline.
# Hypertension - Was hypertensive in ED, likely secondary to withdrawal as well as rebound from beta-blocker and nitrate therapy.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # COPD - Had distant [**Last Name (un) 1440**] sounds and tachypneic on admission but was later saturating well on RA by the time of discharge.
# Anxiety - pt self reported severe GAD and this was likely the cause of his intermittent mild chest pain and shortness of [**Last Name (un) 1440**].
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -*patient may be a candidate for anti-depressant or anti-anxiety treatment, which may help with his medication compliance, severe anxiety, and alcoholism* - continue working with community social worker and rehabilitation facility to continue abstaining from alcohol, continue to encourage alcohol abstinence and compliance with AA  A brief verbal signout was given to the [**Hospital3 2558**] about the pt's course and active issues just before discharge.
