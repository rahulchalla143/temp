Italian speaking male being followed for a 3.5 cm RUL cavitary nodule, suspcious for TB or cavitary tumor, returns for eval.
Currently, the pt reports only occas dry cough and some shortness of breath after climbing two flights of stairs, which does not require him to sit down.
RUL transbronchial biopsy done in [**2102-7-31**] was negative for malignancy.
Currently the patient has had a repeat CT scan which demonstrated FDG avidity in the region of the lung nodule and some uptake in T11.
He does come today with an X-ray report of the thoracic and lumbar spine which demonstrated no abnormality in that region.

Opacities in the right perihilar region and right mid lung are postoperative findings.
There is no large pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
Status post right upper lobectomy, with a small air-fluid level seen in the resection bed.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
A small loculated pneumothorax and small simple effusion in the right basal pleural space.
Partial aeration of the superior segment of the right lower lobe, with near complete collapse of the right middle and lower lobes.
Large amount of secretions obstructing the right main and bronchus intermedius.
Large amount of right chest wall emphysema relates to the recent procedure.
Enlarged large right hydrothorax at the right upper lobectomy bed.
Interval complete collapse of the right middle and lower lobes, with slightly increased rightward mediastinal shift.
Large amount of secretions within the bronchus intermedius and distal branches.
[**2103-3-30**] BRONCHIAL WASHINGS: PLEURAL FLUID.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2103-3-30**]): NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2103-4-2**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
The extrathoracic air collection with multiple air-fluid levels is unchanged in size and appearance.
The extent of the right pleural effusion has minimally increased.
As a consequence, the amount of ventilated lung parenchyma at the lung base has decreased.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 88903**] is an 83yM who initially presented to the thoracic surgery clinic in [**2101**] for an incidentally discovered RUL mass on routine preoperative CXR.
He underwent PET scanning as well as EBUS which were negative for malignancy.
On POD2, his chest xray demonstrated progressive collapse as well as a sizeable pneumothorax.
He underwent placement of an anterior pigtail for evacuation of the pneumothorax and was taken to the OR on [**3-23**] for bronchoscopy for evacuation of mucous plug likely causing lung collapse.
On [**3-25**], his CXR demonstrated continued atalectasis and he returned to the OR for a repeat therapeutic bronchoscopy.
His CXRs continued to demonstrated atalectasis with nearly complete right sided collapse and Interventional Pulmonology performed two further bedside bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet on [**3-27**] and 3.29.
A CT chest was obtained [**3-29**] and demonstrated an apical pleural effusion which was drained with a pigtail by Interventional pulmonology.
He was transferred from the ICU to the surgical floor and began working with physical therapy.
On [**4-3**], his pain was well controlled, he was tolerating a regular diet and his CXR following pigtail removal was stable.
