Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3356**], a 55 year old gentleman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and insulin dependent diabetes, presented with three days of chest pain.
He was found to have EKG changes and a troponin elevation consistent with an ST elevation myocardial infarction.
He was started on a heparin infusion and had a cardiac catheterization the next day which showed diffuse three vessel disease.

That evening he complained of muscular chest pain and was placed on a dilaudid PCA pump.
Around 1050 he complained of shortness of breath and he was placed in the bed.
He became obtunded and stopped breathing.
