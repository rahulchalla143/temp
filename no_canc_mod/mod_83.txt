Brief Hospital Course: This is a 80yo woman with h/o CAD s/p recent DES to LCX and AS s/p valvuloplasty admitted on [**7-22**] for another CHF exacerbation, receiving diuresis/HD, pt course was complicated by GI bleeding, underwent dialysis prior to leaving.
# CHF Exacerbation: The patient had several episodes of desaturation and acute shortness of breath.
The patient was transferred from CCU to the floor, at which point she developed both acute shortness of breath and progressive hematemesis which prompted her return back to the CCU.
She developed renal failure shortly thereafter, and required hemodialysis.
# Coronary artery disease: DES to LCx in [**2174-5-11**], other coronaries w/o obstructive dz.
No evidence of acute ischemic changes during admission.
The patient had been receiving ASA and Plavix along with carvedilol, the ASA and plavix were discontinued after the episode of upper GI bleeding.
# Aortic Stenosis: s/p valvuloplasty, not thought to be good surgical candidate due to large atheroma.
No realistic percutaneous option as patient has 4 exclusion criteria for most feasible trial.
# ID Issues: Pt recently ended course of Vancomycin for strep veridins bacteremia.
Blood and Urine cultures have been negative, TTE negative for any endocarditis.
The patient had her foley removed and she completed a course of cipro for 5 days.
# Upper GI Bleed: The patient devleped retching and hematemesis on [**8-1**], which was similar to an episode a month earlier.
At that time she was scoped and found to have multiple bleeding AVM's which were cauterized and had a stable Hct.
She summarily went into flash pulmonary edema with concomitant renal failure, and had to be dialyzed.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  The patient had been responsive to high doses of lasix (100mg) with diuril priming.
However, when the patient developed hematemesis and had an acute blood loss, she subsequently developed renal failure, and when she had a subsequent episode of flash pulmonary edema, she received urgent dialysis and a tunnelled HD line was placed.
Medications on Admission: Aspirin 81 mg Carvedilol 12.5 mg PO BID Clopidogrel 75 mg Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion as needed for itching.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: [**12-15**]  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob/wheeze.
Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5-500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for PRN pain relief.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: [**12-15**]  Injection PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure Aortic Stenosis Upper Gastrointestinal Atriovenous Malformations Acute on Chronic Renal Failure Secondary: Strep viridans bacteremia Renal cell carcinoma Scoliosis cholelithiasis osteoarthritis herpes zoster Gastritis Anemia Myositis   Discharge Condition: ambulating with marked assistance, tolerating PO feeds, vital signs stable, hemodialysis dependent   Discharge Instructions: You were recently admitted to the CCU because of shortness of breath and during your course at the hospital, an episode of vomiting blood.
An endoscopy of the top portion of your intestinal tract showed some bleeding vessels, which the GI doctors were [**Name5 (PTitle) 460**] to coagulate while doing the scope.
Also, we are now dialyzing you to remove the fluid from your body to prevent the shortness of breath that you've been feeling.
