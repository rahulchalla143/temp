Admission Date:  [**2151-12-23**]       Discharge Date: [**2152-1-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2086-10-25**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old male patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy and hypertension who had a positive exercise tolerance test, was admitted for outpatient cardiac catheterization on [**2151-12-17**] which revealed a 50% left main occlusion with three vessel coronary artery disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45 to 50%  The patient was discharged home and was admitted on the morning of [**2151-12-23**] for elective coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient remained stable on postop day two and on postop day three the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 90 to 120.
This controlled his ventricular response but he remained in atrial fibrillation.
Over the next couple of days the patient remains with a stable blood pressure but was in and out of atrial fibrillation.
He was begun on intravenous Heparin and transitioned to Coumadin for anti-coagulation for his persistent postoperative atrial fibrillation.
The patient has had no other postoperative concerns and has otherwise progressed well.
The patient had his intravenous Heparin drip discontinued on postoperative day eight, his INR was therapeutic at that time, had bumped 2.8, he remained in atrial fibrillation however, at that time with rates up to the 130's.
After discussion with the patient's primary cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] it was determined best to discontinue the Metoprolol due to the patient's intermittent hypotension and discharge him home on Amiodarone for his atrial fibrillation.
Respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 108/50, room air oxygen saturation 97%  Neurologically the patient is alert and oriented with no apparent neurologic deficits.
Coronary artery disease.
Rapid atrial fibrillation.
