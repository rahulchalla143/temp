Admission Date:  [**2179-9-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2140-6-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**] Chief Complaint: Fevers and Chest Tightness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 39 year old male who presented with fevers, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.
Patient began experiencing fevers and joint aches in late-[**Month (only) **].
He visited the [**Hospital **] clinic and was placed on a two-week course of Doxycycline, given his previous history of Lyme Disease.
Patient continued to have fevers despite his antibiotic treatment.
In the beginning of [**Month (only) 216**], the patient began to experience fevers of 102, neck stiffness, and palpitations.
He again visited the [**Hospital **] clinic, where it was thought that he may be having a reaction to Doxycycline.
This week, the patient developed chest tightness and increasing shortness of breath.
He states that his chest pain is worse  He called the [**Hospital **] clinic and was told to go immediately to the ED.
The patient had a CXR performed, which showed a markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
An ECHO was then performed, which showed a large pericardial effusion and sustained right atrial collapse.
900 cc of serosanguinous fluid were successfully removed.
Of note, the post-pericardiocentesis right-sided pressures remained mildly elevated.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Patient endorses recent nausea and vomiting.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Migraines Adrenal Hypoplasis: Treated with Florinef and Cortef until his mid-20s Exercise-induced asthma Seasonal allergies s/p hand surgery in [**2-16**]  Social History: Patient finished graduate school in chemistry and left academics for woodworking.
Patient has not had any recent travel.
No pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple, no appreciable LAD, no elevated JVD.
No appreciable rubs.
Breath sounds not well appreciated secondary to pain with inspiration.
No edema or cyanosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 17 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 15 mm Hg.
There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension of 36/17 mm Hg.
This equalization of pressures is consistent with tamponade physiology.
Post-pericardiocentesis, the right sided pressures remained mildly elevated.
Echo ([**2179-9-30**]):  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
Echo ([**2179-10-1**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Anterior to the right atrium and distal right ventricular free wall, it measures up to 0.8 cm in diameter.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Moderate to large pericardial effusion with pericardial enhancement, a finding that suggests infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic cause.
Small left and tiny right pleural effusions.
The differential diagnosis would include congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and, in the setting of the associated findings described above, other entities such as tuberculosis, other granulomatous disease, or rare entities such as Erdheim- [**Location (un) **] disease.
Several tiny calcified granulomata in the lung bases, consistent with prior granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis.
Stranding in the subcutaneous fat of the right groin, likely due to prior percutaneous vascular access.
Soft tissue attenuation in the anterior mediastinum may represent inflammatory stranding, perhaps secondary to adjacent pericarditis.
DISCHARGE LABS:  [**2179-10-3**] 06:40AM BLOOD WBC-7.5 RBC-4.39* Hgb-13.5* Hct-39.1* MCV-89 MCH-30.8 MCHC-34.6 RDW-12.2 Plt Ct-682* [**2179-10-3**] 06:40AM BLOOD Plt Ct-682* [**2179-10-3**] 06:40AM BLOOD Glucose-90 UreaN-9 Creat-0.9 Na-141 K-4.3 Cl-100 HCO3-28 AnGap-17 [**2179-10-3**] 06:40AM BLOOD Mg-2.1  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 39 yo male with a h/o Lyme disease who presents with fevers, chest tightness, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath, and was found to have cardiac tamponade.
# Pericardial Effusion:  Patient presented with chest tightness and shortness of breath.
CXR demonstrated enlarged cardiac silhouette, and subsequent TTE showed a large pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse.
Patient had a pericardialcentesis with 900 cc fluid drained.
Fluid was sent for analysis and was found to have 4600 WBC.
Thyroid hormones were also within normal limits.
The patient had two repeat ECHOs during this hospitalization, which both showed resolution of the tamponade physiology.
# Fevers:  Patient had persistent fevers since the end of [**Month (only) **].
Medications on Admission: Tylenol prn Oxycodone 10 mg prn for pain in neck and chest   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Cardiac tamponade Pericardial effusion Bilateral pleural effusions Lung granuloma   Discharge Condition: ambulatory, SpO2 100% on RA   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you had signs of cardiac tamponade, which means that fluid was building up in the sac around your heart causing compromise of your heart's ability to pump.
If you have any worsening of shortness of breath, chest pain, severe lightheadedness, please return to the Emergency Room immediately.
