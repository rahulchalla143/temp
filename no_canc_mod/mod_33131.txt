Otherwise, no epileptiform features were seen.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, no choledocholithiasis seen.
RUE U/s IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
CT Head [**1-15**] No evidence of hemorrhage or stroke.
No parenchymal infection or aspiration.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Prominent pericardial recess, less likely a cyst.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 70year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who presents from [**Hospital6 302**] with hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension found to have acute renal failure, severe acidosis and elevated pancreatic enzymes.
Has an appointment set up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3636**] as PCP and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] for renal outpatient.
***Of note: patient should have outpt f/u with pcp regarding the elevated ca [**60**]-9 which was checked for unclear reasons earlier during this hospital stay.
Shock: Patient on presentation was hypothermic, hypotensive and bradycardic concerning for shock of unclear etiology.
Concern for severe infection.
There was a ?
CT Head was positive for possible sinus infection, so patient was treated with azithromycin.
After initial hypotension, patient became hypertensive and was started on Nifedipine in the ICU.
Acute Renal Failure: Likely secondary to ATN.
No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan to suggest obstruction.
Elevated pancreatic enzymes: Unclear etiology, may be secondary to poor perfusion.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be the cause of her original presentation.
On CT abdomen, no mediastinal hemorrhage, some peripancreatic stranding, long stretch of dilated bowel (collapsed bowel behind it) potentially consistent with incomplete sbo vs local ileus in the setting of pancreatic inflammation.
Patient does not have clear risk factors as is s/p cholecystectomy and no known history of alcoholism.
Altered Mental Status: Patient had altered mental status at [**Month (only) 5348**] and schizophrenia.
Likely secondary to severe infection and acute renal failure with electrolyte abnormalities.
EEG negative for seizure.
A psychiatry consult was obtained; per psych, the patient's psych meds were held in the setting of acute illness.
Schizoaffective disorder:  Held all medications for given altered mental status per Psychiatry.
Hyperglycemia: No documented history of diabetes.
Epistaxis: Pt was transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on night of [**1-19**] in setting of massive epistaxis and spitting up bright red blood.
Due to epistaxis and [**Date Range 5348**] altered mental status (see above), pt desated down to 70s on RA, which improved upon deep suctioning of blood clots.
She was seen urgently by ENT who identified an area in the L middle turbinate as being the likely source, which was packed and the bleeding resolved.
There was a subsequent episode of epistaxis on [**1-24**].
As scheduled the nasal packing was removed on [**1-24**] by ENT and to have continued humidified shovel mask and epistaxis precautions.
Around 10pm patient developed cough after sip of water.
ENT was paged and assessed patient at bedside and saw minimal active bleeding from post-nasopharynx (raw appearing diffuse oozing along posterior septum w/o active bleeding along posterior pharyngeal wall).
She then was transfered to MICU-6 for arterial embolization.
She was transiently intubated for the procedure and was then extubated following without difficulty.
was found to be hypoxic on [**1-25**], found to have radiographic evidence of aspiration pneumonia.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 5503**] Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypovolemic Shock Aspiration Pneumonia Refractory Epistaxis  Secondary: Ulcerative Colitis s/p colectomy with end ileostomy Schizoaffective disorder Chronic renal insufficiency ([**Hospital 5348**] creatinine 3.0) Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable, responsive, not ambulatory, can move all 4 extremities spontaneously, eating, drinking, voiding without complaints.
When you arrived to [**Hospital3 **], you had very low blood pressure and your mental status was impaired.
On the floor you were doing well until you had several episodes of nose bleeds, which formed clots that prevented you from breathing.
You were sent back to the ICU twice and the second time you underwent a procedure to block off one of the arteries in your left nostril, which has prevented much of the bleeding from coming back.
In addition, you had been having difficulty swallowing, and at one point you may have aspirated some of your food/saliva into your lung, causing a pneumonia.
If you experience any additional nose bleeds, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, numbness or tingling on one side of your body, please contact your primary care provider [**Name Initial (PRE) 2227**].
