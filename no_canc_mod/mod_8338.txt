HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 23-year-old man with a history of type 1 diabetes complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, hypertension, migraine headaches, and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35% who presents with three days of nausea, vomiting, and hyperglycemia.
The patient also reported diarrhea five times on the day of admission with severe refractory vomiting approximately 10-15x/day.
He reports in addition to that, chills and abdominal pains, but denies any fever, chest discomfort, or shortness of breath.
He did have a sick contact in his mother who had similar diarrheal symptoms recently.
Denies any bright red blood per rectum or any melena.
Upon presentation to the Emergency Department, he had one episode of coffee-ground emesis.
He was volume resuscitated with 2 liters of normal saline, started on an insulin drip for his elevated blood glucose, and was brought up into the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Type 1 diabetes with triopathy.
Chronic renal insufficiency secondary to diabetic nephropathy.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35% and global left ventricular hypokinesis.
He is poorly compliant with his diabetic care.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes.
In general, he appeared in no acute distress.
Pertinent physical findings reveal that his sclerae were anicteric.
His heart was tachycardic with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border and a [**3-6**] murmur at the apex.
Extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Examination of his skin revealed no rashes.
He had no bands on his differential.
Chest x-ray revealed small bilateral effusions.
Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for management of his diabetic ketoacidosis.
His diabetic ketoacidosis was thought to be triggered by a viral gastroenteritis as well as pneumonia ([**Last Name 788**] problem #2).
Initially because of poor po intake, he was only given 10 units of Lantus insulin and his blood sugars were persistently between 200-300.
This regimen to achieve better glycemic control, and prior to discharge, a repeat Chem-7 was checked showing complete closure of his anion gap.
Pulmonary:  Because of his anemia, which is likely secondary to his renal disease, he was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells on the 15th.
Following this blood transfusion and in addition to the aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation he received, the patient developed pulmonary edema, and was restarted on his outpatient dose of Lasix 80 mg po bid.
The patient continued to have an anion gap despite appropriate therapy with insulin and it was unclear if further infection was the cause of his diabetic ketoacidosis.
With the pleural effusions at the lung bases were obscured, to better evaluate lung parenchyma, a CT scan of the chest was done which revealed a right lower lobe parenchymal air space consolidation with again no evidence of bilateral pleural effusions associated with compressive atelectasis.
There are also prominent mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes noted.
Concern was briefly arranged for an aspiration pneumonia given the patient's significant vomiting, however, it was felt that he most likely had a community acquired pneumonia, and then was continued on clindamycin alone.
Upon transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the Medical team, his antibiotics were further changed to levofloxacin as monotherapy for his pneumonia.
Sputum culture was obtained which revealed fewer than 10 polys, and culture grew moderate oropharyngeal flora.
Gram stain revealed no organisms or leukocytes.
Analysis of these numbers revealed that the fluid is most likely suggestive of a transudate likely representing a parapneumonic effusion.
During the admission, the patient had also complained of a pleuritic type of pain on the right side.
Brief concern for pulmonary embolism was raised, and the patient was started on Heparin.
Bilateral lower extremity noninvasive studies were performed which were negative for any evidence of deep venous thrombosis at which time the Heparin was stopped.
The pleuritic pain was likely felt to be due to his pneumonia and effusion.
Hypertension:  The patient continued to be hypertensive during his admission.
B. Congestive heart failure:  As stated above, following transfusion and aggressive volume resuscitation, the patient had some pulmonary edema.
His elevated creatinine likely represented progression of chronic disease with the added insult of dehydration.
He will have very close followup with Nephrology and plans to start peritoneal dialysis in the future as there is no match related donor for transplant.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had no further nausea and vomiting after admission including therefore obviously no further coffee-ground emesis.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Viral gastroenteritis.
Right lower lobe pneumonia.
Small upper gastrointestinal bleed likely secondary to [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
