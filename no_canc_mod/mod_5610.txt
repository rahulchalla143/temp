Tiny volume of pleural air at the base of the right lung is stable.
There is appreciably greater congestion and possibly mild edema in the right lung now than earlier in the day.
Minimal left perihilar edema has also developed.
ET tube in standard placement, transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads unchanged in standard placements as well.
Prominent fluid-containing structure with internal debris in the left upper quadrant may represent gastric contents versus pleural effusion with heterogeneous internal debris, incompletely evaluated.
TTE [**2115-6-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Persistent large multiloculated right pleural effusion.
New loculated hydropneumothoraces are likely related to pleural catheter placement.
New high attenuation along diaphragmatic pleural region, probably representing talc deposition given history of interval talc treatment.
Improving left lower lobe opacity which may be due to resolving area of infection or inflammation.
Septal thickening, probably reflecting hydrostatic edema, but attention to this area on followup CT may be helpful to exclude lymphangitic carcinomatosis   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 34440**] was a very pleasant 54 year-old female who unfortunately was readmitted for recurrent right pleural effusion following a right VATS decortication, mechanical/doxycycline pleurodesis .
Her chest CT showed an increase of the right-sided pleural effusion, partially divided/organized in two major compartments.
Pigtail was inserted without complications, 1350cc of straw colored fluid was drained.
Post-procedure CXRs showed continued right pleural effusion.
Her WBC was elevated, which we attributed to the talc pleurodesis, as she was otherwise w/o signs or symptoms of infection.
It quickly became evident that the pigtail placed was too small in diameter for adequate drainage of this multiloculated effusion and that she would need a repeat R VATS decortication with placement of a pleurx catheter.
On [**2115-6-22**] patient developed tachycardia with rates to the 150s and a drop in SBPs to 90-80s.
However, on closer inspection of her rhythm strip and in consultation with cardiology, it was determined that she actually had afib RVR with aberrancy.
She later spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm without any further intervention.
It also became quickly apparent to us that she was particularly preload dependent given her severe AS, which manifested as a prominent drop in SBPs with HRs >120s.
She never lost consciousness and had a strong peripheral pulse during these episodes.
However, she suddenly became oliguric with outputs ~5cc/hr by 5:00am that morning.
Urine electrolytes were sent which showed a FENA of 3%, not c/w a prerenal state.
Serial ABGs were obtained which showed a severe metabolic acidosis most likely caused by renal failure with a pH of 7.21, CO2 42 and HCO3 18.
Subsequent ABGs showed worsening acidosis.
She did not have abdominal pain or surgical abdomen and her chest tubes were adequately draining sersang fluid.
Renal thought she might have urosepsis given the presence of WBC casts.
She did have leukocytosis, although this temporally was consistent with her recent talc/doxy pleurodesis.
Urinalysis from [**2115-6-23**] was also negative for infection.
Thus, there was few sxns and signs of urosepsis and was generally felt to be an unlikely cause of her sudden deterioration.
They were unsure if her metabolic acidosis and rising lactate was consistent with cardiogenic shock or sepsis physiology.
A TTE showed elevated PCWP with a preserved EF>55%.
There was moderate TR and mild MR. .
Post swan CXR showed appropriate line placement without new PTX.
Bicarb was given for severe metabolic acidosis, which began to improve after CVVH was started.
Cardiology believed the thermodilution was inaccurate given her severe valvular pathology and calculated the CI to be 2.3 (corrected for hemoglobin).
We contemplated the idea that she had thromboembolic acute mesenteric ischemia in the setting of intermittent afib, but ultimately felt this was extremely unlikely given the fact that she did not have abdominal pain or tenderness on exam.
Again, urosepsis seemed an unlikely cause.
Ultimately, we did not understand the exact cause of acute decline, but were actively managing here metabolic acidosis and renal failure by CVVH and bicarb drip.
She was without a pulse and unresponsive.
Bedside ultrasound was negative for a pericardial effusion.
