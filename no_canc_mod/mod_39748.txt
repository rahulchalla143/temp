[**2137-8-7**] 5:44 am BLOOD CULTURE     Blood Culture, Routine ([**Month/Day/Year **]):  [**2137-8-6**] 4:50 pm URINE     Site: CATHETER                              **FINAL REPORT [**2137-8-7**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2137-8-7**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2137-8-6**] 4:45 pm BLOOD CULTURE                              **FINAL REPORT [**2137-8-12**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2137-8-12**]):    NO GROWTH.
Has advanced HIV but no recent CD4 count (none since prior to HAART) so therefore may be at high risk for infection.
He also has a history of E coli and Pseudomonas in his sputum (sensitive to cefepime and Pip/Taz) on [**7-17**].
Sputum from [**7-20**] showed moderate Pseudomonas with intermdiate resistance to Amikacin, and pt had Amikacin levels from [**7-31**], but no additional data regarding this treatment was available.
He also has an indwelling PICC, it is unknown how long this has been in place.
The sputum showed no microorganisms, and the urine culture had no growth.
Blood cultures [**8-6**] showed no growth.
Patient spiked a temperature to 101.6 on [**2137-8-7**], and was re-cultured (blood cx still [**Date Range **] [**8-12**]), but has remained afebrile since then.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia or acute disease.
Consideration was also given to removing the PICC as a potential source of infection, but as patient had no evidence of growth on blood cultures or worsening infection, this was left in.
Pt was afebrile for several days, but on [**8-12**]/8, began to spike recurrent fevers to 103(rectal).
Sputum, blood, and urine cultures were sent on [**8-12**] and showed WBCs and bacteria in urine but never grew any bacteria.
Sputum showed PSA as before.
ID was called for consult regarding whether to get an LP and further workup for infectious cause of fever however they felt that PSA was likely a colonization and fever was central in origin not infections.
H/o Positive sputum cultures: Pt has history of pseudomonas and E. coli in sputum with multiple drug resistance.
No clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR, but with significant immunosuppresion.
Sputum intially showed no organisms, and pt was empirically treated with zosyn/cipro.
Antibiotics were d/c'd on [**2137-8-15**] as it was felt they were not indicated in setting of colonization and no infection.
Very poor mental status at baseline, does not appear changed per [**Hospital1 **] reports.
Progressive neurologic impairment as expected.
A CT was ordered that showed much progressed PML since [**4-9**].
Had several discussions with mother regarding goals of care, and she intially indicated she did not want patient to be intubated or have chest compressions and then after the results of the CT decided to not escalate his care further.
Now at skilled nursing facility, no concern for withdrawal issues.
Code: During this admission, code status was changed to DNR/DNI after discussions with mother, may need to readdress for future admissions.
All of this seems to be related to autonomic dysregulation as a consequence of his PML.
It is worth noting that his sputum is colonized by Psuedomonas, but he does not have a Pseudomonal infection per ID.
Pt was transiently febrile and started on Linezolid for a positive blood culture, but Abx were discontinued b/c culture showed likely contaminant.
He has been afebrile for 5 days.
