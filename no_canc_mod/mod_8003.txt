No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded, yet the apical segment, the mid portion of the anterior septum and apical portion of the septum appear hypokinetic.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No aortic stenosis is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Biventricular function unchanged from the pre-bypass period , LVEF 40-45%, with noted improvement of the apical segment, the mid portion of the anterior septum and apical portion of the septum.
This revealed significant left main disease and an IABP was placed.
