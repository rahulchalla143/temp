Admission Date:  [**2121-5-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-8-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with DES to RCA Intubation Intra Aortic Balloon Pump Placement.
Patient originally presented to [**Hospital 62277**] with exertional chest pain nausea that started at work at 9 am.
Had 2-3 episodes of moderate chest pressure with numbness down the back of both arms, as well as, diaphoresis, nausea, and lightheadedness while at work.
No shortness of breath, headache, visual changes, back pain, or abdominal pain.
No history of prior episodes of chest pain.
Admission EKG at [**Location (un) **] was negative for ischemic changes, however, he later developed EKG changes consistent with an inferior STEMI.
While trying to enagage the RCA, deploy the distal DES and remove the guidewire, patient deveoped asymptomatic hypotension with VT.
HTN 3.
Hyperlipidemia  Social History: Lives with his wife.
Family History: Mother - CAD (MI), DM Father - colon cancer  Physical Exam: VS on transfer to CCU: T 97.8 BP 94/56 HR 79 RR 12 sat 100 AC FiO2 100 TV 600 RR 12 Peep 5 Wt: 212 lbs Gen: intubated HEENT: perrla Resp: clear anteriorly CV: reg, systolic murmur (likely IABP) Abd: + BS, non-tender Ext: DP 1 + bilat, no edema Neuro: sedated  Pertinent Results: STUDIES: CXR - [**5-5**] - Satisfactorily positioned ET tube and OG tube.
Bilateral basilar opacities most likely representing atelectases but consolidations cannot be excluded.
Probable bilateral small pleural effusions.
EKG: [**5-5**] - 11:52 am at OSH - NSR, HR 70s, ST seg elevation in II, III, aVF, V4-V6, ST seg dep I, aVL .
[**5-5**] - 3:33 pm - NSR, HR 80s, ST seg elevations in II, aVF, ?
Qs in II and aVF, resolution of ST seg elevation in V4-V6, ST seg dep in I, aVL .. TTE: [**5-6**] - EF 35-40% Regional LV and RV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 61 yo M with Insulin dependent DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia who presents with inferior STEMI s/p PTCA complicated by hypotension requiring balloon pump and DA gtt as well as VT/VF resulting in Amio and Lidocaine gtt.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and was followed with daily ECGs with no further events.
He did not have any additional episodes of chest pain while in-patient.
Patient may need further intervention to deal with other areas of significant blockage, however, no intervention will be done acutely.
B.  CHF: In the cath lab the patient had hypotension as a result of the ischemia as well as arrhythmia.
As per PCWP and RA pressure from cath lab, he was effectively volume resuscitated.
TTE on [**5-6**] showed an ejection fraction of 35-40%, symmetric LVH, mild RV free wall hypokinesis.
The current hypotension may therefore reflect some amount of myocardial stunning and the heart may recover function at a future date.
C.  Rhythm: The pt had episodes of VT and VT/VF in cath lab during the acute intervention.
This may be secondary to reperfusion or due to involvement of conduction system.
No further episodes of VT/VF.
D.  Valve: No evidence of acute valvular insufficiency on physical exam or by ECHO.
DM:  Based on the findings of DiGAMI II, there is no evidence to support use of glucose/insulin gtt in the setting of ACS to improve mortality or morbidity in diabetics.
Given the discomfort of the invasive monitoring in the ICU at this time (swan, arterial and femoral sheath, IABP), sedation and intubation was continued until the IABP was removed on [**2121-7-6**].
The patient was extubated without difficulty.
