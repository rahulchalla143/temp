Cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 33%, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 25, and severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease; including left main with mild disease, the left anterior descending artery with 70% to 80% proximal to mid stenosis, the left circumflex with 95% proximal, 70% at the second obtuse marginal, and the right coronary artery which was nondominant with a 99% stenosis.
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
History of Alzheimer's disease/dementia.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He did have a right carotid bruit, but no left carotid bruit was noted.
No murmur was noted.
The abdomen was nontender and nondistended.
Extremity examination revealed his extremities were warm and well perfused with no varicosities.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with no acute ischemia.
His echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation, no aortic regurgitation, and global hypokinesis.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a carotid ultrasound which showed moderate plaque in the right and left internal carotid artery with narrowing of the right internal carotid artery to 60% to 69% and the left 40% to 59%.
The patient had no events while awaiting surgery.
The patient had two atrial and two ventricular pacing wires and two mediastinal and one left pleural chest tube.
Initially, on the first operative night, the patient was noted to have a low cardiac index and a low ejection fraction on epinephrine.
This was eventually weaned off, and he did have some ventricular ectopy.
He was also given 500 cc of crystalloid for a low cardiac index.
The patient was eventually A-paced to help with his cardiac index.
In the morning on postoperative day one, the patient was extubated without difficulty.
On postoperative day two, he had his chest tubes discontinued without incident.
His Foley catheter was removed the following day, and he was able to void without difficulty.
On postoperative day four, the patient was complaining of having multiple loose stools.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
