Admission Date:  [**2192-10-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-1-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2137-2-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ceftriaxone / Oxycodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**] Chief Complaint: Free intraperitoneal air and abdominal pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, right hemicolectomy, end ileostomy and Hartmann's pouch.
Pt initially presented on [**9-13**] with acute change in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] weakness, and was found to have bilateral thalamic, and L cerebral peduncle infarcts, transferred to the floor and discharged to rehab (see prior DC summary for details related to initial hospital course).
Pt re-admitted on [**10-14**] and found to have intra-peritoneal air and abdominal pain, was taken to the OR and found to have perforated Cecum thought to be secondary to [**Last Name (un) **] syndrome.
His post-op course was complicated by abdominal abscess.
CT abd showed large fluid collection.
He was intubated on [**10-28**] for inability to manage airway secretions and was started on zosyn.
CT abd on [**10-30**] again showed an organizing fluid collection R hepatic flex to pelvis and on [**10-31**] the collection was drained.
On [**11-20**] pt had CT abd w/ PO contrast via Dobhoff tube for re-eval of abdominal abscess/leak that was drained by a pigtail.
Overnight pt triggered for tachypnea and subsequently transferred from East to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] to the TICU.
Following intubation he suffered a cardiac arrest with pulseless VT responding to epi X3.
Pt was admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **], following transfer from TICU during which he suffered a cardiac arrest.
The pt was intubated and sedated on arrival for Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure thought to be secondary to mucous plugging.
The patient was weaned off the vent over the course of his first day and was subsequently extubated without complications.
He received multiple debridements of a sacral ulcer that had been present since his original surgery.
A wound culture from [**11-27**] grew e.coli and enterococcus and Zosyn was added to his regimen on [**11-30**].
On [**12-2**], the patient developed fevers to 100-101.
ID was consulted and Zosyn was changed to Meropenem out of concern for drug fever on [**12-3**].
The evening of [**12-5**], the patient had an episode of tachypnea to the 30s without new hypoxia or acidosis on ABG, which resolved by morning.
Later he was sent for a repeat CT Torso to evaluate for potential worsening of his abscess.
This showed a large and worsened phlegmon at the site of the previous pigtail with a new fluid collection.
Upon returning from CT, he was tachycardic to the 130s-140s (sinus) and tachypnic with worsened abdominal pain.

FUNGAL CULTURE (Final [**2192-12-25**]):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Streaky density is again demonstrated at the lung bases consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.
Non contrast Head CT [**2192-11-12**] FINDINGS: There are [**Hospital1 **]-thalamic hypodensities, and left mid brain hypodensity, consistent with the site of the patient's previous infarcts, as demonstrated on the previous examination of [**9-14**], [**2192**].
There is no evidence of acute infarct.
There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or midline shift.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Previous infarcts as described above.
Large fluid collection extending from the right hepatic flexure into the pelvis.
Bilateral sacroiliitis.
Right lower quadrant phlegmonous collection at the site of the prior pigtail catheter measuring approximately 6 cm x 8 cm x 7 cm.
There is central hypattenuation within this phlegmon, suggestive of fluid.
Bibasilar atelectasis and a trace right pleural effusion.
1.3-cm exophytic lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney, not fully characterized on this study.
Sacral decubitus ulcer which extends to the level of the underlying bone, raising concern for osteomyelitis.
Minimal decrease in size of a right lower quadrant collection.
No significant change in a collection within the pelvis.
No new collections identified.
Large sacral decubitus ulcer, directly abutting the sacrum.
Although no direct signs of osteomyelitis is seen on this study, the sacrum is at high risk for developing osteomyelitis.
Bibasilar consolidation within the visualized lungs, may reflect atelectasis.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No definite valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
In short, the patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who was discharged 3 days ago prior after a month long hospitalization for bilateral acute thalamic strokes.
He has had 3 days of abdominal pain and poor p.o.
During operation, upon entering the abdomen, it was noted that the patient had a distended perforated cecum.
It was thinned out and ischemic area on the antimesenteric wall of the cecum with his perforation in the ischemic area.
The cecum itself was large and patulous and the perforation was partially walled off with omentum against the right lateral sidewall.
There were feculent contents in the peritoneal fluid throughout the abdomen, indicating prior free perforation which had walled off.
There was no evidence of gastric or duodenal injury.
Patient tolerated the procedure and there were no complications to the operation.
[**10-24**]: CT abd: no collections, PO lasix with IV boluses, desated, likely plug ?
bronch [**10-27**]: sputum Cx with GPC in pt with hx of Hosp Acquired PNA - Vanc started, [**10-28**]: reintubated secondary to large amount of secretions which patient was unable to clear, on vancomycin, zosyn for hosptial aquired pneumonia [**10-31**]: intrabdominal fluid collection tapped by ultrasound, diuresis to continue; spontaneous breathing trial tolerated for an hour and a half [**11-1**]: successfully extubated [**11-2**]:[**Month (only) **] TF 80/hr, NaCl nebs [**11-4**]: continue aggressive diuresis, no bronch [**11-9**]: failed swallow eval, switched back to PO lasix, coumadin 10mg started for SMV thrombus [**11-12**]: therapeutic on coumadin, dose decreased to 5mg [**Date range (1) 57528**]: Tube feeds continued.
He had respiratory arrest most likely secondary to MRSA Pneumonia and mucus plug.
MICU COURSE: [**11-23**] - [**11-26**] Pt was admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **], following transfer from TICU during which he suffered a cardiac arrest.
The pt was intubated and sedated on arrival for Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure thought to be secondary to mucous plugging.
The patient was weaned off the vent over the course of his first day and was subsequently extubated without complications.
In addition the patient was also initially treated for a likely MRSA PNA given fevers and increased sputum.
CXR was without supporting evidence.
The patient had a known intrabdominal abcess for which surgery had placed a drain.
was consulted and in conjunction with surgery a plan was made to continue treating with IV Linezolid for a duration of 14 days post the plugging of the surgical drain (once it is deemed to no longer be draining adequate ammounts).
The pt was also noted to have an enterococcal UTI in the setting of Vancomycin use.
The pt has a stage III-IV sacral decub.
The patient has a hx of extremely labile sugars.
The patient had one episode of FS 30 with hypotension to the 70s, and received 4 Amps of d50.
Plastics was consulted for the patient's stage III sacral decub, who noted that the decub is extending to the sacral fascia but not to the bone, and recommended wound debridement, packing, and continuing Linezolid.
He received multiple debridements of a sacral ulcer that had been present since his original surgery.
A wound culture from [**11-27**] grew e.coli and enterococcus and Zosyn was added to his regimen on [**11-30**].
Pt was afebrile at the time, and hemodynamically stable, and abg normal with 7.42/38/85/25/0.
CXR did show possible retrocardiac infiltrate but without cough and white count aspiration PNA or HAP is unlikely.
Pt's respiratory rate came down after nebs, and humidifying face mask on fio2 50% Pt does have sleep apnea with bipap at home and maybe a possiblity.
We held off on bipap/cpap since pt still at high risk for aspiration.
Pt was continued on Coumadin for his SMV thrombosis, and it was not clear to Neuro what caused the SMV thrombosis and the thalamic strokes in the first place (on his prior admisison).
Pt's coumadin did become subthereapeutic at one point, and pt was started on Heparin to be continued until he became therapeutic again.
Concerning the patient's mental status his delirium initially when he came to the floor improved.
Once there was some improvement and pt was able to communicate Neuro was consulted, who did not believe the pt has anoxic brain injury [**3-17**] cardiac arrest.
Instead pt's delerium [**3-17**] infections and hospital setting likely bring out the cognitive defects associated with his thalamic stroke causing his decrescendo speech.
Also pt's DM was well controlled, with [**Last Name (un) **] following, and at no point did the pt become hypoglycemic, and his lantus was up-titrated.
On [**12-2**], the patient developed fevers to 100-101.
Furthermore meropenem was kept on to treat the sacral decub infection presumptively for sacral osteomyelitis.
The linezolid was continuing to treat possible MRSA and VRE.
The evening of [**12-5**], the patient had an episode of tachypnea to the 30s without new hypoxia or acidosis on ABG, which resolved by morning.
On [**12-7**] since the patient continued to have intermittent fevers the only remaining source was that the pt may have reaccumulated his intraabdominal abscess or developed a new abscess.
This showed a large and worsened phlegmon at the site of the previous pigtail with a new fluid collection.
Upon returning from CT, he was tachycardic to the 130s-140s (sinus) and tachypnic with worsened abdominal pain.
MICU course [**Date range (1) 79603**]: Upon arrival to MICU, he was tachycardic, hypotensive with drop in HCT.
CT abdomen did not reveal any new bleeding and showed fluid collection.
Sacral decubitus ulcer/Osteomyelitis: While on the floor, patient was continued on Meropenem and Linezolid for presumed osteomyelitis for a sacral decubitus ulcer that extends to bone.
He had bleeding from this ulcer which resulted in a hematocrit drop and he was transfused.
Plastic surgery also saw him at this time and sutured part of the wound that was bleeding.
They did not perform any more debridements due to risk of bleeding while on anticoagulation but recommended [**Hospital1 **] to TID wet to dry dressing changes.
His heparin drip was held for [**2-15**] days while we ensured his hematocrit remained stable and he no longer required transfusions.
Plastics was reconsulted on [**2193-1-7**] and saw the wound but did not have any further recommendations other than continuing dressing changes.
They saw patient and examined wound on day of discharge and recommended wet-to-dry dressing changes with [**Last Name (un) 79605**] x approx.
SMV thrombosis/ CVA: Heparin was initially held x 1-2 days when patient had bleed from sacral decubitus ulcer.
He did not have any further episodes of bleeding while on anticoagulation.
He will likely need lifelong anticoagulation given venous and arterial clots and should have INR followed closely on Coumadin with goal INR [**3-18**].
Regarding his double vision from CVA, neurology recommended alternating eye patches which the patient did not like wearing.
They felt his visual problems should improve with time.
Intra-abdominal abscess: For his intra-abdominal abscess (E. coli, VRE) repeat CT was obtained which did not show any new collections.
His RLQ JP drain was removed in early [**Month (only) **] and he did not subsequently spike a fever, show any signs of recurrent infection, or have any abdominal pain.
Anemia: Patient had a chronic anemia which was consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation with elevated ferritin.
He did not have any further episodes of bleeding x 2 weeks prior to discharge and hematocrit remained stable.
Hematuria/Candiduria: He had some hematuria in early [**Month (only) **] which was felt to be secondary to foley trauma and resolved after foley was removed.
Patient completed 7 day course of Diflucan for fever and candiduria (from [**12-11**] to [**12-17**]).
Peripheral lesions: On [**1-5**], patient developed black lesion on tongue and right 3rd digit which was initially tender.
It was most likely secondary to trauma from fingersticks and possible tongue biting but there was concern for septic emboli.
He did not have any signs or symptoms of infection with no fever, no elevated WBC, and no new murmurs.
ID was consulted and did not believe lesion was consistent with septic emboli.
Also, despite patient's multiple infections, he never had bacteremia or positive blood cultures.
PEG tube placement was recommended for nutrition given risks of sinusitis and infection with NGT but pt declined and preferred to keep Dobhoff NGT.
He was regularly seen by speech and swallow therapy who helped him with swallowing exercises and therapy.
