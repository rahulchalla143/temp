Admission Date:  [**2192-5-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2192-5-16**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male with lethargy and a change in mental status for the last four to five days.
He had a sore throat and a cough.
He became dehydrated and vomited.
He has had similar episodes of lethargy eight years and ten years ago.
He was thought to have transient ischemic attack.
He was brought into a neurologist at [**Location (un) 1121**] the day before yesterday, who thought that this was not a transient ischemic attack.
No complaints.
No abdominal pain.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2168**].
No malignancy.
Congestive heart failure, was admitted for congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema as well recently.
Has a history of peripheral vascular disease, no amputations.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HEENT examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
No jugular venous distention.
Lungs revealed crackles in the left lung.
Abdomen revealed bowel sounds positive, soft and nontender.
Extremities had no edema.
A head CT was done in the Emergency Department which was negative for acute bleed or mass.
A new T wave inversions in lead II; otherwise, no change in ST-T wave segments.
He was given intravenous fluids as well as Lasix for his hypercalcemia without change in calcium levels over the first two days.
Workup included a parathyroid hormone which was elevated at 299.
Before that came back, however, he was sent for a bone scan which showed no lesions.
CARDIOLOGY:  The patient had a ventricular fibrillation arrest on [**2192-5-10**], on the floor.
He was noted to be unresponsive and pulseless.
He was given intravenous magnesium, shocked at 300 joules, developed a wide complex escape rhythm, and then ventricular fibrillation, and shocked again, developing a wide complex tachycardia at 140.
Echocardiogram showed left atrium elongation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular cavity size was normal, moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, right ventricular chamber size was normal.
Mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened, mild annular calcification, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation was seen, moderate tricuspid regurgitation was seen.
No pericardial effusion.
His beta blocker was discontinued because the patient had a pause on telemetry.
The patient had atrial fibrillation after transfer from the Coronary Care Unit to the floor.
CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS:  The patient's mental status had not improved.
He was lethargic on admission and that was attributed to her hypercalcemia.
After ventricular fibrillation arrest and extubation, the patient was somnolent, gradually improving; however, still did not recognize family.
He was being medicated with Ativan for agitation rather than Haldol because of his torsade on ventricular fibrillation arrest.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had blood cultures drawn in the Coronary Care Unit which seemed to have carinii bacterium species diphtheroids in his blood on [**5-10**] from cultures drawn from two different sites.
In addition, the patient was seen to have a urinary tract infection.
Status post ventricular fibrillation arrest.
Urinary tract infection.
FOLLOWUP:  Follow up with General Surgery for removal of his parathyroid glands.
