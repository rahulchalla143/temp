Admission Date:  [**2158-7-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-8-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-12-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: All allergies / adverse drug reactions previously recorded have been deleted  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**] Chief Complaint: RUQ abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: laparoscopic cholecystectomy  History of Present Illness: 47M with long standing history of alcholism presented to [**Hospital 8641**] hospital with 3-4 days history of continuous RUQ pain.
Patient states this pain has been a long [**Last Name **] problem for several years and comes after eating or drinking too much.
The pain typically is dull and resolves after several hours, sometimes days.
He presented to the hospital last evening because the pain was constant, sharper and was associated with cramping.
Patient also reports some mild nausea but denies vomiting, change in stool, melena, hematocchezia, fevers, chills, weight loss or fatigue.
Past Medical History: PMH: Anxiety, depression, alcholism, chronic back pain  PSH: Left inguinal hernia repair 20 years ago  Social History: On disability.
ABDOMEN: Soft, no masses noted.
SKIN: No rashes or lesions.
ECG ([**7-25**]): Atrial fibrillation.
Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific diffuse low amplitude T waves with T wave inversions in leads V1-V2.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-7-25**] atrial fibrillation has been replaced by sinus rhythm.
Cholelithiasis with gallbladder distention.
Increased echogenicity of the liver compatible with diffuse fatty infiltration.
Please note that more advanced forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded.
Reversal of flow in the portal vein, splenomegaly and multiple splenic varices.
Right-sided pleural effusion.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Delayed tracer clearance secondary to hepatic dysfunction.
Portal adenopathy, splenic vein tortuosity, and anasarca consistent with liver cirrhosis.
Distended gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid, most likely secondary to third spacing and liver dysfunction rather than cholecystitis.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed due to severe hypokinesis of the distal two-thirds of the left ventricle (LVEF= 30-35 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal LV cavity size with severe hypokinesis of the distal [**1-26**] of the ventricle.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Mild, posteriorly directed, mitral regurgitation, likely due to leaflet tethering.
Moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions and signs of moderate to severe pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
[**2158-8-3**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital to the Medical Service with abdominal pain and a distended and large gallbladder.
He underwent a number of imaging studies that demonstrated a distended gallbladder with stones.
He also underwent a HIDA scan that did not demonstrate any evidence of cystic duct obstruction.
Additionally he underwent additional medical workup which revealed Hep C, cirrhosis with ascites, as well as poor cardiac function with an EF 30-35%.
He was watched for several days, but over the course of the weekend of [**2158-7-30**], he developed an increase in abdominal pain despite antibiotics.
At that point we elected to take him to the operating room for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Echo was performed which showed worsening biventricular heart failure with EF estimated between 15-35% and associted TR.
Over the course of the next days he had had increasing right heart failure, poor oxygenation requiring reintubation, atrial fibrillation requiring chemical and electrical cardioversion as well as volume overload requiring CVVH.
He remained hypotensive throughout his sicu course and he had increasing pressor support.
There was suspicion for pulmonary embolus but the patient was never stable enough to go to the CT scanner.
