Pt states that the pain began about 2 week ago.
Pt states that the onset is gradual and that the pain increases over the 5-10 minutes to a maximum of [**11-4**].
She had taken ASA at home with some relief of her symptoms and NTG at the OSH which relieved her symptoms.
The pain seems to be getting worse over the last 2 weeks.
She does state that the pain is the same as reflux symptoms that she has had in the past, though this pattern and presenation s clear more persistent and severe.
The patient notes that her chest and abdomen turn red when she is having the pain and that her blood pressure shoots up to the 190s from a baseline in the 150-160s.
She denies palpitations but does note dyspnea on exertion which has been progressive since her stroke six years ago, likely due to a significant decrease in her activity level.
EKGs at OSH unchanged from baseline but does have significant LVH with ST changed.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative except for depression and occational swelling of her right lower extremity.
Pt was having 8/10 chest pain.
EKG was inchanged from baseline and pain responded to 2 NTG's.

Vascular calcifications involve a portion of the ascending aorta as detailed above, its major branches, and the coronary arteries.
Aortic valve and mitral annular calcifications.
Small right and minimal left pleural effusion, without evidence of pulmonary edema.
Subpleural right middle lobe nodules measure up to 5 mm.
Calcified lung nodules consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
Colonic diverticulosis.
Left renal calculus.
No signal significant ICA stenosis on either side.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
She underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 62993**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed no significant stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
After obtaining a panorex of her teeth, no evidence of oral infection was noted which would contraindicate valve surgery.
She developed ST changes and hypotension and was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit for monitoring.
