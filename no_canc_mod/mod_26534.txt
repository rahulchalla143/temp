Patient reports that on the morning of admission he awoke with right flank pain, as well as pleuritic chest pain that was similar to prior PE.
Does endorse LE edema, worse on right side, with right leg pain that he has had over a year.
CTA torso showed diffuse PE.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-6-8**], the pulomonary artery pressure and tricuspid regurgitation are significantly worse.
[**11-30**] MRI [**11-30**]: Interval resolution of previously described cervical epidural collection.
The right popliteal vein is not completely compressible, suggestive of thrombosis.
Sagittal color flow images of the right popliteal vein show some flow, suggestive of nonocclusive thrombus.
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein, new compared to prior examination.

No evidence of right heart strain on EKG, but on ECHO there was elevation in right heart pressures and RV dilatation, in addition to significantly worsened TR.
LENIs showed thrombus in the popliteal vein and an IVC filter was placed.
A limited hypercoagulable work-up was initiated, and was significant for a mildly positive Beta 2 microglobulin and a high [**Doctor First Name **] titer.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was continued on heparin gtt without complication.
No sign of neurologic compromise during admission.
An MRI of C spine from [**11-30**] indicated resolution of prior epidural hematoma.

You were found to have a pulmonary embolism, which is blood clots in your lungs.
You were also found to have a blood clot in your right leg.
Your symptoms continued to improve outside of the intensive care unit.
Given difficulties in controlling your INR in the past on coumadin, you were started on Lovenox, which is an injectable blood thinner.
The cause of your blood clots is not known.
