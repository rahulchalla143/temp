Atherosclerosis in the proximal right ICA with a short segment, 90% stenosis, but preservation of flow distally.
Atherosclerosis-related, short segment, 30% stenosis in the proximal left internal carotid artery.
Likely chronic small vessel ischemic changes seen in the subcortical white matter.
Mild mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus, extensive maxillary and mandibular periodontal disease, and cervical spondylosis.
[**5-27**] CNIS: Significant right-sided plaque with an 80-99% focal internal carotid artery stenosis.
[**2183-5-30**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No evidence of aortic dissection post de-canulation.
[**6-2**] CXR: Improving bilateral opacities, which may be due to a combination of asymmetric edema and atelectasis.
Infection is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.

He was admitted one day prior to this procedure and underwent usual pre-op labs and a vascular consult.
On hospital day three he was transferred to the cardiac surgery telemetry floor and awaited his bypass surgery.
On post-op day one he required blood transfusion secondary to low HCT.
