Right ventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-1-27**] there is no diagnostic change.
Haziness at the left lung base most likely relates to overlying soft tissue and underpenetration in this area, although a very small consolidation or trace effusion cannot be entirely excluded.
There are low lung volumes.
CXR [**2199-3-14**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-13**], there is no interval change or evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
There are low lung volumes, there is no definite evidence of pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.
Imaged portion of the lungs including mid and basal areas is unremarkable.
There is no apparent evidence of pleural effusion.
CXR [**2199-3-16**]: FINDINGS: Linear atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region is unchanged since the previous study one day prior.
No newly developed areas of consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
[**2199-3-18**] Video Swallow: Minimal penetration but no gross aspiration seen with multiple consecutive straw sips of liquid consistency.
The OSH was concerned for allergic reaction/anaphylaxis though this was thought to be less likely due to absence of any skin findings.
She noted that her symptoms appeared improved while on bipap and heliox.
IP raised the question of paradoxical vocal cord movement as they visualized some abnormal movements on bronchoscopy.
As a result, ENT was consulted and a laryngoscopy was performed by ENT that noted no paradoxical movement of vocal cords, only minor edema of the posterior cricoids.
She underwent speech & swallow evaluation with video swallowing study which showed no evidence of silent aspiration.
