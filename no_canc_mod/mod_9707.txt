History of Present Illness: 55F s/p lap appy (perforated retrocecal appendix) converted to open [**3-31**] who had fever to 102 after procedure yesterday and was tachycardic, received 1 dose unasyn and then was febrile to 108 this am with altered mental status.
Pt was intubated for signs of respiratory distress and was placed on a cooling blanket and received cold gastric lavage.
CT head, chest, abd neg for acute processes.
At 8:30pm [**4-1**] pt became hypotensive to SBP <80 mmHg and Levophed started prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Past Medical History: Depression Scoliosis Ventral hernia Endometriosis Migraines Chronic anemia s/p back surgery s/p hernia repair s/p ex lap hx uveitis  Social History: lives alone, never married, works as a data programmer.
Physical Exam: VS: T 101.6 BP 123/78 HR 83 AC 500 X 14 P 10 FiO2 50% Gen: NAD, intubated, not responsive, flaccid HEENT: EOMI, PERRL (3 mm) Neck: no LAD Chest: CTAB CV: RRR nl s1 s2 no mrg appreciated Abd: soft, NT, mildly distended + BS, 5 cm horizontal incision near umbilicus, CDI with staples.
15 cm horizontal incision R abdomen CDI with staples.
Skin: no rash  Pertinent Results: CXR [**4-2**]: Mild cardiomegaly accompanied by moderate distention of the mediastinal vasculature.
Mild pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion suggest cardiac decompensation and/or volume overload.
There is no pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
TTE [**4-2**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve is not well seen (probably mildly thickened leaflets).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Complex cystic focus in the left adnexa with apparent enlargement of the left ovary.
Tuboovarian abscess is considered less likely as there is no inflammatory reaction surrounding the ovary.
No fluid collection is identified in the retrocecal space.
No acute hepatobiliary or pancreatic abnormalities identified.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Sepsis: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with sepsis syndrome from OSH, was hypotensive and with high fevers.
There was no pathogen identified, although she was treated for a presumed PNA as well as a possible GI source given the history of appendectomy at the OSH.
There was an initial concern for a Gyn source of infection, possible L [**Last Name (un) **], Gynecology was consulted, and this was found to be less likely.
Altered MS/seizures: After the sepsis was resolving, the pt was noted to have persistent coma.
She was noted at one point to have jerking movements suggestive of seizure activity, initial ECG was negative for epileptogenic activity.
In order to rule out meningitis, LP was attempted by radiology under fluoro although was unsuccessful.
She was treated for possible HSV and bacterial meningitis empirically.
The patient was started on depakote for seizure prophylaxis.
The etiology of the initial CNS insult was assessed as likely sustained when hypotensive and febrile to 108.
Over the course of the hospitalization, the patient's mental status showed minimal improvement.
She demonstrated extremely limited ability to perform movements below the neck.
She remained quadraplegic She had no gag reflex and could not breathe off of the ventilator.
Respiratory failure: The patient remained ventilator dependent during the hospital stay as noted above, .
Pancreatitis: There was an isolated elevation of pancreatic enzymes in the abscence of symptoms.
Likely demand ischemia in setting of septic shock.
# s/p appy on [**4-1**]: appreciate surgery recs, no active issues.
# Code: Full initially, but then later in the hospitialization converted to DNR/DNI.
