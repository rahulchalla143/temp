She had a long post op course and underwent tracheostomy for respiratory failure.
She was dc'd to rehab on [**11-11**] and had an asystolic arrest there.
She was transferred to Good [**Hospital 57794**] Hospital, she has been off the vent and doind well but had a HCT drop of 6 points (31-25) and underwent CT scan which showed question of endoleak and was transferred for further eval.
Past Medical History: cushings syndrome, AVR/ascending aorta [**2143**], pulmonary AVM repair [**2143**], COPD, GERD, h/o splenic lac c/b cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury, bilat adrenalectomy  Social History: unknown.
The patient is status post endovascular stenting of the thoracic aorta beginning at the level of the aortic arch and extending inferiorly to the level of T12 approximately.
Once again, surrounding hematoma is noted concentrically around the graft and not appreciably changed in size compared to the previous evaluation.
There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly.
No pericardial effusion is present.
There is bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
Few mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, none of which meet criteria for pathology by CT.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Once again, note is made of multiple hyperattenuating nodules throughout the liver.
Several low-attenuation foci are consistent in appearance with simple cysts.
A moderate-sized left pleural effusion is noted.
The kidneys, adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and abdominal portions of the large and small bowel appear grossly unremarkable and unchanged compared to the previous examination.
There is no free fluid within the abdomen.
There are no pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes.
No free fluid is present within the pelvis.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is severe S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.
T12 and L2 compression fractures are unchanged.
Findings consistent with an endoleak at the level of the graft- to-graft anastomosis in the mid thoracic cavity anteriorly.
This focal area of contrast extravasation has increased compared to the CT of [**2150-11-9**].
Left moderate subpulmonic effusion.
These findings were discussed over the telephone with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by Dr  Brief Hospital Course: She was seen by vascular surgery and underwent repeat CT scan which showed findings consistent with endoleak at the lower pole of the graft to graft anastomosis with increased area of extravasation as compared to previous CT. She was hypertensive and her medications were adjusted.
She received a nutrition consult for increased risk of malnutrition.
She awaited normalization of INR prior to undergoing angiogram on [**11-24**] which showed no endoleak.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: sinae  Discharge Diagnosis: Type II endoleak - s/p thoracoabdominal stent graft for ruptured thoracic aneurysm/dissection [**10-26**], coiling of L subclavian [**10-27**], s/p tracheal stent [**10-30**]; chronic respiratory failure - s/p Trach [**11-4**], s/p PEG [**11-30**], severe malnutrition - started on tube feeds, aspiration, s/p AVR(mech), COPD, GERD, h/o splenic lac c/b cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury, [**Location (un) 3484**], s/p asystolic arrest [**11-14**], +MRSA bacteremia and Proteus urinary tract infection - being treated with Vanco and Aztreonam  Discharge Condition: Stable.
