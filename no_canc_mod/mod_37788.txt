The patient developed chest pain one hour prior to presentation to the ED.
The LAD had minimal disease.
The LCx had minimal disease throughout with a ghost of an OM1 with late filling.
The RCA had an 80% mid-RCA lesion after a patent [**Doctor First Name 10788**] stent.
There were no focal wall motion abnormalities.
There was no mitral regurgitation.
Aortography revealed an angiographically normal ascending aorta with no evidence for dissection.
Hemodynamic assessment revealed a moderately elevated left-sided filling pressure (LVEDP 25mmHg).
The right-sided filling pressures were moderately elevated (RA mean 14mmHg, PVEDP 17mmHg).
Normal systolic ventricular function with moderate diastolic dysfunction.
Acute myocardial infarction managed by primary PCI and placement of a drug-eluting stent in the RCA.
During the procedure his BP and HR were labile and he had an episode of Afib which resolved spontaneously.
He had a 20 minute period of altered MS associated with shaking and emesis.
The stroke team was consulted and felt that it was secondary to a toxic/metabolic problem.
A CTA of his neck was also obtained b/c the pt continued to have CP post cath.
No evidence of aortic dissection or dissection extending into the neck vessels.
Patchy areas of opacity within the superior segments of both lower lobes which could be due to aspiration or early pneumonia.
CAD s/p inf MI.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 50%) with mild hypokinesis of the basal and mid inferior wall.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
He was started on Clinda for 14 days for possible aspiration pna.
No evidence of stroke.
He did not experience any symptoms of withdrawal during his stay.
The arrythemia was felt to be secondary to ischemia or EtOH abuse, he was not placed on anti-coagulation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute MI with stenting to his Right Coronary Artery Mental Status Changes HTN Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please call your primary care physician or return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other problems.
