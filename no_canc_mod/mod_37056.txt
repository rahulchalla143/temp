The patient was evidently in his usual state of health recently with the exception of a severe frontal headache, nausea and dizziness that brought him to the ED on [**7-18**].
There was no urinary incontinence.
He also presented with hypertension at that time.
He had a full workup including MRI and LP which did not show any cause for his new onset seizures.
His EEG showed only frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) and slowing at that time.
He had a CTA (presented as Code stroke) which showed a 1-2mm aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery.
He was initially placed on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] but then was changed to Lamictal 150mg [**Hospital1 **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] due to patient's complaint of daytime sleepiness, headache, neck stiffness and difficulty swallowing while on Keppra.
He had a generalized seizure while on keppra due to medication noncompliance.
He has not had any seizures on Lamictal.

Low lung volumes with streaky opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis.
Possible trace right pleural effusion.
No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Chronic right frontal sinusitis with inspissated secretions or fungal colonization.
He had no further clinical seizures, and EEG initially showed beta activity from medication effect but no epileptiform activity.
EEG improved over first 24 hours with no evidence of seizure activity.
On discussion with patient and family, it seems that he often forgets morning dose because of work schedule.
We believe the reason you had seizures was missing doses of your medication.
