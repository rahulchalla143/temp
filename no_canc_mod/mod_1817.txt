He later developed headaches and presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for evaluation.
He was taking ASA at that time, and head CT in [**12-30**] showed bilateral chronic subdural hematomas.
He did well following surgery until approximately 4 days ago when he developed left leg weakness and gait instability.
In ED a head CT revealed bilateral subacute/chronic subdural hematomas.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
R/O MASS VS BLEED.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 70 year old man with h/a REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o mass vs bleed CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
FINDINGS: There are large, extraaxial isoattenuating subdural collections bilaterally.
There is effacement of the subjacent gyri bilaterally with new 1 cm leftward shift of the septum pellucidum.
There is no hydrocephalus.
No acute fractures are identified.
IMPRESSION: Interval reaccumulation of isoattenuating bilateral subdural collections, right greater than left with accompanying effacement of the subjacent gyri and 1 cm leftward shift of the septum pellucidum.
No transtentorial herniation identified.
FINDINGS: Patient is now status post right craniotomy, and evacuation of large right subdural hematoma.
A moderate amount of high-density material is seen beneath the craniotomy site, consistent with post-surgical change.
Posterior to this, there remains a small-to-moderate amount of subdural fluid, which is slightly hypodense to brain parenchyma.
Expected pneumocephalus is seen throughout the subdural spaces bilaterally.
Approximately 7 mm of leftward subfalcine herniation is little changed from previous exam.
There is no sign of uncal herniation.
There is no definite evidence of new hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Status post evacuation of large right subdural collection through right frontal craniotomy, and smaller left subdural collection via old left frontal burr hole.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
On HD#2 he was taken to the OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evacuation of his subdural hematomas.
He was tolerating a regular diet, voiding without problems, and his pain was well controlled.
