Abdomen was nontender, positive bowel sounds, nondistended.
Extremities had no edema, bilateral pulses.
She withdrew her left leg and left arm and right foot to painful stimuli.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the intensive care unit for close neurologic observation after transfer from an outside hospital.
She had coiling done for a ruptured middle cerebral and anterio communicating artery aneurysms on [**2160-8-23**], and then was taken to the operating room for craniectomy.
Her postoperative course was complicated by pulmonary edema and adult respiratory distress syndrome, as well as the need for ventricular drain placement.
The patient grew out gram-negative rods in her blood and was on Cipro and ceftazidime for treating blood sepsis.
She also had Klebsiella in her sputum and an episode of elevated liver function tests.
She had episodes of pulmonary edema requiring Lasix.
On [**2160-8-16**] she had bursts of atrial fibrillation and flutter with narrow-complex tachycardia.
She was less arousable on [**2160-8-17**] and had a head CT that showed increased swelling.
She had a CT on [**2160-8-19**] that showed worsening bleeding and also again on [**2160-8-20**].
She continued to have problems with atrial fibrillation and flutter and was on Lopressor.
On [**2160-8-22**] she had an angiogram that showed no spasm and her CT was unchanged.

On [**2160-9-4**] the patient had PEG and tracheostomy placement without intraoperative complications.
Neurologically she opened her eyes, looked around the room, did not follow commands, grimaced to painful stimulation in the upper and lower extremities with small movement of the left lower extremity.
An ultrasound revealed a thrombus in the left subclavian and axillary veins with flow in the cephalic vein, no flow in the brachial.
Bone flap surgery actually was postponed due to positive blood cultures.
The patient was on Flagyl for anaerobes and being covered with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for antibiotic coverage.
She had gram-positive cocci in her blood, thought to be a contaminant and gram-negative rods in her blood also, but that was not considered to be a contaminant.
On [**2160-9-19**] the patient opened her eyes spontaneously and to stimuli, roving eye movements, but following staff, not following commands, no seizure activity, ventricular drain was in place.
