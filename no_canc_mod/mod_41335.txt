Event likely occurred 5 days prior to admission when he had severe pain, and he arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] chest pain free.
Echo showed likely preserved EF at >50% with no obvious wall motion abnormalities (however poor windows).
Beta blocker was also started at lower dose due to episodes of bradycardia (see below).
We also encouraged smoking cessation and dietary changes  # Bradycardia: Patient had several episodes of bradycardia with pauses lasting at longest 6.5 seconds.
Episodes possibly a complication of his inferior MI with resultant ischemia to conduction system, however more likely they are vagal in nature.
Beta blocker dose was decreased and he had no further episodes on telemetry.
# Acute diastolic congestive heart failure: LVEDP elevated at 26 in the cath lab, volume overloaded on exam.
EF found to be preserved at >50%, likely had diastolic dysfunction in setting of acute MI.
CHRONIC ISSUES: #  COPD: albuterol PRN  #  Tobacco abuse:  He was given nicotine 21mcg patch We encouraged smoking cessation  # Possible hemochromatosis: report h/o therapeutic phlebotomy.
Hct and ferritin elevated, however no sign of cardiac involvement.
