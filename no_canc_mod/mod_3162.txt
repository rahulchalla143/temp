Fluid-filled dilated loopss of small bowel in the right lower quadrant and midline pelvis with areas of fecalized small bowel concerning for partial small-bowel obstruction, of uncertain etiology.
Small right pleural effusion.
[**2181-11-7**] Cardiology ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with moderate global hypokinesis - the anterior wall and septum have the worst function.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
[**2181-11-7**] Radiology ART [**Month/Day/Year **] (REST ONLY) FINDINGS: The Doppler waveform in the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal arteries is triphasic with monophasic Doppler waveform at the level of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery.
The pressures are falsely elevated due to calcified vessels; therefore, ABI index could not be obtained.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with significant posterior tibial disease in the right lower extremity.
[**2181-11-8**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS: Removal of dialysis catheter with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Heart is mildly enlarged and is accompanied by vascular engorgement and new septal lines consistent with interstitial edema.
Small pleural effusions have increased in size in the interval.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F child psychiatrist w/ complicated PMH significant for type 1 IDDM (s/p revision renal and pancraes transplants, [**2160**] and [**2174**]), diastolic CHF (Echo 35-40%, [**7-/2181**]), recurrent MDR E coli UTIs, chronic anemia, currently on dialysis for repeated hyperkalemia, who developed fevers during dialysis and later septic shock.
CXR w/out infiltrates or opacities.
CT abdomen concerning for possible obstruction, but Pt currently completely asymptomatic.
No diarrhea, pain or discomfort.
R shin initially concerning for cellulitis, but no obvious skin breaks, and now completely painless and no longer inflamed.
Suspect line infection but site initially looked clean and uninfected.
Pt was treated w/ meropenem ([**Date range (1) 17777**]) at 500mg [**Hospital1 **] (Pt still making urine) given absence of clear source and tenuous clinical condition, but this was discontinued once sensitivities were finalized on [**11-9**] and switched to ceftazidime per HD protocol.
Pt had a replacement HD catheter placed by IR w/ no complications on [**2181-11-9**].
Pt can get CBC checks to ensure she is not having any marrow suppressive effects during treatment, at which time her antibiotic may be switched back to meropenem.
She should continue to have CBCs drawn prior HD to monitor for neutropenia while on ceftazidime.
# dyspnea: likely fluid overload from ICU course vs worsening mitral regurgitation seen on Echo.
CXR on [**11-9**] shows increased pulmonary vasculature.
Attempted diuresis w/ furosemide 80mg iv but poor response.
Pt had complete resolution of symptoms and exam findings w/ HD.
Arterogram shows poor tibial perfusion.
Pt's symptoms have completely resolved without intervention.
Pain and symptoms could have been caused by hypotension during sepsis exacerbating pre-existing poor perfusion from peripheral artery disease.
SBO: CT abdomen w/out contrast concerning for possible SBO, but Pt currently w/out any abdominal pain or nausea.
-consider CT abd w/ po contrast if clinically worsening .
# peripheral neuropathy of amputation stump: intermittently symptomatic.
# CAD/CHF: repeat echo on [**2181-11-7**] shows no vegetations, moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with moderate global hypokinesis, especially the anterior wall and septum, severe mitral regurgitation, and small ASD/stretched PFO present with left to right shunting at rest.
In comparison to echo of [**2181-10-9**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased to severe.
# Hyperglycemia: likely secondary to steroid dosing.
# Diarrhea: Patient had a few loose bowel movements.
C diff was negative and the diarrhea resolved on its own prior to discharge.
Chronic Issues: .
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Pt should continue to have CBC checks prior to HD to monitor for neutropenia while on ceftazidime (until [**11-20**]).

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Roscommon on the Parkway - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: E coli septicemia (suspected HD line infection)  Secondary: s/p pancreas and renal transplant chronic renal failure diastolic and systolic congestive heart failure severe mitral regurgitation peripheral neuropathy glaucoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for fevers and rigors during dialysis.
You were found to have a bacterial infection in your blood and were started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
You then became septic, had low blood pressure, and were transferred briefly to the ICU, where you were given fluids and started on high-dose steroids.
Your dialysis line was also pulled because it may have been the cause of your infection.
Your echocardiogram did not show any signs of endocarditis, but your prior mitral regurgitation has worsened to severe and your pulmonary hypertension is also worse.
When you first came, you developed right leg pain of unclear etiology.
This may have been due to low blood pressure from sepsis worsening your baseline poor leg perfusion from your peripheral vascular disease.
You also developed some shortness of breath, likely because you were fluid overloaded.
Your symptoms resolved after you had a new dialysis catheter placed and were dialyzed.
Although you had a potential drug reaction to a cephalosporin causing neutropenia, our infectious disease experts felt that treatment with ceftazidime was the preferred option due to your brief treatment course of 2 weeks, no need of another line, and no renal toxicity (as with gentamicin).
Your stool sample was negative for C diff infection.
