Diagnostic tap requested.
Hemostasis was then obtained, patient tolerated the procedure well without any immediate post-procedure complications.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2157-1-1**] 5:41 PM  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: assess for loculation  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 52 year old woman with cirrhosis with large ascites, tap with only 1L removed, assess for loculation REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for loculation CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: not needed  INDICATION: 52-year-old female with cirrhosis and large ascites with recent 1 liter of fluid removed via paracentesis.
Assess for loculation.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with IV contrast.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a moderate right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
Metallic clips are present within the gallbladder fossa, consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
The previously seen early enhancing lesions within the liver are not well demonstrated, given the lack of arterial phase timing.
The small bowel is filled with oral contrast with no evidence of obstruction.
There is moderate amount of ascites located primarily along the pericolic gutters and extending down into the deep pelvis.
There are no obvious septations or collection surrounded by soft tissue to suggest loculation.
There is diffuse anasarca throughout the subcutaneous tissues of the abdomen and pelvis.
There is no appreciable lymphadenopathy in the abdomen and pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
No loculation.
Majority of fluid within the pericolic gutters and extending down into the deep pelvis.
Moderate right pleural effusion.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderately elevated estimated pulmonary pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-11-3**], the estimated pulmonary pressures are moderately elevated and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2157-1-7**] 9:16 AM  US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  Reason: EVAL FOR ASCITES AND MARK THE SPOT FOR PARACENTESIS  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 52 year old woman with EtOH, Hep B cirrhosis, refractory ascites.
FINDINGS: Limited [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale imaging of the abdomen was performed to assess for underlying ascites.
Minimal amounts of fluid are seen in all four quadrants and midline pelvic view.
Subsequently, no spot was marked due to limited quantity of free fluid.
IMPRESSION: Minimal amount of abdominal ascites, unable to mark spot for paracentesis.
Brief Hospital Course: # Cirrhosis: The patient reported recent onset of jaundice and acute exacerbation of peripheral edema and abdominal ascites.
Her creatinine improved but her urine output and peripheral edema remained unchanged.
She was titrated up to albumin 25g [**Hospital1 **] followed by lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **] 30 minutes after giving albumin, and she began to respond with increased urine output, increased sodium, and decreased creatinine.
Her cipro was continued for SBP prophylaxis.
She did not tolerate the CVVH secondary to hypotension and after further family meetings she was made comfort measures only and transferred back to the medical floor for placement in an inpatient hospice setting.
In terms of pain and discomfort, morphine solution was given with good effect.
Reporting mild exertional dyspnea as well.
CXR showed vascular congestion.
She also had a mild O2 desaturation 97 to 95 with sitting up.
Her history and presentation was suggestive of hepatopulmonary syndrome.
She reported improvement with increased diuresis.
Her ekg did not show changes consistent with hyperkalemia.
# Transplant workup: To be finished during hospitalization.
Thus because the fluid issues above influenced both, we saw diuresis and then CVVH as one way to bring the patient towards the possibility of going onto the transplant list.
No vomiting, no hematemesis, no melena.
The source of the BRBPR was not clear, since she sometimes also had maroon stool; the possibility existed that some food dye or medicine could have been responsible for some of the color; however, a colonoscopy and workup for GI bleeding was secondary to trying to see if the patient might become eligible for a liver.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
