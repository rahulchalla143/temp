For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood cultures          positive for Staphylococcus aureus, yeast or other fungi.
**FINAL REPORT [**2149-8-16**]**     R/O VANCOMYCIN RESISTANT ENTEROCOCCUS (Final [**2149-8-16**]):       ENTEROCOCCUS SP..
Slightly eccentrically located small filling defect in the main portal vein suggestive  of a small chronic non-occlusive thrombus.
If confirmation or further delineation are needed clinically, CT or MR could be considered.
Adherent likely tumefactive gallbladder sludge including part of with a polypoid configuration measuring about 1.8 cm.
Moderate ascites.
[**2149-7-26**] CT Chest:  Right upper lobe nodule on chest radiograph corresponds to a right upper lobe cavitary lesion with slightly spiculated borders.
A second smaller cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe is seen.
The differential is broad and includes cavitary infection (including TB), septic emboli, necrotic tumor or metastases.
Nonspecific ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe may be infection or other foci of the same process as the cavitary lesion.
3-mm left lower lobe nodule.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
Pathology: [**2149-7-29**] Sputum Cytology: Rare atypical squamous metaplastic cells; squamous cells, pulmonary macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells and many neutrophils.
[**2149-7-31**] BAL Cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
No evidence for PE.
Increase of inflammatory changes involving the upper lobes.
Cavitary lesions in the upper lobes bilaterally.
The lesion in the right upper lobe has increased in size.
Due to the rapid change in size of the lesion, this is more consistent with an infectious process including TB.
Increased subcarinal lymphadenopathy.
Further evaluation with MRI is recommended to evaluate for features of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
No DVT in the lower extremities.
Nonspecific subcutaneous edema within the right calf.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 year old gentleman with a history of alcohol abuse, HTN and COPD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] after presenting complaining of abdominal pain/distention and found to have a sodium of 104, found to have alcoholic hepatitis and underlying alcoholic cirrhosis.
Course complicated by cavitary pneumonia and secondary peritonitis.
In light of poor prognosis and non-candidacy for transplant, patient decided to withdraw aggressive treatment and was discharged to hospice.
#Acute alcoholic hepatitis: Had 7-day prednisone course with resultant Lille score 0.84, so prednisone discontinued, especially in setting of acute infection.
# EtOH cirrhosis: No recorded history of cirrhosis but patient not followed closely by PCP in outpatient setting.
RUQ U/S showed diffuse nodularity consistent with cirrhosis.
No improvement of INR with IV vitamin K and high AST:platelet ratio, physcial exam findings consistent with long standing cirrhosis.
Not currently eligible for transplant as was actively drinking prior to this admission.
Would require longer term involvement with relapse prevention program.
Patient aware that his prognosis is grim enough that he would be unlikely to survive long enough to qualify for transplant, and felt that transplant itself would be a long challenging road.
If unable to obtain rifaximin, increase lacutlose as needed for confusion - SBP: Patient had SBP this admission, as above, discharged on cipro ppx to prevent SBP per discussion with family - Varices:  has not had EGD, no known GIB - Ascites: diuretic refractory, s/p several large volume paracenteses this admission  # Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic hypernatremia in setting of alcoholic hepatitis with new onset ascites with intake of free water in excess of sodium.
# Secondary peritonitis: Polymicrobial peritoneal infection with E. coli, enterbacter, [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**], possibly iatrogenic, as earlier paracentesis negative for SBP, vs. microperforation.
CT with contrast did not show evidence of perforation, though one CT abdomen showed small amount of free air thought to be consistent with recent paracentesis, and had resolved on subsequent CT abdomen.
Had worsening of cavitary lesions and increased sputum production following 10 day course of steroidss, and rapid evolution was concern ing for active TB, and patient was ruled out again, with pulmonology and ID following.
Also considered other causes of cavitary lung lesions including klebsiella, staph, fungal, etc, but sputum cultures were unrevealing.
- Patient treated with vancomycin and zosyn to cover pneumonia and peritonitis.
- F/u quantiferon, HIV, fungal markers pending at discharge - Discharged off of antibiotics except SBP prophylaxis as discussed above  # Septic shock: [**1-11**] SIRS criteria + lactic acidosis and elevated creatinine, hypotension with multiple potential sources, including cavitary HCAP and peritonitis as discussed below.
Had brief MICU admission for stabilization, did not require pressors or intubation.
# Hepatorenal syndrome: patient with acute kidney injury late in hospital course, low urine sodium, bland sediment and no response to albumin challenge consistent with hepatorenal syndrome type 1, possibly triggered or exacerbated by restarting of diuretics when he had stabilized from acute infections.
# Malnutrition: Severely malnourished.
#HTN: Home metoprolol was held for low blood pressures.
# COPD: Continued on spiriva # Tobacco abuse: nicotine patch  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ====================== Unlikely to affect future management, but of note: - Liver hypodensity on CT not further characterized on MRI with gado as renal function not stable, but AFP and CA [**55**]-9 were normal - Fungal markers, Tb quantiferon pending at discharge, will not need to be follow up as patient transitioned to CMO - Final cultures from peritoneal fluid were pending at time of discharge   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

You were admitted because your sodium was very low, and you had increased fluid in your abdomen due to damage to your liver caused by long-term alcohol use.
During this admission you were also found to have very serious lung and abdominal fluid infections, as well as damage to your kidneys.
You were given aggressive treatment for these problems, but did not improve significantly.
You were not a candidate for liver transplant because of your recent alcohol use, and would have to be involved in relapse recovery for a while before being considered for transplant.
