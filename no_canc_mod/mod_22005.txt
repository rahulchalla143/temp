R/o for MI and treated for community acquired pneumonia and discharged.
Had 2 episodes of angina and SOB since that admission.
Past Medical History: Coronary Artery Disease s/p LAD stent, h/o Aortic Stenosis, Diabtes Mellitus, h/o Breast Cancer s/p radiation/chemo/implants, Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Chronic pleural effusion, Diverticulitis, s/p Colonic resection [**2082**], chronic renal insufficiency, pulmonary hypertension  Social History: Lives with son and his family.
Physical Exam: VS: 82 108/48 18 97% 68.4kg Gen: NAD Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, Non-focal HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, Anicteric, nl buccosa Neck: Supple, FROM, -carotid bruit Pulm: CTAB CV: RRR -c/r/m/g Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS Ext: Warm, -edema, -varicosities  Pertinent Results: [**2106-4-6**] CXR: Compared with [**2103-3-28**], there is new diffuse haziness over the right hemithorax consistent with a moderate pleural effusion.
There is a triangular density at the right lung base, which may indicate right middle lobe collapse.
No overt CHF.
[**2106-4-7**] CNIS: There is no significant common or internal carotid stenosis bilaterally.
Longstanding, large right pleural effusion with relaxation atelectasis.
No pleural mass or other evidence of intrathoracic malignancy or infection.
Small left pleural effusion.
Widespread vascular calcifications including three major coronary arteries.
Calcific aortic stenosis.
Right breast skin thickening with retroareolar mass containing clips and calcifications.
All the findings might represent post- treatment appearance but in the absence of previous imaging including dedicated mammography recurrence cannot be excluded.
Improving small right pleural effusion without evidence for underlying mass.
Right breast skin thickening and retroareolar mass with clips and calcifications, most likely postoperative but indeterminate.
Further imaging including dedicated mammography would be necessary if there is clinical suspicion.
Widespread atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta, its major branches, and coronary arteries.
[**2106-4-15**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities in the mid and apical anterior, anteroseptal, inferoseptal walls.
There is severe apical akinesis and apical inferior and lateral walls as well.
Rest of the segments are mildly hyponetics.
There are simple atheroma in the thoraic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Note the low Cardiac output as the peak and mean gradients are 28 and 16mm of Hg only.
No inotropes given pre bypass to see the change in gradient with the increase in cardiac output due to the severe coronary lesions.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Thoracic aortic contour is preserved.
Mild improvement in the overall LV systolic function to LVEF of 30%-35%.
Mild MR. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 43404**] is seen well seated in the native aortic positiion, with no leaks and a residual mean gradient of 16mmof hg.
[**2106-4-20**] CXR: Questionable new loculated right basilar pneumothorax status post chest tube removal with either atelectasis or fluid within the fissure on the right.
Slightly increased left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis/consolidation.
On her pre-op chest x-ray there was a new diffuse haziness over the right hemithorax consistent with a moderate pleural effusion.
She also underwent chest CT which revealed a right breast skin thickening with retro areolar mass.
The thoracic and pulmonary services were [**Hospital1 4221**] for effusion drainage and a breast surgery consult was obtained secondary to new right breast findings.
Medical management was continued for several days prior to surgery and was treated for UTI with antibiotics.
On [**2106-4-15**] she was taken to the operating room where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels and aortic valve replacement with a tissue prosthesis.
As her creatinine stabilized, low dose diuretics were resumed given her peripheral edema and preoperative daily requirement of 80mg daily.
The wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] for a sacral/coccyx ulcer and recommendations were made and closely followed to protect from further skin breakdown.
