Admission Date:  [**2153-4-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2153-5-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2078-4-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old Russian speaking male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2143**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to the LAD and left circumflex in [**2152-10-21**] in [**Location (un) **] who presents with worsening and more frequent episodes of chest pain.
The patient notes daily angina at rest, as well as when exerting himself which is substernal in location without radiation.
There was no associated nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or shortness of breath.
Prior to the day of admission, the daily chest pain was responsive to 3 to 10 sublingual nitroglycerin per day, but over the last 24 hours his chest pain has been refractory to nitroglycerin and so he decided to come in.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for any orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
There were no fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
The patient denied any abdominal pain.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was afebrile and had stable vital signs.
His electrocardiogram showed no acute changes.
His chest pain was not responsive to three sublingual nitroglycerin, but it completely resolved with 2 mg of morphine.
Coronary artery disease.
The patient has had multiple cardiac catheterizations with the most recent one being done in [**Location (un) **] in [**2152-10-21**] at which time a stent was placed in the LAD and left circumflex.
That catheter showed a 20% lesion in the left main, 50% in the LAD, 50% in the left circumflex, previously placed stent which was deemed to be hemodynamically insignificant and a 75% right coronal artery lesion.
Most recent stress MIBI done in [**2151-4-22**] showed ischemia in the inferolateral region.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy 3.
Hypertension 4.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
History of pancreatitis during his admission in [**Location (un) **] for his cardiac catheterization 6.
Status post pacer placement in [**2148-12-22**] for sick sinus syndrome which was upgraded in [**2152-12-22**] for lead upgrades and generator change.
Toprol XL 25 mg po q day  ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
GENERAL:  The patient is alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress.
There was no jugular venous distention.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 51 beats per minute with normal axis and normal intervals, except for slight prolongation of the QRS at 124 milliseconds.
There were no acute ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 75-year-old male with significant coronary artery disease who is admitted for worsening chest pain.
The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction.
Initially, it was unclear whether the patient did have unstable angina or not given that his enzymes were not positive and his initial troponin was less than 0.3 despite over one day of chest pain at home unresponsive to nitroglycerin.
In addition, there was a confounding lab discovery of acute pancreatitis and it was felt that this may explain the patient's pain as well.
At that time, cardiology was consulted for cardiac catheterization given the fact that the evidence was now showing the patient was having unstable angina.
The patient was chest pain free with the above interventions, however his platelets dropped after being on the Integrilin drip for 24 hours and therefore the Integrilin had to be discontinued.
However, prior to being transported for catheter, he then developed severe [**8-30**] substernal chest pain and was rushed to catheterization emergently.
At catheterization, he was found to have 100% restenosis of his LAD stent, as well as 99% occlusion of the tube.
He also had 40% proximal in stent stenosis in the left circumflex artery as well as 50% distal occlusion in the left circumflex.
He also had 70% calcified mid RCA lesion at 60%, posterolateral RCA lesion.
However, the patient did suffer an acute anterior myocardial infarction prior to catheterization with his CK peaking at 1334.
After cardiac catheterization, the patient was scheduled to return to the general medical floor, but suffered recurrent chest pain in the recovery suite.
There were no significant changes during the re-look procedure and no additional interventions were made.
The patient was then transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring given his unstable nature and large anterior myocardial infarction.
The patient initially did well after his cardiac catheterization, however did have intermittent chest pain with no electrocardiogram changes.
However, two days after cardiac catheterization the patient was found to be unresponsive to voice, tactile or noxious stimuli.
An emergent head CT was performed (an MRI could not be performed given the patient's pacemaker as well as recent stent placement) and it showed no evidence of a bleed, but possible new stroke in the thalamic region.
His blood pressure medications were held for a period given his acute stroke, but has since been restarted at low doses.
He had an echocardiogram performed after his cardiac catheterization and acute myocardial infarction and his ejection fraction was found to be down to only 25%.
There was severe depression of overall left ventricular systolic function.
There was severe global hypokinesis with some preservation of the basal wall motion.
There was no evidence of left ventricular thrombus.
Given the patient's new depressed ejection fraction, he was started on a low dose of Lasix to prevent congestive heart failure.
NEUROLOGIC:  As already stated, the patient suffered an acute stroke on [**2153-5-2**].
Neurologic exam immediately after the event showed the patient to have no eye opening.
There was no blink to threat.
There was no facial asymmetry to grimace.
He withdrew his left leg and pulled his heel back all the way to the buttocks.
At the time of this discharge summary, the patient has improved in regards to his neurologic status.
He follows some simple commands such as sticking out his tongue or showing two fingers or wiggling his toes.
He also has frontal release signs consistent with possible underlying dementia.
PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have developed a pneumonia during the time of his stroke.
It was felt to be likely secondary to aspiration.
They did not feel comfortable placing a PEG given that the patient cannot be taken off Plavix for 30 days given his high risk for restenosis.
Coronary artery disease, status post acute myocardial infarction 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 4   Aspiration pneumonia 5.
