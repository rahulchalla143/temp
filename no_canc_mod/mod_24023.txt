Intramedullary fixation L femur shaft 2.
L 1st metatarsal percutaneous pinning 4.
Injuries noted at the scene included L scalp avulsion, Left lower extremity deformity.
Plain films showed L femoral shaft and L tib-fib fractures.
Prior to transfer, the patient became agitated and was intubated to facilitate transfer.

L SCALP AVULSION : The patient's scalp avulsion was repaired by plastic surgery at the bedside in the ICU, with vigorous debridement and washout prior to closure.
The wound dressing was changed daily with xeroform, and the patient had a short course of prophylactic antibiotics while in the hospital.
The patient was deemed to have a poor prognosis of visual function in this eye.
He was operated on by ophthomology on HD#1 during orthopedic repair of his femoral shaft fracture.
Repair of extensive orbital blow out fractures was deferred until patient is more medically stable and had decreased surrounding tissue edema, possibly as an outpatient.
However, in consultation with the plastic surgery team, this was deferred as it would likely make ORIF of his facial bone fractures more difficult.
Thoracic surgery was consulted re: the patient's pneumomediasinum, and per their reccomendations, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed, showing no airway disruption.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY FRACTURES: Orthopedics took the patient to the OR on HD#1, where he had intramedullary fixation of his L femur, debridement/washout of his L tibial fracture, and percutaneous pin fixation of his L lisfrank fracture.
Definitive operative fixation of his metatarsal fractures was deferred for this hospitalization.
An spinal MRI was performed which ruled out significant soft tissue injury to the spinal cord or surrounding structures.
L SCAPULAR FRACTURE, RIGHT CLAVICULAR/1ST RIB FRACTURE - These nonoperative injuries were managed conservatively throughout the hospital stay.
