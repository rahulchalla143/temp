Per Hematology recommendations, the patient was started on Lovenox on hospital day number five for continued anticoagulation in the setting of a deep venous thrombosis.
The patient's right lower extremity remained in a pressure dressing with progressive decrease in swelling and no further evidence of bleeding.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was continued on Kefzol for a total of three days (antibiotic day number seven) given concern for potential right lower extremity cellulitis, seeding of the existing hematoma, and/or prosthesis infection.
Given the patient's risk for bleeding, the patient underwent a noncontrast head CAT scan on hospital day number ten without evidence of bleed, mass affect, or midline shift.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was without further episodes of hypotension and was restarted on a low-dose beta blocker post non ST elevation myocardial infarction without complication.
There were no further episodes of chest pain or evidence of ischemia.
The patient's aspirin was held secondary to increased risk for bleeding.
A Cardiology consult was obtained with recommendations for outpatient echocardiogram evaluation of the patient's aortic valve given the history of aortic stenosis and elective cardiac catheterization (from the upper extremity) at a future date.
Aortic stenosis.
Deep venous thrombosis (in the setting of supratherapeutic INR).
Non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Hypoxic respiratory failure, status post intubation.
(Please note, aspirin held secondary to increased risk for bleeding.)
The patient's right lower extremity remains in a compression dressing with recommendations to maintain lower extremity elevation while at rest.
Please note, concern for infection in the patient's right lower extremity hematoma, particularly given the proximity of the total hip prosthesis.
