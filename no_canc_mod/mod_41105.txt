Admission Date:  [**2120-7-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-7-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ambien / Motrin / Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 82 yo F w/ reported CHF, CAD, and reported COPD/obstructive lung disease p/w increasing SOB & decreased exercise tolerance x's 2 weeks.
At recent checkup ([**2120-7-9**]) was noted to have crackles on exam and started on lasix 40mg.
On follow-up 2 days later, she noted symptomatic improvement but no increase in UOP, and lasix was increased to 60 mg. Home nurse noted O2 sat of 87% today at rest and 79% with exertion, with O2 sats settling persistently in the 70's at rest, which prompted the pt to come into the ED.
Of note ROS is remarkable for: stable 2 pillow orthopnea, diminished exercise tolerance (one room length), chronic productive nonbloody cough X 3 years and dysuria after completing a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin recently.
She also endorses lightheadedness on the morning of admission, hx of falls (last in [**2120-1-20**]), and increasing unsteadiness recently that she attributes to recent hip replacement.

h/o fx right elbow, s/p falls  .
Mobility: Walks with cane/RW; last fall - "slipped" [**1-27**], positive unsteady gait .
Healed midline scars X2.
Ext: trace edema bilaterally.
Sinus tachycardia.
Urine cx ([**2120-7-12**]): ====== IMAGING: [**2120-7-12**] CXR - Pulmonary edema, bilateral effusions.
Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Mild to moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the inferolateral and anterolatreral walls.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No AS, mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) AR, mild (1+) MR, mild [1+] TR .
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (LCX terrigory).
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Bilateral subpleural interstitial markings are still very prominent suggesting severe interstitial lung disease.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small and unchanged, probably related to residual prior CHF.
Incidentally, severe degenerative changes and deformity of both gleno-humeral joints are unchanged, mostly prominent on the right.
Thoracic deformity with S- shaped scoliosis is unchanged.
The pattern of pulmonary fibrosis that favors fibrotic NSIP over UIP.
Signs of cardiomegaly and pulmonary hypertension.
Extensive degeneration and destruction at the level of the shoulder joints.
F w/ CAD, CHF and reported COPD, who p/w hypoxia and leukocytosis.
The hypoxia was multifactorial, due in large part to diastolic CHF exacerbation (BNP [**2111**] on admission); with contributions from underlying severe interstitial lung disease and possible CAP given leukocytosis and infiltrate seen on admission CXR.
She ruled out for MI with Cardiac enzymes negative x 3.
An echo showed diminished systolic function EF 40% and inferior hypokinesis.
While on the floor, pulmonary was consulted to evaluate the nature of her underlying lung disease (as she was on nebulizers on admission without documentation of COPD and no hx of smoking).
A chest CT revealed extensive fibrotic lung disease consistent with either UIP or NSIP, and PFTs revealed a severe restrictive defect consistent with an interstitial lung disease.
She completed a 5 day course of azithro and ceftriaxone, and was stable on 5L O2 by NC by day of expected discharge, but was retransfered to the ICU for what appeared to be worsening hypoxia on the floor.
ARF: On admission, she had acute renal failure of 1.3 likely hypovolemic and improving to 1.1 the next day and remaining stable through diuresis throughout her course.
CAD s/p stents/acute on chronic systolic CHF (EF 40%): she was continued on ASA and Zocor and started on metoprolol.
Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC at admission, initially thought to be [**12-23**] PNA and received 7 day course of antibiotic with some decrease.
However CT scan negative for infiltrate, and leukocytosis increased prior to initiation of steroids.
Suspect may be due to possible malignancy but will defer w/up at this time given patients focus more on comfort.
Thrombocytosis: she exhibited rising platelets over her course, most likely reactive in setting of recent PNA, elevated ESR, or malignancy given lesion on liver seen on  recent CTscan.
For chronic pain in shoulders and legs, and new complaint of hyperesthesia, she was started on gabapentin and lidocaine patch with relief.
Heaptic Lesions: Two hypodense liver lesions concerning for malignancy were documented incidentally on CT [**2120-7-18**], and the patient expressed no desire to have follow up.
She had a bedside swallow eval on [**2120-7-15**], that concluded she had funcional oral and pharyngeal swallow but is at increased risk for aspiration due to impulsivity.
She agrees to any non-invasive work-up but does not want anything invasive, i.e.
** Compounded med for arthritis pain: Lidocaine 5%/Ketoprofen 15%/Dexamethasone 2%, apply [**Hospital1 **] (per pharmaacist @ [**Location (un) 1226**] Pharmacy); 1st rx was [**2120-1-20**].
Acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): for pain related to DJD.
