He presents with an episode of hematuria from a longstanding Foley which was recently removed two days prior to admission.
In addition, he had a meatal tear noted and bleeding from the laceration was noted and he was brought to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management of the hematuria.
Also of note there were blood clots surrounding the meatus and clots in the urine and they were unable to replace the Foley at that time.
On admission he also has had increasing sizes of his sacral pressure ulcers which despite topical treatment have increased in size and depth.
Also of note, he has recently completed a 10 day course of Levo/Flagyl on [**7-9**] for aspiration pneumonia.
He has a history of multiple aspiration pneumonias.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Distant history of hypertension.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Right femoral DVT in [**2187**], in [**Month (only) 956**].
ALLERGIES:  Patient is allergic to Haldol which causes extra pyramidal symptoms.
On pulmonary exam he has coarse rhonchi throughout his entire lung fields with upper and lower chest congestion.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, non distended, positive bowel sounds and no masses.
GU exam, he has traumatic hypospadias with blood surrounding the urethral meatus.
He is extremely stiff throughout and has severe contracture in his extremities.
Initial urinalysis showed that patient had specific gravity of 1.025 with positive nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase and [**2-19**] white blood cells with occasional bacteria and [**5-26**] red blood cells with large blood.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient initially was brought to the hospital given his episode of hematuria noted after removal of the Foley.
He was started on Zosyn and Vanco at this time and had a chest x-ray which showed that he had a new left lower lobe opacity.
He did not require pressors for his hypotension.
The patient then was noted to have hypoxemic respiratory failure and was intubated on [**7-11**] for this.
He had difficulty with extubation and weaning from the ventilator due to high levels of copious secretions.
Also during the MICU course he continued to spike fevers despite being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
He had sputum cultures which grew out Klebsiella which were resistant to all antibiotics tested except for Zosyn and Imipenem.
Also it was noted that he had yeast in the urine and Diflucan was started for this.
In addition, patient was seen by the GU service during his MICU admission and they recommended possible placement of a suprapubic catheter due to his decubitus ulcers, history of hypospadias and history of urethral meatal tear.
NG tube was placed and patient was fed with NG tube feedings and was also supplemented with Vitamin C and Zinc for improved wound healing.
The patient, after he was extubated, had a repeat episode of tachypnea on [**7-27**] where his respiratory rate was in the 40's and elevated heart rate.
He spiked a fever to 100.8 and chest x-ray showed repeat right lower lobe infiltrate.
Tube feeds were stopped at this point, given it was felt that he had an aspiration pneumonitis.
On the following day the patient had multiple episodes of desaturation with PCO2 to the 60's for approximately 20 minutes and noted to have extremely thick secretions upon suctioning.
Given the patient's worsening respiratory status, it was discussed with the guardian about patient's overall prognosis.
In addition, patient was started on pain medications for pain control.
Also patient's other medications such as antibiotics were stopped as it was felt that if patient were to have a septic compromise, it would be more gentler and kinder than a respiratory compromise.
The patient at this point appears comfortable, in no acute distress and previously when he had been turned he expressed signs of discomfort such as moaning, but currently feels comfortable upon position changes.
Regarding patient's pain medications, patient initially was started on IV Morphine at 2 mg per hour and appeared comfortable on this medication.
It is important that patient have a continuos pain medication so he does not have breakthrough pain.
History of multisystem atrophy.
History of multiple aspiration pneumonia.
