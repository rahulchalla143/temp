This pregnancy was complicated by dichorionic-diamniotic spontaneous twin gestation.
This pregnancy was complicated by premature preterm rupture of membranes on the day prior to delivery.
Mom had progressive labor and the infants were born by emergent C- section because of breech gestation during one of the twins.
The palate is intact and this patient has no significant dysmorphic features noted.
The heart exam was normal S1, S2 with no murmur appreciated.
The abdomen exam is consistent with a nondistended, nontender abdomen with no masses palpable.
The GU exam is consistent with bilateral palpable testicles and bilateral hydroceles.
This patient does have approximately 1.5 cm linear scars located at the proximal portion of the inguinal canals bilaterally.
These scars are covered with Steri-Strips and appear pink and well perfused with no significant erythema or pus.
The hip exam reveals no clicks or clunks.
There is no sacral pits or tuft noted.
The infant does attempt to lift his head on ventral suspension.
This patient did receive surfactant x2 for surfactant deficiency.
This patient also had a presumed pulmonary hemorrhage due to bloody secretions that were obtained from the endotracheal tube on day of life [**6-9**].
The patient had no significant hemodynamic compromise from these secretions.
This patient did have a right-sided pneumothorax that was noted in the 1st week of life and a chest tube was placed.
This patient also had apnea of prematurity and was placed on caffeine.
The patient had no significant apnea or bradycardia events for at least five days prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular: This patient did have a patent ductus arteriosus and was treated with indomethacin for 2 courses.
The most recent echocardiogram on [**1-28**] revealed no patent ductus arteriosus, a PFO and a left-sided peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
This patient will be discharged home on 20 calories per ounce Enfamil AR or breast milk.
Gastroenterology: It was noted in the last month of this hospitalization that this patient had spitting and associated apneic events related to these spit-ups.
Due to these clinical findings a clinical diagnosis of reflux was made.
It is not clear if this patient had bloody spit-up related to problems with mom's breast milk or if the patient had true esophagitis.
There have been no additional episodes of blood streaked emesis.
GU: This patient did have bilateral hernias noted in the last 2-3 weeks prior to discharge.
This patient did have some apnea events after the anesthesia, but remained stable for approximately a week prior to discharge.
The incision sites looked goog prior to discharge.
Of note, this patient does have bilateral hydroceles in addition to the bilateral hernias.
Ampicillin and gentamicin were started due to concerns for sepsis related to mom's premature rupture of membranes and delivery.
A lumbar puncture revealed increased white blood cell count and left shift and for a 14-day course.
On day of life 48 which was equal to [**2182-3-6**] the patient had a cluster of apnea and bradycardia events.
A followup blood culture on [**3-7**], as well as lumbar puncture revealed no group B Strep.
Breast milk was cultured as a possibility for the etiology of the group B Strep and revealed mixed flora, but no significant group B Strep.
It was thought that this patient's group B Strep bacteremia was due to a late onset sepsis.
This patient received no FFP for coagulopathy.
This patient had anemia of prematurity and was treated during the hospitalization with iron and vitamin E. The most recent hematocrit performed prior to discharge on [**4-4**] was 30.4 with a reticulocyte count of 2.2%.
Neurology: This patient had several head ultrasounds to screen bleeding related to prematurity.
A head ultrasound on [**1-22**] revealed a right germinal matrix hemorrhage.
A head ultrasound on [**2182-1-29**] revealed a right germinal matrix hemorrhage and slightly increased ventricular sizes.
The most recent head ultrasound was performed on [**2182-4-17**] and was normal with no evidence of periventricular leukomalacia or germinal matrix hemorrhages.
The patient also had ophthalmology screening for retinopathy of prematurity.
The social worker identified no significant psychosocial problems with this family.
It is recommended that this patient take at least 2-3 bottles a day of breast milk to prevent constipation that may be caused by Enfamil AR.
This patient had initial abnormal newborn screens with low T4 levels on [**1-22**] and [**2182-1-31**].
Chronic lung disease.
Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of a child's life immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers.
Ophthalmology is recommended at 2 weeks after discharge     to screen for retinopathy of prematurity.
One-month followup with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for     postoperative evaluation of bilateral hernia repair.
Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved 4.
Chronic lung disease 7.
Patent ductus arteriosus, status post indomethacin      treatment, resolved 11.
Bilateral inguinal hernias status post repair 12.
Anemia of prematurity 13.
Retinopathy of prematurity 14.
