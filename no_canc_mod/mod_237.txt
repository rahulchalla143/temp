Admission Date:  [**2134-12-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-1-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2069-2-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Service  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old man with a two week history of increasing shortness of breath admitted to the [**Hospital6 2910**] on [**12-6**] where he ruled in for an myocardial infarction.
The patient with known cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology with known coronary artery disease by MIBI echocardiogram, scheduled for an elective catheterization but had increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion, therefore admitted prior to his cardiac catheterization and ruled in for non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
The patient was in congestive heart failure at the time.
He was started on Dobutamine with relief of symptoms and was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for coronary artery bypass grafting.
He has a history of syncopal episodes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, elevated lipids.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for penile prosthesis and L4-5 fusion.
In general this is a very pleasant man in no acute distress with no chest pain at the present time.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, anicteric, not injected, no jugulovenous distension, no bruits, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular, tachycardiac, normal rhythm, III/VI systolic ejection murmur.
No clubbing or cyanosis.
The patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting +/- aortic valve replacement.
The patient had coronary artery bypass grafting times two with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 as well as an aortic valve replacement with a #23 Mosaic valve.
In the postoperative period the patient was noted to have frequent premature ventricular contractions and for that reason he was weaned from his Dobutamine and started on Milrinone.
The Renal Service was consulted at that time, and it was felt that the patient was suffering from acute renal failure from acute tubular necrosis.
It was also noted that the patient had a distended and tympanitic abdomen with right upper quadrant discomfort.
An nasogastric tube was placed and his abdomen was decompressed without further complications.
He was kept in the Intensive Care Unit to allow the resolution of his acute renal failure as well as his ileus.
His acute renal failure was stabilized with a creatinine maintaining a steady 2.3.
However, it was noted over the several day period, that the patient was persistently hypertensive with a rise in his creatinine related to that hypertension.
The patient was noted to have urinary retention and with the discontinuation of the above-noted cardiac medications, the patient's systolic blood pressure improved from the 80s into the 100 to 110 range.
His discharge physical examination showed vital signs of temperature 97.4, heartrate 94, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 121/63, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
The sternum is stable, incision with Steri-Strips open to air, clean and dry.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities were warm and well perfused with 2+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting times two with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.
Aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement with #23 Mosaic valve.
Diabetes mellitus.
Elevated lipids.
