Admission Date:  [**2177-2-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-2-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-2-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: hyoxia and NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: failed central line placement  History of Present Illness: Transfer from [**Hospital3 4107**].
On arrival to the ICU EKG showed dynamic TWI inversions, stable ST depressions, prominent R waves in precordial leads, ?
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: 1)Type 2 Diabetes 2)Peripheral vascular disease: s/p left common femoral to below-knee popliteal artery bypass with in situ saphenous vein and an open transluminal angioplasty of the anterior tibial and below knee popliteal arteries in [**5-12**].
3)Hypertension 4)Hyperlipidemia 5)Hx of R breast ca s/p lumpectomy 6)Depression  Social History: Lives alone.
No JVP HR: II/VI SEM heard best at the apex.
Resp: CTA-B, no wheeze, no rales, ext: cool bilateral lower extremities, no edema no femoral bruit bilaterally.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Inferior and inferolateral akinesis consistent with prior infarction.
The posterior leaflet of the mitral valve is tethered with consequent assymetric coaptation of the mitral leaflets and at least moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, directed posteriorly.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CXR ([**2177-2-13**]) - IMPRESSION: Increased perivascular haze in lung upper zones and left side, possibly beginning pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o woman with hx alzheimers transfered with dynamic EKG changes/mild troponin leak equivocal for NSTEMI with decision for medical management.
#Coronaries: Acute CHF at OSH in setting of CP/troponin leak.
Echo showed tethered MV, overall more consistent with chronic MR. Troponin peak likely secondary to CHF, versus poor clearance in the setting of renal failure.
Tethered mitral valve, may be chronic MR. Dopamine initially given for increased CO with concommittent cardiac output augmentation however she became tachycardic and her blood pressyures were much improved, and so the dopamine was discontinued and her home ACE restarted.
# Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.3.
#Leukocytosis: She was afebrile and there was no evidence of infection.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Troponin leak Hypotension Acute renal failure  Secondary - Type II Diabetes Hyperlipidemia Depression   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Mental Status: Confused - always   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for a procedure to evaluate your heart.
Your doctors should follow your creatinine (measure of renal function) and restart your metformin if this improves.
