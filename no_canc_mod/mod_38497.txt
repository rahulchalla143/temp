At that time she was complaining of left hip pain and was noted to have bruising over her surgical incision site.
Since that time she has been complaining of worsening left hip pain despite treatment with vicodin.
On my interview she reports that since her fall she has been having worsening left hip pain as well as back pain.
The back pain is diffuse and not well localized.
She does endorse mild pain with movement of her neck but no photophobia or headaches.
She also endorses pain with deep inspiration.
She denies fevers but endorses chills.
She denies cough or congestion.
She has chest pain only with deep inspiration and no frank shortness of breath.
She does have chronic constipation.
She has mild diffuse abdominal pain.
She denies dysuria or hematuria.
She endorses mild decreased urine output.
No bowel or bladder incontinence.
She has chronic left leg weakness which she does not think is worse than her baseline.
She has mild numbness in her left foot which is also unchanged.
EKG showed normal sinys rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, diffuse TW flattening, no priors for comparison.
She had a CXR which showed no focal infiltrates.
Her labs were notable for a leukocytosis with left shift and bandemia, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia and anemia.
On the floor she continues to complain of left hip pain and diffuse back pain and pleuritic chest pain.
She is very difficult to engage and cries throughout the interview and asks for pain medications.

L trochanteric bursa notable for TTP, light pink area of blanching erythema and edema extending from trochanteric bursa extending towards L glutteal muscle.
R hip w/ no erythema or fullness.
She has no [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions or Osler nodes.
Back: Tenderness to palptation over entire spine and paraspinal muscles.
Does have mild tenderness when moving neck but is able to move in all directions with full range of motion Neurologic: CN II-XII tested and intact, strength 5/5 in upper extremities, [**5-16**] in right lower extremity, [**4-16**] in left lower extremity but limited due to pain.
L upper extremity with limited range of motion due to pain, unable to lift shoulder above 90 degrees on active motion, and passive motion limited due to pain.
No saddle anesthesia.
MSSA bacteremia:  was complicated by abscesses at T1-T2, L3-L4, septic left hip and septic left knee.
[**2175-11-6**] e. Washout, left hip, with revision of acetabular component.
She was also started on IV nafcillin, however she developed persistent fevers, rash across her sternum and renal failure which raised concern for AIN.
Surveillance cultures were drawn following initiation of antibiotics and these were negative; she was also afebrile after the above procedures were complete.
Acute renal failure:  Likely secondary to AIN following initation of nafcillin.
Creatinine rose from baseline near 1 to 1.9 with development of fever and rash across sternum 10 days after initiation of nafcillin.
Differential includes ATN secondary to hypotension perioperatively.
Received fluids perioperatively and has led to volume overload grossly (especially noted in upper extremities, lower extremities, abdomen).
She did not have any difficulty with pulmonary edema during the hospitalization and saturated well on room air.
Chest x-ray did not show any evidence of volume overload.
Anemia:  HCT has been relatively stable but occasionally dropped and was thought to be secondary to hematoma along left hip s/p left hip washout.
She remained guiaic negative.
Other contributing factors included blood loss perioperatively, bome marrow suppression in setting of sepsis, and anemia of chronic disease.
Around time of discharge, her hematoma appeared to be stable and she was hemodynamically stable.
They felt that she occasionally felt depressed secondary to her prolonged hospitalization and that her drinking was likely related to masking underlying symptoms of depression.
Psychiatry was consulted just prior to discharge for OBRA form and during assessment they felt that she was not depressed and had likely underlying alcohol abuse as well as an element of cognitive impairment secondary to frontal disinhibition leading to her tearfulness and emotional lability.
Likely secondary to underlying liver disease from history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse.

Left flank hematoma s/p left hip washout, stable 6.
Depression 8.

Hyponatremia   Discharge Condition: Stable for rehab, saturating well at room air.
While you were here, we found that you had a serious infection caused by a bacteria called Staph aureus.
This bacteria infected several places in your body including parts of your spine (your thoracic/lumbar spine), your left hip, and your left knee.
Following these measures, your kidneys were slightly injured which we thought could be because of your antibiotics.
While you were here, you also developed a lot of swelling because you had a lot of fluid given to you around the time of your surgeries.
As a result of one of your left hip surgery, you developed a large area of bleeding around your left hip that we call a hematoma.
(5) Simethicone - You can take this as needed for the pain that you have from gas.
(7) You can take bisacodyl as necessary for constipation, as this was a frequent problem during your hospitalization.
(9) Aspirin - You should take 81 mg instead of 325 mg because of your history of bleeding - high dose aspirin can make it worse.
(2) Aspirin 325 mg: we changed this to 81 mg daily because we wanted to lower your bleeding risk since you had a hematoma.
(3) We stopped your ibuprofen because your kidneys have been slightly injured during your hospital stay: you should not continue this medicine while your kidneys recover.
Please follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2175-12-28**] at 1120 AM, who is an orthopedic doctor, regarding your left hip.
