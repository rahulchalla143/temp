Four days after admission on [**2196-8-9**], he developed BRBPR and hematemesis with hypotension SBP 70s.
Emergent EGD revealed acute bleed from grade 2 varix which was banded and severe esophagitis.
Cx were negative but he was noted to have bilateral airspace disease on CXR so was treated for VAP with Vanco cefepime currently Day [**5-10**].
Ongoing hypoxia with 3-4L O2 requirement was felt to be due to resolving infection as well as volume overlaod so he was diuresed with IV Lasix, recently 40mg IV BID.
Hyponatremia resolved with Na 139 at time of transfer.
On the floor, the pt is comfortable and in no acute distress.
He complains of abdominal fullness and discomfort, like he "needs a tap", and feels as if this has affected his breathing.
He reports cough productive of white phlegm and SOB which he feels is secondary to abdomen.
He denies current fever or chills and denies change in baseline tremor.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Single, never married, no children.
No h/o IVDU or intranasal cocaine.
Family History: - mother died at age of 70 due to complications from a fractured hip; she had osteoporosis and hypertension.
- no history of liver disease or liver cancer in his family.

The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
This is most consistent with transpulmonary shunting, although with several early bubbles, a concurrent PFO cannot be excluded.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small effusions.
Lung volumes remain very low, but the clearing of opacification at the left lung base suggest that this was largely atelectasis.
Mild interstitial abnormality and plate-like scarring in the right lung are unchanged.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
[**8-23**] EGD- Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction.
Granularity, erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
[**8-24**] Colonoscopy- Angioectasia in the sigmoid colon.
Non-bleeding rectal varices were noted.
No significant lesions were identified, although a small polyp could not be excluded at the hepatic flexure due to the presence of stool.
Discharge Labs: [**8-26**]: WBC 7.2 Hgb 9.6* Hct 27.9* MCV 101* Plt 115 [**8-26**]: Gluc 158* BUN 42* Crt 1.4* Na 135 K 4.4 Cl 105 HCO3 20* [**8-26**]: ALT 23 AST 46* AKP 157* TB 1.6*  Brief Hospital Course: 51yo man with EtOH cirrhosis c/b refractory ascites s/p his 3rd episode of variceal bleed and banding who presents from outside hospital with resolving pneumonia, ongoing hypoxia .
#Hypoxia: Patient presented from outside hospital with oxygen requirement s/p treatment for a pneumonia.
His persistent hypoxia was attributed to the resolving treated pneumonia, transpulmonary shunting (TTE on [**8-16**] consistent with this), likely smoking related parenchymal lung disease, deconditioning with poor clearance of upper airway secretions and restriction from large volume ascites.
Patient was treated with aggressive pulmonary toilet (chest physical therapy, incentive spirometry), frequent nebulizer treatments and large volume paracenteses (3 L on [**8-17**] L on [**8-19**] L on [**8-23**] L on [**8-26**]) with marked improvement.
# Alcoholic cirrhosis: Patient with history of alcoholic cirrhosis c/b refractory ascites (typically gets taps every two weeks) and variceal bleeds x3, now s/p banding in OSH.
Patient underwent EGD to assess his variceal status after banding which showed an ulcer in the GE junction and 3 cords of grade I bands in the lower third of the esophagus.
He had some encephelopathy during his ICU admission, but this resolved shortly after his transfer to the floor with aggressive lactulose treatment.
He underwent diagnostic paracentesis in the MICU (negative for SBP) and several therapeutic paracenteses ([**8-17**]- 3L, [**8-19**] 10L, [**8-23**] 3L, [**8-26**] 4L) which were also negative for SBP.
As part of his transplant evaluation patient underwent echocardiogram w/ bubble study which showed transpulmonary shunting with supine room air ABG pO2 57, though the patient had no orthodeoxia.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that there was no need for further pre-transplant workup- should the patient develop cardiac symptoms they recommended possible CTA of the coronaries.
Patient also underwent colonoscopy which showed angioectasia in the sigmoid colon and non-bleeding rectal varices.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Patient's creatinine was elevated around 1.3 (and as high as 1.5) during this admission from baseline 0.8-0.9.
This was attributed to poor volume status due to bleeding and diuresis in the OSH.
Other contributing factors may be increased intra-abdominal pressure secondary to ascites vs. hepatorenal syndrome.
Would recommend further evaluation and consideration of treatment for hepatorenal syndrome.
# Anemia - Patient's anemia was likely multifactorial and related to acute bleed and cirrhosis.
Received 2 units transfusion in the MICU without active bleeding throughout his [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization.
#Hyponatremia: History of hyponatremia to 120 at admission to OSH.
This was attributed to the hemodynamics of his cirrhosis and recurrent ascites.
# Hyperglycemia- Patient became hyperglycemic (sugars in the 160s -180s) with tube feeds.
We recommend that this be followed up in the outpatient setting and patient evaluated further for diabetes and oral anti-hyperglycemics considered.
