The patient was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic and was difficult to ventilate by bagging.
The patient's tracheostomy was found to be very positional and on [**2117-2-2**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy to evaluate the position of the tracheostomy tube.
The procedure was done under general endotracheal anesthesia without complications.
The patient continued to be intermittently hypertensive throughout the remainder of her hospital stay.
The patient would become agitated and hypertensive and be required to go back to pressure support ventilation.
It was felt that the etiology of the patient's hypertension and apparent respiratory distress were likely anxiety related as the patient's arterial blood gases and oxygen saturations all appeared to be within good limits.
The patient's hypertension continued to be difficult to control and on [**2117-2-7**], the patient was placed on Hydralazine 10 mg p.o., four times a day with p.r.n.
intravenous dosing to control her systolic blood pressure.
In order to further work-up the patient's hypertension, urinary catecholamines were sent on [**2117-2-7**] and results of that collection are pending.
On [**2117-2-6**], the patient was noted to have a small amount of bright red blood suctioned from her tracheostomy site of approximately 30 cc.
Again, on [**2117-2-7**], the patient was suctioned with a small amount, approximately 10 cc., of bright red blood per tracheostomy.
It is felt that the bleeding is likely related to the tracheostomy site and not bleeding from any more distal site within her bronchial tree.
The patient, therefore, had a PEG tube placed by Interventional Radiology on [**2117-2-4**], without complications.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Anxiety disorder.
Severe systolic hypertension.
