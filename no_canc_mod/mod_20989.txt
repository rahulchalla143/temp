At this time, there is no evidence of subfalcine herniation.
There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with brain atrophy.
IMPRESSION: Focal 17 x 35 mm parenchymal hemorrhage in left basal ganglia.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT4/22/05: The area of parenchymal hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia is not significantly changed, allowing for differences in technique, currently measuring 14 x 36 mm.
There is no new intraventricular extension or subfalcine herniation.
Given his histroy of [**10-10**] beers daily, he was started on htiamine and folate supplements and ativan was ordered as needed for signs or symptoms of EtOH withdrawl which never manifested.
He had a repeat CT head which showed stable appearance of the hemorrhage and therefore was transferred to the floor service where he was evaluated by PT/OT/ST.
