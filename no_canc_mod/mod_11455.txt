ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname 41672**] is an 83-year- old woman, with a history of congestive heart failure, who was found to have aortic stenosis during her cardiac work-up, for which she was scheduled to have elective repair.
She had had multiple admissions to the hospital for exacerbations of her congestive heart failure.
She also notably had increasing episodes of angina, and on her cardiac catheterization was found to have 60% disease of her right coronary, 30% disease of the diagonal, and 80% to the PDA, with an ejection fraction of 60%.
Given her constellation of symptoms and her multiple exacerbations, she was admitted to the hospital for elective repair.
She was in no acute distress.
There was no significant JVD.
She had a III/VI systolic ejection murmur throughout the precordium.
She had no edema in the lower extremities.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2189-2-18**], and on that same day underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm CE tissue valve, and also coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch of the right coronary artery.
She had no    episodes of confusion or agitation, and had adequate pain    control with a combination of narcotic medications in the    initial postoperative period, followed by Tylenol and    ibuprofen as needed.
She did    well initially post extubation on postoperative day 1, but    by postoperative day 4, she began to have worsening oxygen    saturation with increased work of breathing, and was found    to be in mild respiratory acidosis with hypercarbia.
showed bilateral pleural effusions with some    evidence of CHF.
Her pleural effusions    were drained via insertion of pigtail catheters.
The remainder of her hospitalization was notable for significant output from the right and left chest tubes of 500 cc to 1,000 cc per day.
Analysis of this fluid revealed it to be a transudate without any evidence of an infective process.
The drainage catheters were left in place for 2 weeks, but at that time there was only about 100 cc to 200 cc of fluid draining from these catheters and; therefore, it was determined that they should be removed.
She did not require reintubation postoperatively, and her respiratory acidosis did improve.
The pulmonology critical care service was consulted for assessment of these effusions, and they felt that these were likely secondary to her congestive heart failure.
They felt that there was no evidence of amiodarone toxicity contributing to her pulmonary status.
She did have some decreased breath sounds at the bases with the presence of mild bilateral pleural effusions which had been stable on serial chest imaging.
To note, there was some question as to whether these effusions may have been secondary to nonspecified postcardiotomy syndrome.
She had been in atrial fibrillation in the past    but, in fact, remained in sinus rhythm throughout the    course of her hospitalization.
There was a question as to    whether her pleural effusions were secondary to congestive    heart failure from a problem with her aortic valve, for    which she underwent repeat echocardiography.
Her aortic valve had a    prosthetic which was seated in good position, but had    somewhat of an increased gradient present.
It was not felt that the valve was responsible for    her recurrent pleural effusions.
We added calcium channel blockers for some    time after consultation with congestive heart failure    service, but prior to her discharge it was felt that the    combination of beta blockade and ACE inhibitor alone would    be adequate for her control, along with diuretics.
She    never had any evidence of postoperative cardiac ischemia,    and her bypass graft seemed to be functioning well.
Her Coumadin was not restarted, as she had remained in sinus rhythm, and otherwise not reverted to atrial fibrillation, and also due to the fact that there was concern that there might be some risk of instability while walking, or falls while on anticoagulation.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The patient was, as    noted, significantly volume overloaded in the initial    postoperative period.
She remained mildly volume overloaded    throughout the course of her hospitalization, for which    she was diuresed on and off, depending upon her renal    function.
She    never became anuric and, as noted, her creatinine had    normalized prior to discharge, and she was making adequate    volumes of urine.
HEMATOLOGIC: The patient did require multiple blood    transfusions for her blood loss anemia in the immediate    postoperative period.
She    had no neurologic deficit, and otherwise no lacerations,    or subsequent consequence of the fall, but given the fact    that she may be at risk for this again, it was felt that    the risks of anticoagulation outweighed the benefits.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: During her hospitalization, the    patient had a urinary tract infection  for which she was    treated with Bactrim and levofloxacin.
She otherwise had    no other infectious complications.
As noted, the patient's overall hospitalization was focused around management of her congestive heart failure and pleural effusions.
She was afebrile with a pulse in the 70s, systolic blood pressure of 115, with an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air.
She otherwise had 1+ edema in her lower extremities.
Her chest x-ray was remarkable for bilateral pleural effusions with some atelectasis, and her EKG was in sinus rhythm.
