Brief Hospital Course:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68F with history of diverticulosis, internal hemorrhoids who is being transferred here for BRBPR.
She was seen by GI who decided that no active intervention was needed at the time, as the patient was not bleeding.
Recent history of bleed led to brief ICU stay for monitoring while heparin started for DVT (see below).
By the end of the hospitalization, the patient was having normal bowel movements, without any evidence of bright red blood; her stools were also occult blood negative.
# RLE DVT: The patient was found to have new RLE DVT.
Decision was made for initiation of anticoagulation as there were several factors favoring possible/likely progression of her distal DVT, including multiple veins involved, ongoing immobility, recent horomone therapy.
Given the need for anticoagulation in the setting of recent GI bleed, it was decided that the patient be transferred to the MICU for treatment of DVT with heparin drip for close observation in the event of possible repeat bleeding, however, the GI team (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3315**] felt that the chance of repeat bleeding was very low.
# HTN:  The patient's home metoprolol was initially held given concern for masking physiologic tachycardia in the seting of acute bleeding.
# Allergic rhinitis:  The patient was continued on her home Flonase.
# Chronic LBP: The patient's home exalgo was converted to its morphine equivalent and she was continued on 30 mg MS contin daily while in house.
# menopausal symptoms:  The patient was taking hormone replacement therapy (Prempro) for symptomatic hot flashes.
Because of her development of RLE DVT, she was instructed to stop all hormonal therapy, as it can increase her risk of clotting.
