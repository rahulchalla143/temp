with who presents feeling weak today after eye doctor's appointment.
She states that he sleeps often and had a congested cough the last few nights for which she gave cough suppressant, but otherwise he has been doing well.
Of note, he was recently discharged to [**Location (un) 620**] in [**2104-1-1**] for acute on chronic renal failure and bradycardia, and the discharge summary and discharge medication list recommended stopping digoxin.
EKG showed bradycardia at 28, V paced.
Pacer was found to not be functioning d/t dead battery, and he was paced externally initially and then a transvenous pacer was placed successfully by the EP fellow.
Prior to this placement however, he became more agitated and somnolent, and per nursing notes became more hypoxic (no O2 sat recorded) and was placed on NRB.
Also recieved digibind in the emergency room for mildly elevated digoxin level.
On review of symptoms per wife, no prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
No recent fevers, chills or rigors.
No dysuria, abdominal pain, or other symptoms.
Cardiac review of systems per wife is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

No femoral bruits.
Skin: Ecchymosis on LE, scattered, no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No acute ST changes.
ECHO [**2104-1-29**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation  is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
CT head [**2104-3-11**]: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Decrease in the moderate right pleural effusion.
New small left pleural effusion.
with bradycardia s/p pacer, CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM, CRI who presented [**3-11**] with weakness and found to have bradycardia to 28 now s/p pacer adjustment and generator change.
This bradycardia +/- digoxin toxicty this was likely the cause of his weakness/lethargy.
It peaked at 2.7, perhaps contribution from ARF and was given digibind in ED given sx's.
# Pump: Pt did have a recent ECHO with normal EF.
He was extubated the following morning, but continued to have an oxygen requirement.
Since pt had 1+ peripheral edema and mild pulmonary edema on CXR it was thought pt was in mild acute diastolic heart failure.
Pt will likely not need long-term diuretic but should s/s of volume overload appear should be considered.
[**Last Name (un) **] was held given mild acute on chronic renal failure, but restarted upon discharge.
# CAD s/p CABG Pt had no signs or symptoms of ischemia.
[**Last Name (un) **] was held given mild acute on chronic renal failure, but restarted upon discharge.
# HTN Pt was hypertensive off home BP meds to 200s, and was covered with hydral before BB and CCB restarted.
[**Last Name (un) **] was held given mild acute on chronic renal failure, but restarted upon discharge.
# Acute on chronic renal failure, baseline creat 1.8-2.0 Creat peaked at 2.2.
Pt likely has chronic renal disease from HTN and DM and had an acute worsening likely d/t dehydration in setting of poor PO intake (sleeping more, more somnolent).
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Not on ASA or coumadin at home.
Given risks/benefits was determined to need at least ASA 325 for stroke prevention.
- HISS - Held glipizide while NPO, restarted upon d/c .
# FEN: Followed lytes and repleted .
# Prophylaxis: PPI, bowel meds, SQ heparin .
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis # Pacer malfunction (at end of batter life) s/p pacer [**2085**]'s in [**State 108**] # Digoxin toxicity (bradycardia) # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (nl EF) # Diastolic heart failure # DM - poorly controlled # HTN # CRI - Cr 1.8-2.0 # CAD s/p CABG [**2085**]'s .
The following changes to your medications were done: - please stop taking digoxin as there is no indication to be taking this drug and it has now likely caused you to be hospitalized twice - please start taking aspirin 325mg daily to protect you from another heart attack and to decrease the risk of a stroke which you are at increased risk for with atrial fibrillation.
- please continue taking antibiotics for another 2 days to prevent an infection of the ICD (levofloxacin) - please continue to take your other medications as before .
