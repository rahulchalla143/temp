HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 25 year old female with a complex past medical history with short gut syndrome requiring chronic venous access for total parenteral alimentation and subsequent numerous line infections.
The decision was made to change to a right internal jugular line and discontinue the patient's old left femoral line secondary to increased risk of infection.
In the past the patient has had numerous line infections with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Serratia, Klebsiella and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and it was thought that keeping a left femoral line in place would increase the risk of infection greatly.
Over the last few days the patient admits to increased fatigue and somnolence and lowgrade temperatures, but denies high fevers, rigors, purulence, erythema, or tenderness to the left femoral site.
Interventional Radiology performed a high right internal jugular stick and started TPA infusion with the hope of lysing the thrombus and a re-attempt of placing a working right internal jugular on [**2159-5-9**] and subsequent removal of the patient's indwelling left femoral line.
Gastrointestinal dysmotility beginning at age 13, diagnosed with gastrointestinal motility study, status post colectomy status post secondary to gastrointestinal vasculitis which has resulted in short cut syndrome and the need for chronic total parenteral nutrition.
The patient is wheelchair bound secondary to neuropathic vasculitis.
Chronic pain syndrome in the lower half of the body maintained on chronic Dilaudid PCA at home with large doses of Benadryl.
Recurrent line infections, [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Serratia, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus epidermidis on the past secondary to line infections.
Chronic venous access managed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at Interventional Radiology, status post multiple central line placements and status post numerous recannulation attempts, most recent the patient had a femoral line placed on [**2159-4-3**].
Anemia of chronic disease.
Eosinophilia and leukopenia.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, mucous membranes moist, right internal jugular line in place.
Cardiac examination, tachycardiac, rate normal, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremities, left femoral line in place, no purulence, erythema or tenderness with palpation.
The morning of [**5-9**], the patient was taken to Interventional Radiology where they found that the thrombus was only minimally lysed and it was decided to give the patient a further day of total parenteral alimentation.
The patient remained stable on the floor and had further infusion of total parenteral alimentation with no laboratory abnormalities.
The plan at that time was to bring the patient back in two to three weeks at which time they would try once again to obtain more stable and a cleaner site for central venous access for the patient's total parenteral nutrition and numerous intravenous medications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  No change from admission.
