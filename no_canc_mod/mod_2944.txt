History of Present Illness: Patient is a 50 year old woman with a past medical history significant for SLE (never been treated with steroids), peptic ulcer disease, non-insulin dependent diabetes (diagnosed three months ago but with no medical management) who presented with polyuria and polydipsia over the past two weeks.
She denies any urgency, incontinence, or burning with urination.

She denies any cold or heat intolerance.
She denies any recent illnesses, nausea, or vomiting.
She did not have any evidence of altered mental status or confusion.
In addition, patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or changes in vision.
She denies any recent travel history, but does endorse that her grandson has been suffering from pertussis for some time and has been in her house on a daily basis.
On review, at admission, she related a history of back pain that started following an accident about 10 years ago.
She noted that her back pain had changed somewhat in character, and felt like a pinching, located in the upper back, between her scapulae.
Treated [**8-19**]) --Vericose veins s/p stripping and ligation of the right great saphenous vein and stab avulsions of right lower extremity varicose veins.
--Lactose intolerance --Possible depression --Chronic upper back pain --Abnormal Pap 5/06  Social History: Lives with husband and 2 of her four children.
Has several grandchildren.
Physical Exam: (on transfer from ICU) T:100.1 BP:156/80 HR:80 RR:16 O2saturation:94% on room air Gen: Pleasant, well appearing mildly obese woman laying in bed.
Slightly dry mucous membranes.
No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
No wheezes, crackles, or rhonci appreciated.
Nontender and nondistended.
No guarding or rebound.
No splenomegaly appreciated.
No abdominal aortic bruit.
No clubbing or cyanosis.
2+ dorsalis pedis and radial pulses, bilaterally.
SKIN: No rashes, ulcers, petechiae, or pigmented lesions.
No ecchymoses.
Blood Culture: [**3-24**]  Staph, coag negative [**3-26**]  Staph, coag negative; gram positive rods (thought most likely contaminant and not treated).
CTA Chest w&w/o recon ([**2126-3-24**]): No evidence of acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
Small axillary lymph nodes up to 12 mm in size.
CT Head w/o contrast ([**2126-3-24**]): No hemorrhage or mass effect.
Portable CXR ([**2126-3-24**]):  No acute pulmonary process.
Patient subsequently found to have a pan sensitive urinary tract infection and admitted to ICU for medical management.
1) Diabetic ketoacidosis: Patient presented with an anion gap acidosis of 22 and qa finger stick of 700.
-Of note, patient initially complained of upper back pain and has documented MSK back pain recently by PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] DM is a risk factor for CAD, pursued full ischemic work-up, although clinical suspicion very low.
She had no elevation of cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes.
-Intraabdominal precipitant ruled out as she had no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, or changes in BMs.
CXR did not reveal any evidence of pneumonia.
2) Urinary Tract Infection and questionable bacteremia: Initially, the patient had no signs or symptoms to suggest infection; however, blood cultures on [**2126-3-24**] grew 1/2 bottles of coag neg staph and urine cx revealed E.coli >100,000.
She was afebrile with WBC 6.4.
There was high suspicion for skin contamination in the blood culture.
There was concern for bacteremia, so sensitivities were sent for this culture and the previously positive culture to see if they were of the same morphology, with the plan to treat as if bacteremia if they had the same sensitivities.
It was decided not to treat empirically at the time due to low suspicion for bacteremia and no signs of endocarditis on exam.
She continued to remain afebrile and with WBC <6 for remainder of hospital stay.
It was felt that the low virulence of the original bacteria and lack of subsequent positive cultures indicated that both positive blood cultures were contaminants, and she was not felt to need TTE to rule out endocarditis.
Will continue to treat for ten day course from day of last positive urine culture.
3) Diabetes: Her picture was in some ways atypical for DKA because of older age of this patient and lack of serum ketones.
However, her glucose was in the range for DKA and she did have urine ketones.
Likely not hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia as she did not have mental status changes and glucose in the 700s is not as high as it typically presents in NKH.
Overall, her presentation is more convincing for DKA, and this raises questions regarding which type of diabetes she has.
She was initially presumed to be type II diabetic.
-She has been recommended to follow up with PCP for further CV risk stratification following new diagnosis of diabetes, including stress test and lipid profile.
4) Chest/Back pain: Patient has documented MSK back pain recently by PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] ruled out with three sets of negative enzymes and no EKG changes.
6) SLE: She has never had a lupus flare, and currently has no symptoms consistent with flare, such as MSK pain, eye problems, rash.
7) Abnormal Pap: Patient had an abnormal pap in [**2125-6-18**], for which she is due to have a follow up pap at six months.
8) Possible Depression: Patient also noted to have slightly depressed affect and social work consulted for new diagnosis.
Disp:*1 glucometer kit* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Diabetic Ketoacidosis -E.coli UTI .
Secondary: -Diabetes: no medications on admission -Systemic lupus erythematosis -Lactose intolerance -Depression -Back pain -Abnormal PAP smear in [**2125-6-18**] -Varicose vein removal in [**2125-12-19**] -Peptic ulcer disease (H.pylori positive in [**2121**])   Discharge Condition: Stable.
-You were found to have a urinary tract infection and were started on the antibiotic Bactrim which you will need to continue twice each day for the next seven days.
-You had nutrition counseling and insulin training to learn how to take care of diabetes at home.
Diabetes increases your risk of cardiovascular disease, so we recommend that your PCP consider further cardiac risk assessment, including measuring cholesterol levels, hypertension control, and cardiac stress test.
-You will need to have annual appointments with a podiatrist and an opthalmologist because diabetes can lead to neuropathy and retinopathy.
-If you have any symptoms of flu, such as fevers, cough, sore throat, muscle pains, please contact your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2227**].
