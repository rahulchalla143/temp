Admission Date:  [**2133-6-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-6-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-9-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7881**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
He was tachypneic/hypoxic on floor and then transferred to ICU for NIV and diuresis.
Hypernatremia (not drinking enough water with dementia, can't obey thirst).
Chronic permanent AF, on warfarin/BB.
Combined systolic/diastolic heart failure 3.)
HTN 6.)
Recent urosepsis precipitated by urinary retention s/p hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **] with Foley catheter in place   Social History: Retired.
Decreased breath sounds on left.
CV: tachycardic, irregular, no audible murmurs or gallops.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing.
Lungs: Diffuse wheezing, new crackles bilaterally.
Decreased breath sounds on left.
Productive noises on cough, but no sputum.
CV: tachycardic, irregular, no audible murmurs or gallops.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing.
Pertinent Results: STUDIES: CXR [**2133-6-10**]: Cardiomegaly is severe, associated with severe bilateral pulmonary edema, unchanged since the prior chest radiograph from [**2133-6-9**], but progressed since [**2133-6-3**].
Bibasilar consolidations may represent a combination of pulmonary edema and aspiration.
ECHO [**2133-6-9**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with inferior akinesis/hypokinesis, and inferolateral and inferoseptal hypopkinesis .
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, laterally directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-1-9**], regional wall motion abnormalities may have been present previously (views subopitmal) but overall left ventricular ejection fraction now appears slightly less vigorous.
Mitral regurgitation is now much more prominent and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
SWALLOW STUDY [**2133-6-5**]:  Premature spillover with laryngeal penetration, but no frank aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: This is the hospital course for a 81 year old man with systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 45%), hypertension, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with vascular dementia, and recent pneumonia here with what was thought to be a CHF exacerbation, but was an aspiration pneumonia.
Patient contracted C. difficile colitis while in the hospital, and developed acute renal failure and hypernatremia.
On HD7 he was transferred to the Medical ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress, which appeared to be primarily due to flash pulmonary edema given the acuity of onset.
The hypernatremia increased across the admission max was 152.
Acute kidney injury resolved with time over admission.
Congestive heart failure was stable along with the atrial fibrillation for which he is anticoagulated.
Per urology, the patient is to have Foley catheter for 3 weeks due to a large hydrocele.
Video swallow study performed on [**2133-6-5**], confirmed worsening of patient's ability to tolerate nectar-thickened diet, progressed to honey-thickened with aspiration precautions.
8. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
10. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 25112**] at [**Location (un) **] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: - Aspiration pneumonitis - Vascular dementia - Congestive Heart Failure  Secondary Diagnoses: - Chronic permanent atrial fibrillation - Combined systolic & diastolic heart failure - Presumed coronary artery disease with evidence of old inferior MI - Hypertension - Urinary retention - Hydrocele - Recent urosepsis precipitated by urinary retention   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You came to the hospital from your rehabilitation facility because it was noted that you were having a cough for a couple days and became suddenly worse while eating lunch.
These aspirations can increase your risk for pneumonia, however, since you were recently treated for a pneumonia and your exam and bloodwork were not consistent with pneumonia, we thought this diagnosis was unlikely.
However, you had a swallow study in the hospital which revealed that you were indeed continuing to have aspiration events that put you at risk for pneumonia.
