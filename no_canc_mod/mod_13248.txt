Patient is well known to our service and he recently underwent right and left vascular bypasses with revision.
His last surgery was [**2163-9-24**] where he underwent a left femoral popliteal revision with bovine patch for graft stenosis.
He has had a right femoral popliteal in [**2163-4-24**], a right femoral anterior tibial bypass with PTFE and a right femoral endarterectomy and right profunda femoris plasty secondary to failing graft in [**2163-8-25**].
Patient on [**2164-1-29**] in the morning after going to church had onset of acute left foot pain most of the day and by bed time the pain had progressed and the foot had become cool.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past illnesses include peripheral vascular disease, carotid disease, status post bilateral carotid endarterectomy, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction at the age of 36, status post coronary artery bypass graft x4 in [**2160**] at [**Hospital6 1130**].
History of type 2 diabetes mellitus with neuropathy and nephropathy.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis via Quinton catheter Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Renal artery stenosis by arteriogram.
History of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
History of PMIBI on [**1-29**] which showed moderate severe left ventricular dysfunction.
Exploration of the right femoral popliteal bypass with thrombectomy, a right femoral anterior tibial with PTFE, right femoral endarterectomy and right profundoplasty in [**2163-8-25**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The wound sites are well healed.
The carotid pulses are 1+ bilaterally with no jugular venous distension or thyromegaly.
Heart has a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub.
Peripheral vascular pulses show left foot with rubrous cyanotic changes the toes to the ankle.
The patient underwent on [**2164-1-31**] an arteriogram which showed a patent right femoral anterior tibial bypass graft with a proximal common femoral artery 90% stenosis.
On [**2-4**] cardiology was consulted in anticipation for revascularization.
A PMIBI was done which showed moderate fixed deficit with global hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 27%.
On [**2-7**] the patient had mental status changes with hypotension and he was transferred to VICU.
The patient was begun on Levophed which required him to be transferred to the surgical intensive care secondary to vasopressive use.
There was no significant change.
On [**2-9**] there was a significant drop in the patient's hematocrit from 30.6 to 26.0.
Patient was noted to have melanotic stools.
An upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done which demonstrated esophageal erosions with duodenitis and gastritis.
The patient was then transferred to the VICU for continued care and serial hematocrits were monitored with stabilization of his hematocrit.
The outside cardiac catheterization studies were reviewed and they felt the patient was not a candidate for any cardiac intervention.
The patient underwent on [**2-13**] a left common iliac artery and external iliac artery stenosis with a left femoral patch angioplasty and removal of his peritoneal dialysis catheter.
The patient was noted to have persistent left foot ischemia and they felt he would probably wind up requiring a below knee amputation.
The patient had a full graft pulse at the end of the procedure.
The patient's amiodarone was increased secondary to increase in atrial fibrillation.
On [**2-20**] the patient had an episode of bradycardia with supraventricular tachycardia.
There were no significant ischemic electrocardiographic changes on the bradycardia supraventricular tachycardia episode.
A repeat showed progressive elevation in his INR.
PT/INR the following day was 2.2 after 5 mg of vitamin K. Recommendations were to hold the Augmentin which we had started for the patient's stump cellulitis and to continue to monitor his coagulations carefully, reconsider another antibiotic given that the Augmentin would synergize the effect of Warfarin.
Left foot ischemia secondary to peripheral vascular     disease with rest pain.
Bilateral carotid disease, status post CEAs,     asymptomatic.
History of coronary artery disease with myocardial     infarction at the age of 36, status post coronary artery     bypass graft x4.
History of diabetes mellitus type 2 with neuropathy and     nephropathy.
End stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis,     discontinued with removal of the PD catheter and begun     hemodialysis.
Renal stenosis by arteriogram.
PMIBI shows moderate severe left ventricular dysfunction.
Postoperative blood loss anemia, transfused, corrected.
Postoperative esophagitis, gastritis and esophageal     erosions by esophagogastroduodenoscopy with H pylori     negative.
Postoperative hypotension requiring vasopressor support     secondary to gastrointestinal bleed,corrected.
Status post left common iliac, external iliac stenting     with left femoral patch angioplasty on [**2-13**],     failed.
Status post foot ischemia secondary to embolectomy.
Status post right femoral endarterectomy with patch     angioplasty and graft thrombectomy with return of     circulation.\ 17.
Postoperative paroxysmal atrial fibrillation requiring     amiodarone.
Postoperative hypocoagulation secondary to nutritional     depletion, corrected.
No stump shrinkers.
Skin clips remain in place for a total of 2 weeks in the right leg and in the left leg the below knee amputation stump skin clips remain in place until seen in follow up.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 1392**] office should be called if the patient develops a temperature greater than 101.5, if the amputation site or the incisions on the right leg become erythematous or drain.
