VNA was concerned as the patient was becoming increasingly dyspneic and lethargic.
Daughter denies any new cough, no fevers or chills.
No chest pain or pleuritic pain.
The daughter is also wondering if her mother is worse because of the increased oxygen that she was sent home on after her last hospitalization (hospitalized for falls thought to be secondary to mental status changes from hypercapnea).
Denies any new or missed doses of her medications.
CHF: ECHO [**1-3**] w/ 1+ MR, minimal AS, EF 40% w/ regional wall motion abnormalities 3.
HTN 5.
Schizophrenia: initially symptomatic w/ paranoia and hallucinations, well controlled w/ meds 7.
Symptomatic VT: s/p ICD in [**1-2**] 9.
Hypothyroidism  Social History: lives alone in [**Hospital3 **] apartment; has home health aide daily; meals are prepared by the pt's daughter; walks independently but sometimes uses walker; uses home O2 at all times and BiPAP at night; smoked 60 pack-years but quit in [**2123**]; no alcohol, IVDU, or cocaine use.
CAD: mother died of MI at unknown age  Physical Exam: GEN: obese female, sleeping, [**Last Name (LF) 18248**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] follow commands HEENT: atraumatic, anicteric, BI-PAP mask in place NECK: large, +JVD, no LAD, no carotid bruits CV: soft precordium, RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur, best at LSB LUNGS: distant breath sounds, rales at bases ABD: distended, soft, NT, NABS, no organomegaly EXT: warm, dry.

No actue ST changes .
Studies:  Portable CXR ([**9-15**]) - Interval worsening of perihilar and upper lung field vascular engorgement and cardiomegaly, suggesting cardiac decompensation.
Atelectasis of right lower lung.
Head CT ([**9-13**]): FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of the normally midline structures.
There are also unchanged ill-defined areas of relative hypodensity in the white matter in the frontal lobes, probably chronic small vessel infarcts.
IMPRESSION: Resolution of fluid in the right maxillary sinus.
No other change.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Shortness of Breath Likely secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Admission ABG demonstrates a chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.
However, BNP also significantly more elevated than prior, CXR with B/L effusions, cardiomegaly suggestive of component of heart failure.
The patient was ruled out for an MI with 2 sets of neg.
cardiac enzymes, also with no significant EKG changes on admission.
Placed on steroids for possible copd exacerbation.
On [**9-16**] and [**9-17**] patient maintained on bipap at night with restraints as needed for compliance as well as steroids.
As above, started on steroid taper, plan two weeks given copd exacerbation, severe COPD.
3) Cardiac a. Vessels- history of CABG x4 in [**2119**], no acute issues.
The patient was continued on her home beta-blocker, aspirin, statin b. Pump- history of CHF, preserved EF on echo in 5/[**2130**].
The patient appeared somewhat volume overloaded on admission, which improved with diuresis.
Lisinopril 2.5mg was added on [**9-10**] given patient's history of heart failure and diabetes.
d. Valves- aortic stenosis on echo .
5) Diabetes Last hgb A1c 7.1% in [**8-5**], controlled with oral hypoglycemics.
6) Anemia Baseline hct 28-35, currently stable.
7) Hypothyroidism Continued on levoxyl.
8)Altered Mental Status/intermittent lethargy: Initially thought secondary to hypercarbia although mental status did not always correlate with level of hypercarbia.
On [**9-13**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], co2 blown down by bipap, but did not clearly improve secondary to this intervention.
Also started on steroids for COPD over this time, and diuresed as above, unclear if improvement of resp status helped with somnolence.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Risperidone 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for agitation.

Central hypoventilation syndrome 7.
Bradycardia (?-medication induced) Secondary: 1.
Schizophrenia 2.
Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Stable, baseline mental status and respiratory status.
