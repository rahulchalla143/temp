Emesis initially consisted of food particles, then became bilious.
She felt very weak and dizzy.
Her mother-in-law took her to the [**Hospital **] [**Name (NI) 620**] campus ED where she underwent a CT scan as part of her workup.
This revealed a liver laceration with hemoperitoneum.
She denies fever and chills.
Currently, she does have diffuse abdominal pain.
As a result an ultrasound was obtained to further characterize her liver, which was read as more consistent with a chronic liver injury or a congenital cleft than an acute liver laceration.
Fluid was seen in the cul-de-sac as well as in Morison's pouch and adjacent to the liver consistent with ascites seen on prior imaging.
