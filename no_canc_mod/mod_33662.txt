She has a baseline chronic productive cough which worsened over the 2 days prior to presentation; it did not respond to her home nebs and and she developed SOB at rest.
She concurrently had intermittent 2/10 chest pain which was substernal and radiating to her Right shoulder, associated with diaphoresis.
She also noted blood tinged phlegm 2 days prior to presentation to OSH, but no fevers, rigors or chills.
Of note, the patient has chronic lower extremity edema with no significant changes from baseline.
Also given vancomycin 1 g, Zithromax IV 500mg and started on prednisone 40 mg daily for possible COPD exacerbation.

Asymmetric density in the right upper lobe and right paratracheal region merits further evaluation on a followup chest radiograph after diuresis to exclude right upper lobe infection and right paratracheal adenopathy.
[**2146-11-22**] CXR:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, a small left pleural effusion, small retrocardiac atelectasis and evidence of mild overhydration.
The pre-existing right upper lobe and perihilar parenchymal opacities unchanged in extent.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
Unchanged alignment of sternal wires, unchanged position of right-sided PICC line.
[**2146-11-16**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near-akinesis of the inferior wall and inferior septum and hypokinesis of the other segments.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Severe regional and mild global hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation, probably due to posterior leaflet tethering.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no angiographically apparent dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the stent.
R 6Fr femoral artery angioseal closure device deployed without complications.
R Femoral Vascular U/S [**2146-11-27**]: There is no evidence of femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula at the site of catheterization.
There is no fluid collection or hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 72F with CAD S/P CABG, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, chronic diastolic CHF, asthma/COPD on home O2, atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin (H/O cerebral aneurysm s/p clipping) presenting from OSH with progressive worsening chest tightness and SOB leading to diagnosis of NSTEMI and transferred for cardiac catheterization.
She had episode of [**9-13**] non-radiating chest pain with nausea yesterday that resolved with SL TNG x 3, additional 2 episodes overnight that self resolved.
Cath canceled twice due to respiratory status and persistent blood tinged sputum.
Heparin gtt was initially stopped secondary to hemotpysis; however, it was restarted due to ongoing chest pain.
However, patient developed nausea and epigastric pain, became hypotensive and was found to have guaic positive stools.
The patient was started on ASA 325mg (despite H/O epistaxis on full dose ASA, had no further episodes of epistaxis noted).
Post-cath course complicated by Right groin tenderness on post-cath day 6; ultrasound revealed no fistula or pseudoaneurysm, and symptoms resolved.
# PUMP: Worsening LV function; LVEF reported to be 61% from OSH, chronic diastolic CHF with chronically elevated BNP per outside records.
Worsening of LE edema and respiratory status s/p pre-cath hydration; respiratory status improved with diuresis.
Due to increased pressures seen on cardiac cath, the patient was diuresed with Lasix gtt and transitioned to torsemide 60 mg twice daily with daily potassium repletion.
This was decreased to 60 mg torsemide daily with no K supplementation at discharge.
# RHYTHM: Persistent atrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated (beyond ASA+Plavix) due to distant history of cerebral aneurysm.
Unclear if this was ingested blood versus slow upper GI bleed, not hemodynamically significant.
She continued to have guaiac positive stools post-cath, but remained hemodynamically stable.
Concern for COPD exacerbation/PNA at OSH, received vancomycin 1 gm x 1, azithromycin IV 500 mg x 1 and started on prednisone.
She completed a course of vanc/azithromycin and prednisone taper for concern for acute bacterial bronchitis/pneumonitis or COPD exacerbation.
She developed blood tinged sputum with heparin gtt, which was evaluated by pulmonology.
Patient will require PFT and pulmonology follow-up as an outpatient; no need for repeat imaging per pulm and radiology as the abnormal finding at OSH consistent with ectatic vasculature involving the aorta.
# DM: Unknown HgbA1c.
We avoided nephrotoxic medications and administered pre-cath Mucomyst; pre-hydration was held due to fluid overload/poor cardiac function.
# Hyperlipidemia: No record of last lipid panel.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been due to steroids or infection.
Legionella antibody negative.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 2255**] [**Name (NI) 2256**]  Discharge Diagnosis: - Coronary artery disease with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and prior coronary artery bypass surgery with documentation of vein graft occlusion and stenosis.
- Chronic atrial fibrillation - Chronic left bundle branch block - Acute on chronic left ventricular systolic and diastolic heart failure - Hypertension - Diabetes mellitus - Dyslipidemia - Hemoptysis - Abnormal radiographic findings of the chest - Guaiac positive stools, possible gastrointestinal bleeding, melena - Acute blood loss anemia - Urinary tract infection - Presumed pneumonia and/or bronchitis - Chronic obstructive lung disease and/or asthma - Peripheral arterial disease - Leukocytosis - Chronic renal insufficiency  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted due to having a heart attack.
We had difficulty with performing your cardiac catheterization due to the blood tinged sputum that you developed while on heparin and the blood we found in your stool.
There was question of concerning findings on your chest CT scan from the outside hospital; however, upon further review of the images by the radiologists and pulmonologists, it appears that the abnormal finding is due to a bundle of blood vessels.
Also, you should follow-up with a gastroenterologist as you were found to have blood in your stool during your admission.
You should call your doctor if your weight increases by more than 3 pounds or you notice difficulty breathing or increased leg swelling.
