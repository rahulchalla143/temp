Per OSH, family reports that after starting metolazone and lasix (once 6 weeks ago and once last week),he developed several shocks from AICD which he has never had before.
With firings, has brief loss of consciousness lasting less than one minute.
Was brought to [**Hospital3 417**] ([**6-6**]), where he had several episodes of VT on presentation where his device fired several times converting him to AV paced rhythm.
However he did have 1 episode on that admission where he became [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and had diffuculty repiratory effort and was slow to recover.Pacer interrogation demonstrated eight shocks delivered since [**2145-6-5**] due to VT with rates from 180-250, fourteen VT since since [**2145-5-16**] treated with ATP.
Given diuretics and fluid alternating for few rounds with diuretics finally held because of creatinine 2.1 and SBP in the 90s.
On review of systems,  deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Denies claudication, orthopnea, PND, lightheadedness Pitting edema to ankles, (+) CVA [**2130**] .
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain (+), dyspnea on exertion (+), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (+), orthopnea, ankle edema (+), palpitations (+), syncope (+) or presyncope (+).

Sclera anicteric.
No xanthalesma.
Systolic murmer heard in left 4th intercostal space ([**1-30**]), radiating to the left axilla.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, crackles at lung bases bilaterally on expiration and inspiration, no wheezes or rhonchi.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 83830**] Reason: please evaluate for aspiration, PNA    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    77 year old man with BiV pacer/ICD in place admitted for multiple episodes V    Tach with ICD firing, altered mental status and recent asystole requiring CPR.
There is new asymmetric opacity in the right lung and new bilateral alveolar and interstitial opacities in both lungs on a background of moderate cardiomegaly.
No rib fractures or pneumothorax.
Moderately severe bilateral glenohumeral subluxation is incidentally noted.
The diffuse ground-glass opacity in the right lung may be attributable in part to pulmonary hemorrhage, which would fit with the given clinical history.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 83831**] Reason: Any acute lung process?
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    77 year old man with with non ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 20%, CVA,    DM, A fib (on warfarin at home), 6 weeks ago had BiV ICD re-placement s/p VT,    who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] hospital after ICD interrogation    demonstrated 86 episodes of VT with intermittent firing REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    Any acute lung process?
There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and a dual-channel pacemaker device in place.
Mild retrocardiac opacification consistent with atelectasis.
No definite pleural effusion.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Ech [**6-8**]: IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
No pericardial effusion.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This 77 year old male patient with non ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 20%, CVA, DM, A fib (on warfarin at home), 6 weeks ago had BiV ICD re-placement s/p VT, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] hospital after ICD interrogation demonstrated 86 episodes of VT with intermittent firing.
Patient presented with persisitent episdoes of ventricular tachycardia while on Sotalol and Biv ICD.
We Hemodynamically monitored the patient with frequent vital signs check and kept him NPO in anticipation of a possible EP study in the AM.We also continued metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 **] p.o .
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF- appeared to be volume overloaded on exam.
Noted to have [**12-30**]+ MR/TR on last echo.He could have been  volume overloaded however intravascular depleted because of his high creatinine.
#Altered Mental Status- Patient had experienced delirium for the past 6 weeks which was acute in onset.
His first altered mental status coincided with his first hospital admission for V tach.
Held sedating medications.
Measured ammonia levels for suspicion of hepatic encephalopathy, the ammonia levels were normal.
#Hyperlipidemia -Continued Simvastatin .
#History of CVA: Without any persistent neurologic sequelae on presentation.
#Sciatica -Held Lyrica for potential sedating effects.
#Melanoma .
2nd cardiac arrest call at 12:30 in PEA requiring 2 amps epinephrine,1 amp bicarb 1 amp atropine and dopamine titrated to maximum.
Time of death and confirmation:    Time of death 13:50 with no pulse trace on A-line with no recordable although still ventilated at the request of family.
Full external examination and vital signs at 14:47:  No A-line trace.
No carotid pulse palpable for 1 minute and no heart sounds on auscultation for 1 minute.
