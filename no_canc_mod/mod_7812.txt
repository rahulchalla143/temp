Admission Date:  [**2160-10-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2160-10-30**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 81-year-old male is admitted to the Coronary Care Unit after a catheterization for inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction; status post ventricular fibrillation and post bradycardia during catheterization.
The patient has a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease.
In the intervening time period he developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and has been on warfarin.
He was in his usual state of health recently until the evening of [**10-25**] when he noted "burning" in the shoulder, chest, back, and distal portions of both arms; different from gastroesophageal reflux disease in that he did not note acid in his mouth.
He did not feel shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
When the pain persisted through early this a.m., he presented to [**Hospital1 **], received aspirin, metoprolol, and nitroglycerin for inferior ST elevations and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.
En route, he became unresponsive in ventricular fibrillation and was defibrillated into sinus rhythm with 200 joules.
At catheterization, the patient had a transient decrease in heart rate and was treated with transcutaneous pacing, dopamine, and atropine.
Hiatal hernia/gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Bilateral carotid endarterectomy.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
In general, a sleeping elderly male, in no apparent distress.
Groin was soft, no oozing or bruits.
Extremities revealed trace peripheral edema, 2+ palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Catheterization revealed pressures with right atrial mean was 8, right ventricular was 42/5, pulmonary artery was 41/21, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 22, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 30.
Vessels revealed right-dominant, mild left main and left anterior descending artery disease.
A 90% mid left circumflex lesion.
Right coronary artery with 70% ostial proximal ulcer/lesion stented.
A 95% distal right coronary artery lesion was stented.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Coronary artery disease: The patient with coronary artery disease as above.
He did not have any further chest pain or shortness of breath while in the hospital.
(b)  Pump:  The patient received a post myocardial infarction echocardiogram on [**2160-10-27**].
This demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% to 45%, moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function, with inferior and lateral hypokinesis to akinesis.
The patient did not have any signs or symptoms of heart failure throughout his admission.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient had several episodes of atrial fibrillation occurring on the day of catheterization and up until the day prior to discharge.
Prior to discharge, it was arranged for the patient to participate in an electrophysiology study involving risk stratification of post myocardial infarction patients for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
NEUROLOGIC SYSTEM:  The patient had some delirium on the day of his catheterization.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
