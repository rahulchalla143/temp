The patient had a history of a type B aortic dissection, but the CT scan which was done in the emergency room at an outside facility showed new type A aortic dissection.
After reviewing the CT scan, he was taken emergently to the operating room for repair of acute type A aortic dissection.
He remained intubated on post operative night due to bleeding and was extubated post operative day 2 after receiving Precedex.
He had some impulsive behavior and was kept in the ICU an extra day for that reason.
It was also recommended that he be seen by Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital3 1810**] for evaluation for possible Marfan's syndrome.
