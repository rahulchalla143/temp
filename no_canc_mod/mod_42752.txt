Admission Date:  [**2176-10-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2176-11-20**]   Service:  Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for multiple small-bowel and abdominal surgeries which resulted in adhesions and obstructions requiring lysis of adhesions and reduction of volvulus who presented to the [**Hospital1 346**] with a complaint of hypertension, nausea, vomiting, as well as shortness of breath.
Just prior to admission, the patient had a barium swallow study to evaluate a known hiatal hernia and had a normal bowel movement on the day prior to admission which was consisting mainly of barium from that swallow study.
The patient felt somewhat uncomfortable on the day of admission and was found to have a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis of 211, and so the patient came to the Emergency Department.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Multiple abdominal surgeries to relieve small-bowel volvulus secondary to adhesions as well as lysis of adhesions.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
There was no scleral icterus.
The neck was supple with full range of motion, and no lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention was noted.
The heart was regular in rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
There was a small 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the apex.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
There were no hernias or masses appreciated.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed no acute disease.
A portable abdominal examination revealed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, this was a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman who has had prior multiple abdominal surgeries who was admitted for hypertension, and a complaint of nausea, and vomiting, as well as coffee-grounds emesis.
Gastrointestinal Service was consulted for his upper gastrointestinal bleed since this was felt to be secondary to his hiatal hernia.
The Gastrointestinal Service saw the patient and felt that the patient had the possibility of a paraesophageal hernia with partial volvulus.
The upper gastrointestinal study revealed an incarcerated hiatal hernia, and a General Surgery consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 100353**] was obtained.
The levofloxacin was started to treat a urinary tract infection.
The surgery team evaluated the patient further and felt that his hiatal hernia was not incarcerated, and an attempt could be made to repair it laparoscopically, and since the patient's symptoms had essentially resolved, plans were made to have the patient follow up in the outpatient setting.
However, on [**10-23**], the patient again became symptomatic after taking a few sips of some soup and experienced another episode of coffee-grounds emesis.
Postoperatively, the patient remained stable, and his pain was well controlled, and plans were made to replete his electrolytes, and await the return of bowel function.
However, the patient required a Physical Therapy consultation and had some difficulty voiding.
He then developed tachycardia which was worked up and evaluated and discovered to be atrial fibrillation.
He became hypotensive with this atrial fibrillation and was aggressively resuscitated medically.
By postoperative day five, the patient was tolerating his oral diet and had no acute surgical issues.
The patient converted from his atrial fibrillation and was maintained on sotalol with resolution of his hypotension, and he was essentially asymptomatic.
The patient had to have his Foley catheter replaced for an inability to void.
By postoperative day seven, the patient was having difficulty tolerating oral intake, and an x-ray evaluation revealed that there was gas-filled colon, indicating an apparent obstruction versus a pseudo-obstruction.
He was again made nothing by mouth and experienced coffee-grounds emesis.
On the day and evening of [**11-2**], the patient developed low urine output which was not responding to fluid boluses, and despite the fluid boluses and blood transfusion, the patient continued to have low urine output and went into respiratory distress; for which he required intubation which was performed by the Anesthesia staff.
The patient underwent a computed tomography angiogram of his chest which was negative for pulmonary embolism and also underwent serial cycling of cardiac enzymes and was found to not have a myocardial infarction.
In the Intensive Care Unit, he underwent invasive monitoring of his blood pressure and his pulmonary performance and remained intubated.
However, he failed extubation and developed a large AA gradient once again, and the patient required reintubation.
Pan-cultures were essentially negative, and the sputum cultures grew only expected respiratory flora.
The patient having required a large volume resuscitation, subsequently upon improvement of his status, required diuresis which was able to be accomplished without difficulty.
The patient did not have resolution of his ileus, and with his pulmonary status worsening, and increasing ventilator support to maintain his oxygenation, his wife and daughter expressed their concerns that the patient did not want to be on ventilator support for a prolonged period of time, and without resolution of his pseudo-obstruction and with his prognosis (which included a prolonged Intensive Care Unit stay), the decision was reached with the family and attending physicians that the patient should be made comfort measures only.
The patient was made comfort measures only and was made comfortable, and he expired on [**11-20**] at 5:29 a.m. from respiratory compromise secondary to an acute respiratory distress syndrome.
