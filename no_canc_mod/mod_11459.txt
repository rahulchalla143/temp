History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname 2251**] [**Known lastname 33754**] is a 60 yo male with CAD, HTN, borderline DM who recently underwent a cardiac cath with a stent LAD that did not fully deploy who presents with CP that began at noon today.
The patient was shoveling snow at a moderate pace when he developed the chest pain.
CP became very severe and  was similar to CP (SSCP with radiation to right shoulder) with his previous MI so he presented to the ED.
He reports diaphoresis, but he denies associated nausea, vomiting, SOB, palpitations or dizziness.
Patient presented in [**9-21**] with complaints of excertional chest pain similar to his chest pain prior to his MI in [**2181**].
He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5076**] in clinic and underwent cardiac cath on [**2185-9-29**] that showed a totally occluded LAD and 80%.
In the proximal portion of the stent, there was substantial rigidity of the LAD and it would not fully dilate.
This resulted in a 40-50% residual stenosis but normal flow into the distal vessel.
He continued to have excertional SOB and discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5076**] CABG vs PCI and returned on [**2185-10-27**] with stent placement to the OM1 lesion.
Today, he was found to have acute stent thrombosis in LAD stent with hyper-acute T waves in the anterior leads.
At the end of the case TIMI 3 flow was restored an the patient did not have any residual stenosis.
On arrival to floor, he reports some mild nausea and SOB.
He denies chest pain or pressure.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname 2251**] is a 60 yo gentleman with pre-diabetes, HTN, and CAD who presents with chest pain and was found to have an acute stent thrombosis.
Patient was given 1L NS for renal protection post catheterization and had no evidence of acute kidney injury through duration hospital stay.
Tolerated procedure well, with no complications.
Also started on omeprazole for gastritis prevention given anticoagulation with numerous medications.
Post cath ECHO showed EF of 30-35% with moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction.
HTN - remained normotensive on metoprolol and lisinopril as above.
