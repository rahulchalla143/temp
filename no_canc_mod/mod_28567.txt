This pregnancy was notable for placenta previa, fibroids in the first trimester and spotting.
Prenatal sepsis risk factors were unknown GBS colonization, no maternal fever, rupture of membranes less than 24 hours, no maternal intrapartum antibiotics.
At birth, the infant presented with some respiratory distress and neonatology was called to delivery.
Due to the respiratory distress in the delivery room, the infant was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further management.
There was grunting, flaring and retracting present.
Abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Hips stable, no clicks or clunks, no sacral anomalies.
Extremities showed acrocyanosis distally but was centrally pink on oxygen.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The infant presented with mild to moderate RDS initially.
The infant had a dusky episode shortly after admission to the NICU.
Chest x-ray was done initially which was consistent with transient tachypnea of the newborn.
An ABG was done on admission with oxygen at 100% to rule out any cardiac anomalies.
The infant was transferred to nasal prong C-Pap due to worsening respiratory distress on the newborn day.
Respiratory symptoms continued to worsen over the next couple of days and on day of life 1, the infant was intubated and received 2 doses of surfactant therapy for respiratory distress syndrome.
The chest x-ray at that time had worsened to atelectasis and surfactant deficiency.
The infant has been on room air since that time, with a normal respiratory rate, no increased work of breathing and oxygen saturations in the  range.
The infant has had no issues with apnea or bradycardia and no methylxanthines were started.
Cardiovascular:  The infant was given normal saline bolus x1 on admission to the NICU for poor peripheral perfusion which improved.
The infant was noted to have a 2/6 systolic murmur on the day of discharge, but is well perfused with normal pulses, normal blood pressure, normal heart rate and rhythm.
Screening cardiac investigations including hyperoxia test, EKG, chest radiograph and 4-extremity blood pressure were negative and cardiology consultation suggested that this was likely a benign finding.
feeding well, breast milk or Similac 20 with iron or breast feeding, taking all feedings by mouth and showing steady weight gain.
Hematology:  No blood typing has been done on this infant.
There have been no needs for blood product transfusions.
No further neurologic evaluations were needed.
State newborn screen was sent on day of life 3, [**2142-5-27**], which showed an elevated 17OH.
There are no active ongoing psychosocial issues at this time but if there are any questions or concerns, social worker can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**].
feedings of breast feeding or breast milk with supplemental Similac 20 with iron as needed.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
