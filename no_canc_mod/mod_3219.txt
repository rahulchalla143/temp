Distended fluid and air-filled loops of small and large bowel, most consistent with ileus.
However, early partial small bowel obstruction could have a similar appearance.
Right basilar airspace opacity which may be related to aspiration, pneumonia, or less likely atelectasis.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2160-3-24**] 5:02 PM IMPRESSION: Suboptimal examination; however no definite evidence of pulmonary embolism is identified.
Bilateral infiltrates likely representing aspiration pneumonia.
Large amount of abdominal ascites.
There are several calcified mediastinal lymph nodes likely representing sequelae of previous granulomatous disease.
Small bowel distention, mural thickening, pneumatosis, and mesenteric venous gas, consistent with bowel ischemia.
Right lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia and atelectasis minimally improved.
Findings consistent with portal hypertension and cirrhosis, unchanged.
Calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes consistent with prior granulomatous disease.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-4-5**] 12:34 AM IMPRESSION: Mild interval increased atelectasis and elevation in the right hemidiaphragm when compared to prior study.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted with SBP and distened abdomen consistent with ileus, encephalopathy and was started on antibiotics.
Originally abdominal distension resoleved and NFGT was d/c'd.
A Abdominal CT was performed at that time which showed dilated small bowel and air in the mesenery and portal vein consistent with ischemic gut.
On exploration he was found to have 12L of ascites and fibrinous exudate on the bowel.
No evidence of obstruction, ischemia or open perforation.
JP was left in the abdomen for ascites leak control.
The patient was maintained on levofloxacin and flagyl post operatively for SBP and question of pre op aspiration PNA for 1 week.
Subsequently transitioned to cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
3 days prior to discharge he developed increasing WBC and hypotenion with elevated Cr.
He was cultured and JP drain was analyzed and contained 1500WBC with 80% polys consistent with SBP with no growth on culture at this time.
Also was noted to have g+ cocci growth from his central line which grew staph epidermidis, question of contamination.
The patient is putting out 3-4L ascites through the JP daily which is being replaced 1/2cc per cc with NS.
The plan was to D/C JP drain after 2 weeks post op to ensure fascial healing to minimize risk of ascites leak through the midline incision.
1 day ago pt was noted to have drop in HCT from 30 to 22 with no evidence of gross bleeding.
He is afebrile and the incsion has a stapled closure with no evidence of leakage, erythema or edema.
He has a JP with serous drainage.
