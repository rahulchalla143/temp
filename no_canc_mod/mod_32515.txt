Admission Date:  [**2128-9-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-9-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-4-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Azithromycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 552**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pheresis catheter placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 79158**] is a 27yo F otherwise healthy p/w nausea, blood-tinged emesis, and nonbloody diarrhea x 2 days and found to be thrombocytopenic and anemic at an OSH, thus transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval/mgmt.
Once reaching home, pt became nauseous w/ frequent emesis and watery/yellow diarrhea, up to BM x 10/day.
Emesis was at times slightly bloody, but no blood in stool.
Pt denies dysuria, hematuria, or back pain, but did notice that her urine output has decreased w/ poor PO intake in the past 2 days.
Pt tried to rest and increase PO fluid intake, but symptoms persisted the next day so her family decided to bring her to the OSH ED.
ROS: Reports shakes/chills, night sweats, malaise, and poor appetite.
No recent sick contact or travel.
No recent fatigue, or other illness except a URI for 2 days around [**8-20**].
Denies any problems with bleeding or clotting in the past.
Currently she denies HA, and is mainly bothered by her persistent and frequent nausea and vomiting.
She has not had any episodes of diarrhea since arrival to the ED.
Pt was given ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV x 1 for UTI, Morphine 2 mg IV x 2 for pain, ondansetron 2 mg IV x 2 for severe nausea.
Peripheral blood smear revealed about [**2-18**] schistocytes per hpf, tear drops and a few myelocytes, very few spherocytes.
Heme/onc was consulted and suspected TTP-HUS, thus contact[**Name (NI) **] the blood bank to facilitate plasmapheresis and as well as IR to place a pheresis catheter.
Went to Castle Island last weekend, but no other travel.
Family History: Mother: DM type 2, HTN, thyroid condition Father: DM type 2, HTN, 2 stents placed for CAD 1 brother who is healthy 1 sister with asthma M Grandmother: CHF M Grandfather: CVA No family history of malignancies, bleeding or clotting problems.
Anicteric sclerae.
Oral mucosa is moist, no  thrush, no petechia on the palate.
Few small petechiae periorbitally.
no cervical LAD.
No nuchal rigidity, thyromegaly, or JVP appreciated.
HEART: Regular rate, normal rhythm, nl S1 S2, no M/G/R.
SKIN: Few ecchymoses on L nasal ridge as well as on RUE in area of tourniquet or blood draw and BP cuff.
Quarter-sized ecchymosis on RUE.
No rashes on palms or soles.
Pertinent Results: ADAMTS13 Activity and Inhibitor        Results                            Units         Reference Interval       -------                            ----- ------------------  ADAMTS13 Inhibitor                       3.6 <=0.4  ADAMTS13 Activity                        <5 %  L           >=67   INTERPRETIVE COMMENTS: Severe deficiencies of ADAMTS13 (activity <5-10%) appear to be a relatively specific finding in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic pupura TTP will show severe ADAMTS13 deficiency , and a functional inhibitor can be demonstrated in 40-90% of these individuals.
Plasma exchange therapy may induce remission of clinical symptoms of TTP despite persistance of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency.
A persistently abnormal ADAMTS13 assay during remission is associated with increased risk for recurrent clinical episodes of TTP.
Severe congenital ADAMTS13 deficiency ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 79159**] [**Doctor Last Name 1147**] syndrome) is an autosomal recessive condition which may present as thrombotic microangiopathy in either children or adults; inhibitors are generally not observed in these patients.
Other  where severe ADAMTS13 deficiency has been reported include disseminated intravascular coagulation, netastatuc nakugbabct, advanced cirrhosis and severe sepsis.
Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is rarely observed in secondary thrombotic microangiopathies (e.g.
diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation).
Mild moderate deficiency of ADAMT13 activity has been observed in multiple medical conditions.
Hemolysis with plasma free hemoglobin greater than 2gm/L or an elevated bilirubin level in the sample can cause artifactually low ADAMTS13 activity and false positive inhibitor results.
EFFICTIVE [**2128-9-3**]   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 79158**] is a 27yo female admitted with diarrhea, HA, N/V and found to be thrombocytopenic and anemic, findings consistent with HUS-TTP.
1)TTP-HUS: Patient presented with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], microangiopathic hemolytic anemia was evident by lab data including elevated LDH, undetectable haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin and >2 schistocytes/100x field on peripheral smear.
Given clinical presentation of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, it is likely that she has HUS-TTP [**3-20**] to an infectious process likely E.coli O157:H7 (although no bloody diarrhea) or other infectious diarrheal illness.
Other possible though less likely causes of her presentation and findings would include an acquired or congenital ADAMTS13 deficiency or unidentified toxin or medication.
Given the negative direct Coombs test it is less likely a warm hemolytic anemia, and normal PT and PTT in the setting of anemia and severe thrombocytopenia would argue against DIC.
With elevated creatinine and lack of MS changes such as seizures and coma, patient probably has HUS more than TTP; however, it is clinically difficult to distinguish between the two at the moment.
She was transferred to the MICU during her hospital stay given increased nursing needs.
An ADAMTS 13 level was also sent which showed very low activity, and the presence of an inhibitor.
She likely had a GI illness in the setting of HUS-TTP.
She did have anxiety regarding the diagnosis, but as her clinical health improved, her anxiety resolved.
Pt was initially placed on ativan but that was quickly tapered down to 0.25mg QD prn and pt was given a limited supply without refills at discharged  Medications on Admission: Ibuprofen PRN Prevacid PRN No new medications or supplements   Discharge Medications: 1.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: [**2-18**] Tablet PO once a day as needed for anxiety for 5 days.

Acute renal failure, resolved Anxiety Hx GERD   Discharge Condition: GOOD   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome.
Return to the ED if you develop recurrent abdominal pain, bruising, other rashes, confusion or headache, similar to this episode.
