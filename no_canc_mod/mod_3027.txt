Of note, patient was recently admitted from [**5-29**] to [**2120-5-31**] to [**Hospital1 18**] c/o rapid palpitations due to atrial tachycardia with HR 15-150.
Her BPs remained stable for fisrt 3 hours of the case and then subsequently became hypotensive with SBPs in the 90s.
Currently, her only complaint is generalized itching.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, DOE, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, syncope or presyncope.

Other Results: ECG ([**6-12**]): "Slow" atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia with 2:1 response.
ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2120-6-10**] the rhythm as [**Date Range 4030**] has replaced atrial fibrillation.
ECG ([**6-10**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Modest ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo F with atrial flutter s/p multiple cardioversions and pulmonary vein isolation in [**9-/2119**] who presented for repeat pulmonary vein isolation.
Pt's post-procedure course was complicated by hypotension and return to atrial flutter/fibrillation.
#Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive to the 90s systolic during pulmonary vein isolation procedure and initially required pressor support in the cath [**Year (4 digits) **].
This hypotension was most likely due to the fact that a) this patient's baseline SBP is in the low 100s and b) the anesthetics used during the procedure (she received fentanyl, propofol, and midazolam) contributed significantly to a drop in pressures.
On transfer to the floor on [**6-11**], her blood pressures were recorded to be in the mid 70s systolic though pt was asymptomatic at the time and again showed no signs of infection or acute blood loss.
Immediately following the procedure, the patient was in sinus rhythm but the evening of [**6-11**] the patient complained of some palpitations and she was noted to be tachycardic to the 100s, up from 50s previously.
ECG at the time showed atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
She received 5mg IV Lopressor, 50mg PO Lopressor and 40mg PO verapamil with some improvement of her rate but no conversion of her rhythm.
She converted back into sinus rhythm for a few hours on [**6-11**] but in the late evening, she was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rates in the 90s.
She continued to alternate between sinus and atrial arrhythmias throughout the night though she remained asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable throughout.
Patient was discharged on quinidine; her beta-blocker and CCB were held in the setting of her low blood pressures (again though this is likely pt's baseline) and she was given [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor and was instructed to follow-up with EP.
Chronic Diagnoses .
#Hyperlipidemia - Stable.
#Insomnia - Stable.
Transitional Issues .
Patient will follow-up with EP this week regarding her medication adjustments and her [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts event recorder results.
6. zolpidem 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
10. diazepam 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Outpatient [**First Name (STitle) **] Work Please check CBC, INR on Friday [**6-14**] with results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation/flutter Secondary Diagnosis: Dyslipidemia Hypotension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
During the procedure you had some low blood pressure and needed to be on a medicine intravenously to keep your blood pressure up.
Please call his office if you notice any palpitations, pain at the groin sites, dizziness or lightheadedness.
