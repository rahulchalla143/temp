The mother's prenatal screens are blood type O positive, antibody negative, Rubella immune, rapid plasma reagin nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and group B strep status unknown.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Revealed a vigorous, active, nondysmorphic preterm infant.
No sacral anomalies.
She was treated with caffeine    for apnea of prematurity from day of life two until day of    life fourteen.
Her last episode of apnea and bradycardia    occurred on [**2132-6-30**].
CARDIOVASCULAR STATUS:  The infant remained normotensive    until day of life 47 when she began to have increasing    systolic blood pressures.
She was evaluated by the [**Hospital3 1810**] Cardiology, and an echocardiogram was done on [**2132-7-29**] and revealed a patent foramen ovale, a cystic mass on the tricuspid valve without significant impact on valvular function, and qualitatively moderately depressed left ventricular function with qualitatively normal right ventricular function.
It was felt that this finding on her echocardiogram was not related to her hypertension.
Her workup for hypertension on [**2132-7-25**] included a renal ultrasound that showed normal sized kidneys with a normal cortex, and no hydronephrosis.
Her urinalysis had no red blood cells and no white blood cells.
GASTROINTESTINAL STATUS:  The infant was treated with    phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia from day of life two    until day of life six.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE STATUS:  The infant was started on    ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission for    sepsis risk factors.
DISCHARGE SCREENING:  The infant passed a car seat position screening test.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED: A. Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should be    considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet    any of the following three criteria:  (1) born at less    than 32 weeks gestation; (2) born between 32 and 35 weeks    gestation with 2 of the following:  Plans for day care    during respiratory syncytial virus season, a smoker in the    household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or    with school-age siblings; or (3) with chronic lung    disease.
Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the Fall    for all preterm infants with chronic lung disease once    they reach six months of age.
Status post transitional respiratory distress.
Sepsis ruled out.
Retinopathy of prematurity.
Status post hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity.
Status post apnea of prematurity.
Cystic mass on the tricuspid valve.
Depressed left ventricular function.
