2), who was born by repeat cesarean section for intractable preterm labor to a 34 year old G2 P1 now 3 mother.
The pregnancy was complicated by an exploratory laparotomy at 5 weeks of gestation to rule out ovarian torsion.
The mother was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] and was treated with magnesium sulfate for tocolysis and betamethasone.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: Respiratory:  Upon admission to the NICU, the infant was placed on high frequency ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome.
The infant did receive Vitamin A for the prevention of chronic lung disease.
The infant was started on caffeine for apnea of prematurity on day of life five.
His last apnea or bradycardia of prematurity was well before that time, [**8-21**].
He has not had any apnea of prematurity since that time.
On day of life three, a murmur developed for which a clinical diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus was made and he was started on indomethacin.
A blood culture was sent which revealed gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
Ophthalmology:  Due to his extreme prematurity with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks and birth weight less than 1500 gm, he qualified for serial eye examinations to evaluate for retinopathy of prematurity.
He did have retinopathy of prematurity with his maximum disease noted on [**9-17**] with Stage 2 Zone 2 ROP; 7 clock hours on the right and 8 clock hours on the left.
Immunizations Recommended:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria - 1) born at less than 32 weeks, 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with any of the two following risk factors - day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings, or 3) with chronic lung disease.
This infant does qualify for monthly Synagis throughout the RSV season.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
