Radiologic Data: [**12-10**] CT C-spine IMPRESSION: No acute fracture.
Degenerative changes.
[**12-10**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
No fracture identified.
Small left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at the left lower lobe.
[**12-10**] CXR (PA/Lat) IMPRESSION: Large left pleural effusion.
Associated left lower lobe consolidation could be secondary to compressive atelectasis, however, an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Left retrocardiac consolidation is also slightly improved.
A moderate left and small right pleural effusions are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old woman with history of asthma, HTN, GERD, and gait disorder who presented with falls, fever, and found to have LLL PNA with loculated parapneumonic effusion requiring VATS decortication.
Hospital course was complicated by post-operative hypotension requiring pressors and admission to the MICU.
#) Community Acquired Pneumonia with Loculated Parapneumonic effusion: Strep Milleri from diagnostic thoracentesis.
#)Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: The patient's initial chest CT noted mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Hypotension: Most likely in setting of volume loss and volume shifts as 1L fluid was removed from VATS in addition to 400cc blood loss intra-op.
No evidence of cardiac etiology-no EKG changes, no changes in cardiac enzymes.
No tachycardia, no CP, or changes in O2 require to suggest PE.
Pt was weaned from pressors without incident.
#) Asthma: No PFT data available on admission, with history seemed more consistent with chronic obstructive lung disease.
#) Fall: CT head on admission without any evidence of bleeding.
No focal neurological deficits.
#) Anemia: Iron studies consistent with acute inflammatory state.
#) Hyperglycemia: Patient had elevated BG's in the setting of acute infection as no history of diabetes.
