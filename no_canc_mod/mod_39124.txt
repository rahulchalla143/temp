Arrived to PACU @ 12:56pm today c/o chest pressure with lateral ST elevations & HR in the 120s 127/80.
On transfer to the floor, he was hemodynamically stable, awake and alert without complaints.
During the first few hours of his CCU course, he experienced an episode of nausea with loss of conciousness and was found to be pulseless.

The LMCA had no significant stenosis.
The mid LAD had a large occlusive thrombus in the prior stent.
The LCX had 60% stenosis at the origin.
The dominant RCA had 80% stenosis in the mid RPDA branch.
Very late stent thrombosis in the LAD (previous stent deployed in [**2149**]) with acute antero-lateral MI.
LAD stenosis successfully treated by aspiration thrombectomy and deployment of a 3.0 x 12 mm Promus drug-eluting stent.
Very late stent thrombosis in the LAD treated successfully with aspiration thrombectomy and deployment of a 3.0 x 12 mm Promus drug-eluting stent.
[**2159-2-14**] HIP XRAY WITH PELVIS Left total hip arthroplasty in satisfactory alignment with no evidence of immediate post-surgical complications.
[**2159-2-15**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate anterior septal hypokinesis and mild inferior septal hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate hypokinesis of the anterior septum, mild hypokinesis of the inferior septum.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
No retroperitoneal hematoma.
Expected soft tissue edema and subcutaneous air, consistent with post-surgical changes from left total hip arthroplasty.
Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.
[**2158-2-19**] CXR No evidence of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 58M hx CAD with LAD and ?other stents 9 years prior, hep C, HTN, HLP who presented to OSH for elective L hip ORIF.
In PACU, developed substernal chest pressure, was found to have ST elevations in V2-V4 and transferred for cath.
# CAD:  Unclear history of cardiac disease, has had at least one stent to the LAD ~9 years prior.
Post-operatively had ST elevations in the precordial leads.
Was plavix loaded, put on hep gtt without [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325, atorva 80, was on a nitro gtt for hypertension and received lopressor 5 IV x2.
Cath showed large LAD thrombus in the old stent, s/p thrombectomy with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**].
EKG after stent showed resolution of ST elevations.
# PEA: On [**2158-2-14**], patient experienced a PEA arrest.
Likely vagal episode (nausea prior to event) versus hypovolemia (blood loss into RP versus into hip).
No further PEA episodes.
# L hip ORIF:  s/p elective surgery.
Possible site of bleeding for PEA etiology.
Ortho was not concerned for compartment syndrome currently.
LIkely [**3-15**] inflammation from recent hip surgery and cardiac manipulation.
UA and CXR were negative for infection.
# CHF:  No history of CHF.
Appears hemodynamically stable without evidence of pulmonary congestion.
In setting of volume resuscitation/blood and anterior [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] monitor fluid status and oxygenation.
# HLD: increased atorvastatin to 80 daily.
Percocet 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours: please hold for sedation, do not take if you are drowsy or are having difficulty breathing.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 2203**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction, PEA Arrest Secondary: s/p Open Reduction Internal Fixation, Acute Blood Loss   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
This episode was probably due to some blood loss during your surgery, and you had no further episodes during your hospitalization.
We monitored your hematocrit (a measure of your blood levels) and found that it was dropping, probably due to slow ongoing bleeding into your left hip.
