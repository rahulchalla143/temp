No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS The patient is A-paced and is on no inotropes.
There is a new bioprosthetic aortic valve which appears to be wellseated without evidence of paravalvular leak.
There is no aortic insufficiency.
Trace mitral valve regurgitation persists.
Shortly after arrival to the CVICU, she experienced a brief episode of VT/VF and cardiac arrest.
