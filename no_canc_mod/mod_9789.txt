Briefly 70 year old patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension s/p TIPS shunt placement in 04, with refractory ascites, grade I varices and atrial fibrillation not on tranplant list admitted s/p redo TIPS procedure.
Pt had episodes of encephalopathy and ascites requiring repeat paracentesis despite diuretics and was found to have occluded TIPS on ultrasound on [**12-18**] which was performed to evaluate heterogeneity seen on previous ultrasounds.
Patient underwent redo TIPS on [**1-28**] and was found to have portal vein thrombosis causing poor flow through the TIPS with a gradient of only 15.
They injected 10mg of TPA and ballooned the area in an attempt to break up the clot.
Patient became encephalopathic post TIPS.
Patient was found to have decreased PO intake the day prior to admission.
Head CT showed evidence of hydrocephalus.
Neurology was called and they stated that the study is consistent with NPH and this should not cause acute change in mental status.
CXR was concerning for RLL consolidation.
He was encephalopathic and unable to answer questions appropraitely.
Syncope [**3-13**] cardiac conduction abnormalities with PPM placed this admission 2.

Recv'd epidural steroid injection [**2123-8-29**] 7.
Stable mild macrocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia at OSH prior to this admission 10.

Reportedly indep in ADLs, needs help with IADL's secondary to confusion.

Aside from mild atelectasis at the base of the right lung is clear, opacification in the left lower lung is more severe, usually due to atelectasis but not excluding pneumonia.
There is no pulmonary edema, no pneumothorax.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are still in place.
No definite acute hemorrhage is seen.
There is low density in the left inferior cerebellum which may be artifactual, may represent age-indeterminate ischemia.
There has been interval increase in size of ventricles since the prior study, also with progressive periventricular hypodensity.
This could represent progression of small vessel ischemic sequela, but communicating hydrocephalus cannot be entirely excluded.Recommend clinical correlation.
Cardiac Echo [**2-1**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
The chronicity of this occlusion is unknown though per report the patient is not having acute symptoms.
Cardiomegaly, coronary artery disease, atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and great vessels.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
Nonspecific enlarged nodes in the axillae, mediastinum, and hilar regions.
Cirrhosis and gynecomastia.
Moderate ascites.
Limited exam of the left lower extremity demonstrating normal compressibility without evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 YO gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory ascites s/p TIPS in [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now s/p redo TIPS on [**1-28**] with portal vein thrombosis s/p redo TIPS on [**1-30**].
Pt intubated on [**2124-2-1**] for airway protection secondary to agitation and encephalopathy.
TTE showed right heart strain but CTA was negative for PE.
He was empirically treated with Vanc/Zosyn for possible HAP given infiltrates on CXR and hypoxia but abx were discontinued [**2-3**] since pt developed a rash and did not have any clear source of infection with no positive culture data and no fever or elevated WBC.
MICU and GI team were unable to place an NGT for lactulose and rifaximin despite multiple attempts, most likely secondary to known esophageal stricture.
