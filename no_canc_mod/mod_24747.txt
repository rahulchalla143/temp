The hematoma is most prominent over the right frontal lobe.
It has both acute and subacute components.
Over the region of the right frontal lobe, there is intermediate T1 and T2 weighted signal intensity material which may be due to a component of acute blood.
The subdural hematoma measures 1.5cm in maximal thickness and extends for length of at least 11.8 cm in the anterior to posterior dimension.
There is mass effect upon the right cerebral hemisphere by the subdural hematoma and approximately 5mm midline shift towards the left side.
The ventricles are mildly prominent consistent with mild atrophy.
No acute cerebral infarction is noted.
CT Head [**9-20**] (done at [**Hospital1 18**]): There is a mixed density subdural hematoma along the right frontal convexity, measuring up to 15 mm in thickness.
No other extraaxial hemorrhage is visualized.
There is associated mild leftward shift of the midline structures up to 6 mm but the basal cisterns are not effaced.
There is no hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION:  Mixed density right subdural hematoma, with mild leftward subfalcine herniation.
Head CT [**9-21**] Stable appearance of acute on chronic right subdural hematoma with mild leftward shift of normally midline structures.
