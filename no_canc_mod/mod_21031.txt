Admission Date:  [**2163-2-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2163-2-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-4-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with recent right total knee replacement in [**2162-11-25**].
Rehabilitation stay complicated by a left hip fracture.
At [**Hospital3 **], she was found to have a temperature of 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit as well as a desaturation to 89% on room air and 95% on 2 liters with decreased breath sounds at both bases.
On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient complained of low back pain that was related to position, and she stated this had been going on for weeks.
She denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
She also reported about one week of a cough productive of yellow and green sputum with no hemoptysis.
Urinalysis was consistent with a urinary tract infection.
An abdominal computed tomography showed no diverticulitis but a question of left lower lobe consolidation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.
Diabetes mellitus (on insulin).
Chronic renal insufficiency (with an unknown baseline creatinine).
History of urinary tract infection.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Positive for heartburn.
In general, she was an upset female in no acute distress.
There was no lymphadenopathy.
The lungs had diffuse scattered rhonchi, and there were decreased breath sounds at both bases.
Slight bilateral left quadrant tenderness.
There was no rebound or guarding.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
On neurologic examination, she was alert and oriented times three with no focal signs.
Back revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.018, large blood, nitrite positive, moderate leukocyte esterase, 500 protein, trace ketones, more than 50 red blood cells, and more than 50 white blood cells.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the abdomen revealed no appendicitis.
There was sigmoid diverticulosis with no diverticulitis.
There were hyperdense right renal cysts.
There was a left lower lobe consolidation thought to represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
A chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe consolidation.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 77-year-old woman with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recent orthopaedic procedures who presented from rehabilitation with fever, back pain, and hypoxia.
Sources were felt to be either the patient's newly installed prostheses, her heart, or her back.
Plain films of the prostheses were unremarkable, and there was no significant pain upon moving her right knee or left hip.
Therefore, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on [**2-9**] which showed global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 25%; most consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
There was 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation with a right atrium to right ventricular gradient to 36 mmHg.
There was 2+ mitral regurgitation.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine was a poor study because of motion artifact that showed abnormal signal from L1 to L5 with probable epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, and L5-S1 discitis.
It was unclear how this abscess developed.
This clearly demonstrated an L5-S1 discitis with an epidural abscess and osteomyelitis.
BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  As mentioned, the patient had blood cultures positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was afebrile from [**2-3**] through the time of this dictation ([**2-17**]).
QUESTION OF ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have increasing oxygen requirements with thick secretions.
Given the patient's depressed mental status (see below), there was concern for aspiration pneumonia.
A chest x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis that had increased on the right along with a right-sided effusion.
A sputum culture grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that was resistant to levofloxacin and sensitive to piperacillin tazobactam.
On [**2-17**], the piperacillin tazobactam was discontinued because of a concern of acute interstitial nephritis.
CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS ISSUES:  Over the first week of the hospitalization, the patient's mental status deteriorated.
This was felt to be secondary to delirium from infection.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient was briefly in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
She did not have a known history of atrial fibrillation.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was found to have an ejection fraction of 25% and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
There was no known prior history of congestive heart failure.
It was unclear when the patient developed systolic dysfunction.
It was presumed that she had multivessel coronary artery disease from the multifocal wall motion abnormalities noted on echocardiogram.
She was not felt to be in any significant amount of pulmonary edema at any time up to the point of this dictation.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had deteriorating renal function from [**2-13**] when her creatinine was 1.1 to [**2-17**] when it was 2.1.
The urine was evaluated by the Nephrology team and felt to be bland sediment.
Gentamicin-induced acute tubular necrosis remained a possibility.
Her fractional secretion of sodium was 6.9%, so a prerenal problem was unlikely.
ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient had an anemia that was of unclear etiology.
ORAL HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient developed oral lesions that were felt to be consistent with herpes simplex virus.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE/ASTHMA ISSUES: The patient has been on prednisone 5 mg by mouth once per day for a long time, and this was continued.
ACCESS ISSUES:  On [**2-7**], the patient was without peripheral access, and multiple attempts were unsuccessful to achieve access.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was evaluated by the Swallow Service who felt that she was a high aspiration risk due to impaired swallow function.
An nasogastric tube was placed, and she received approximately three days of full-strength tube feeds prior to proceeding to the operating room for epidural abscess debridement.
COAGULOPATHY ISSUES:  The patient had an INR of approximately 2 for the first and second weeks of her hospitalization which was likely secondary to malnutrition and vitamin K deficiency in her diet.
