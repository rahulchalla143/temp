The pregnancy was remarkable for IVF assistance and was complicated by preterm labor and shortened cervix resulting in admission for the mother at 24 weeks and again at 30 weeks.
Her last ultrasound was on [**12-26**] and showed an estimated fetal weight at the 24th percentile with a biophysical profile of [**8-14**].
There was no maternal fever.
Of note, mother was in the midst of treatment for a urinary tract infection with Macrobid.
At delivery, baby boy [**Name (NI) **] emerged with moderate tone and spontaneous cry, becoming more vigorous with drying and stimulation.
Blow-by oxygen was needed for duskiness with good improvement.
In general, baby boy [**Name (NI) **] was a well-developed, premature male infant who was responsive to exam with mildly reduced spontaneous activity.
His skin was noted to be pink, mildly pale, warm, without rashes or bruising.
HEENT exam revealed anterior fontanelle that was soft and flat, mild molding, normal ears and nares, intact palate, supple neck, and moist mucous membranes.
His chest exam revealed moderate aeration with coarse breath sounds bilaterally and mild to moderate grunting and retractions.
His cardiac exam showed a heart that was regular rate and rhythm without a murmur and capillary refill time that was 1-2 seconds.
His abdomen was soft without hepatosplenomegaly, without mass, with a 3-vessel cord, and with some quiet bowel sounds appreciated.
Extremities were notable for hips and back that were grossly normal without lesion.

He has had apnea     of prematurity for which he was monitored, but did not     require treatment with caffeine.
He has intermittently been noted to have a soft     murmur on exam which is consistent with peripheral     pulmonary stenosis.
His     maximum bilirubin was 10.2 with a direct component of 0.3     and his rebound was 5.4 with a direct component of 0.2.
Infectious Disease: Baby boy [**Known lastname **] received antibiotics     for rule out sepsis on admission.
He has had no other infectious issues and has     not required any other antibiotics.
Neurologic: Baby boy [**Known lastname **] has had a normal neurologic     exam during his hospital stay and did not require     screening for intraventricular hemorrhage secondary to     his gestational age.
He did not require an eye exam for retinopathy     of prematurity because his gestational age was greater     than 32 weeks.
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following 3 criteria - i) born at less than 32 weeks; ii) born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the following - day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; or iii) with chronic lung disease.
Before this age (and for the first 24 months of the child's life), immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Prematurity at 32-3/7 weeks gestation.
Respiratory distress syndrome - resolved.
