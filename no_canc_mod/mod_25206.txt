Unfortunately she did not improve and re-presented to the [**Hospital 1562**] hospital ED with SOB/dyspnea and a dry cough.
Repeat films showed multifocal infiltrates and it was felt she had either aspiration or atypical pna.
She was admitted and underwent an extensive pulmonary workup including multiple Chest CTs and trials on antibiotics/antifungals and antiviral medications.
No cultures or laboratory tests identified a specific diagnosis or etiology for infection.
Additionally she did not have relief from her symptoms and radiographic evidence did not suggest that her pulmonary process was resolving.
She did undergo bronchoscopy with BAL but this was not revealing for any gross disease or disorder of the upper airway.
Ultimately it was felt that she had an acute intersitial pneumonitis and will undergo a wedge biopsy to obtain lung tissue for pathologic diagnosis.
