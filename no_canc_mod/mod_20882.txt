Admission Date: [**2192-11-8**]        Discharge Date: [**2192-11-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-9-2**]        Sex:  F  Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who presented initially with progressive exertional leg pain and initially admitted for lower extremity angiogram and was transferred to the CCU status post repair of femoral artery puncture complications.
The patient has had complaints of pain in her legs during her ADLs, especially climbing stairs for about 1 year.
She described the pain as burning in her thighs and aching in her legs.
No apparent tenderness was reported in her calves.
MRI/MRA done on admission showed atretic left kidney with 95% stenosis of proximal renal artery and 95% stenosis origin of right common iliac artery.
MRI also revealed profound stenosis of origin of left common iliac artery.
She was admitted on [**2192-11-8**], for lower extremity angiography with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**].
In the cath lab, the patient had 95% renal artery stenosis, 90% stenosis of right and left common iliac artery and underwent stenting bilateral CIAs and right renal artery which was complicated by a femoral bleed since the patient was on heparin and a loading dose, was off Plavix.
She had 400 cc of urine output with an estimated blood loss of 50 cc.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to cephalosporins which give her a rash, Effexor which gives her shaking and Norvasc and tape.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg, Lipitor 10 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, Actonel 35 mg on Saturdays, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., lisinopril 40 daily, Vagifem 3 times a week and Tylenol 325 mg for pain p.r.n.
Carotid pulses were 2+, no bruits were auscultated.
There were some crackles at the bases.
Cardiovascular exam showed normal S1 and S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
She had bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
She had diffuse ecchymosis at the groin sites.
She had no femoral bruits.
Excerpt from the operative report by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] during the cardiac catheterization, the patient developed profuse hemorrhage from the right femoral artery.
Hemorrhaging was controlled with direct pressure, however, the bleeding continued and vascular surgery was consulted and the patient was taken urgently to the operating room.
Electrocardiogram performed on [**2192-11-8**], showed sinus bradycardia.
She had nondiagnostic ST-T waves and Q waves and early R wave progression, prominent T waves in leads V1 through V2 which suggested possible old inferior and posterior myocardial infarction.
No previous tracing was available for comparison.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 65 year old female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking who presented initially with progressive exertional leg pain, admitted for lower extremity angiography by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] transferred to the CCU status post surgical repair femoral artery puncture by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She had some hemodynamic instability with mean arterial pressures of 55 to 60 overnight with wide pulse pressure, presumably due to noncompliant vessels which was corrected with fluid boluses.
Hematocrit dropped from 32 to 29 but she received a lot of fluids so the drop in hematocrit was attributed to dilution and no transfusion was done.
Even though she got fluids, this was attributed to be a hematocrit drop and she was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
We considered CT of abdomen and ultrasound if the hematocrit continues to fall but stayed stable around 30 so no further imaging was supposed to be necessary.
The patient continued to experience pain across the medial right thigh.
At this point, vascular surgery has signed off and had no further recommendations.
Except for the postoperative period, the patient's blood pressure continued to be elevated and ranged from 120 to 198/74 to 78.
Chronic renal insufficiency: She was admitted with a creatinine of 2.7 which improved with fluids.
The patient did not have any complications status post removal of triple lumen catheter.
