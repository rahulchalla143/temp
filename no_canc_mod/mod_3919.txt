History of Present Illness: 65 year old famale with a known history of CAD s/p MI, [**2154**] and angioplasty of RCA lesion, s/p RCA stent [**2156**], s/p [**2158**] angiojet and stenting of the mid-RCA .5 x 15 mm, Multilink stent, s/p [**2159**] mid RCA using one 3.5mm x 25mm Multilink stent, s/p IMI in [**2170**] at [**Hospital3 **].
She presented to ED on [**2172-5-20**] with reports of frequent falls, weakness, headache and dizziness accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhea for one week.
A CT of the head showed cortical atrophy, old lacunar infarcts bilaterally in the basal ganglia, small vessel disease, some asymmetry of the periventricular white matter to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right frontal lobe.
She was admitted for hydration and developed chest pain shortly after her admission.
She was found to be in atrial fibrillation and was admitted to the ICU, was started on amiodarone and converted to SR. She continued to have chest discomfort and subsequently underwent a stress test that revealed an inferior defect with inferior infarct.
She presently denies chest pain.
She was transferred for further evaluation and for a cardiac catheterization.

Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  demonstrated severe 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had an 80% mid-vessel lesion prior to an aneurysm with collaterals to the RCA and LCx.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
Severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
CABG evaluation; discontinue Clopidogrel  [**2172-6-2**] Carotid Ultrasound There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
No flow within the right vertebral artery  ECHO [**2172-6-5**] Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferobasal dyskinesis, inferior mid hypokiensis, Lateral hypokinesis is seen at the base and mid level.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is borderline moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2cm2 by contiuity and plainemtry ).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Again seen is evidence of prior sternotomy, with cardiomegaly; left base opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation; probable pleural fluid; upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, consistent with mild CHF; and blunting, atelectasis and scarring at the right lung base.
No pneumothorax detected.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4343**]    Brief Hospital Course: Transferred in from outside hospital for cardiac catheterization after ruling in for non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Cardiac catheterization revealed significant coronary artery disease and surgery was consulted.
She received cefazolin and vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative management.
On post operative day three she was found to be somulent with increased work of breathing.
With expiratory wheezes she was treated with nebulizers and lasix for diuresis with no improvement.
She was also in and out of atrial fibrillation at a rapid rate and was started on Amiodorone and had her beta blocker increased.
