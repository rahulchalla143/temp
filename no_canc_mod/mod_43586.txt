The patient also has a PMH significant for chronic anemia, internal hemorrhoids, gastritis, ischemic colitis, and AVMs in his small bowel and colon.
Of note, Mr [**Known lastname 101054**] received a colonoscopy 2 weeks ago for acute on chronic anemia (his Hct had drifted down to 17.9), and his colonoscopy was normal.
While having the bloody stool yesterday the pt denied nausea, vomiting, abdoinal pain or discomfort.
Rectal exam notable for guaiac + brown to marroon stool but otherwise abdomen benign.
Pt underwent EGD today which showed gastritis but no active bleeding.
Also + for chronic diarrhea over the past 6 months (pt thinks this has correlated with decreasing his methadone dose).

# GI bleed:  Given hematocrit drop to 20.7 from most recent of 27.4, patient was admitted to ICU.
The following day, he underwent EGD and was found to have esophageal varices, erosive gastritis in the setting of portal hypertensive gastritis, duodenitis but otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.
Given concern that esophageal varices may represent worsening liver disease, liver ultrasound was obtained.
This showed slightly nodular surface and enlargement of the left lobe, suggesting cirrhosis, without evidence of a focal lesions.
GI recommended that the patient get a capsule endoscopy as an outpatient given concern for AV malformations or other small bowel pathology causing the melena.
He did finally have one small melenotic stool the afternoon of [**2190-2-11**], but his hematocrit was stable at 28 on discharge.
He should continue to get daily hematocrit checks until his melena stops and his hematocrit is stable.
# Pancreatic mass: An incidental finding on the patient's liver ultrasound was a hypoechoic region that measured 3.0 x 2.8 x 1.9 cm.
It was difficult to assess whether this region represented part of the duodenum or arises from the pancreatic head or ampulla.
He should get a CT abdomen with contrast with pancreatic sequencing.
# Hepatitis:  The patient has suggestion of cirrhosis on liver ultrasound.
He does not follow with a hepatologist and has never had therapy for his hepatitis.
# End stage renal disease: The patient normally receives dialysis on T/Th/Saturday.
# Diabetes type II: The patient's last HbA1c was 5.5 on [**11-2**].
# Upper extremity edema/facial edema.
The patient was noted to have significant left arm and facial edema.
Per OMR records he presented with this back in Novermber [**2188**] and underwent full work up with ultrasound, CT and MR venography which all did not show evidence of clot.
He did not receive DVT prophylactic anticoagulation during this hospitalization given the concern for GI bleeding.

You had an upper endoscopy which showed that you have Esophageal varices, Erosive gastritis in the setting of portal hypertensive gastritis, and Duodenitis.
This showed that your liver may have some cirrhosis.
