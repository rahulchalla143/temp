Admission Date:  [**2191-2-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-2-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**] Chief Complaint: cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 84yo woman with h/o HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DCIS s/p resection & XRT who presented on [**2191-2-11**] w/ productive cough and SOB.
Pt denied fevers at home, sick contacts, does not recall if she received the flu vaccine this year.
ROS notable for decreased appetite and possible wt loss, though not clear how much.
Pt was noted to have rhonchi at RLL.
CXR notable for small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atalectasis.
Also, had episode of hypotension w/ drop in SBP to 80's.
She also received levoflox 750mg PO x 1 in ED for possible PNA as well as tx of UTI.
She required no pressors.
No PE was seen.
There was, however, near complete collapse of the right and left lower lobe likely due to "soft tissue and fluid density" within the lower lobe bronchi (possibly mucous vs. endoluminal lesion).
A patchy opacity was seen in the RUL, which [**Hospital1 **] read as concerning for PNA.
Cough is still present and productive of yellow-whitish sputum.

Large amount of atelectasis, with complete collapse of the right lower lobe and near complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
Underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Bronchoscopy could be helpful for further evaluation, especially given the  dense material within the lower lobe bronchi.
Patchy opacities seen in the right upper lobe,  consistent with pneumonia.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
CXR ([**2-12**]): There has been no radiographic change.
An irregular area of heterogeneous opacity at the left lung base could represent pneumonia, alternatively atelectasis, unchanged in configuration since earlier in the day on [**2-11**], but not since 6:06 p.m.  Opacification at the right lung base is more likely pleural effusion and atelectasis, and not pneumonia.
On the other hand there is a new region of heterogeneous opacity in the right upper lung projecting over the head of the clavicle which could be superimposition of the bones and a dilated upper lobe and mediastinal vessels, but should be re-examined later in the day as a second possible focus of infection.
Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2191-2-11**] 12:59 PM AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 1310 HOURS: Hazy opacity overlies the right lower lung, somewhat obscuring the right hemidiaphragm.
No obvious pleural effusion is seen; however, small bilateral layering pleural effusions with adjacent atalectasis may be present.
There is no hilar lymphadenopathy.
Possible small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atalectasis.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2191-2-12**] 3:50 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 6:06 p.m. [**2-11**]: There has been no radiographic change.
An irregular area of heterogeneous opacity at the left lung base could represent pneumonia, alternatively atelectasis, unchanged in configuration since earlier in the day on [**2-11**], but not since 6:06 p.m. Opacification at the right lung base is more likely pleural effusion and atelectasis, and not pneumonia.
On the other hand there is a new region of heterogeneous opacity in the right upper lung projecting over the head of the clavicle which could be superimposition of the bones and a dilated upper lobe and mediastinal vessels, but should be re-examined later in the day as a second possible focus of infection.
Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
There has been considerable interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectases.
A small residual right-sided pleural effusion is present.
A consolidation in the right upper lobe persists, but has partly resolved.
Moderate cardiomegaly and calcifications in the aortic arch are unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in pleural effusions and right upper lobe consolidation.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2188-6-2**] no change.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 84 yo woman w/ history of HTN,hypercholesterolemia, DCIS s/p resection/XRT [**2187**] who p/w productive cough, hypoxemia, and low-grade fever.
# Pneumonia: The patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit due to CPAP requirement in the ED and hypotension.
She required no pressors.
No PE was seen.
There was, however, near complete collapse of the right and left lower lobe likely due to "soft tissue and fluid density" within the lower lobe bronchi (possibly mucous vs. endoluminal lesion).
A patchy opacity was seen in the RUL, which [**Year (4 digits) **] read as concerning for PNA.
She had frequent cough with copious production of sputum and frequent chest PT, incentive spirometry, and OOB to chair was performed.
She was continued on ceftriaxone and azithromycin and additional induced sputums were performed to rule out tuberculosis.
Transiently low BP in ED, R IJ placed for hypotension in MICU - BP responded to fluid resuscitation, suggesting component of hypovolemia.
# Anemia - patient was noted to be anemic and she is advised to follow up with PCP for further evaluation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: right upper lobe pneumonia right lower lobe collapse Hypotension Anemia  Secondary: - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - DCIS s/p resection & XRT in [**2187**] - Osteopenia  Discharge Condition: good, no oxygen requirement   Discharge Instructions: You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for pneumonia.
You were also tested for tuberculosis, which was negative.
You should call your primary care provider or return to the emergency department if you experience shortness of breath, fevers/chills greater than 101.5 degrees F, worsening cough, blood in your cough, chest pain, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, or any other symptoms that concern you.
