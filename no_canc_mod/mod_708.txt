Right CP angle inferior most aspect is excluded.
The imaged portions of the lungs appear clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: No acute findings in the chest.
[**3-21**] LUE NONVASCULAR ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: Transverse and sagittal images were obtained of the left upper arm at the area of interest indicated by the patient.
There is no fluid collection seen within the superficial tissues.
No suspicious soft tissue mass is identified.
IMPRESSION: No fluid collection or other signs of infection seen in the left upper arm.
[**3-20**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 138 bpm.
Normal axis and intervals (QTc = 414); No ST-T wave changes.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 64 yo M w/ h/o ESRD [**3-1**] lithium toxicity being evaluated for renal transplant admitted with fevers at dialysis, no source identified by exam/imaging/labs, discharged home after he was afebrile 24h off antibiotics.
# Fever/hypotension on admission: Admitted to ICU with concern for SIRS, w/fever to 104, relative hypotension (105->93 systolic evolved in the ED), elevated WBC and tachycardia.
Renal consult team evaluated fistula and felt there was mild warmth but no erythema; follow-up AVF ultrasound non-concerning for inflammation.
No evidence of thrombus on exam.
Antibiotics were stopped the morning of [**3-22**]; he remained afebrile for 24h thereafter, so was discharged home with instructions to check temperature [**Hospital1 **] and call PCP if [**Name Initial (PRE) **]>101, subjective fever or malaise.
ICU d/w PCP reveals this to be a chronic issue, already evaluated by heme/onc at [**Company 2860**] a few months ago and thought to be a med effect; no known med changes since that time.
Peripheral smear was evaluated by hematology fellow who saw microcytic hypochromic RBCs and some atypical lymphocytes but no teardrop and no dysplasia.
# ESRD on HD: Pt has ESRD secondary to lithium toxicity, dialysis initiated in [**8-/2107**] via LUE AVF without difficulty at [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] for renal transplant.
He was continued on HD qTuThSat, with no difficulty accessing LUE AVF.
# Elevated Anion Gap on admission: Anion gap of 14 on admission, likely secondary to lactate of 2.3 in setting of relative hypoperfusion, since resolved with PO hydration.
13. sennosides 17.2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
You were feeling well and had no concerning results on labs, x-rays or examination.
Your PCP may consider referring you back to see your hematologist at [**Hospital1 4601**] for re-evaluation of your low blood counts.
