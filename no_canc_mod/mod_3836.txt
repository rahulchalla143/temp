No concerning liver lesion identified; however, visualization of the liver is limited.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Mild splenomegaly.
Small simple left renal cyst.
TTE [**2143-4-18**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
This results in crowding of bronchovascular structures.
No gross areas of consolidation are identified, and there are no definite pleural effusions, although exclusion of left lateral costophrenic sulcus from the radiograph limits this assessment.
Brief Hospital Course:   Pt is a 45 y/o male who presented with alcohol withdrawal, transferred to the ICU for management of withdrawal and alcoholic hepatitis  Active Problems:  # Alcohol withdrawal: Last drink on the afternoon of [**2143-4-15**] and he had been drinking up to 1.5L wine per day for an extended period of time.
On the floor he continued a very slow valium taper and required intermittent valium dosing for anxiety, tremulousness and tachycardia for about a week.
He continued to be anxious at the time of discharge, and close follow-up was arranged.
# Alcholic Hepatitis:  Pt presented with classic AST:ALT ratio of 2:1, as well as an elevated INR and rising T bili.
A dobhoff was also placed on HD #2 for increased nutrition.
Although a 28 day course of steroids was planned, he was very anxious and tremulousness despite successfully being weaned off benzodiazepines and it was felt that steroids may be contributing and they were stopped.
# Thrombocytopenia: He had thrombocytopenia on admission felt to be related to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
He stayed in the hospital a few extra days as he lives on the [**Location (un) 10043**] at home and was having difficulty navigating stairs.
You also had abnormal liver function tests which suggests you have inflammation of your liver due to alcohol.
You were admitted to the ICU for management of withdrawal and then transferred to the floor.
