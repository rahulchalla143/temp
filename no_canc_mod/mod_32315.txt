No acute intracranial injury identified.
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Interval accumulation of fluid in the right sphenoid sinus with diffuse mucosal thickening throughout the other paranasal sinuses, which i commonly seen in intubated patients.
[**2116-10-7**] EEG: Abnormal portable EEG due to the very low voltage background with usually slower frequencies as the predominant rhythm but with some widespread faster activity superimposed, and all without a  typical antero-posterior gradient.
These findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy, and the faster frequencies and low voltage raise the possibility of medication as a cause of that encephalopathy.
Nevertheless, there were no areas of prominent focal slowing (although encephalopathies may obscure focal findings), and there were no epileptiform features.
[**2116-10-7**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: No evidence for acute intracranial abnormality.
Small bilateral frontal subdural fluid collections, likely hygromas.
No abnormal signal intensity or diffusion abnormalities detected in the brain to suggest hemorrhage, infarction, or other neuronal injury.
No evidence of fracture, hemorrhage, or edema.
No significant change since three days prior.
Right frontal soft tissue swelling.
Initial toxicology screens were only positive for EtOH.
He remained minimally responsive and dysarthric during the first several days of admission.
Repeat head CT did not reveal any changes.
Subsequent EEG showed widespread encephalopathy and MRI did not show any acute changes.
He sustained several falls while on the regular nursing unit; no significant injuries were sustained.
On repeat head CT  there was a slight increase in right frontal soft-tissue swelling.
Occupational therapy worked with him for cognitive therapy.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p ?Fall Traumatic brain injury without brain hemorrhage Right frontal laceration   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, tolerating a regular diet, pain adequately controlled.
Because of your fall you did sustain an mild traumatic head injury; it is not uncommon to experience periods of dizziness, with headchaes, you may even become forgetful at times.
These symptoms usually do get better over sevral weeks to several months.
Return to the Emergecny room if you develop headaches that won't go away, changes in your vision, seizure activity, fevers, shortness of breath, nausea, vomitng, diarrhea and/or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
