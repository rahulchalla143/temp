Per her aide the patient has had chronic left lower leg edema (history of L hip fracture) and in the last several weeks has developed new RLE edema.
She has also had significant decrease in appetite in the last several weeks to the point that this week she was only eating a few bites at each meal.
Today her aide was concerned that she was having episodes of decreased responsiveness.
Physical exam was positive for elevated JVD and lower extremity edema.
CXR was concerning for a right middle lobe infiltrate.
She was given a total of 3 L IV NS for her hypotension with only a minimal response.

She reports a history of chest pain but no recent episodes.
She denies any loss of consciousness.

DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Patchy right base opacity, raises concern for infection and/or aspiration.
Prominent bronchi with peribronchial thickening are noted in the right infrahilar region, suggestive of bronchiectasis and possible chronic inflammation.
Limited study by motion artifacts, but no evidence of hemorrhage.
Moderate global atrophy, likely age related.
Moderate-to-significant chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
Fluid in left mastoid air cells.
Moderate-to-large right and moderate left simple-appearing pleural effusions with intrafissural fluid on the right.
There collapse/consolidation of both right and left lower lobes, likely related to compression atelectasis, although superinfection cannot be excluded.
Severe mitral annular calcification.
4-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule is likely benign; however, if the patient is at high risk for intrathoracic malignancy, a followup chest CT in one year can be obtained to document stability [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] Society guidelines.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation (however may be underestimated due to shadowing).
There is moderate posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No high-grade cervical or thoracic spinal canal narrowing.
High signal within the central mid-thoracic spinal cord may represent a syrinx or prominent central canal.
Hetrogeneous thoracic aorta flow void, which may represent low flow or artifact.
[**2178-8-27**] MRI HEAD: There is no evidence of acute infarct or mass.
Again demonstrated is extensive increased FLAIR/T2 signal within the cerebral white matter and brainstem compatible with underlying microvascular changes.
There is a focal chronic lacunar infarct in the left pons without diffusion restriction.
A region of susceptibility artifact within the left thalamus has no correlate on the recent CT and shows no surrounding edema, likely a remote focus of hemorrhage or a small microcalcification.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Age-related volume loss with microvascular changes.
No evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
[**2178-8-27**] US RUE: Thrombosis of the left brachial vein  [**2178-9-3**] EEG: Abnormal EEG due to the slow and disorganized background.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no persistent areas of focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
Unchanged appearance of bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with associated atelectasis and retrocardiac opacity.
DISCHARGE LABS:             WBC  Hgb  Hct  Plt Ct [**2178-9-14**]  5.3  7.8  24.6  331             Glucose UreaN Creat Na   K   Cl HCO3 [**2178-9-14**].1  140 3.9 105 30   Brief Hospital Course: HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Shortly after admission Ms. [**Known lastname 107551**] had an episode of unresponsiveness in the ICU, similar to what had been happening in the nursing home according to her health aide.
Her ABG revealed hypercarbia of pCO2 79.
She is without any known chronic lung disease, though recent labs from [**2178-8-20**] did show HCO3 of 38 suggesting this may be a chronic process.
She had altered mental status and required non-invasive ventillation.
However, overnight from [**Date range (1) 3923**]/10, she developed unresponsiveness and apnea with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation for a PCO2 of 78.
It was felt that her hypercarbic respiratory failure was not fully reversible and she underwent trach/PEG placement on [**9-9**] without complications.
Health Care Associated Pneumonia: She received a seven-day course of vancomycin and cefepime for healthcare-associated pneumonia beginning on admission.
Given her multiple episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure and concern for repeated need for intubation, the family decided to proceed with tracheostomy which was done without complication.
Her hyponatremia and hypovolemia on admission was consistent with this (a so called tea-and-toast diet).
She had a swallow evaluation on [**2178-8-25**] which showed no overt signs of aspiration.
She had a PEG placed on [**9-9**] without complication and tube feeds were running at goal.
She was continued on vancomycin and cefepime for possible [**Company 191**] pneumonia and was weaned from levophed by [**2178-8-24**].
Transthoracic echo from [**2178-8-25**] showed EF 55% with no wall motion abnormalities and minimal valvular disease, suggesting against cardiogenic source for hypotension.
She was treated for severe c/ diff with iv flagyl and po vancomycin (day 1 = [**9-5**]) for a total of 2 weeks.
Her family remarked she has had bleeding complications while on coumadin in the past and has a history of hemorrhagic CVA.
Her family was concerned her wishes to be DNR/DNI and her refusal for a feeding tube, which were both expressed to mulitple housestaff and nurses, were the result of her depression and that these are not her true wishes.
Geriatrics was consulted on [**2178-8-26**] to help address the issue of depression and general goals of care with the family.
They recommended starting no new meds for now given concern for polypharmacy on patient's mentation.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient occasionally had rapid ventricular response.
