That night she underwent attempted exploratory laparotomy for intra-abdominal abscess from anastomotic leak.
There was evidence on CT abdomen of enteral fistula into the abscess cavity as well.
She remained in sinus tachycardia with heart rate ranging 100-130s.
There was no evidence of myocardial injury.
She was hypotensive and initially required neosynephrine gtt, which was weaned.
She was intubated episodically for invasive procedures.
Infectious work-up found enterobacter pneumonia on broncheoalveolar lavage on [**2110-8-5**], and this was treated with a two-week course of meropenem.
She had h/o bilateral nephrectomy.
Post-operative course was complicated by Candidemia found on blood cultures on [**2110-7-28**], which was treated with Ambisome ([**8-2**] thru [**8-15**])then Micafungin [**8-15**] thru [**8-24**]).
Retinal specialist found changes indicating only tuberous sclerosis.
She had no acutely anemic events.
R Temporary HD line was removed on [**9-2**] when she had head/neck and bilateral arm edema.
CTA venogram on [**9-3**] demonstrated partially occlusive thrombus within the right subclavian vein near the thoracic inlet with probable occlusion of the right internal jugular vein.
Abdominal CT with po contrast was done on [**9-8**] showing decreased size of LUQ collection with extravasated enteric contrast with pigtail catheter positioned appropriately.
Bibasilar pulmonary consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
Contrast was seen entering the lumen of the colon through a fistula track measuring approximately 5 mm in width.
This was done,and was negative for vegetations, but was a sub-optimal study.
US of the known right SVC/IJ was done to characterize previously known non-occlusive thrombus to rule out another source of bacterial seeding.
No thrombus was seen in the SVC/ distal IJ or right upper extremity.
Antibiotic plan was for 4 weeks for question endocarditis given that TEE was not done in setting of positive blood cultures.
