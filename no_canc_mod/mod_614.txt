Admission Date:  [**2166-7-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-8-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-2-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: seizure, hypoglycemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: trans-esophageal echocardiogram bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: 31yoF w/ h/o DM1, HTN, s/p left sided hemorrhagic CVA (3 yrs ago) s/p trach/PEG/chronically indwelling catheter presents to ED from [**Hospital **] rehab today after having had witnessed "tonic clonic" activity at which time her BS was found to be 30.
NH staff had also noted decreased alertness today prior to her seizure activity and hypoglycemia.
In review of her med list, she was started on ceftriaxone, vancomycin and inhaled tobramycin on [**7-10**] (planned for 2 wk course); abx were changed from levaquin/vanco when sputum grew cipro resistant klebsiella (sensitive to ceftriaxone).
was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 6957**] for sepsis (presumed pulmonary source).
Course was c/b probable VAP and she is s/p tracheostomy recannulation during last hospitalization as well as s/p PEG placement as she had been having increasing dysphagia at home.
Also during this past hospitalization, she was noted to be persistently febrile without clear e/o of persistet infection and in the absence of clear medication causes.
UA showed moderate bacteria, but only 0-2 WBCs and she has a chronic indwelling foley.
ROS:  Unable to obtain from patient   Past Medical History: # Diabetes Mellitus type 1 (dx at age 3), hx of hypoglycemic episodes # CVA (hemorrhagic) at 27 with residual aphasia and Right hemiparesis, tracheostomy post CVA now recannulated during recent [**6-/2166**] admission # Blindness in one eye # History of aspiration pneumonia # Although patient is on valproate, no reported history of seizures # Depression # Hyperthyroidism # Anemia (BL hct 22-25) # HTN # Gastroparesis # LV dysfunction .
Pertinent Results: [**2166-7-12**] CXR:  wet read without clear evidence of infiltrate.
[**2166-7-13**] sputum: sparse coag +staph = MRSA.
for c. diff .
[**7-14**] UCx: yeasts > 100K .
[**2166-7-15**] EEG: This is a mildly abnormal portable EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the disorganized and poorly sustained background.
There was no clear electrographic correlate for clinically observed episodes of eye fluttering or leg tremor.
There were no clearly focal, lateralized, or epileptiform features noted.
There were no electrographic seizures.
[**2166-7-16**] CT head: no significant change since [**2166-6-27**].
no new IC bleed or infarct .
[**2166-7-16**] CT abd/ pelvis: pneumonic infiltrate of RLL, no perinephric abscess, 4.5cm soft tissue mass in R breast (rec f/u with US) .
[**2166-7-18**] CT head: no significant interval change.
no new IC bleed .
[**2166-6-12**] Echo:  LVEF 30-40% [**1-10**] to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the apical half of the left ventricle, mild pulmonary htn.
[**2166-7-19**] Echo: Mild mitral leaflet thickening but without discrete vegetation or pathologic flow.
The focal thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet was also present on review of the prior study.
Severe bilateral athermatous disease of the intracranial internal carotid arteries.
Similar  encephalomalacic changes in the left frontal lobe.
Extensive T2 signal abnormality in the cerebral white matter, probably due to widespread chronic small vessel infarction.
No evidence of brain abscess or abnormal meningeal enhancement.
[**2166-7-25**] RLE US: neg for DVT .
[**2166-7-28**] CT head/ sinus: IMPRESSION:  Similar appearance of cystic encephalomalacia and other atrophic changes in the brain.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Interval improvement in extent of right lower lobe atelectasis, and development of small airspace opacity, that may represent pneumonia vs. reexpansion changes.
Right lower lobe airspace consolidation, likely representing atelectasis, underlying infection cannot be entirely excluded.
No drainable fluid collection.
[**2166-7-30**] EEG: intermittent sharp wave, as well as spike and slow wave discharges, seen in a multifocal fashion arising sometimes in a generalized distribution but also were seen independently in the bifrontal regions and the left temporal region.
Also noted were broad-based, high amplitude, blunted triphasic waves in the region of the left anterior temporal and temporal regions.
Discharges were not repetitive and there were no electrographic seizures noted.
These multifocal regions of discharges suggest areas of cortical irritability with potential for epileptogenesis.
Also persistent slowing over the left temporal regions in the setting of a persistent slow and disorganized background.
The otherwise slow and disorganized background rhythm suggests a more global and diffuse process consistent with an encephalopathy likely due to deeper midline or bilateral subcortical dysfunction.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infections, and anoxia are among the most common causes of encephalopathy.
[**2166-7-31**] TTE: could not be done as study is technically difficult - no additional information would be provided from previous .
Multifocal pneumonia with new left upper lobe and lingular infiltrates and no significant change to left lower lobe air bronchogram containing infiltrate.
Near complete resolution of previously identified patchy right lower lobe opacities.
No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
Unchanged atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and its branches as well as the coronary circulation much more prominent than expected for patient's age.
no evidence of bronchial obstruction.
[**8-7**] Bilat LE u/s: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in both lower extremities.
[**8-5**] Trans esophageal echo Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
A very small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mildly thickened mitral and aortic valve leaflets.
Trivial aortic and mitral regurgitation.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Small secundum atrial septal defect.
[**8-11**] CXR: Increased consolidation at left lung base which could represent pneumonia.
New development of left pleural effusion, small.
ANCA neg [**Doctor First Name **] neg dsDNA neg   Brief Hospital Course: # Fever:  Febrile to 101.6 in ED where she received IV ceftriaxone and vancomycin without clear infiltrate on CXR but has extensive h/o aspiration pneumonia and was recently treated for VAP for which she completed a course of meropenem and vancomycin prior to d/c on [**7-4**].
and tachycardia she met criteria for SIRS with no definitive source.
Did have elevated WBC count to 13.7, but no notable left shift and all cell lines appeared to be up suggesting hemoconcentration.
She was started on vanco/zosyn for ?LLL pna here but then these were stopped given negative infectious workup and no significant LLL infiltrate on repeat CXR.
TTE and TEE showed no vegitations, CT abd showed no abscess.
Sputum grew Klebsiella pneumonia on [**7-19**] which was sensitive to Zosyn and she was treated with a full course of zosyn.
She continued to spike fevers after she was treated, ID was consulted, review of culture data showed that she has a sub-population of ESBL resistant klebsiella and so she was subsequently treated with meropenem.
She was also found to have pseudomonas in her sputum which was sensitive only to amikacin.
She should have amikacin levels draw just prior to administration of third dose (on [**8-16**]).
Because of fevers and prolonged antibiotics, C. diff was a concern.
Patient grew MRSA in sputum which was initially treated with vancomycin then linezolid as there was concern for drug-fever with vancomycin.
Linezolid then stopped because of eosinophilia (see below).
Although CXR on [**8-11**] was read as having consolidation in left lower lobe, she was clinically much improved with fever curve trending down.
Given much improved respiratory status, MRSA was felt to be a chronic colonizer.
During her hospitalization, non-infectious sources of fever were considered as well.
Vancomycin was thought to be causing a drug fever as above given that she was febrile to 106F.
Neurology consulted to consider autonomic dysfunction/central causes of fevers but did not feel this would explain fevers.
At discharge she had been afebrile x4 days.
She should have a repeat CXR in a few weeks to assess for resolution of pneumonia.
# Seizure:  Reportedly no h/o seizures previously despite having been maintained on depakote (presumably started post CVA).
?seizure on day of admission seems more likely [**1-10**] to severe hypoglycemia as opposed to structural abnormalities post CVA acting as epileptiform nidus.
A [**2166-6-11**] EEG did not reveal e/o seizure/epileptiform activity.
Pt now with increased resting tremor of LUE.
for epileptiform activity; no clear electrographic correlate for clinically observed episodes of eye fluttering or leg tremor.
CT head r/o acute IC process/ new stroke since [**6-27**].
She was continued on keppra with no further evidence of seizure activity - she has a resting tremor of the left hand which was not felt to represent epilectic activity.
# ARF:  Baseline creatinine is 0.7-1.0 and was found to be elevated to 1.7 on ED presentation (while it was normal on d/c on [**7-4**]).
U lytes consistent with prerenal ARF.
# Respiratory failure:  Has reportedly not attempted wean at [**Hospital1 **] per limited progress notes sent w/ patient.
Respiratory distress has been complicated by tremors, apears to be a central process with cyclical periods of tacchypnea that had made weaning difficult.
# Coughing Patient had intermittent paroxysms of coughing that persisted even once respiratory infection was mostly treated.
#Aggitation she has been receiving standing clonazepam for aggitation/anxiety and occasional ativan IV with good effect.
# HTN:  antihypertensives initially held for hypotension and ARF.
# Corneal opacity Patient is blind in left eye from diabetic retinopathy.
Eye noted to have corneal opacity in inferior aspect of cornea for at least a month.
Ophthalmology consulted who felt this was unlikely to be a corneal ulcer but that there may be some abrasion for which they recommended erythromycin ophthalmic ointment.
This was stopped for concern of systemic absorption causing eosinophilia.
# Anemia:  Baseline hct appears to be 22-25.
Recent iron studies during last hospitalization are c/w AOCD w/ low TIBC, elevated ferritin.
No evidence of bleeding.
# Eosinophilia Eosinophils rose to 7/8 on [**8-9**] and a maximum of 12.5 on [**8-11**].
Although she was afebrile at the time, this was thought to perhaps be another representation of tendency towards drug fever.
linezolid and erythromycin ophthalmic ointment stopped and eosinophilia began trending down.
On lasix, BB, ACEI as outpatient (see HTN above) .
# R breast mass: US evaluation as outpatient .

afebrile x4 days.
You had an extensive workup for your fevers.
We believe the fevers were due to infections in your lungs with two bacteria and in your urine with yeast.
You are also being treated for an infectious diarrhea associated with antibiotic use called Clostridium difficile.
Also, you were treated for hyperthyroidism, which is a high level of thyroid hormone.
Please return to the hospital if you have recurrent high fevers, increased sputum production, seizures, or any other new or concerning symptoms.
