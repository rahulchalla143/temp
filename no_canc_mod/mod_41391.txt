Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY  71 M with Hx of CVA, HTN, DL presents with 3 weeks of lightheadedness, falls and 1 day of palpitations.
He is admitted for workup and management of his narrow-complex tachyarrythmia.
There was question as to whether he had atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter.
There was evidence (flutterform waves during carotid sinus pressure) that his rhythm was flutter.
We attempted to manage him with nodal agents, but these only lowered his blood pressure (to the 90's) while his heart rate was steady in the 120's.
On [**3-20**], with low BP and afib, he was transferred to the CCU for TEE/cardioversion complicated by hypotension requiring transient pressors.
BY PROBLEM  1) SVT - Atrial Flutter and Atrial Fibrillation with RVR    Hypotension   The differential for his tachycardia was fairly narrow.
It was either atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter.
Right carotid sinus massage (very light pressure was sufficient) effected a decrease in the ventricular response with a period of just flutter waves that also showed atrial repolarization or an "a" wave.
A long strip from the outside hospital additionally showed flutter waves.
He had flutter waves with carotid pressure and the interval between QRSs is variable.
We attempted to manage him medically without conversion for the dual concern of stroke and bleeding on anticoagulation (hx of UC and gastritis).
After [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 102218**] trial of betablockade from 25->75 mg [**Hospital1 **] metoprolol, his rate did not change and he became hypotensive.
The dose was halved to 37.5 and his hypotension persisted, concommittant with his conversion to atrial fibrillation.
After cardioversion, he went into a sinus rhythm with a large amount of atrial ectopy.
However, his hypotension persisted after his cardioversion with blood pressures in the 60's to 70's systolic and after several boluses of phenylephrine with only 10 to 20 mm Hg rise in systolic blood pressure including well after he had been given fentanyl and propofol for the TEE and cardioversion he remained hypotensive requiring an arterial line and continuous phenylephrine intravenous infusion for hypotension which persisted after large volume of saline infusion (over 2 liters).
This was continued overnight and he remained bradycardic with rates in the 50's with atrial ectopy and paroxysmal atrial flutter.
2) Arterial Vasculopathy, confirmed at least by coronary calcification in all coronary vessels on chest CT and atheroma in the ascending aorta seen on TEE      Hx of CVA; his stroke is now considered thromboembolic given recent events.
Peripheral Artery Disease      Hypertension, Dyslipidemia       Patient has risk factors for heart disease but no prior documentation.
His TEE showed "simple atheroma" in the aortic arch and the CT of the chest for evaluation of a question of a nodule showed calcium in all the coronaries.
Patient has elevated troponin, in the setting of chronic renal failure.
The patient was admitted on aggrenox and aspirin, was discharged on coumadin w/o antiplatelet agents to lessen bleeding risk given the history of gastritis and 4+ guaiac stools in the past thought to be colonic or related to colitis in origin.
3) Alcoholism         Patient had his last drink the night prior to admission.
4) COPD/Emphysema    CXR showed hyperinflated lung fields and a LLL opacity.
CT chest non-contrast showed multiple 1-3 mm nodules.
Chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.4, as high as 1.8.
Hyperlipidemia - lipitor .
H/o CVA  - discharged on coumadin for presumptive embolic source .
# PUMP: There is no clinical suspicion of heart failure.
He does not have electrocardiographic or echocardiographic evidence of LVH   Medications on Admission: ATORVASTATIN 40mg daily DIPHENHYDRAMINE HCL 25mg daily DIPYRIDAMOLE-ASPIRIN [AGGRENOX] 25 mg-200 mg [**Hospital1 **] FOLIC ACID 1mg daily LISINOPRIL 10mg daily ASPIRIN 325 mg daily THIAMINE HCL    Discharge Medications: 1.
