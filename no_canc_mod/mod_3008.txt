Her hospital course was complicated by increased respiratory distress and was transferred to the ICU overnight for closer monitoring.
She was hospitalized for cellulitis in [**7-7**] and cultures grew Pseudomonas, which was sensitive to Cipro.
She remained afebrile with no leukocytosis during her hospital stay.
2)Respiratory distress: Patient acutely decompensated 1-2 days into admission with increased O2 requirements and a drop in her O2 saturation into the 70's.
Cxray suggested acute pulmonary edema.
3)Pulmonary hypertension: Secondary to long standing sleep apnea.
Patient has failed multiple CPAP trials on prior admissions due to urinary incontinence.
Pulmonary was consulted in the ICU and they recommended the following tests once her volume status had improved: repeat ECHO, R heart catheterization, PFT's, and CT scan to r/o interstitial lung disease.
Likely pre-renal component based on physical exam.
Likely anemia of chronic disease secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.
10)Sleep apnea: Patient has been tried on CPAP in the past but has not been able to wear mask at night due to incontinence.
She does not want to wear since she has difficulties wearing the mask and has to go to the bathroom several times during the night.
5)If you experience any fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, dizziness or any other concerning symptoms please return to the emergency department.
