Pt states that his vision from both eyes gets blurry at times.
At OSH, pt had a non-contrast head CT scan which showed a left sided SAH.
Mild dysarthria.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
extraocular movements are full without evidence of nystagmus.
He did not have a pronator drift.
Large anterior communicating artery aneurysm whose rupture appears to be the cause of the increasing subarachnoid hemorrhage noted within the brain, compared to the prior non-contrast head CT. 2.
Markedly narrow A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery may be due to congenital hypoplasia or less likely due to spasm (given time duration).
Of note, there is increased blood seen layering within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
New aneurysm coils in the region of the anterior communicating artery.
CT Head [**2150-5-7**]: The patient is status post aneurysm coiling in the vascular territory of the anterior communicating artery, unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular shunt via right frontal burr hole, the tip terminating on the left ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**] as described above.
There is no significant change in the size and configuration of the ventricles since the prior study.
No evidence of low attenuation areas or significant edema to indicate subacute ischemic changes.
The CTA demonstrates persistent lobulated aspect of the aneurysm in the superior dome with no significant change since the prior cerebral angiogram, and coil embolization.
No flow-stenotic lesions are identified or vasospasm.
CTA Head [**2150-5-7**]: The patient is status post aneurysm coiling in the vascular territory of the anterior communicating artery, unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular shunt via right frontal burr hole, the tip terminating on the left ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**] as described above.
There is no significant change in the size and configuration of the ventricles since the prior study.
No evidence of low attenuation areas or significant edema to indicate subacute ischemic changes.
The CTA demonstrates persistent lobulated aspect of the aneurysm in the superior dome with no significant change since the prior cerebral angiogram, and coil embolization.
No flow-stenotic lesions are identified or vasospasm.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Interval improvement of the vasospasm involving the left middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral arteries, posterior cerebral arteries, and basilar artery.
Unchanged residual aneurysm filling at the base of the coil pack of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented on [**2150-5-6**] with severe headache and dizziness after working on his truck.
Patient became lethargic and less responsive, angiogram was performed to coil aneurysm and an EVD was placed to relieve ICP.
On [**5-8**], his exam improved, he was a&ox3, full strength on L and antigravity with both upper and lower extremities on the R side.
He was taken to angiogram where mild vasospasm was seen and he received 10mg of verapamil intrathecally.
In the afternoon, patient failed a clamping trial and drain was reopened to relieve ICP.
Overnight the drain was observed to be draining less and a poor waveform was also noted.
The drain was flushed with normal saline, but continued to have poor waveform and ouptut.
The patient subsequently had a change in his neurological status.
He had mental status changes and no command following.
He was started on a 3% HTS for chronic hyponatremia (na 12) at 10cc an hour, titrating up to 30cc/hour.
CTA on [**5-19**] showed vasospasm and hypertonic saline is being weaned to off.
MRI of the lumbar spine was ordered due to patient's complaint of back pain.
MRI results show some SAH blood within the thecal sac.
It also showed an intradural hematoma at L2 with mild cord compression.
On [**5-23**] overnight patient became confused, but over time began to was more alert and oriented.
There was a question of seizure activity and patient was then transitioned to Keppra from dilantin.
Lenis showed a R dvt from the proximal SFV.
CTA of chest showed a R subsegmental PE.
Patient was observed to have RUE weakness which was improved on [**5-27**] and SSRI restarted for his depression.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: [**1-31**] Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H:PRN nausea   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 38**] Landing Rehab & Skilled Nursing Center  Discharge Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage fever right hemiparesis left frontal infarct communicating hydrocephalus cerebral vasospasm subarachnoid hemorrhage respiratory failure deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism fever diplopia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
without imaging ?????
You need to follow up with Opthamology for a dilatation exam.
