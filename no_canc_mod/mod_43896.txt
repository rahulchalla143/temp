Past Medical History: GERD HTN Hep C Heroin abuse Gunshot wound to abdomen s/p ex-lap 20 years ago   Social History: He is homeless and has been living at shelter.
- Tobacco:  1 ppd for about 30 years - Alcohol:  Denies any recent alcohol use; "does not like it" - Illicits:  IV Heroin last use: "months ago"   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Admission: General: Alert, not oriented to place or time, NAD HEENT: Sclera anicteric, Dry MMM, conjunctiva injected Neck: supple, JVP 7-8 cm, no LAD Lungs: Dry bibasilar crackles CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: protuberant, soft, normoactive bowel sounds, no shifting dullness to percussion, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: + foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CN II-XII grossly intact, PERRLA, no asterexis,  no focal motor deficits, tender ness to palpation over right lower paraspinal musculature  Discharge: Gen: Pleasant, middle aged male in NAD.
Sclera anicteric.
No sinus tenderness to palpation Neck: Supple, full ROM.
No visible JVP.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
Mild crackles at RLL base, otherwise CTAB without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No organomegaly or masses appreciated Ext: WWP.
Skin: No rashes, ulcers, or other lesions noted.
There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar adenopathy meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Small hiatal hernia is present.
There is a new right-sided pigtail catheter terminating at the base of the right lung.
Loculated pleural effusion is slightly increased compared to the prior study.
For example, a collection of fluid at the base measures 2.6 cm in maximal width compared to 2.1 cm previously.
Gas within the pleural fluid is presumably secondary to placement of the pigtail catheter.
A loculated component of fluid anteriorly measures 5.6 x 11.2 cm.
A third component of fluid along the right lateral chest measures approximately 4.4 x 2.1 cm.
A small collection of gas within a consolidation at the right lung base adjacent to the effusion is similar to prior and concerning for pneumonia or necrotizing pneumonia.
There is peribronchial thickening.
A 5-mm nodule in the right lower lobe is not appreciably changed from the prior study (2:26).
A second nodule measuring 3 mm is seen at the right lung base (2:33).
There is a small left pleural effusion.
Hypodensity in the upper pole of the left kidney is better evaluated on the prior CT abdomen.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified.
Interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter with slight increase in the loculated pleural effusion which could reprsent empyema.
Persistent area of loculated gas surrounded by lung parenchyma could represent pulmonary abscess or necrotizing pneumonia.
Small left-sided pleural effusion.
Small pulmonary nodules measuring up to 5 mm on the right.
RUQ/Liver US [**2188-5-28**] FINDINGS: Normal liver echotexture without focal liver lesion.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Incidental 3-mm polyp noted within the gallbladder.
Gallbladder is only mildly distended.
There is a trace of peri-cholecystic fluid.
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] features of acute cholecystitis.
Findings in the gallbladder are likely related to underlying liver disease and third spacing from renal failure and low albumin.
There is a non-obstructing 6-mm calculus in the interpolar region of the right kidney.
No evidence for ascites in the visualised upper abdomen.
Minimally distended gallbladder with mild gallbladder wall edema and pericholecystic fluid.
No gallstones seen.
Findings most likely represent sequelae of liver disease and third spacing from acute renal failure and low albumin.
There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
Atelectasis of the left lower lobe is present.
Upper zone redistribution to the right side is present though not to the left, third degree of failure is probably present.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 64 year old male with a history of HCV infection, GERD, HTN, and polysubstance abuse admitted for UGIB and [**Last Name (un) **] from rhabdomyolysis, while hypertensive to 170s-180s systolic.
On the floor he had no subsequent upper GI bleeding, and his acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis slowly resolved.
While on the floor, he was found to have a RLL necrotizing PNA/empyema, which was treated with IV antibiotics and a VATS decortication.
Active issues: # Upper GI Bleed On presentation, the patient complained of epigastric pain and had two episodes of bloody to [**Last Name (un) 30212**]-colored emesis.
RUQ ultrasound with doppler showed a normal appearing liver without a nodular appearance, not suggestive of cirrhosis.
He had an EGD which was negative for any source of bleeding, but positive for gastritis, as well as esophagitis and duodenitis.
CK elevated to [**Numeric Identifier 100019**] on admission, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis as a major contributor.
Renal ultrasound demonstrated no obstructive cause for the [**Last Name (un) **].
He was not continued on Lasix due to his continued urine output.
# Necrotizing Pneumonia/Empyema Shortly after the patient was transfered from the MICU to the floor, the patient began to report some discomfort at the right upper quadrant/lower right costal margin.
At this time, he had a few brief fluctuations in mental status.
The discomfort increased over two days, and began radiating to his back.
Given the finding of a non-obstructing kidney stone on his initial ultrasound, and a mild pancreatitis, a CT abdomen was ordered (both kidney and RUQ U/S were recently negative for obstruction).
The patient was found to have a loculated effusion in the RLL, which was initially tapped by interventional pulmonology.
Subsequent to the surgery, the patient ran a low temperature on several nights, likely due to atelectasis (cultures sent during these spikes were negative), which quickly resolved.
During this period, the patient received aggressive chest PT, and had a progressive decrease in his requirement of supplemental O2.
He has smoked 1 PPD for many years.
Disp:*30 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper GI bleed Acute Kidney Injury due to Rhabdomyolysis Right Lower Lobe Pneumonia complicated by empyema   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
When you were admitted, you were vomiting blood and you had a severe injury to your kidneys.
However, when you were on the general medicine [**Hospital1 **], it was discovered that you had an infection in your right lung.
A CT scan was performed which showed that the infection was so severe that it had to be treated with surgery.
During your stay, you were also found to have an infection with an organism called H. Pylori.
