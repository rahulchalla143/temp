She was noted to have new ARF with Cr to 4.5m Depsite receiving 2L.
She remained hypotensive throughout her ED course with SBPs in the 70s and 80s, and was uptitrated on levo, neo, and dopamine to maximal doses with continued hypotension.
No ABG or A line oculd be placed.
With high peak pressures and ?
With absent bowel sounds on exam and marked leukocytosis with a history of loose stool, flagyl was given.
An A line was placed and oxygention improved   Past Medical History: Hypertension Back pain (new since 3 days PTA)  Social History: The patient is married and has children.

Diffuse airspace consolidation, most severely involving the right upper and lower lobes is concerning for pneumonia.
Left hilar lymphadenopathy may be reactive, although an underlying mass cannot be excluded.
Extensive bilateral airspace consolidation and left hilar lymphadenopathy.
As noted on the previous study, this should be followed to resolution to exclude an underlying mass.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dense parenchymal multifocal airspace consolidation, most compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
Distended gallbladder with small amount of pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder stone seen in the region of the neck.
Mild mesenteric stranding adjacent to gallbladder tip.
No discrete fluid collections that would be concerning for abscess formation.
Mild wall thickening seen in several regions of the colon, though is more likely secondary to collapsed bowel from underdistension as no associated mesenteric stranding to suggest active colitis.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxia/ARDS/Pneumonia:  The patient presented with 3 days of fever, cough, SOB and congestion.
IN the ED she continued to be hypoxic to the low 80's and hypotensive requiring pressors (levophed, neo, dopamine).
The patient had a CXR that showed multifocal opacities and was venilated based on ARDS protocol.
The patient was aggressively diuresed given volume overload on a lasix gtt and eventually was able to be extubated on [**12-25**].
#Hypotension- On admission the patient was hypotensive and required pressors including levophed, neo, and dopamine.
Aside from one episode of hypotension while on lasix/ ambien, Mrs.[**Known lastname 86713**] blood pressure was stable throughout the rest of the admission.
# Acute Renal Failure: At the OSH the patient's creatinine was found to be 4.5.
# Fevers: Patient with continued fevers throughout her course likely from pan-sensitive strep pneumo bacteremia isolated at the OSH hospital.
The patient was treated for pneumonia as above with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Patient underwent RUQ that showed some dilation of the CBD, but evaluated by surgery who did not feel it was the cause of her fevers.
She also underwent MRI of the T/L/S spine that was negative for abscess.
She had several episodes of nausea and vomiting.
She was evaluated by speech and swallow and there was no evidence of aspiration.
The nausea and vomiting quickly resolved on its own without further intervention.
# Weakness: Lower extremity weakness noted once patient extubated and awake.
This was thought to be secondary to deconditioning.
Physical therapy was initiated and her weakness was improving throughout her admission.
