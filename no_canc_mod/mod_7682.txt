Electronically signed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3318**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2132-11-24**] 15:52   Brief Hospital Course: He remained stable and pain free after admission.
Of note, intra-op TEE revealed a "haze" suggestive of potential Left Atrial Appendage thrombus.
He experienced transient diploplia and floaters postoperatively and ophthalmology and neurology consults were obtained.
He will follow up as an outpatient as these were transient and likely of no consequence.
