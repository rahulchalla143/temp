She was subsequently sent home one day postoperatively and had persistent abdominal pain and shortness of breath.
The abdominal pain and shortness of breath persisted such that she was readmitted to [**Hospital3 7362**] on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**8-30**].
She also had a CT of the abdomen and a HIDA scan which revealed a bile leak.
The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and further management of her bile leak.
The patient did have evidence of choledocholithiasis as well as a bile duct leak at the duct of Luschka.
Status post procedure, the patient was extubated and was noted to be breathing rapidly and with shallow breaths.
On examination, she was noted to have diffuse pulmonary rales.
Given her tenuous respiratory status, the patient was transferred that evening to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].
Type 2 diabetes mellitus; which has been diet controlled.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was slightly tachypneic with talking.
The neck revealed no jugular venous distention.
There were no bruits.
Lungs revealed bibasilar crackles one-third of the way of bilaterally.
Cardiovascular revealed first heart sound and second heart sound, tachycardic but a regular rate.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
There was right upper quadrant tenderness.
No lower extremity edema was noted.
On neurologic examination, the patient was alert and oriented and moved all extremities; otherwise, a nonfocal neurologic examination.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Her chest x-ray on admission to the Intensive Care Unit that night (AP portable) showed a small right effusion, [**Last Name (un) 16765**] B-lines, and pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure.
Her electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia at 110, with normal axis and normal intervals.
She did have an S wave in lead I; although, she did not have a Q wave or an inverted T wave in lead III on this electrocardiogram.
She did have flat T waves across the precordium at [**Hospital3 7362**].
In terms of diagnostic workup; it was unclear as to what the reason for her persistent hypoxia and dyspnea was.
She did have evidence of the first heart sound, Q3/T3, pattern at [**Hospital3 7362**], and a report of a normal perfusion scan.
She also had the evidence of a small troponin leak; although, no known history of coronary artery disease.
It was also significant for mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
She had no focal wall motion abnormalities.
The patient also received a CT of the chest; both for looking at the possibility of a pulmonary embolism as well as to look at her lung parenchyma.
It was a suboptimal CT; although, it was good enough to rule out large perfusion defects.
It also did show the lung parenchyma significant for ground-glass opacities; felt most consistent to be pulmonary edema.
From a gastrointestinal perspective, the patient's abdominal pain was entirely gone by the morning status post procedure.
She was also scheduled for a stress test with nuclear imaging on [**9-13**] at 4:30 at the [**Last Name (un) 469**] Center to help delineate the etiology of any potential cardiac problems.
