Admission Date:  [**2157-3-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-4-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-9-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Confusion; Multiple intraparenchymal intracranial hemorrhages on OSH CT scan  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: MRI MRA brain TEE under general anaesthesia   History of Present Illness: 36 year old with no known prior medical history presented to [**Hospital3 15402**] ED with confusion.
Head CT showed multifocal parenchymal hemorrhages throughout the cerbral hemispheres, primarily at the grey-whit ejunction aidn the largest at the right temporal lobe.
Family History: Nil significant reported  Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals:  T 99.8    HR 81    BP 115/60    HR 16     97% on RA General:  Warm to touch but in no acute distress HEENT:  OP clear, no lymphadenopathy Heart:  RRR no murmurs Pulm:  Clear bilaterally, good areation Extremities:  Warm and well perfused, no rashes over body  MS:  Arouses to gentle sternal rub and then quickly falls back asleep.
Gait deferred   Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: CBC 12.1/14.4/41.5/182 INR 1.3   PT 14.3   PTT 27.3 Lytes 145/3.6/110/26/10/0.7/111 Ca 8.7 Mg 2.1 Phos 2.9 AST 29 ALT 36 Amylase 33, AP 84, TB 0.5 Lithium 0.3 Troponin negative UDS and SDS negative EKG with NSR  Dilantin [**2157-4-5**]  7.4  CSF: WCC 71  RCC [**Numeric Identifier 21671**]* prot 41   gluc 71 negative for gram stain, bacterial culture, malignant cells, cryptococcus, fungal and viral cultures, acid fast bacilli to date Neurocysticercosis/Toxo PND   EEG: This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the infrequent right frontocentral slowing.
This suggests a right frontocentral region of subcortical dysfunction.
MRA/MRV of head FINDINGS:  There are diffuse areas of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the largest lesions involving the right anterior temporal lobe and right inferior frontal lobe with smaller hemorrhagic lesions noted scattered through the right frontal, right parietal, right occipital lobe, and left parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes.
Additional lesions are noted within the left corpus callosum and right basal ganglia.
Many of these lesions display mild surrounding edema; however, no areas of abnormal enhancement are noted throughout the brain parenchyma.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or minor or major vascular territorial infarct apparent.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted within the maxillary sinuses bilaterally with surrounding osseous structures appearing unremarkable.
There is a probable small left parietal subgaleal hematoma.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]  The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent with no areas of significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation.
Within the limits of coverage of study, no sign of an AV malformation is apparent.
Caliber of the vessel lumens appears smooth and within normal limits with no irregular stenotic areas identified.
MRV of the brain demonstrates no venous sinus thrombosis.
Bilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhages many of which are at the grey white junction with additional lesions noted within the left corpus callosum and right basal ganglia.
No abnormal areas of enchancement to suggest underlying focal masses identified.
Differential includes vasculitis and septic emboli including fungal etiologies.
Less likely would be coagulopathy, hemorrhages from underlying trauma, or diffuse metastatic disease.
TEE No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen  ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the  aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears  structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
[**2157-3-31**] Testicular USS: Bilateral simple epididymal cysts and small left-sided hydrocele with no evidence of focal testicular lesion.
Brief Hospital Course: 36 year old with previous episode of head trauma (details unknown) who presents with confusion and multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages.
The etiology of lesions remains unclear.
The initial differential included drugs such as cocaine, CNS vasculitis, hypertensive crisis, sinus thrombosis, or multiple mass lesions with hemorrhage.
MRI demonstrated L scalp hematoma, suggestive of trauma.
Thus traumatic precipitant likely but possible other underlying predisposition for bleeding.
The patient was treated with dilantin and doses increased for low level.
EEG showed mild right frontal slowing.
The patient became increasingly responsive but remained with clear cognitive impairment including poor recall for events despite repeated explanation.
No other focal deficits present at discharge.
Formal testing of power difficult due to variable effort but appears full.
Review of imaging studies revealed no concensus regarding etiology of lesions.
MRV was negative for venous sinus thrombosis.
Echocardiogram to look for signs of endocarditis/septic emboli  was performed under GA (due to failure to obtain without sedation) and demonstrated no source of septic emboli.
Question of possible bleeding metastatic lesions explored with testicular ultrasound which was normal aside from epipidymal cysts.
CT abdomen demonstrated hypodensity in the liver likely due to early fatty infiltration.
He was asymptomatic and no further action taken in view of intracranial bleeding.
There was an episode of urethral bleeding occurred on [**2157-3-31**] likely associated with recent catheterisation, then settled.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Multiple intracranial hemorrhages   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: Please keep all follow up appointments and seek further medical assistance for new symptoms of confusion, weakness, abnormal sensations or speech problems.
Please keep all follow up appointments and seek further medical assistance for new symptoms of confusion, weakness, abnormal sensations or speech problems.
You have been started on a medication to prevent seizures called dilantin.
