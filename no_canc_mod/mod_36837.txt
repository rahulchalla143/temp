Admission Date:  [**2154-5-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-5-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-11-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 678**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain and vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tunnelled hemodialysis catheter placement AV fistula Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] is a 57 yo male with a h/o chronic pancreatitis, CHF, and polysubstance abuse who presented with 3 days of abdominal pain and vomiting.
Epigastric pain similar to prev.
pancreatitis flare.
+ emesis (nonbloody and non-billious).
He says he has felt intermittent fevers and chills as well.
He was found to have elevated pancreatic enzymes and a cxr suggestive of CHF vs. pneumonia.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of hypertensive urgency.
On review of systems, pt complains of productive cough x many weeks (since discharge in late [**2154-3-14**] for pneumonia).
He also complains of vague chest pain that "comes and goes" and has been going on for an undefined period of time.
He says he has been compliant with his meds.
Past Medical History: DM2 HTN CAD s/p MI, MIBI in [**11-18**] showed inf/lat reversible defect CHF with EF 20-30% and severe global hypokinesis Dyslipidemia Atrial Fibrillation H/o GI bleed: Duodenal, jejunal, and gastric AVMs, s/p thermal therapy; sigmoid diverticuli Chronic Pancreatitis Hepatitis C GERD CRI, baseline 3.9-5.3 Gout, s/p Arthroscopy with medial meniscectomy [**5-/2149**] Depression, s/p multiple hospitalizations due to SI Polysubstance abuse-- crack cocaine, EtOH, tobacco Erectile dysfunction, s/p inflatable penile prosthesis [**5-/2148**]  Social History: Pt lives in [**Location 686**] with his wife.
His mother died of renal failure at age 58.
He states that his twin brother and his son also have kidney disease.
Abd: soft, mild epigastric tenderness.
[**5-9**] cxr: Again, there is significant cardiac enlargement.
Marked perivascular haze is consistent with pulmonary congestion in the pulmonary circulation.
When comparison is made with the next previous examination ([**4-9**], frontal view) the degree of pleural effusion and pulmonary congestion appears more marked.
Possibility of inflammatory processes on the lung bases obscured by the pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
EKG: Supraventricular tachycardia with atrial rate 230, ventricular rate 116.
1mm ST segment depressions in leads II, III, aVF.
Echo [**1-20**] - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30 percent).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo male with h/o pancreatitis, chf and polysubstance abuse admitted with hypertensive urgency and pancreatitis.
1) Pancreatitis - On admision with Amylase 701, Lipase 2089, and abdominal pain c/w prior pancreatitis flares all consistent with acute-on-chronic pancreatitis.
2) Acute renal failure: This was acute on chronic (long-standing DM and HTN), with baseline Cr ~4.0-5.0.
Creatinine was at approximate baseline on admission, then doubled with minimal urine output likely due to ATN as muddy brown casts observed in sediment; possible compounded by cocaine and NSAID use.
A tunneled HD line was placed and dialysis was initiated without complications.
3) HTN: Hypertensive urgency on admission with SBPs 190's-200's in ED, admitted to the ICU and treated with nitro gtt with improvement.
4) Pulmonary infiltrates: CHF vs. PNA on cxr.
Residual RLL infiltrate and resolving CHF noted on repeat CXR.
5) Anemia:  Chronic anemia likely [**2-15**] CKD.
Iron studies [**2154-4-9**] showed iron deficiency and iron supplementation was started, which was then discontinued per renal and he was started on erythropoetin.
6) Hyperglycemia: Type 2 diabetic with known history of poor glycemic control.
7) Chest pain: Unclear of the exact nature and duration of CP based on the vague history.
ECG was without signs of ischemia and cardiac enazymes with elevated trop of 0.17 likely due to renal failure +/- demand from decompensated heart failure.
The patient was not started on ASA given h/o GI bleeding and not started on a beta-blocker given h/o cocaine use.
8) Tachycardia: h/o parox a-fib.
ECG on presentation with SVT with 2:1 block atrial tachycardia.
Anticoagulation was not started given his h/o GI bleeding and significant anemia.
9) Pruritis: The patient complained of pruritis for 7-8 months, possible related to uremia/hyperphosphatemia from his chronic renal disease.
There was no visible rash.
Patient became over-sedated with dose of valium coupled with Dilaudid in the setting of renal failure, and required a dose of Narcan for reversal.
No further evidence of EtOH withdrawal and did not require more benzodiazepines.
