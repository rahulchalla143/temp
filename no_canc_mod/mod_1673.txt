No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities in the RCA and Circumflex territory.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated to 4.5 cm at one specific area and beyond that it was 3.7cm.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: On epinephrine 0.02 mcg/kg/min Mild global RV systolic function.
Preserved mid anterior and anterolateral wall functions.

A subtle area of hypodensity in the left insula is seen.
No mass effect is identified.
The ventricles and sulci are slightly prominent, compatible with a mild degree of global atrophy.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
There is a mucosal retention cyst and small fluid level within the left maxillary sinus.
There is minimal mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells.
There are calcifications of the carotid siphons bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage.
Subtle area of hypodensity in the left insula could represent an area of infarction.
The patient was also restarted on anticoagulation for history of atrial fibrillation.
He made slow progress and was noted to have perseverating speech and word finding difficulties, left/right confusion, weakness of the RUE, and some very mild facial asymmetry, neurology was consulted and a head CT was done.
The CT showed No acute hemorrhage.
Subtle area of hypodensity in the left insula could represent an area of infarction.
