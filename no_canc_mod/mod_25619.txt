The patient was maintained on 24 hour sitter precautions for the length of his stay, due to the possibility that the injuries were sustained secondary to a suicide attempt.
The patient had new onset of rash during hospitalization.
Dermatology was consulted, and performed a biopsy, which turned out to be consistent with drug hypersensitivity (among other diagnoses).
The clindamycin the patient was recieving for facial lacerations was discontinued, and the rash disappeared within several days.
However, this rash delayed the date of the patient's ORIF of his mandibular fractures, which was ultimately performed without event on HD#14.
He had several bouts of nausea and vomitting, but was able to clear the emesis through his fixed jaw without problems.
