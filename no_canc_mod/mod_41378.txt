He reports that he has had some chest pain over the last two days, none since last night, for which he took sublingual GTN with little relief.
He previously had not required GTN for several months.
He complains of nasal congestion, cough and dyspnea over the past 1 week.
He also has diffuse lower abdominal pain which started last night, he also reports loose, soft stool over the last [**2-23**] days, but no liquid stools, no blood, some nausea but no vomiting.
He was placed on bipap with improvement of respiratory status, but was unable to tolerate weaning of bipap.
EKG showed sinus rhythm and left bundle branch block, consistent with prior EKG.
CXR showed moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
CTA torso consistent with right-sided pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, normal aorta, no PE.
On review of systems he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY:  CAD s/p triple CABG in [**2182**] - CABG: [**2182**].
- 40-59% stenosis of both Left and Right ICAs.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -BPH -Squamous Cell Carcinoma on right side of nose, s/p Moh's excision [**5-31**], prior metastatic SCC in infraauricular area, s/p excision in [**2188**], excision of hand growth in [**2187**].
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
RR, Loud S1, muffled S2, No m/r/g.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Diffuse wheeze, reduced air entry bilateral lung bases, bronchial breath sounds in right lung.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
sinus rhythm.
No q wave abnormalities in inferior leads, changed from prior.
No other ischemic changes.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology is identified.
There is extensive calcification in the descending aorta.
The patient is status post CABG with native coronary calcification.
On the left, there is a small pleural effusion.
On the right, there is a moderate pleural effusion with subjacent atelectasis.
There is evidence of volume overload with new septal thickening at the lung bases.
There are also ground-glass opacities in a perihilar distribution in bilateral lungs; however, there is also a more focal consolidative process in the right perihilar region concerning for infection.
A 8 mm lung nodule in the left upper lobe adjacent to the mediastinum is seen (3a:45).
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver enhances homogeneously and shows no focal lesions.
However, there is no gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid.
The right kidney has a small hypodensity, which is too small to characterize, but likely a simple renal cyst.
Again noted is extensive calcification of the abdominal aorta, including the SMA and extending down to the iliacs.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
No free air or free fluid.
The prostate is slightly enlarged along with prostatic calcifications.
Small fat containing left inguinal hernia is noted.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are seen throughout the lumbar and thoracic spine; however, there is no evidence of suspicious osseous lesions.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with subjacent atelectasis and mild pulmonary edema.
More focal consolidation in the right perihilar region is concerning for superimposed infection.
Sub-cm hypodensity within the right kidney, too small to characterize, but likely simple renal cyst.
Cholelithiasis without any evidence of cholecystitis.
Extensive calcification of the aorta.
8 mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
This should be followed up with a chest CT in [**7-3**] months if there are no risk factors for lung cancer or prior history of malignancy.
Brief Hospital Course: Respiratory symptoms:  Cough, URI symptoms since 1-2 weeks.
Leukocytosis, but afebrile, no tachycardia.
He remained tachypneic with increased work of breathing on the bipap machine with a PEEP of 10.
His chest xray showed continued interval progression of his lung pathology, with worsening multifocal infiltrates and probable development of ARDS.
