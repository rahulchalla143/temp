She reports no complaints other than continued left arm and bilateral leg swelling which has been getting worse over the last month.
She also has had some intching of her back, but denies thirst, nausea, vomiting, change in frequency/color/odor of urine.
She did have her metolazone restarted one week ago and took a dose on thursday and saturday because of worsening leg edema.
Past Medical History: # DM Type II --Renal allograft artery angioplasty [**2-27**] HTN --Renal transplant ([**2099**]): No information about donor # Atrial fibrillation, not currently anticoagulated s/p [**8-1**] hemicolectomy # Right hemicolectomy ([**7-/2111**]) # CAD s/p CABG ([**2098**]: LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, SVG to OM, SVG to  diag) # Cholecystectomy # Zoster  Social History: # Personal: Widowed, lives with son # Smoking: Never # Alcohol: Never # Also has VNS come to help weekly   Family History: Mother died of ?
htn in her 80s   Physical Exam: General: AAOx3 in NAD, Elderly female wearing wig.
Neck: No LAD or masses, no JVD or carotid bruits Chest: CTABL.
Extremities: LE pitting edema to the knee and over the sacrum.
Left arm with blaiteral nonpatent AV fistula.
Weak left radial and distal LE pulses bilaterally.
RENAL ULTRASOUND: IMPRESSION: Unchanged overall appearance of renal transplant with marked upper pole cortical thinning and underlying focal hydronephrosis.
Doppler examination demonstrates relatively normal venous flow and preserved systolic and diastolic arterial flow, though the latter is low in amplitude, as before.
The renal artery shows slightly broadened spectral waveforms, with normal parenchymal resistive indices, ranging from 0.54 to 0.62 in the mid- and lower poles; these results are not significantly changed compared to prior exams.
However, though the Doppler evaluation of the upper pole parenchyma is limited, the elevated RIs, which appear new, in the setting of rising creatinine, raise the possibility of chronic rejection.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 77 y/o Female with HTN, DM2, CAD S/P CABG, Afib, ESRD S/P Renal Transplant, and RAS S/P Angioplasty with rising creatinine and elevated blood pressure, but asymptomatic.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Likely etiology of rising creatinine is worsening of her chronic kidney disease due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy.
Urine studies were consistent with an intrinsic cause of renal failure and patient had nephrotic range proteinuria.
Renal transplant ultrasound with Dopplers was negative for RAS and showed normal venous flow.
The patient's diuretics were held for concern of renal hypoperfusion.
Prograf levels were followed and were within therapeutic range, making renal failure secondary to prograf unlikely.
Hypertension: Blood pressure was elevated while in hospital and patient's medications were changed to correct this.
Leg Edema: Has normal EF, so possibly diastolic failure vs. worsening renal disease.
Etiology is most likely anasarca secondary to protein losing nephropathy.
Right Basilar Decreased breath sounds: Likely pleural effusion.
On ECG, NSR with PAC's, LVH and RBBB.
- continue beta blocker as well rate controlled - coumadin has been held because of diverticular bleed requiring hemicolectomy - 6.
DM Type II: - diabetic diet - regular insulin sliding scale - 7.
CAD s/p CABG and stenting: No chest pain.
Hypothyroidism: Continued on home regimen of levothyroxine; TSH elevated but free T4 normal - 11.
Anemia: Likely ACD from renal disease.
HCT was stable with no evidence of bleeding.
Disp:*90 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Community VNA, Attelboro  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute on chronic renal insufficiency Hypertension Diabetes Type II Atrial fibrillation  Secondary: CAD s/p CABG Diastolic Dysfunction End Stage Renal Failure S/P Renal Transplant Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Hypothyroidism Anemia   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with worsening renal function.
This is most likely due to chronic kidney disease.
If you develop any worrisome symptoms such as abdominal pain, pain at the site of biopsy, bleeding, blood in your urine, pain with urination, [**Month/Year (2) **], chest pain , shortness of breath, please contact your doctor or return to the emergency room.
