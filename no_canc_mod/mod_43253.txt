The patient is homeless and was found unresponsive by the police with a vodka bottle in his hand.
A CXR demonstrated possible infiltrates and he was treated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
While in the ED, the patient had a transient episode of possible Torsades with a serum magnesium of 1.1 which was repleted with 2gm IV.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably without complaints.

Acanthosis nigricans.
Mild rales at the bases bilaterally.
Abdomen: S/NT/ND, +bs GU: Scrotal edema, small superficial erosions.
Ext: 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2100-11-20**] no significant change.
CXR: IMPRESSION: Nodular opacity at the left base may represent aspiration or focal pneumonia, but a neoplastic process cannot be excluded.
Short interval radiographic followup is recommended to ensure resolution.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
No focal liver lesion identified.
No ascites identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 20473**] is a 53 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for EtOH abuse admitted for hypotension and hypoxemia after being found unresponsive.
# Hypoxemia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis.
# EtOH: Utox and Serum tox negative.
# BP: Trend hypotension.
Likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion resolved with IVF.
# Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 0.8-1.
# Scrotal and peri-anal maggots: Patient has some minor peri-anal and scrotal skin breakdown, but no signs of gangrene.
Patient may be diabetic given acanthosis nigricans on exam and body habitus.
After cleaning the wounds there were no large open wounds and no more maggots were found.
Per report, patient had transient episode of Torsades on telemetry while hemodynamically stable although question if artifact.
No repeat episodes.
# Nodular opacity: Repeat CXR during admission to assess for interval change.
If persistent would consider non-contrast CT chest to further evaluate given concern for potential malignancy.
