Admission Date:  [**2194-12-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-1-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-3-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 530**] Chief Complaint: bright red blood per rectum  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: This is a 61 yo M with a past history of afib not on anticoagulation, stroke, motor seizure and labile hypertension who was admitted to an OSH with bright red blood per rectum that occurred while sleeping.
The day prior, he had a bloody BM and became diaphoretic and pale and did not respond to his wife, making it difficult to tell if he had an expressive aphasia or vasovagal syncope.
He had been off coumadin for 6 months secondary to chronic anemia from hemorrhoidal bleeding.
He has a history of significant rectal bleeding about 5-6 months ago at which time he underwent upper and lower endoscopies that revealed internal hemorrhoids that were considered a potential source of bleeding.
His hypertension has historically been labile and difficult to control and he has been evaluated at both [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 2025**] for this.
He also has a history of afib and had significant episodes of arrhythmia during his admission, prompting a cardiology consultation.
His stroke history is significant for a history of right lateral temporal lobe infarct extending to the right parietal lobe, pre and post central cortex and right middle frontal gyrus.
On this admission, he experienced sudden left sided weakness with falls, and he was evaluated by neurology.
He is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up and treatment of his GI bleeding, as well as for his neurologic and cardiac co-morbidities.
His rate slowed with the amiodarone and his rhythm returned to a narrow complex irregular tachycardia.
He was also noted to have a wide-complex tachycardia and was started on dofetilide, amiodarone and esmolol gtt per the EP team which were then stopped and then transitioned to diltiazem, labetolol, which he was taking as an outpatient.
On admission the patient was also noted to have a significant speech delay.
[**12-24**] MRI/A: showed acute infarct of R ACA without discrete vascular  abnormality (no acute cutoff or discrete stenosis) at R ACA.
Severe atheromatous disease noted in other intracranial arteries as well as the basilar artery.
R ACA infarct was thought to be [**1-17**] emboli v. pressure drop distal to severe stenosis.
Neurology was consulted and recommended holding anticoagulation given lower GI bleed and to maintain SBP 140s-160s.
Pt has remained hypertensive to a peak sbp of 185/126 and his diastolic blood pressures remain high.
On questioning, the patient denies any new headache, visual changes, speech difficulties, new weakness though he does report chronic UE and some LE weakness ?R > L.  He has chronic knee pain but is ambulatory.
He denies orthopnea or PND and can walk one block w/o SOB.
The patient denies any recent weight loss or night sweats, fevers/chills, denies chest pain, palpitations, or a new cough.
Currently he denies dizzyness and has not had BRBPR since prior to admission.

MRI/MRA brain [**2194-12-24**]: IMPRESSION:  Acute infarct of the right ACA without discrete vascular abnormality detected of the right ACA.
However, severe atheromatous disease is noted in other intracranial arteries as well as the basilar artery.
No PFO seen.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
No evidence of new brain ischemia apart.
Stable signal abnormality corresponding to known subacute right anterior cerebral artery territory infarct.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the intracranial carotid and vertebral branches as detailed above.
New, marked focal short segment stenosis of left A1 segement of ACA with patent artery distally.
Grossly patent major cervical vessels;  MRA of the neck was significantly limited due to decreased contrast in the arteries (bolus timing problem)  as above.
Bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening versus fluid as well as fluid within the left mastoid air cells.
Mucosa appeared abnormal on NBI (biopsy) Possible rectal varices.
Diverticulosis of the whole colon .
Carotid u/s OSH: R >50% external carotid stenosis, L < 50% external carotid stenosis, no internal carotid stenosis bilat .
Probable sinus rhythm with intraventricular conduction delay and frequent ventricular premature beats or aberrated supraventricular complexes.
There appears to be organized atrial activity in some leads but cannot rule out the possibility that this is atrial fibrillation or multifocal atrial tachycardia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
R UE u/s [**2194-12-26**]: IMPRESSION:  Occlusive thrombus in the right cephalic vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 61M h/o Afib, CVA, and recurrent lower GI bleed [**1-17**] hemorrhoids admitted [**2194-12-18**] with rectal bleeding and near syncopal episode.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with persistent BRBPR and L sided weakness.
Patient was found to have right sided ACA stroke identified on head MRI.
Patient has history of GI bleeds from hemorrhoidal bleeding, but there was no evidence of hemorrhoidal bleeding seen on anoscopy at OSH.
Colonoscopy on [**1-2**] revealed several possible etiologies of bleed: internal hemorrhoids vs. rectal varices vs. diverticuli.
Most recent episode of melena on [**12-31**] and patients last transfusion of 1 unit was on [**2195-1-1**].
If patient had any further GI bleeding, he would likely need tagged red blood cell scan or anoscopy to evaluate the source of bleed.
Patient has a history of CVA and presented with left sided weakness and slurred speeck in setting of GI bleed.
An MRI/MRA on [**12-24**] revealed an acute infarct of R ACA without discrete vascular abnormality (no acute cutoff or discrete stenosis) at R ACA.
Severe atheromatous disease noted in other intracranial arteries as well as the basilar artery.
Right ACA infarct was thought to be due to embolic event versus pressure drop distal to severe stenosis.
He recovered much of his function on left side, however in setting of low blood pressure (SBP < 130), patient had re-expresion of these symptoms.
Atrial fibrillation.
Patient has A. fib with RVR, but went into A. flutter and wide complex tachycardia during hospital staty.
Antihypertensives were intially held due to GI bled, but were resumed with blood pressure goal of 140s-160s systolic due to recent CVA.
At lower BPs (SBP <130s), patient had re-expresion of CVA with left sided weakness and slurred speeh.
He will ultimately need to have diltiazem switched to long acting form and labetolol will need to be switched to [**Hospital1 **] dosing if BP remains stable.
Patient developed hypoxia in the setting of hypertension, thought to be due to flash pulmonary edema.
Right upper extremity cephalic DVT.
Patient had a PICC associated DVT.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1970**] - [**Hospital1 1559**]  Discharge Diagnosis: GI bleed CVA .
Diabetes Hypertension Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Fair.
Left sided weakness is nearly resolved with 4+/5 strength on left side.
Please call you physician or come to the emergency department if you have chest pain, weakness, numbness/tingling, difficulty walking, blood in stools, black stools, or any other concerning symptoms.
