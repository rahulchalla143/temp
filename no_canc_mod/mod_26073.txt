Patient with recurrent left sided pleural effusion dating back to late [**2190**] of unclear etiology, symptomatic secondary to trapped lung.
At that time biopsy and pleural fluid sampling demonstrated exudative lymphocytic pleural fluid of unclear etiology as pathology only with reactive mesotheialial cells c/w chronic inflammation (pleuritis).
She returned to nursing home but today noted to have progressively worsening non-productive cough and febrile to 100.9.
Went to [**Hospital3 **], noted to be 88%RA, CXR with worsening pleural effusion on left.
IP saw and drained 550cc of serosanguinous fluid, studies sent.
Spastic quadriplegia.
Unsteady gait.
Hypertension and hypotenstion.
MI in [**2182**] CHF Depression hx of hypokalemia hx of hyponatremia hx of hyperlipidemia hx of intermittent constipation.

Marked enlargement of probably loculated left pleural effusion with features suggestive of superimposed infection, possibly empyema.
Rounded foci of air within the collapsed basal left lower lobe may communicate with similar foci in the complex subpulmonic fluid collection raising concern for bronchopleural fistula.
New small right pleural effusion.
CXR: [**2191-8-31**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in extent of the right-sided pleural effusion, leading to a blunting of the right medial cardiophrenic space and increased right basilar atelectasis.
On the left, there is a small increase in pleural effusion, one of the three left-sided chest tubes has been removed in the interval.
No other changes, notably no evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities indicative of pneumonia.
[**2191-8-23**]: CXR Two loculations within moderate left pleural effusion, which in the right clinical setting would raise concern for empyema.
[**2191-8-21**]: The left pleural effusion is currently loculated.
There is no change since [**8-18**], but there is significant decrease since [**8-18**] and 9.
There is loculated air within the right upper pleura.
No interval development of consolidation worrisome for progression of infectious process has been currently demonstrated.
[**2191-9-1**]: Left upper Extremity Doppler: No evidence of acute left upper extremity DVT.
Left IJ appears chronically occluded which appears to have been present on [**2191-8-18**] CT.    Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 52**] is a 69 year old woman with a history of cerebral palsy, developmental delay with cognitive impairment, and recurrent left pleural effusion s/p placement of Pleu-x catheter ([**3-/2191**]) who presents with cough, shortness of breath and fever.
#FEVER: The patient frequently had low grade fevers overnight, especially on [**8-18**] and [**8-21**] when blood cultures were sent.
The differential for her fever is wide and includes infectious and noninfectious etiologies.
In a patient this age with incontinence suspicion for UTI was high and supported by a urinary analysis with 6-10 WBCs and bacteria.
By hospital day 3, she had developed suprapubic tenderness.
Pulmonary infections were also considered including empyema in the setting of an increasing lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion with loculation.
The patient is at risk for aspiration due to swallowing difficulty and presents with a cough making pneumonia a consideration.
However, the cough seemed to involve the upper respiratory tract with no abnormal lung sounds, normal serum WBC, and serum lactate.
No erythema or induration.
Pt did not have any diarrhea or abdominal pain or rigidity.
Noninfectious causes were unlikely, but includes pulmonary embolism in a patient presenting with fever and dyspnea.
However, there was no dyspnea or tachypnea throughout her hospital course and heart rate remained within a normal range with no changes in blood pressure.
Finally, post-ictal state was considered given her history of seizure disorder.
The pt's urinary tract infection was treated on a three day regiment of Bactrim.
However, suprapubic pain persisted.
By the third day on Vanc/Levaquin, the patient was found to be afebrile overnight with minimal symptoms such as cough.
#RECURRENT PLEURAL EFFUSION: Pt has history of a trapped lung s/p thoracoscopy, pleural biopsy and pleur-x catheter placement.
Patient also underwent left tPA placement via the Pleu-x and now presents with fever and cough.
Upon presentation, pleural fluid was drained and showed a lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion.
The etiology is unclear as only one culture was positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus (likely contaminant) and pathology negative for malignancy.
CT scan showed loculated effusion with foci of air, not being accessed by the Pleu-x catheter.
They recommended continuing antibiotic coverage for upper respiratory tract infection and attempted a subsequent drainage of the collection which only produced 20cc of fluid.
#SEIZURE DISORDER: The patient's cousin [**Name (NI) 382**] describes her seizure episodes as generalized tonic-clonic seizures followed by somnolence with confusion as alertness increases.
Throughout her course, she had upper respiratory tract mucous build up so an induced sputum culture was sent but was contaminated.
After concerns were raised about her ability to take PO medications, she was evaluated by speech and swallow and sent for a fluoroscopic swallow study.
No reported symptoms of acid reflux.
#ANEMIA: Unclear baseline (27-30), but was stable throughout hospital course with guaiac negative stools and no signs of bleeding.

Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Seizure Disorder NOS Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
