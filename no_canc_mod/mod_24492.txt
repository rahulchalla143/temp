The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced under direct visualization until the cecum was reached.
There were no complications.
Findings:  Contents: A white tube most likely the PEG tube was seen going through the transverse colon.
There was no bleeding, and no ulceration around it.
Flat Lesions A single angioectasia that was not bleeding was seen in the proximal transverse colon.
Excavated Lesions A few non-bleeding diverticula were seen in the sigmoid colon.Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Angioectasia in the proximal transverse colon PEG tube seen going through the transverse colon Recommendations: If Re bleeds while in hospital then please get Tagged RBC scan / angiogram If dropping HCT and has melena again after discharge - consider Capsule endoscopy   _________________________________ [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2643**], MD (attending)  _________________________________ [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD  Case documented on [**2132-9-4**] 11:33:02 AM Patient: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 16471**] ([**Numeric Identifier 67110**])  Brief Hospital Course: 76M with hx of MS, AFIB, old anterior MI, recent UTI/C diff, cervical laminectomies and fusion in may who was admitted for revision of cervical fixation on [**2132-8-14**] and [**2132-8-18**].
