No oropharyngeal lesions or erythema.
EOMI, no scleral icterus or conjunctival injection.
no m/r/g appreciated.
2+ radial pulse PULM: CTAB, poor air movement with kyphosis ABD: Non-tender, +BS, soft without guarding EXT: Upper extremity pitting edema persists, right worse than left.
RLE ulcers stable, no signs of cellulitis.
Erythema with edema around elbows bilaterally.
[**4-12**] upper and lower extremity strength.
IMAGING: [**2101-4-18**] ECHO Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional and mild global hypokinesis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2096-12-13**], the severity of aortic regurgitation has increased.
No evidence of neck masses or pathologic lymphadenopathy.
Per discussion with the primary team, palpable area of abnormality is consistent with a small lymph node.
Severe atherosclerotic disease.
Significant emphysema and calcified pleural plaques, better evaluated on subsequent CT torso.
Partially solid and calcified benign appearing dominant right lower lobe nodule.
This may represent a hamaratoma or sequela of prior Tb.
Known emphysematous changes and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery is consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
Mild dilatation of the ascending aorta up to 4 cm in conjunction with atherosclerotic calcification involving the coronary arteries and aortic valve.
Bilateral rib fractures as detailed above.
Mild wall thickening and inflammation surrounding the esophagus which contains fluid.
This presumably relates to the known underlying esophageal dysmotility and esophagitis as seen on recent endoscopy.
[**2101-4-16**] BILAT UP EXT VEINS US: Bilateral upper extremity DVT, involving the right basilic and cephalic veins and one of two left brachial veins distally.
There is no extension into the axillary or subclavian systems.
Moderately large left pleural effusion, stable since [**2101-4-13**].
Possible left lower lobe atelectasis/pneumonia stable since [**2101-4-13**].
EGD [**4-11**]: Mucous in the esophagus [**Last Name (un) 23424**] esophagus Small non-bleeding pre-pyloric gastric ulcer Small non-bleeding stomach body ulcer (distal lesser curvature) Small stomach body ulcer with stigmata of recent bleeding (endoclip) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
EGD [**4-13**]: Coffee ground heme in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, without active bleeding or source of bleeding Diverticulum in the esophagus at 20cm from the incisors Previously-placed endoclip in good position without bleeding from underlying gastric body ulcer Gastritis, duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
EGD [**4-15**]: Thick mucous in the esophagus [**Last Name (un) 23424**] esophagus Non-bleeding distal esophagitis Non-bleeding gastritis Small non-bleeding pre-pyloric ulcer Small previously-clipped gastric body ulcer, with endoclip in good position and no bleeding Few small non-bleeding angioectasias in the jejunum Non-bleeding duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to mid-jejunum .
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: 86 year old male with a history of COPD, CAD, CHF and remote history of PUD presenting with UGI bleed, hypotension, and HCT drop s/p transfusion with 9 units pRBCs, and found to hvae bilateral upper extremity venous thromboses.
The patient had multiple acute HCT drops to low 20s and required pRBC transfusion x9 (2 at outside hospital, 7 at [**Hospital1 18**]) with stable HCT since [**4-14**].
No active bleeding by EGD, with one ulcer with bleeding sequela endoclipped.
Remote history of PUD per pt, recent use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids suggest upper GI ulcer as the source of bleeding.
A more distal GI bleed beyond reach of EGD is another possibility, as the patient has evident angioectasias in the jejunum with no ulcers in the duodenum.
He should follow up with GI to have repeat EGD to evaluate gastric ulcer and consider capsule endoscopy to further evaluate a small bowel source.
# Upper Extremity DVT.
On his final transfer to the floor, pt had 2+ bilateral pitting edema of upper extremities.
By U/S pt found to have bilateral thromboses in upper extremity veins.
Left side has DVT (1 of 2 brachial veins), right side has superficial thromboses (cephalic and basilic veins).
Given bilaterality and largely unprovoked thormboses (IJ line with appropriate placement), a hypercoagulable state is a possibility.
There is a positive family history of thrombosis, as pt's mother died from PE.
A possible malignancy was also considered, given the presence of a pleural effusion, left cervial mass and nodule on CXR.
However, a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis found no evidence of overt malignancy.
As discussed above, anticoagulation was held for concerning of life-threatening GI bleed.
He was stated on aspirin 81mg daily for minimal anticoagulation.
# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: No known history of A fib (patient is unsure), but pt developed A fib during this hospitalization with rapid ventricular response.
Cause of new-onset A fib is most likely from physical stress of recent bleeding events, but alternatively may be from cardiac irritation due to thromboembolism or pneumonia; alternatively worsening CHF, CAD, hyperthyroidism (TSH wnl [**2101-4-13**]), or hypertension (pt currently normotensive on floor).
CHADS2 score is [**3-11**] (no documented history of CVA, TIA or diabetes).
TTE [**4-18**] showed no intramural thrombosis.
He will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient and consider initiating anticoagulation or possible cardioversion at that time.
# Leukocytosis: Patient had an elevated white count 13-21k with neutrophilia this admission, which trended down over time, and has been afebrile on the floor.
Multiple etiologies of leukocytosis are potentially present.
Pt presented on steroid taper for COPD exacerbation, which may be contributing to leukocytosis by promoting demargination.
Bleeding itself can cause leukocytosis from a leukemoid recation.
RLE ulcers over distal metatarsal and plantar aspect of the great toe may be site of infection (soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis): culture found diptheroids, evaluated by podiatry.
However, no erythema or purulence on LE.
Left upper extremity rash concerning for cellulitis, though it is not spreading and not warmer than other skin.
Concern for PNA vs atelectasis in LLL in most recent CXR, and patient has a history of multipla PNAs.
Thrombosis causing upper extremity edema could also promote leukocytosis.
An underlying hematologic malignancy could explain leukocytosis, but DIFF shows no atypicals.
No clinical evidence of cellulitis or foot ulcer infection at time of discharge, white count normalized to 9.2. .
# Right Lower Extremity Ulcers: Afebrile and no evidence purulence or cellulitis.
# Emphysema: History of emphysema/COPD without home oxygen requirement.
At admission, he was on a steroid taper for a recent COPD flare.
There was no clear indication of CHF exacerbation currently, though persistent upper extremity edema is present (likely due to upper extremity thromboses).
# Restless Leg Syndrome: The patient's symptoms were controlled by increasing his home Ropinirole dose to 1.5 mg at night.
Upper GI Bleeding.
Patient admitted with severe GI bleeding requiring 9 pRBC transfusions.
He will need to be monitored for signs of GI bleeding, including melena and bright red blood per rectum.
Bilateral venous thrombosis in upper extremities were found after the patient had persistent upper extremity edema (superficial thrombi on right side, deep thrombus on left side).
Atrial Fibrillation.
The patient has no knowledge of prior atrial fibrillation, but while in the hospital was noted to have episodes of fibrillation interspersed among periods of normal sinus rhythm.
With a CHADS score of [**3-11**], coagulation could be recommended, be given the recent GI bleed anticoagulation was held (see above).
If GI bleeding has been stable, can reconsider anti-coagulation or possible cardioversion if still in a fib.

You were admitted with blood in your stools which are likely coming from your small bowel.
You three endoscopies done to evaluate your esophagus, stomach, and part of your small intestine which did not show a lot of active bleeding, but a metal clip was placed over an existing ulcer in your stomach.
You required blood transfusions and two ICU stays for your bleeding to stabilize and at the time of discharge your blood counts were stable.
They may also consider to do further studies of your small bowel at that time.
During your hospitalization you were found to have atrial fibrillation which is an abnormal rhythm of your heart.
We did not see this documented previously in your records, but it's possible that you have had this before without symptoms.
You likely developed it this time due to bleeding and stress.
You were also found to have a deep vein clot in one of your arms and a superficial vein clot in your other arm.
We started you on a baby aspirin and you will follow up with cardiology in 2 weeks to reassess your heart rhyhtm and discuss blood thinners at that time.
