Admission Date:  [**2124-9-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-9-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-7-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint:  nausea, vertigo, ataxia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year-old man with history of severe peripheral vascular disease who was transferred to our ED after he experienced several symptoms last night and this morning and an OSH head CT revealed a hyperintense lesion in his right dorsolateral medulla/inferior cerebellar peduncle.
He stood up and walked to his living room to lie on the rug, which he often does when he gets a headache or feels unwell.
He remembers feeling a bit unsteady changing his clothes for bed, but shaved and showered and dried off without any difficulty, and then slept well for several hours.
He endorses a spinning dizzy sensation in addition to recurrence of lightheadedness at that time, but denies headache, speech change, weakness, sensory change, and vision/hearing change.
At that time, he noticed a mild headache, which was diffuse (holocephalic, perhaps worse in front), achy, non-positional, and not sudden in onset.
He was still walking "like a drunk," and had difficulty dressing and walking downstairs.
On my review of the images, it looks like a round, moderately hyperintense mass (just under a centimeter in diameter) in or immediately atop the dorsolateral aspect of the mid-to-caudal medulla (near or at the caudal end of the inf cb peduncle, perhaps overlying the vestibular and rostral dorsal-column nuclei and extending medially to or near the rostral DMV/NTS/AP complex).
He denies any history of cerebral infarction, aneurysm, tumor, or vascular malformation.
He has never had any symptoms like this before.
Denies difficulties producing or comprehending speech.
He acknowledges that his voice sounds a bit slurred, but he insists that it is only because of dry throat.
No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain (just "sour stomach" y/d and earlier this morning).
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
CAD, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease: - bilateral carotid endarterectomies circa [**2102**] (Left was revised once, due to "scarring") due to "90% blockage."
Denies h/o stroke.
Says may have had TIA once before the CEAs (episode of vertigo at a barbershop).
"retinal tear causing chronic double-vision especially when looking left" per pt.
Diabetes on MTF/Januvia 4.
Hypertension on HCTZ/BB (says A1c was 6.5% [**2124-1-23**]) 5.
Hyperlipidemia on statin (says TC was 114 recently) >>Denies h/o stroke/MI, denies any neurologic disease history besides carotid atherosclerotic disease   Social History: Lives at home with wife, independent in ADLs/iADLs, normally walks without assistance.

Says he has no current headache or dizziness, and only mild lightheadedness currently.
No bruits appreciated elsewhere (e.g.
No scleral icterus.
No lesions noted in oropharynx.
Neck: Supple, with full range of motion and no nuchal rigidity.
No carotid bruits.
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally with reduced BS at bases.
Cardiac: Distant, sharp HS, RRR, no loud M/R/G appreciated.
Slightly pale.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin: no gross rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
Speech was mildly dysarthric (pt denies, says it is dry throat).
There were no paraphasic errors.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect or ideomotor apraxia or left-right confusion.
There is occasional subtle nystagmus at rest, and the lower eyelids twitch a bit (more prominent on the Left).
There is mixed rotatory/vertical nystagmus (vertical most prominent looking up and right; rotatory most prominent looking right and up/right).
VII: No ptosis, no flattening of either nasolabial fold, but very subtle assymetry of [**Location (un) 67019**] border (down towards right).
Slightly paratonic in both legs.
Mild rest/intention tremor in RUE, which pt holds flexed 90deg up in the air frequently for no apparent reason.
Joint position sense is normal in both upper (5th digits) and lower extremities (great toes).
Eyes-closed Finger-to-[**Last Name (un) **] testing revealed no proprioceptive deficit (did not miss [**Last Name (Titles) **]), despite gross RUE ataxia.
Left UE with very mild end-reach tremor on FNF, but not clearly ataxic and mirroring is normal.
No dysdiadochokinesia noted on rapid-alternating movements.
-Gait: Stands slowly, but without difficulty.
Wide base, very unsteady (ataxic gait), becomes rapidly nauseous and vomits x1.
No flow-limiting renovascular stenosis or Preliminary Reportthrombosis.
Severe atherosclerosis at the aortoiliac bifurcation, with distal Preliminary Reportreconstitution.
Prominent adrenals, without discrete nodules.
No evidence of renal size discrepancy.
Mild, bilateral increased resistive indices in the interlobar arteries, may reflect intrinsic kidney disease.
This is a small discrepancy and may be related to technical difficulties.
If clinical concern remains, CT or MR angiogram would be beneficiary as tests of choice.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old man multiple vascular risk factors came in with vertigo, nausea and vomiting and found to have a posterior lateral medullary/inferior cerebellar peduncle hemorrhage on the right.
The etiology is cavernoma versus HTN-related hemorrhage.
An underlying lesion is unlikely, but can't be completely ruled out.
While here he was determined to need rehab given his severe functional impairment secondary to vertigo.
He developed severe refractory hypertension with hypokalemia (we began investigation for hyperaldosteronism).
His hypokalemia has been stable with about 20 meq of potassium given per day (HCTZ).
Renal MRA/US did not show significant stenosis of the renal arteries nor clear adrenal mass.
ALPRAZolam 0.25 mg PO DAILY:PRN anxiety (home med) hold for sedation or RR<12 or SaO2<96% 2.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Diabetes 5.Left renal stenosis s/p stent   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Neuro exam: Awake, alert and oriented x3, mild facial droop on the right side.
No focal deficit in motor or sensory.
Dysmetria in right hand.
You were admitted to hospital as your symptoms were concerning for stroke.
In performed tests we found that you have bleeding in your brain stem which caused you vertigo, imbalance and worsened your double vision.
During your hospital stay you developes high blood pressure , we performed multiple tests to make sure that your kidney stent is working well and you have no abnormality in your adrenal , as some time adrenal problem can cause high blood pressure.
All test results so far came back normal so you do not have any adrenall mass and your stent is working well .
We stopped HCTZ as you developed low potassium level and this medication can worsen that.We also stopped atenolol.
