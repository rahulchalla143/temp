Compression fracture of the T4 vertebral body with mild retropulsion of the posterior fragment.
No significant spinal canal narrowing though the thecal sac is likely indented.
Right C7 facet fracture again visualized.
Cardiomegaly and markedly dilated pulmonary vasculature suggestive of congestive heart failure.
R ankle xrays with pilon fx of distal tibia as well as fibula fracture.
The patient had no acute abdominal pathology and no evidence of variceal bleed or other complication due to his liver failure during his hospitalization.
No changes in his prior liver failure management were implemented and all his regular home medications were restarted prior to discharge.
On repeat examination in the TSICU he was noted to have thoracic and lumbar spinal tenderness and had a CT T-L-S spine.
It showed compression fracture of the T4 vertebral body with mild retropulsion of the posterior fragment.
No significant spinal canal narrowing though the thecal sac is likely indented; as well as right C7 facet fracture.
C-collar was coninued as above and no brace or precautions were recommended regarding the T4 compression fracture.
Orthopedic surgery was consulted for his left wrist and right ankle fracutres.
He was taken to the OR for external fixation of his pilon fracture and ORIF of his left wrist.
