Admission Date:  [**2144-1-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-2-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2089-4-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Aspirin / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: transfer to ICU s/p stroke  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tunnelled catheter placement Picc line placement   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 54 year-old portuguese speaking woman with a PMH insulin dependent DM with nephropathy and neuropathy, HTN, PVD, and acute on chroni renal failure who was transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital after being found to have decreased movement of the left arm > left leg.
The patient was admitted to the OSH on [**2144-1-16**] with a CC of decreased PO intake.
Per the patient's daughter, the patient was discharged from the hospital on [**2144-1-7**] after an admission for RLE wound related to her diabetes.
She was noted on admission to the OSH to have worsening renal failure with BUN61 and Cr 4.7.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt had MRI/MRA and CT which showed a subacte infarct involving the R globus pallidus and internal capsule.
Past Medical History: GERD DMII with neuropathy and renal failure.
Renal Failure - chronic/acute HTN Right foot osteomyelitis.
Peripheral Vascular Disease.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx.
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity  Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, soft, nl.
Extremities: Severe wound on RLE - including necrotic deep wound.
Pertinent Results: IMAGING: OSH-EKG: Sinus tach at 105, normal axis, normal intervals, no acute t-wave St-segment abnormalities.
OSH CT - with small vessle ischemic changes.
NCHCT - Subacute infarct involving the right globus pallidus and internal capsule.
No intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
MRI - Diffusion and adc abnormalities in the area corresponding to the NCHCT.
Renal U/S - Limited study without evidence of hydronephrosis or large mass.
Foot XR - no areas of bony erosion are seen to suggest osteomyelitis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Carotid U/S - no significant stenosis .
Vein Mapping - IMPRESSION:  Patent bilateral basilic veins and left cephalic vein.
Normal bilateral brachial arteries with triphasic Doppler waveforms.
Bone Scan - IMPRESSION:  Abnormal study with intense increased radiotracer uptake on all three phases in the right ankle region.
This is a non-specific finding and infection vs fracture vs charcot joint or a combination of these entities remain within the differential.
[**2144-2-7**] p-MIBI: normal wall motion, no perfusion defect, no changes on EKG, no symptoms manifested with test.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ECG changes from baseline.
URINE  BLOOD-MOD NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-100 GLUCOSE-TR KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-5.0 LEUK-SM  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 7563**] is a 54 year-old female with an extensive past medical history including DM, PVD, HTN, and nephropathy transferred for acute stroke and possible TPA.
Based on the imaging there was no vascular cutoff on which to intervene despite a subacute infarct in the right thalmus/internal capsule.
The patient presented with a subacute CVA with residual left-sided upper extremity weakness.
CT head ([**2144-1-17**]) revealed subacute infarct involving the right globus pallidus and internal capsule.
MRI brain ([**2144-1-17**]) revealed correlated increased signal intensity in the posterior limb of the internal capsule.
There was no hemorrhage.
Given the subacute nature of the injury, the patient was not a candidate for lysis therapy.
Aspirin therapy was deferred due to a history of an aspirin allegy.
On carotid ultrasound the patient had no significant stenosis.
Lower extremity ultrasound did reveal bilateral tibial artery disease.
Echo on [**2144-1-20**] was a limited study though revealed no intracardiac source of embolus and no PFO.
# CV: The patient's EKG showed T wave flattening in I and aVL in the setting of negative serial cardiac enzymes.
# Respiratory: The patient has a brief stay in the ICU including intubation for likely volume overload.
CXR [**1-19**] showed fluid overload, and she was given Lasix 20mg IV and 0.5 in nitropaste for hypertension.
She subsequently had continued improvement in respiratory function especially with establishment of scheduled hemodialysis to control volume overload.
She had a foot ulcer that probed to bone at that time and MRI revealed bony changes concerning for osteomyelitis.
She underwent bone scan on [**2144-1-23**] with signs of abnormal tracer uptake in the ankle of unclear significance possibly consistent with osteo, fracture or chacot foot.
The patient had a repeat MRI while in the hospital at [**Hospital1 18**] revealing bony abnormalities consistent with osteomyelitis though also possibly consistent with charcot foot.
The patient also underwent lower extremity vascular studies revealing no clear intervenable vascular deficits.
The paitent was evaluated by the inpatient podiatry and vascular surgery consult services both of whom recommended no immediate intervention, instead favoring completion of 6 week antibiotic course and outpatient follow-up.
The patient's urine also grew enterococcus and vancomycin therapy as above was continued to treat this infection.
She completed a course of antibiotics on [**2144-2-4**] with antiobitics being dosed with hemodialysis.
She had frequent wound care.
She remained afebrile for the remainder of her course.
# Renal: The patient was transferred with acute on chronic renal failure.
Her Cr continued to rise and in the setting of volume overload the patient was initiated on hemodialysis after right subclavian tunnelled HD catheter placement on [**2144-1-22**].
She underwent vein mapping for possible future fistula placement in the event of prolonged HD needs.
The etiology of the patient's renal failure was felt multifactorial.
On renal U/S on [**2144-1-17**] the patient had 10-11cm kidneys without hydronephrosis.
UA was consistent with significant proteinuria and infection.
Culture eventually grew enterococcus which was treated with vancomycin as described above.
Urine micoscopy also revealed muddy brown castst consistent with ATN possibly due to hypotension at the time of recent CVA.
She likely has baseline diabetic nephropathy complicated by AIN and ATN.
SPEP and UPEP showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and no Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] protein.
Of note, on [**2144-2-1**] the patient had an episode of hypotension, diaphoresis and nausea while on HD after removal of 1L of fluid.
Likely this represents hypovolemia due to overdialysis.
Again, on [**2144-2-3**], she had an episode of hypotension with HD, which resolved with IVF.
It was decided to keep the patient in house for a cardiac stress test prior to discharge as hypotension with HD may indicate underlying coronary artery disease.
The p-MIBI was not concerning for ischemia (see above report).
# Shoulder pain: Tendonitis, tendon tears and labral tears were seen on MR. She was evaluated by the orthopedic team who felt that no acute intervention was warranted and she should continue antiinflammatory medications and physical therapy.
# Elevated INR: The patient received Vitamin K 5mg daily for 3 days.
Her anemia was felt to be secondary to her renal failure.
We recommend outpatient followup to optimize her blood sugar control.
