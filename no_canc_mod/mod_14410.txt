[**2125-10-7**] Repair of Right Common Femoral Artery Pseudoaneurysm.
[**2125-10-2**] Cardiac Catheterization with Successful Angioplasty of an acutely occluded diagonal branch without stenting.
History of Present Illness: This is a 70 year old male transferred from [**Hospital3 **] in cardiogenic shock after undergoing cardiac catheterization which revealed an occlusion in his left anterior descending artery.
Patient became hypotensive and bradycardic requiring intubation and placement of an IABP for hemodynamic support.
Mr. [**Known lastname 48612**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] was also significant for mitral regurgitation, aortic insufficiency, and dilated ascending aorta.
An echocardiogram on [**2125-9-25**] showed mild aortic insufficiency, mild aortic stenosis, severe mitral regurgitation and dilated ascending aortic aneurysm.

No history of excessive ETOH.
Family History: No history of premature coronary artery disease.

Likely no stenosis of the right carotid and less than 40% stenosis of the left carotid.
There remained a 30% residual with normal flow and no dissection.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no significant aortic valve  stenosis but aortic valve velocities/gradient may have been underestimated.
No  aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification with moderate mitral inflow  gradient.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2125-10-7**] Groin Ultrasound: There is a large fairly anechoic hematoma in the right groin, with a pseudoaneurysm which is poorly organized and extending over several centimeters.
[**2125-10-9**] TEE, PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function maybe depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No significant MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 48613**].
There is a well seated bioprostheis in the aortic position.
After arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] pt sedation stopped, weaned from ventilator and extubated, pt then found to have continuing angina and was [**Last Name (un) 4662**] to the cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**] for angioplasty of LAD(please see report for details)following which the angina was resolved.
On hospital day 5 the patient was noted to have an expanding hematoma at the catheterization site and vascular surgery was again consulted.
The patient had a repair of the Right femoral pseudoaneurysm by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**](please see OR note for details).
He is also to have an INR check by the visiting nurse on [**10-19**] with the results called to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 20683**] who will monitor his INR.
