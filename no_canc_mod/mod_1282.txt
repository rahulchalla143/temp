He describes  the pain as [**9-10**] associated with nausea, vomit and worse on inspiration and radiated to the L arm and jaw.
In the ED, EKG with ST elevations on II-III-AVF- I-AVL v4-v5-v6.
LMCA Normal LAD 70% ulcerated stenosis with TIMI 3 flow, D1 is TO LCX ulcerated thrombotic stenosis in the distal LCX with TIMI 2 flow RCA normal.
No new EKG changes compare to EKG post cath, ST elevation in precordial leads improving.
the chest pain did not respond to 2 sublingual nitro, so Nitro drip was started and Morphine 2mg x2 was given obtaining pain relief.
Anal condyloma 3.
PCP pneumonia currently treated.
Unknown Brain lesion right temporal lesion  Social History: Lives with roommate.
No other substances.
Cardiology: Cath [**2136-12-27**] Hemodynamics: Elevated left heart filling pressures with preserved ci Co 4.64, CI 2.88 PCW 20 PA 39/7 Mean 16 LV 97/11 25 RV 39 end 12 Left ventriculography: No mitral regurgitation, anterolateral and inferoapical hypokinesis LVEF ~45% .
Coronary angiography: [**2136-12-27**] Right dominant LMCA Normal LAD 70% ulcerated stenosis with TIMI 3 flow, D1 is TO LCX ulcerated thrombotic stenosis in the distal LCX with TIMI 2 flow RCA normal .
Midly depressed systolic ventricular function.
Moderately elevated left heart filling pressure.
Mildly depressed cardiac output.
Trivial TR and MR .
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the posterior and lateral walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Imaging: CT CHEST, W&W/O CONTRAST ([**2136-12-15**]): There is a 4.8 x 2.8 cm consolidative opacity within the left upper lobe with surrounding nodularity and ground-glass opacity, as described above.
The differential for this includes a consolidative pneumonic process, though given the patient's history of HIV, atypical organisms such as aspergillus or TB should also be considered.
MR HEAD With GADO/ADC ([**2136-12-19**]): Signal abnormalities in the right temporal and occipital lobes, likely represent either evolving acute brain ischemia, an infiltrative process such as lymphoma, or inflammatory process.
Sinus rhythm.
Severe right axis deviation *** LATERAL INFARCT - POSSIBLY ACUTE *** Tall R waves in lead V1, V2 - consider posterior wall myocardial infarct No change from previous .
Occasional microglial nodules at [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction.
No diagnostic Toxoplasma gondii or multinucleated cells (e.g.
Scattered gram-positive cocci isolated and in pairs, not directly associated with microglial nodules.
NOTE: This brain biopsy includes neocortex and a small amount of underlying subcortical white matter.
Several small microglial nodules are present at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction in the several levels prepared from the tissue.
They also lack diagnostic viral inclusions (including the inclusions of PML), giant cells, or Toxoplasma organisms.
The acid fast stain is negative for bacilli and the GMS silver stain lacks fungi or yeast forms.
The tissue gram stain shows infrequent gram-positive cocci scattered over the tissue, sometimes near sites of pathology and sometimes in otherwise normal brain.
While the lack of secondary tissue changes to many of these organisms suggests they may be a staining contaminant, the culture prepared from this same brain tissue did grow rare coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
Based on the H&E and lack of staining in AFB and GMS stains, the main differential diagnoses for the microglial nodules at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction would be HIV encephalitis and treated toxoplasmosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 43yo male with history of HIV, PCP pneumonia, seizures who was found to have a brain mass.
The pt initially presented to the Ed with complaints of chest pain, underwent a cardiac workup which revealed a postero-lateral STEMI.
The pt underwent a brain biopsy which revealed no evidence of lymphoma or focal infection.
The brain biopsy was significant for some gram positive cocci which were thought to be a contaminant.
CARDIAC: ISCHEMIA The pt has no known past cardiac history.
He presented with acute onset chest pain and was noted to have inferolateral ST elevations with a CK peak of 5864, MB>500 and Troponin-T of 9.83.
His cardiac cath revealed a right dominant circulation with two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had an ulcerated lesion in the mid segment with 70% stenosis and TIMI 3 flow.
The LCx had a proximal 40% stenosis and the distal segment had an ulcerated thrombotic stenosis with TIMI 2 flow after OM3.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right heart filling pressure and moderately elevated left heart filling pressure (RVEDP 15 mmHg, LVEDP 26 mmHg, mean PCWP 20 mmHg).
There was mild to moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Left ventriculography demonstrated anterolateral and inferoapical hypokinesis.
The distal CX thrombotic lesion was angioplastied using a Maverick and a Voyager balloon with lesion reduction from 95% to 10%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection but embolization in a small branch of the OM.
No stents placed given brain lesion and risk of bleeding with Plavix and Integrilin.
In the post-cath period the pt developed repeat episode of chest pain, described as "sharp", "14/10" and focal over cardiac apex.
The chest pain resolved with 1mg IV morphine sulfate.
The pt was noted to have one subsequent episode of chest pain on the day of the brain biopsy which was not associated with any new or acute EKG changes (unchanged compared to previous).
The pt's pain was relieved with 1 SL Nitro and 1mg IV morphine.
The cardiac cath was also significant for an elevated wedge pressure in 20's, severe hypokinesis of posterior and lateral walls, trivial mitral regurgitation and no effusion.
LEUKOCYTOSIS: The pt was noted to have an elevated white count of 24.3 but no bands or fever on admission.
The WBC count decreased to within normal limits on subsequent lab readings the same day and it was thought that the pt may have had transient leukocytosis secondary to acute MI.
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: The pt was noted to have a CXR significant for a worsening of consolidation in the left upper lobe with cavitation.
It was thought that this may represent worsening of pneumonia or a hemorrhage from a recent biopsy (which showed no aspergillus or fungal elements).
The was placed on TB precautions until TB was ruled out with acid fast smears from induced sputum and a bronchoalveolar lavage which revealed Pneumocystis Carinii on immunofluorescence testing.
The pt also underwent testing for Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test in which no respiratory viral antigens were detected.
INFECTIOUS DISEASES WORK-UP: The pt was noted to have negative tests for legionella urinary antigen, fungus ([**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage), RPR ([**First Name3 (LF) **]), Toxoplasma antibodies (IgG, IgM) and cryptococcal antigen.
SEIZURES: The pt was noted to have new-onset seizures during his last hospitalization.
He was started on Keppra and was noted to have a non-specific hypodensity in the right temporal lobe on CT. During that admission the pt had an EEG that showed the unknown hypodensity to be a likely source of his seizure activity.
On discharge after his last hospitalization the pt was also informed of state law requiring 6 months of no seizures prior to driving again, and was instructed to make  arrangements to inform his place of employment.
When the pt was admitted on [**2136-12-27**] he was not noted to have any focal deficits.
The pt underwent a planned brain biopsy which showed no diagnostic Toxoplasma gondii or multinucleated cells, scattered gram-positive cocci isolated and in pairs, not directly associated with microglial nodules (the nodules lacked multinucleated cells that would be diagnostic for HIV encephalitis), the acid fast stain was negative for bacilli and the GMS silver stain lacked fungi or yeast forms, tissue gram stain showed infrequent gram-positive cocci scattered over the tissue, sometimes near sites of pathology and sometimes in otherwise normal brain.
While the lack of secondary tissue changes to many of these organisms suggested they may be a staining contaminant, the culture prepared from this same brain tissue did grow rare coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
A decision was made to discharge the patient on his HAART regimen, cardiac medications and PCP pneumonia treatment.
No treatment was indicated based on clinical correlation (no mental status changes, no signs of meningitis or clinical signs of infection).The pt was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7991**] who will discuss the final results of the biopsy (brain) and pending microbiology studies.
