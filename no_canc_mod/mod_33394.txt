Admission Date:  [**2151-6-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-6-27**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: intacranial hemorrhage   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubated [**2151-6-21**]  History of Present Illness: 86 yo woman with atrial fibrillation on coumadin and aspirin, HTN, dementia, hypothyroidism, and tremors who lives in [**Hospital3 12272**] was found down after a fall this morning.
She was thought to hit her head on hard surface.
She was first taken to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital where she was found to have L sided weakness.
Her head CT showed a 3.2x2.0.3.5cm R frontal hemorrhage and 4mm hemorrhage in R thalamus.
Past Medical History: HTN Afib dementia - per family baseline is that she doesn't always recognize  people and wouldn't know the day.
hypothyroidism tremors frequent UTIs Infected tooth recently may need root canal   Social History: Lives at [**Hospital3 **] facility.

Does not follow commands   CN - Pupils R 4-->2, L 4-->3; Unable to assess EOMs due to concerns about c-spine, difficult to assess for facial asymmetry with ETT but possible L facial droop   Motor - low tone throughout, withdraws all ext slightly to pain, DTRs 2+ symmetric [**Hospital1 **], tri, bracheoradialis, knees.
Sensory - withdraws to pain  CT head in am at OSH - 3.2x2.0.3.5cm R frontal hemorrhage and 4mm hemorrhage in R thalamus  CT head here unchanged 4pm - 31 x 21 mm acute right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild effacement of the right frontal lobe sulci, unchanged compared to OSH CT 6 hours earlier.
No midline shift.
No new hemorrhage.
Mild left parietal soft tissue subgaleal hematoma.
CTA no aneurysm or vascular malformation  CT c-spine - 1.
No fracture or subluxation.
Biapical lung opacities, right greater than left, might represent pulmonary edema superimposed on an infectious process.
Moderate cervical spondylosis.
CXR - L sided effusion, diffuse airway haziness EKG - ST depressions II, II, aVF and V4-6, atrial fibrillation with rate 128.
INR 2.7 at OSH, down to 1.4 here   Pertinent Results: [**2151-6-21**] 09:53PM   PT-17.8* PTT-28.4 INR(PT)-1.6* [**2151-6-21**] 07:19PM   TYPE-ART PO2-154* PCO2-33* PH-7.50* TOTAL CO2-27 BASE XS-3 [**2151-6-21**] 07:19PM   LACTATE-2.2* [**2151-6-21**] 07:19PM   freeCa-1.14 [**2151-6-21**] 04:00PM URINE  BLOOD-MOD NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-150 GLUCOSE-100 KETONE-15 BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-7.0 LEUK-NEG [**2151-6-21**] 02:20PM   cTropnT-<0.01 [**2151-6-21**] 02:20PM   TSH-2.6  CT: FINDINGS: A 28 x 20 mm right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema and minimal effacement of the right frontal lobe sulci is unchanged.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
No evidence of acute major vascular territory infarction is seen.
A small focus of hyperdensity (2:14) is not seen on the prior examination, unclear if this represents artifact or new area of hemorrhage.
Again noted are chronic changes including periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
The patient has had bilateral replacement of the ocular lenses.
Mucosal thickening and fluid within the ethmoid air cells, sphenoid sinuses and right maxillary sinus appear similar.
Vascular calcifications of the carotid siphons are present.
No fracture is identified.
No significant change in right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema as compared to the examination of [**2151-6-23**].
Small focus of hyperdensity not seen on the prior examination, unclear if this represents artifact or new area of hemorrhage.
MR: FINDINGS: A right medial frontal lobar hematoma is again seen, with hyperintense blood products on the precontrast T1 weighted images.
There is no evidence of nodular contrast enhancement outside of the blood products to suggest an underlying mass.
Vasogenic edema surrounding the right frontal hematoma is stable in extent.
There are innumerable foci of increased susceptibility artifact on the gradient echo images, throughout the brain, the vast majority of which are located superficially, but also with some deep lesion, including in the thalami, left pons, and the left cerebellar hemisphere.
These chronic blood products are most likely secondary to amyloid angiopathy, given the patient's age.
Hypertensive hemorrhages and multiple cavernomas are less likely.
The lesion within the right thalamus shows no surrounding vasogenic edema to suggest recent hemorrhage.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter T2 hyperintensities are most likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
The ventricles and sulci are enlarged secondary to age-related brain atrophy.
Fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses are likely related to endotracheal intubation.
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the subacute right frontal parasagittal hematoma with mild local mass effect.
No evidence of an associated mass.
In the setting of innumerable chronic hemorrhages throughout the brain, the subacute hematoma is most likely secondary to amyloid angiopathy, given the patient's age.
Hypertensive hemorrhages and multiple cavernomas are less likely.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo f with h/o HTN, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and aspirin, dementia, hypothyroidism, tremors admitted with fall at [**Hospital3 **], L sided weakness, R frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and small thalamic hemorrhage.
Most likely amyoid angiopathy vs hypertensive.
On MRI scan the patient was noted to have mulitple microbleeds consistent with amyloid.
She also developed gram negative rods in the lungs and started on on antibiotics.
After discussion with the family and the patient's diagnosis of progressive dementia, it was decided not to pursue trach and the patient was made comfort care and extubated.
