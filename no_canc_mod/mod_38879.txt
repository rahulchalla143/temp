Headache is of a chronic nature and never really resolved, he was seen in urgent care for his HA two weeks prior to admission and given IM toradol with some relief.
He has had some difficulty sleeping due to his headache.
He also notes that he developed some loose stools yesterday, also complaining of decreased po intake for the past few days.
He also denies any nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, bloody stools, urinary symptoms.
He has no known sick contacts and has not had any recent travel.
Reports no neck pain/stiffness, no focal neurologic symptoms.
EKG in the ER was atrial fibrillation at 151bpm with TWI in III and aVF.
He then desaturated to 87% on 3LNC with a HR in the 160's, so he underwent a CTA, which was negative for PE but confirmed the LLL PNA that was seen on CXR.
He is currently complaining of some worsening shortness of breath, but denies any palpitations, chest pain/pressure/tightness, also says that his HA has improved.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2147-7-19**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2147-7-19**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2147-7-21**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
CXR [**7-17**]: Left lower lobe pneumonia.
Possible chronic bronchial inflammation.
CT head w/o contrast [**7-18**]: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or vascular territorial infarct.
Paranasal sinuses are well aerated; mild mucosal thickening is noted in the ethmoid air cells and minimal fluid/mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus.
Apparant mild proptosis on the rigth side may be positional- correlate clinically.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the setting of significant tachycardia.
CTA chest [**7-18**]: The visualized pulmonary vasculature shows no evidence of filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolus.
The aorta shows no evidence of intramural hematoma or dissection.
There are bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Opacifications at the left lung base with air bronchograms as well as small opacification in the right lung base are consistent with pneumonia.
8-mm opacification in the right lung (2,27) most likely represents infectious process; however, recommend attention to this area on followup imaging to determine resolution and to exclude presence of parenchymal process.
This study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
No focal lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions suspicious for malignancy are identified.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Consolidation in the left lower lobe with air bronchograms as well as patchy opacities in the right lower and upper lobe are consistent with pneumonia.
No evidence of purulent secretions.
BAL performed in left lower lobe anterior segment with two aliquots of 60 mL sequentially (total of 120 mL) with return of approximately 30% of instilled lavage.
CXR [**7-19**]: Relatively symmetric peribronchial opacification has worsened on the left, now accompanied by moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
In the setting of moderate cardiomegaly, this is almost certainly pulmonary edema and there are no findings prior to the onset of edema on [**7-17**] to suggest pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
There is no pneumothorax.
There are low lung volumes.
Left lower lobe collapse is unchanged.
Multiple opacities in the right lower lobe and left perihilar regions are also stable.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
LUENI [**7-23**]: FINDINGS: The study is limited in evaluation due to left upper extremity swelling.
There is a lack of flow and compressibility through the left basilic vein suggestive of left basilic vein clot.
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to overlying soft tissue swelling.
However, there is evidence of a left basilic vein thrombus.

#) Community Acquired Pneumonia: Patient with CXR and chest CT with contrast showing evidence of LLL PNA.
In the setting of diarrhea and abdominal pain, legionella was on differential, but urine and sputum legionella were negative.
Initially, patient was doing well and did not have an oxygen requirement.
Oxygen saturations did not improve, so proceeded with elective intubation.
Intubation was complicated by flash pulmonary edema and patient was given Lasix 80mg IV.
His SBP was low, and he had a pressor requirement briefly.
A stat TTE was obtained which demonstrated reduced cardiac function, and mild global hypokinesis.
Given hazy appearance/bilateral infiltrates of CXR which persisted along with PaO2/FiO2 <200, likely there was ARDS secondary to an infectious etiology.
TTE demonstrated  mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50%), so may have mild cardiogenic component but this is less likely.
--repeat CXR in [**3-15**] weeks to document improving infiltrate  #) Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: Patient does report prior history of Afib, back in [**2139**] and was seen at [**Hospital1 112**].
TSH was checked and came back at 4.8 so hyperthyroidism not thought to be cause of afib.
Suspected cause is med effect from amiodarone that was used in ICU for afib and that was stopped on [**7-25**] because patient was in NSR.
No RUQ pain and normal bilis and alk phos.
#) Acute Kidney Injury: Cr in the ER was 1.5 from a baseline of 1.1, likely prerenal in the setting of decreased intake from his recent illness, U/A with microscopic hematuria.
#)Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive in the ICU to SBP of 190s.
Elevated BPs when BP cuff used on legs because of R arm picc and L arm thrombophlebitis.
--discharged on lisinopril 10mg qd (monitor creatinine) .
#)LUE thrombophlebitis: on [**7-22**], patient developed erythema/swelling/tenderness at LUE PIV site.
#) Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: no history of respiratory complications, has never been intubated, mainly has ocular manifestations.
#) Hypothyroidism: his levothyroxine dose was recently uptitrated by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] his TSH was mildly elevated at 9.34 in [**5-20**].
