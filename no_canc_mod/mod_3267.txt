HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 72 year old female with a history of hypertension, recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and a cerebrovascular accident, now on anti-coagulation who presents with shortness of breath.
Per the patient's family, the patient had shortness of breath with acute onset two hours prior to her presentation, with associated decreased responsiveness.
The patient had recently been admitted in [**2104-11-26**] with mental status changes and rule out myocardial infarction and was found to have right occipital bilateral thalamic infarctions with atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin.
She was not responsive to verbal or painful stimuli.
The patient was prepared for rapid tube intubation when her vital signs showed respiratory failure.
The patient had a CT scan of her head given her presentation of decreased responsiveness which was negative for a bleed, shift or mass.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic knee pain.
Atrial fibrillation.
Cerebrovascular accident with right occipital and bilateral thalamic infarctions.
Dry mucous membranes.
No carotid bruits.
Lungs with inspiratory low breath sounds, expiratory with coarse breath sounds.
Extremities were warm with two plus dorsalis pedis pulses; no edema.
Urinalysis shows trace leukocyte esterase, positive nitrites, protein greater than 300, a few bacteria with a white count of 3 to 5.
Chest x-ray suggested a retrocardiac density and bilateral pleural effusions.
EKG was 80 beats per minute, irregular, normal axis, normal R wave progression, nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
Her chest CT SCAN showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolism; it showed left lower lobe collapse, left sided pleural effusion, bilateral basilar atelectasis and pleural thickening.
ASSESSMENT:    This is a 72 year old female with a history of hypertension, cerebrovascular accident and atrial fibrillation, admitted with acute mental status changes and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to a left lower lobe pneumonia, acute onset.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was intubated secondary to respiratory failure with impaired oxygenation secondary to pus in the alveoli.
She had a number of spontaneous breathing trials which she continually failed secondary to continued secretions.
PNEUMONIA:  The patient has been treated for left lower lobe pneumonia.
She was treated with ceftriaxone from [**1-31**] until [**2-3**] and Azithromycin from [**1-31**] through [**2-5**] for a community acquired pneumonia.
However, the patient was bronchoscoped multiple times to help clear her secretions and to help her left lower lobe collapse open up with removal of obstructive plugs and secretions and it was thought, given the nature of her secretions being very thick and pus-like, in addition to her airways which were consistent with bronchiectasis, that she should be placed on coverage that included Pseudomonas.
The patient was also briefly treated with Vancomycin starting on [**2-13**], where she had an episode of hypotension and it was appearing as though she may have become septic, however, the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage which was negative for any evidence of a gram positive infection necessitating Vancomycin coverage and this was promptly discontinued.
MENTAL STATUS CHANGE:  The patient had a dubious mental status at the time of her admission likely secondary to her acute onset pneumonia.
The patient's mental status improved significantly with treatment of her pneumonia and the patient did not require any sedation while she was intubated.
boluses which worked very well for agitation and for keeping the patient sedated during the times of bronchoscopy.
The patient had one episode where she was noted to be biting on her OG tube and had a shift in her mental status which prompted a head CT scan that was negative for any new infarction and only showed her previous right occipital and bilateral thalamic infarctions.
She also had an EEG to make sure she had no evidence of seizure that was attributed to her acute change and this was also negative.
Of note, the patient had had a lumbar puncture at the time of her admission to rule out meningitis and that had also been negative.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient had a history of atrial fibrillation and had been on 150 gm p.o.
The patient's doses were continually changed throughout her hospitalization secondary to periods of hypotension and tachycardia.
At the time of this dictation, her dosing was actually at her home dose of 150 mg although it was increased to three times a day as she became more tachycardia prior to the dosing of her second daily dose.
