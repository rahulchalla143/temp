He states these symptoms have been going on for some time (weeks).
He denies any vertigo or diplopia.
No fevers but endorses some chills and myalgias.
No chest pain or palpitations.
He endorses a new cough and a dry itchy throat, as well as congestion.
He does have a positive sick contact in that his wife has "a cold."
He has had a somewhat depressed appetite and did vomit his food earlier today.
No abdominal pain or diarrhea.
He denies dysuria prior to having a Foley placed in the ED.
Once euglyemic, he had no complaints and was very interactive.
Initial labs revealed elevated lactate to 8.1, with AG was elevated at 21.
A sepsis CVL was placed and infectious workup was initiated, which revealed no leukocytosis or bandemia.
He had a clean U/A and a CXR which showed patchy opacities within both lung bases.
SvO2 monitoring revealed central venous O2 sats in mid 50's, but dobutamine not started given concern for promoting tachycardia.

Shock, possibly septic - evidence of hypoperfusion with lactate peak in ED of 8.1, improving to 4.1-->3.3 with fluids.
Unclear etiology but most likely source at this point appears pulmonary, either viral or bacterial.
# Hypoglycemia - likely from ongoing sepsis, but contributions from medication effect and poor hepatic/renal clearance of oral hypoglycemics vs. impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis are also possible.
CAD s/p MI: No evidence of ischemia on EKG.
One set of enzymes were negative int he ED but pt never complained of any chest pain.
chronic systolic CHF: did not appear to be in florid decompensated CHF at this time.
He reported only mild SOB, and CXR did not reveal evidence of pulmonary edema.
Recent Fe studies did not reveal iron deficiency.
On that admission there was also no evidence of hemolysis.
# Elevated LFTs: The patient has had chronically elevated LFTs and currently they are not significantly changed from prior.
Felt likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy versus medication induced (was on amiodarone until recently) .
Omega-3 Fatty Acids #.
