When a friend threw him into the pool, he became upset and drank half a bottle of vodka (the other half he had consumed in mixed drinks a few hours prior).
With placement of NG tube he had copious bleeding from his L nares and the NGT was removed and nose packed.
He underwent CT head which showed a possible hyperdensity in the L vertebral artery.
CXR showed possible L apical opacity suspicious for possible aspiration.
There is note of a bicarb gtt started due to widened QRS at 114.
He was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to possible vertebral artery abnormality.
CXR showed haziness of L heart border, ?

Lung volumes are low, due in large part to upper lobe atelectasis which improves on subsequent CXR available at the time of approval of this report; subsegmental left lobe atelectasis persists.
There is no pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion.
Widening of the upper mediastinum and pulmonary arteries which would have generated concern for a variety of problems also resolves over the next 3.5 hours.
Head CT [**8-13**] Head CT: No acute intracranial abnl.
CTA Head: No flow limiting stenosis, e/o dissection or large aneurysm.
[**8-13**] CXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing predominantly left and retrocardiac opacities have decreased in extent.
There is no evidence of a newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity.
Low lung volumes despite intubation.
No pleural effusions.
Improvement in left retrocardiac opacity as well as right hilar opacity.
Narrowing of the trachea as well as the right upper lobe opacity, consistent with possible tracheal edema and stenosis due to prior intubation or possibly a thyroid mass.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after being found unresponsiveness s/p ingesting a bottle of vodka and cocaine, s/p intubation at OSH.
# Unresponsiveness - likely due to acute ingestion and intoxication with EtOH and cocaine.
A head CT scan at the OSH was concerning for a lesion around the vertebral artery and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of this.
A repeat head CT did not show any abnormalities, including any acute processes or bleeding.
Pt was placed on CIWA scale for withdrawal but did not score high enough for treatment.
# Traumatic NG tube placement attempt - attempted to place NG tube during intubation at OSH but pt began bleeding from nare which required packing and epinephrine injection.
His bleeding resolved but he continued to cough up small amounts of sputum streaked with blood.
Pt received Vanc/Zosyn prophylactically but antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia was not continued given low suspicion for infection.
Repeat CXR showed some tracheal narrowing.
# Possible thyroid dysfunction - per radiology read on repeat CXR there was an opacity in right upper lobe which may be suggestive of thyroid mass.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Unresponsiveness due to EtOH/cocaine intoxication  Secondary diagnoses: Bipolar d/o Hypertension Substance abuse   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because you were found to be unresponsive after drinking alcohol and doing cocaine.
While you were there, a tube was tried to be placed through your nose into your belly but there was bleeding from the nose when this was attempted.
Another CT scan was done which did not show any abnormalities in your arteries.
Your blood alcohol levels were found to be very high and there was evidence of cocaine in your urine and this is the most likely cause of you becoming unresponsive.
You were given a dose of antibiotics just in case for a pneumonia, but we found no evidence of infection.
On your chest x-ray, the radiologist noted an area of haziness in the right upper section which may be due to a thyroid problem.
This is not an acute issue, but we ordered some blood tests in the hospital to test your thyroid and you should follow-up with your PCP about the results, as well as obtain an ultrasound of your thyroid when you leave the hospital.
We are starting you on a medication to prevent infection from the packing in your nose - Augmentin 875mg twice a day for 10 days  Followup Instructions: Please see your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
