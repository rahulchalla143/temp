There is mild hypoattenuation of the periventricular and deep subcortical white matter.
The ventricles and cortical sulci are normal in size and configuration without evidence of mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
There are mucus retention cysts or polyps within both maxillary sinuses.
There is opacification involving multiple bilateral ethmoid air cells, the sphenoid sinuses, and the frontal sinuses.
There is mild narrowing involving the mid-to-distal M1 segment of the right MCA.
There is no evidence of aneurysm or arteriovenous  malformation.
CT PERFUSION: The perfusion images are nondiagnostic secondary to technical failure.
The paired vertebral arteries are normal in course and caliber without evidence of occlusion, flow-limiting stenosis, or dissection.
The common, internal, and external carotid arteries are normal in course and caliber without evidence of occlusion, flow-limiting stenosis, or dissection.
Cross-sectional analysis of the internal carotid arteries is as follows:  On the right: Proximal DMIN 7.0 mm; distal DMIN 4.2 mm.
The thyroid gland demonstrates homogeneous attenuation.
There are no osseous lytic or blastic lesions identified.
Hypodensities of indeterminate age in the right centrum semiovale, right subinsular cortex, and right lentiform nucleus with mild narrowing of the mid to distal right M1 segment, which may be secondary to intrinsic disease or thrombus.
Recommend MRI for further evaluation of acute infarction.
Pansinus disease as described above, the activity of which is to be determined clinically.
No CT evidence of aneurysm, dissection, or arteriovenous malformation.
MRI: FINDINGS: Increased FLAIR signal of the posterior limb of the right internal capsule extending to involve the posterior caudate nucleus and putamen with corresponding diffusion restriction is consistent with acute to early subacute infarct.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or shift of midline structures.
There is a mucous retention cyst of the right anterior maxillary sinus, and mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells, frontal sinuses and fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses.
These findings are consistent with no stenosis.
These findings are consistent with no stenosis.
Left vertebral antegrade artery flow.
Impression: Right ICA no stenosis.
Left ICA no stenosis.
Multiple hypercoagulatibility and secondary hypertension studies were performed to assess the underlying etiology:  -Normal complement levels -[**Doctor First Name **] negative -ANCA negative -Tox screen negative -Lupus anticoagulant - neg -Aldosterone < 1  Pending results requiring follow up: -Anticardiolipin antibodies -Protein C/S -AT III -Factor V Leiden -Metanephrines, plasma -Prothrombin mutation -Renin  Carotid series [**4-21**]: Impression: Right ICA no stenosis.
Left ICA no stenosis.
No evidence of hydronephrosis, or renal stone.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis bilaterally.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion  TEE [**4-24**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers (though prominent inflow from the inferior vena cava directed towards the interatrial septum by the Eustachian valve seems to blunt the amount of superior vena caval inflow that comes in contact with the interatrial septum).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
No evidence of atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale with saline contrast and maneuvers.
No significant valvular abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: 35 yo M with history of HTN presenting with acute onset of left face and arm weakness at 9:50 PM while eating dinner.
He was called as a CODE STROKE for recurrence of his deficits shortly after infusion of tPA and minutes prior to arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
His examination is notable for a dense left hemiplegia as well as decreased sensation on the left.
He underwent an MRI which confirmed the presence of a posterior limb of the right internal capsule infarct, extending into the posterior caudate nucleus and putamen.
He had a carotid dopplers, as well as a CTA of the head and neck which showed no signs of vascular occlusion.
Echocardiograms were notable for mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%) suggestive of prior hypertension.
It was thought that his infarct was secondary to hypertension, however possibility of an embolic infarction (though no clear source was identified) which can occur in up to many patients with this presentation could not be ruled out.
Given his relatively young age, he underwent an evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension, including a renal ultrasound which showed no signs of renal artery stenosis, and plasma renin, aldosterone and metanephrines which are pending at time of discharge.
Given persistently elevated SBPs (150-170s) mmHg even 4 days after the CVA, he was started on Lisinopril 10mg daily.
No change in Cr was observed after tx initiation.

You were found to have a significant stroke in the right side of your brain.
After a thorough evaluation, we were unable to identify a definite source of the stroke, however, it was felt that it was due to hypertension and a possible embolic source.
You were discharged to such a facility  There are still tests pending that will require follow up:   Followup Instructions: Please follow up with the following providers:  Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **], [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].D.
