At 8:30 he complained of acute onset of severe L. sided headache and the sensation of pressure.
His wife then noted prominent L. lower facial weakness and brought him to the local ER.
CT revealed an 8.3 x 3.8cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage with subarachnoid and subdural components and 6mm midline shift.
This prompted transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.

There is surrounding edema which is slightly increased compared to the most recent prior examination.
There is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with unchanged slight shift of the uncus medially, but without evidence of extensive uncal herniation.
A small right-sided subdural hematoma with a maximum width of approximately 5 mm is once again noted with adjacent mass effect.
There are also bilateral subdural hematomas along the tentorium.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted after several hours of progressively worsening headache, followed by left-sided weakness, then marked stupor.
Consistent with this history and the above examination, a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage was noted on non-contrast head CT.
Given his poor functional status prior to the hemorrhage and the likelihood of further disability, he was made comfort measures only, after extensive discussion with his extended family.
