Asthma exacerbation: On admission had significantly decreased BS and wheezing.
Patient was quite agitated, diaphoretic, and tachycardic, with improvement after administration of clonidine.
At the time of discharge, it appeared that his [**Doctor Last Name **] on the CIWA scale was due to his baseline psychiatric issues and not active withdrawl.
Cardiac echo was normal and without evidence of endocarditis.
Suspect significant component due to patient's significant anxiety issues.
