FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**11-9**], there is less opacification at the right base.
However, this most likely reflects primarily the change in patient position, as there is continued large effusion with compressive atelectasis.
Lower lung volumes and some atelectatic changes are also seen at the left base.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
LVEF 50% The aortic bioprosthesis is stable and functioning well with a mean residual gradient of 15mm of Hg.
No new valvular findings.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
