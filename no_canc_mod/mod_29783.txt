Found to have a worsening pneumonia on portable chest x-ray, so begun on aztreonam/levaquin on [**6-26**] after completing a course of azithromycin.
Hospital course also notable for acute renal failure thought to be due to prerenal azotemia and labile blood sugars.

Neck: Supple, no cervical lymphadenopathy.

Pertinent Results: CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2123-6-30**] : Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
The right effusion is likely slightly increased since the prior study.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2123-6-21**] : Interval clearing of the left lower lobe opacity with a new opacity in the left midzone.
A pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Right-sided effusion has improved.

Patient was also started on Aztreonam for concerns of nosocomial organisms, however, Aztreonam discontinued [**2123-6-30**] as patient improved, and suspicion of nosocomial pneumonia was low.
- Nasal cannula supplemental O2 was given PRN to keep sats 88-92%, to prevent CO2 retention - encouraged IS to prevent atelectasis - aggressive pulmonary toilet and chest PT were administered - Given patient's poor ability to clear secretions, humabid was given as a mucolytic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] - Pulmonary status continues to improve (based on decreasing oxygen requirements) - Afebrile throughout hospital course.
2) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - administered albuterol and atrovent nebulized.
- BIPAP was administered PRN (as suspected obstructive sleep apnea)  3) Congestive Heart Failure - Patient given diuresis while in ICU due to suspicion of congestive heart failure compromising respiratory status, which may have precipitated acute on chronic renal failure.
- Patient received IV fluids for support of renal function, and was somewhat volume overloaded after transfer from ICU (pedal edema, coarse breath sounds), and was restarted on lasix PO 40mg per day.
- Given 2g Na cardiac diet w/ strict I/Os monitored throughout course  4) Anemia - Patient was anemic on transfer from ICU: Hct 35->29.6 - Responded well to transfusion 1u PRBCs on floor, with goal to keep Hct>35 given COPD/CAD - Stools were guiac negative x 3 - Iron saturation approximately 6% in [**4-30**] constistent with iron deficiency anemia - Iron supplements were started on [**6-29**]  5) Hypertension - continued Diltiazem.
- Lisinopril initially held for concerns of renal failure/insufficiency - then as renal function improved, restarted Lisinopril.
6) Acute renal failure - Serum Creatinine peaked to 2.1 during this admission likely due to prerenal azotemia from diuresis - Creatinine level was monitored throughout course, and returned to baseline of 1.0 on [**2123-7-2**] - All meds were renally dosed all meds for CrCl of 44 (including antibiotics)  7) Diabetes - profound hypoglycemia while in intensive care unit, requiring D5 continuous infusion - Patient was quite lethargic in mornings, and it was suspected that lethargy was due to hypoglycemia, as blood sugar was found to be low on multiple mornings.
- NPH insulin was discontinued given patient's profound hypoglycemia - Once patient was able to eat well again, NPH was started at 6U at breakfast, and 3U at dinnertime.
- It was felt that patient would be more likely to suffer morbidity from hypoglycemia than moderate hyperglycemia.
- [**Doctor First Name **] diet  8) Hyperkalemia - During last part of hospital course, patient had intermittent hyperkalemia (~5.8), and kayexalate was administered, without complications or cardiac issues.
