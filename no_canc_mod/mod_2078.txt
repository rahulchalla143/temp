Modest non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CT perfusion study indicates a very small acute infarction in the territory of the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery, in the right frontal lobe, with a small ischemic penumbra which is significantly larger than the area of infarction.
One mm non-occlusive filling defect in the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery.
Punctate hyperdensities in the right frontal sulci in the ischemic territory may represent additional thrombus in small vessels.
No evidence of appreciable atherosclerosis or hemodynamically significant stenosis in the cervical arteries.
Cervical spondylosis.
No evidence of pneumonia.
MRI head - There are three foci of acute infarction in the right cerebral hemisphere.
The third acute infarction is linear in configuration, involving subcortical and deep right frontal white matter.
There is no significant associated mass effect.
There is no evidence of intracranial blood products.
The major arterial flow voids appear unremarkable, without evidence of definite occlusion.
There are foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical and periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, likely reflecting mild chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses and in the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Three areas of acute infarction in the right cerebral hemisphere, as above.
No evidence of intracranial blood products.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No cardiac source of embolus identified (cannot definitively exclude).
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
MRI brain showed acute infarct in the right putamen and posterior limb of the internal capsule, another infarct in the right caudate and anterior limb of the internal capsule, and a right subcortical infarct.
He may have had a large artery thrombosis in the right M1 segment which later embolized.
CTA neck showed no significant atherosclerosis.
He subsequently underwent a transesophageal echo to further evaluate which was negative for PFO, ASD, thrombus or complex aortic plaques (prelim read did show simple arch and descending aorta atheromas).
His HgbA1c was 5.6 and his lipid panel showed mildly elveated LDL, so he was started on Lipitor 20mg QD.
His exam on discharge was significant for LUE weakness in the 2-4/5 range and LLE weakness in the 3-4/5 range.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
