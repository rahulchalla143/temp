EKG:  NSR @ 93 bpm, LAD, LVH, pseudonormalization of T waves in V1-V6 since prior tracing [**5-7**].
pCXR [**2157-2-15**]: Since most recent comparison film, there appears to be increased interstitial alveolar opacities likely representing [**Month/Day/Year 9140**] pulmonary edema with unchanged appearance to cardiomegaly, and linear calcifications within the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.
No focal parenchymal consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax is identified .
pCXR [**2157-2-16**]: A small atelectasis is seen in the left lower lobe retrocardiac area.
There has been almost complete resolution of the pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
The aorta is unfolded with extensive atheromatous plaques in the ascending, descending, and the arch  Brief Hospital Course: 73-yo-woman w/ CAD, CHF, ESRD on HD, HIV, HCV, HTN, and anemia presents w/ dyspnea, thought [**2-4**] pulmonary edema in setting of hypertensive emergency.
# Dyspnea: The patient's shortness of breath was felt most likely secondary to pulmonary edema as evidenced by initial exam and CXR in setting of severe hypertension.
Pt with CHF and renal failure, making her prone to this.
There is no evidence of PNA, PE, or obstructive disease.
The precipitant is unknown, but the patient does have a history of flash pulmonary edema.
She denies medication non-compliance or excessive sodium consumption.
Her shortness of breath resolved after hemodialysis and better BP control, and she maintained her O2 saturation on room air.
Cardiac enzymes revealed flat CKs and elevated troponins (in setting of ESRD)   which did not rise.
Her pain was in the setting of hypertensive emergency and resolved with control of her blood pressure, including nitro drip.
There were no specific EKG changes on presentation to indicate active ischemia.
Her cardiac enzymes were notable for an elevated troponin (in setting of ESRD), with flat CKs.
# ESRD: Her renal failure is secondary to HIV nephropathy.
# Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure was initially controlled with volume removal by HD, IV enalapril, IV hydralazine, and nitroglycerin drip.
# Elevated amylase/lipase: This is chronic and likely a chemical pancreatitis from her [**Hospital6 2775**] therapy.
There were no signs of clinical pancreatitis.
# DM type 2: This is controlled with diet as an outpt.
# Proph: She was given heparin SC, but developed a hematoma in her abdomen from these injections.
Hypertensive emergency 2.
Pulmonary edema 3.
Congestive Heart failure 4.
End Stage Renal Disease   Discharge Condition: Stable, symptoms resolved.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain, thought due to severe high blood pressure and fluid building up in the lungs.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or any other symptom that concerns you.
