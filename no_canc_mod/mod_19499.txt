Small right pleural effusion with adjacent right lower lobe consolidation, possibly reflecting compressive atelectasis though infectious process cannot be excluded.
Congestive heart failure with evidence of volume overload including hepatic congestion, small amount of perihepatic ascites and anasarca.
Small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
Subtle areas of hypoenhancement within the right kidney, which raise concern for pyelonephritis.
Top normal appendix measuring 6-7 cm; however, no inflammatory change and air present within the appendix.
TTE: IMPRESSION: Preserved left ventricular regional and global systolic function.
Moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation with right ventricular dilatation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    68 year old woman with elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    explanation for elevated alk phos?
Final Report INDICATION:  Patient with elevated alkaline phosphatase.
FINDINGS:  The liver demonstrates normal echotexture without focal lesions.
There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The gallbladder wall edema likely reflects congestive heart failure.
A 3 mm polyp is seen in the gallbladder wall.
There is no ascites.
Small riht pleural effusion is noted.
Normal liver echotexture without focal lesions.
Gallbladder wall edema, prominent hepatic veins and pulsatile portal venous flow signify underlying congestive heart failure.
Small right pleural effusion.
Echogenic right kidney, may represent chronic parenchymal disease, correlate clinically.

ACTIVE ISSUES: ================ # Atrial fibrillation w/ RVR: Rates were initially in the 170s on arrival to the ER.
Patient was given IV diltiazem and IV metoprolol in the ER with little effect and was eventually started on a diltiazem infusion at 15 mg/hr in the ICU.
She was briefly on an Esmolol infusion as well to help control rates and was able to be weaned from this with oral Diltiazem and Metoprolol.
This may have been the provoking reason for the rapid ventricular response and/or catecholamine surge from symptomatic anemia.
On transfer to the medicine floor, she was started on diltiazem 60mg q6hr but metoprolol dose was decreased due to relative hypotension.
She remained asymptomatic with HR in 80s on discharge.
# Anemia: Patient has chronic microcytic anemia, the origin of which has never been clearly elucidated.
No signs of active bleeding were seen.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation but could also be masking a concurrent iron deficiency (although she takes iron chronically).
She has had chronically elevated inflammatory markers of uncertain etiology.
# Pneumonia: CT Abd/Pelvis done in the ER for complaints of abdominal pain showed no acute abdominal process but did show R-sided effusion with possible consolidation.
CXR/CT showed small R-sided pleural effusion as above.
MD should be notified if weight increases or decreases by more than 3 lbs.
Patient increases or decreases by more than 3 lbs.
# Communication was with HCP (brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 31**], w [**Telephone/Fax (1) 53147**], c [**Telephone/Fax (1) 53148**]) plans to bring her to North [**Doctor First Name **] after discharge where he lives and establish new doctors for [**Name5 (PTitle) **].
