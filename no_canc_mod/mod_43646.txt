Admission Date:  [**2164-3-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-3-18**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT [**Location (un) **] SERVICE  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Fevers and chills with decreased urine output.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year old, nursing home resident, with a history of recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis, urinary retention with an indwelling Foley, history of hypotension, who presents with two days of fevers, rigors, hypotension and decreased urine output, over one to two days prior to admission.
The patient was noted to have decreased urinary output and hematuria at the nursing home.
The Foley catheter was changed at the nursing home but did not result in increased urine output.
The patient was also noted to have a cough productive of a large amount of brown sputum.
He also reported one day of fevers, chills and some mild nausea with one episode of vomiting two days prior to admission.
A right internal jugular sepsis catheter was placed and the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for sepsis protocol monitoring.
Of note, he denied abdominal pain, light headedness, diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, chest pressure, shortness of breath, cough, peripheral edema or palpitations.
The patient received most of his medical care at [**University/College 18328**]Medical Center and, in [**2163-10-12**], was hospitalized in their Intensive Care Unit with an episode of sepsis, secondary to a gangrenous cholecystitis with accompanying pancreatitis.
He also had a biliary stent placed for residual drainage of infected fluid collection.
He also has had multiple episodes of Clostridium difficile colitis.
History of benign prostatic hypertrophy with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, which is changed once per month, at the discretion of his outpatient urologist at [**Hospital1 2177**].
Glucose intolerance.
Tachyarrhythmia, not otherwise specified, with known history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not on Coumadin.
Major depressive disorder.
Dry mucous membranes.
Chest:  Minimal crackles at the bases bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia, regular rhythm, no murmurs.
No organomegaly.
Guaiac positive brown stool.
Extremities:  No edema.
Dermatology:  No rashes.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 147 with a normal axis; no ST or T wave changes; normal intervals.
No prior available for comparison.
Urinalysis showed large blood; greater than 50 red cells; greater than 50 white cells; many bacteria; less than 1 epithelial cell; negative nitrite; moderate leukoesterase.
Chest x-ray significant for a left lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient was initiated on the sepsis protocol and was placed on Vancomycin, Ceftazidime and Flagyl for empiric coverage of most likely urosepsis with the Ceftazidime, especially given the patient's asplenic status and susceptibility to encapsulated organisms.
He was also placed on Flagyl for a question of Clostridium difficile colitis given his history.
A cortisol stimulation test was performed and showed no evidence of hypoadrenal state.
The patient had an underlying metabolic gap acidosis, secondary to lactic acid production.
He had an appropriate compensatory respiratory alkalosis; however, he was unable to breathe down his C02 and required intubation on [**2164-3-17**], secondary to labored breathing and acute hypoxemia.
This was thought to be most likely secondary to volume overload, status post aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Genitourinary:  On [**2164-3-16**], the patient was noted to have a markedly distended bladder.
A bladder ultrasound was performed at the bedside, which demonstrated approximately one liter of fluid in the urinary bladder.
The urology consult was obtained and after replacing the patient's Foley catheter, 900 cc of dark red urine was drained from the urinary bladder.
Diarrhea:  The patient was tested negative for Clostridium difficile colitis times three.
Acute renal failure:  The patient initially had a creatinine greater than 2.
This was felt to be secondary to post obstructive nephropathy and his creatinine decreased to 1.5 status post drainage of the urinary bladder.
He grew out 4 out of 4 bottles of gram negative rods, with Klebsiella and Enterococcus on [**3-15**] from his blood cultures.
He was negative for Clostridium difficile times three.
Vancomycin for targeted treatment for gram negative rods as well as Clostridium difficile prophylaxis.
