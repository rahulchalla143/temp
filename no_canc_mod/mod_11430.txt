Early Neonatal Intensive Care Unit course was remarkable for evidence of respiratory distress with grunting, retractions and oxygen requirement and the infant was placed on CPAP and managed in the Intensive Care Unit.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Infant was pink, ruddy and alert with evidence of retractions, grunting and flaring.
Chest revealed poor aeration.
Cardiac exam revealed no murmur.
Abdomen was soft with good bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.

The extremities were within normal limits with normal clavicle and no hip click.
Due to persistent respiratory distress and nonresponsive to CPAP, infant was intubated and given Survanta.
No grunting or flaring retractions.
He was bolused with caffeine prior to extubation and did demonstrate some mild evidence of apnea of prematurity following extubation.
Otherwise, at the time of discharge his chest was clear, using room air with no other ongoing issues.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  He has had no murmurs.
He has had good perfusion with no evidence of a persistent patent ductus arteriosus.
