The dictation of this discharge summary is done in preparation  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 34-year-old Brazilian male, who was transferred from the [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**Location (un) 47**], MA on the day of admission having experienced nausea and vomiting over several hours during the middle of the day.
He then went to the emergency room at [**Hospital6 1109**], where he complained of headache and revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage with interparenchymal and intraventricular blood and he underwent placement of two ventricular drains immediately at that time at the outside hospital prior to being transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**].
Repeat head CT scan, upon arrival, at the [**Hospital1 346**], showed findings consistent with massive interparenchymal hemorrhage, as well as intraventricular hemorrhage and massive subarachnoid hemorrhage.
In the patient's physical examination, he was grade 5, unresponsive, pupils nonreactive and entirely unresponsive.
The angiogram showed aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery and nine coils were placed at that time.
The patient was brought to the ICU with three intraventricular drains, all of the drains, draining small amounts of thick, bloody fluid at the time of admission to the ICU.
The patient had positive corneal reflexes bilaterally and a weak intermittent cough, but, otherwise, entirely unresponsive.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On post-op day 1 the patient underwent instillation of intraventricular tPA for dissolution of intraventricular  clot and this helped improve drainage from the drains and resulted in a lower intracranial pressure.
The vent drains were showing high intraventricular correction and intracerebral pressures of 8 to 31 cm water.
The above procedure was done due to persistent elevated intracranial pressures.
He had positive doll's eyes.
He showed mild withdrawal of the right upper extremity.
Decision was made for the patient to undergo removal of the drains and placement of a ventricular peritoneal shunt.
He was, therefore, taken back to the operating room on the afternoon of the [**2140-9-9**], where he underwent removal of the ventricular drains and placement of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt and also had replacement of the bone flap with a small incision made in the left abdominal wall for removal of the bone flap and replacement of the bone flap onto the left frontotemporoparietal area.
The patient returned to the Intensive Care Unit and remained essentially unchanged neurologically with occasions when the patient's eyes were opened and he would appear to be awake or minimally response if at all to light sternal rub and deep painful stimulation.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Neurologically minimally responsive male who remains severely comatose with grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage status post multiple procedures.
