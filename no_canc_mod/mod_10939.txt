The patient had had two episodes of endocarditis since murmur was identified in [**2143**] followed by echo since that time.
Last echo was in [**2147-12-23**] that showed left atrium mildly dilated with mild, symmetric LVH, with EF of 70%.
There was moderate-severe mitral prolapse with partial flail posterior leaflet, and moderate-severe MR.  ETT on [**3-11**] showed no ischemia with ST changes, an aortic root of 4.3 cm.
Mitral valve disease.
Dilated aortic root.
Endocarditis x 2.
Debridement of left knee for septic arthritis.
Beta blockers, somewhat of an allergy with fatigue.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient denies shortness of breath, CVA, TIA, GI bleed, melena, diabetes, seizures, COPD, asthma, edema and claudication.
Generally, the patient was in no acute distress.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular exam showed regular rate and rhythm with a IV/VI systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, without hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were warm and well-perfused, without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
EKG:  Showed a sinus rhythm, rate 68 beats per minute, nonspecific ST changes.
UA - nitrite negative, leukocyte esterase negative, RBCs 0-2, white blood cells [**1-24**], no bacteria, epithelial cells less than 1.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had dental clearance and was taken to the operating room on [**2148-8-12**] and date of admission with the diagnosis of MR/dilated aortic root, and the procedure was mitral valve repair with 32 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band/quad resection, posterior leaflet, under general anesthesia, indicated for severe MR, status post endocarditis.
The patient had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on postoperative day #3, and beta blocker was increased as tolerated, but remained sinus through rest of admission.
Dilated aortic root.
Mitral valve disease.
