The pt has a complicated hx of Afib with several episodes of RVR, these have spontaneously cardioverted back to NSR in the past except for a few occassions.
The pt was previously treated with Amiodarone with development of pulmonary toxicity as well as sotalol and norpace without much success resulting in this current regimen consisting of Metoprolol XL and Rhythmol.
The pt reports acute onset of palpitations and shortness of breath at 9PM last night.
ED Course:  In the ED, the pt was afebrile with HR max of 173 but developed asymptomatic hypotension with drop in SBP to 70s.
Pulmonary toxicity from amiodarone 5. s/p R BKA ([**2-7**] MVA) 6.
Family History: Father: died of myocardial infarction vs. sudden cardiac death in his 60s.
Mother: coronary artery disease and end stage renaldisease.
HEENT: perrl, EOMI, MMM, anicteric Neck: supple, no elevated JVD (exam limited to pt's large neck and beligerence) Lungs: CTA bilaterally no w/r/c CV: tachycardic, irregular?, no murmurs Abd: soft, nt/nd.
Ext: s/p R BKA, no edema  Pertinent Results: STUDIES: ECG [**2126-6-15**]: Afib at 110, nml to leftward axis, IVCD, LVH, repolarization changes.
CXR [**2126-6-15**]: no acute cardiopulm abn.
TTE [**2126-6-15**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is prominent asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No definite mitral regurgitation is identified (cannot exclude due to acoustic shadowing).
There is no pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on EP team discussed possibility of AV nodal ablation with placement of PPM/ICD, but pt deferred due to concerns that his ICD would fire unexpectedly.
# CAD: Had recent NSTEMI in setting of RVR [**2-7**] demand ischemia, however has had normal coronaries by cath and MIBI in '[**20**] and '[**24**].
# MVR: [**2-7**] endocarditis - Continued coumadin with goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
# HOCM: The pt has had an outflow tract obstruction as per echo in '[**20**], however he has not had a repeat echo to evaluate since then.
Repeat TTE done, which demonstrated no resting or inducible gradient, EF>55%, and stable MVR.
ALLERGIES: Epinephrine -> atrial fibrillation   Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Good - normal sinus rhythm   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with atrial fibrillation.
You should return to the ED with palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness/lightheadnedness, or for any other problems that concern you.
