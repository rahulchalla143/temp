Admission Date:  [**2195-4-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2195-4-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2123-4-7**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CARDIAC SX  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year old female with a past medical history significant for a repair of a Type A aortic dissection back in [**2193-10-22**], who presented to an outside hospital on [**2195-4-1**], after going to her primary care physician's office complaining of chest pain which had been worsening over the last month.
The patient reports that the pain was of recent onset and localized to her left chest.
The pain was not relieved by Nitroglycerin; no associated nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, palpitations or diaphoresis.
The chest pain worsened with movement and deep breaths.
Status post repair of Type A aortic dissection.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Her cardiac enzymes were negative for evidence of myocardial ischemia.
The patient had had a CT scan performed at the outside hospital which showed unchanged dissection with poor flow in the false lumen.
The patient underwent an ETT which was negative for any symptoms of pain and the thallium images were negative for evidence of ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory which showed two to three plus aortic insufficiency, aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta, both aortic valves, no clear location of dye extravasation of evidence of proximal retrograde dissection.
No coronary artery disease.
The MRI showed evidence of periaortic hemorrhage around the ascending aortic graft with signal intensity suggestive of subacute hemorrhage less than ten days old.
Distal to the left subclavian artery there was a large aneurysmal dilatation of the false lumen with extensive thrombus within the aneurysmal dilatation and subacute hemorrhage within the aneurysmal dilatation at the level of the distal arch and proximal ascending aorta.
The aneurysmal dilatation extended to the apical region of the left hemithorax.
There was significant atelectasis of the left upper lobe surrounding the large aneurysm, a small left pleural effusion which was suggestive of blood.
On [**4-13**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] again met with the family and the patient decided to go forward with surgery and agreed to the risks and potential complications as described by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
During the operation, the patient had an episode of hemoptysis and postoperatively the patient's chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate which was felt to be due to a rupture of the pseudoaneurysm and to the left upper lobe.
The patient did not have any further hemoptysis postoperatively.
At this time, the patient was awake, alert, oriented times three, moving all extremities equally, with no neurologic deficit.
On postoperative day number three, the patient was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 76.
