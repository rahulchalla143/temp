He initially felt exertional dyspnea while walking fast started about 1 year ago.
He attributed his shortness of breath to being overweight.
He lost some weight and his shortness of breath improved, however he continued to feel exertional dyspnea with activity.
In addition, he presently notes occasional lightheadedness as well as some mild chest discomfort at rest.
Based on the the patient worsening aortic stenosis seen on echo noted below, he is now referred for a cardiac catheterization and possible surgical evaluation.

No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
The valve is well-seated, the leaflets are normally mobile, and there is no paravalvular leak.
The peak gradient across the aortic valve is 24mmHg, the mean gradient is 11mmHg with a CO of 4.8.The LV chamber size is small, consistent with hypovolemic state.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
He developed postop atrial fibrillation.
There was no indication for pacemaker or any other antiarrhythmic at this time.
Due to volume overload, he required several days of aggressive diuresis.
If he remains in atrial fibrillation at that time, he will be evaluated for possible cardioversion.
