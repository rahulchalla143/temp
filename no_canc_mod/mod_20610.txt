She started having dyspnea on exetrtion 7 days prior to admission with a nonprod cough, without CP.
While in the ER she vomited into her face mask and had an acute worsening of her respiratory distress at which time repeat CXR showed bibasilar opacities consistent with aspiration and possible worsening edema.
Discussion at that time with her family and PCP resulted in decision to make pt DNR/DNI/CMO and start a morphine drip for relief of respiratory distress or discomfort.
Next was in [**2099**] with severe left sided weakness.
- hard of hearing, + tinnitus - hypothyroidism - HTN - high cholesterol - cataract surgery bilaterally -?
CAD and CHF- no old records here.

Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
MODERATE GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2106-7-9**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2106-7-9**]):    NO GROWTH.
CXR - IMPRESSION: Marked improvement of previously identified congestive pattern and parenchymal infiltrates in this elderly patient.
Comparison with the study of [**2106-7-7**] demonstrates now also improvement of the initially seen fluffy infiltrates on the right base.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of new infarction or hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect or shift of midline structures.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to involutional change.
Marked periventricular white matter hypodensities are unchanged, and old bilateral basal ganglia infarcts are again noted.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Diffuse ST segment changes could be secondary to myocardial ischemia or rapid ventricular rate.
Compared to prior tracing of [**2106-7-9**] no interim diagnostic change.
TRACING #2   Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] V.    Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 87 0 142 390/434.42 0 -76 -97  CXR - IMPRESSION: Diffuse fluffy opacities more reminiscent of edema given cardiomegaly and effusion.
Please note atypical pneumonia may present in a similar fashion.
Repeat radiography following diuresis may be indicated to assess for underlying infection.
Brief Hospital Course: Sepsis from aspiration pneumonia - the hypotension resolved with IVF initially.
The dyspnea was multifactorial - mostly from a severe aspiration pneumonia.
Aspiration risk is high as confirmed with swallow therapist and with video swallow.
Congestive heart failure - diastolic, pulmonary edema - from aggressive IVF and rapid A fib.
Lasix was not continued as the patient was very volume depleted due to decreased po intake and diuresis.
Delerium - multifactorial - from infection and also from hypovolemia.
Hypernatremia - hypovolemia - Due to above reason, the patient was severly free water restricted.
Lactic acidosis was from the hypovolemia as it resolved after volume repletion.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid rate - as above  h/o CVA - warfarin as above.
Hypothyroidism - levothyroxine continued at home dose.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis from aspiration pneumonia Congestive heart failure - diastolic, pulmonary edema Delerium Hypernatremia - hypovolemia Lactic acidosis Atrial fibrillation with rapid rate h/o CVA Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please inform your doctor if you have any new symptoms of concern to you.
