There was no evidence of left-right confusion as the patient was able to accurately follow the instruction to tough right ear with left hand.

-Coordination: No dysmetria on FNF on left ___________________________________________________________   Pertinent Results: NCHCT [**2100-9-1**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Interval mild increase in the size of a right parenchymal hemorrhage as described above.
There are no pleural effusions.
The slightly increased vascular diameter and the multiple interstitial bilateral markings suggest mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No significant interval change from prior study.
Foci of parenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporoparietal region and right inferior insular cortex, unchanged from prior study with no areas of new hemorrhage.
Area of hypodensity in the left frontal lobe likely representing prior infarcts.
TTE [**2100-9-3**] - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated given small body size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe mitral regurgitation.
Mildly dilated left ventricle with at least mild global systolic dysfunction.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
NCHCT [**2100-9-4**] IMPRESSION: No interval change in known right temporoparietal and inferior insular cortex intraparenchymal hemorrhages.
No new hemorrhage.
Sputum Cx - MSSA  Urine Cx - Klebsiella  Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo W h/o prior L MCA stroke (residual Rhemiplegia, aphasia), DM2, past tobacco use, s/p PPM p/w L-sided weakness s/p fall on [**8-31**], resulting in a R IPH and small SAH.
[] Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage - She was noted the next morning to be leaning primarily to her left (her strong side) and was subsequently brought to the hospital where the hemorrhage was found on imaging.
She was awake and oriented (could nod yes or no) and had new mild left sided weakness ([**5-4**]) with her prior residual productive aphasia and R face, arm, and leg weakness.
Her repeat NCHCTs on [**9-2**] and [**9-4**] showed no further expansion of the IPH/hematoma or SAH.
Her hemorrhage and neurologic exam remained stable throughout the rest of her hospitalization, but her overall mental status was very poor with regards to interactivity with her environment.
[] Systolic Heart Failure and Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - She was given Furosemide when being infused with FFPs to help prevent volume overload but her UOP did not respond appropriately; she became hypoxic later in the evening of [**9-1**] while in the ICU and was intubated for respiratory support.
A TTE performed on [**9-3**] showed an LVEF of 40-45% with 4+ MR and 2+ TR; the EF was felt to be an overestimate in the setting of her severe valvular disease.
[] Cardiac Ischemia - The patient has had elevation of her cardiac troponins from 0.06 to a maximum of 4 in the setting of her IPH and metabolic abnormalities, possibly suggesting demand ischemia versus NSTEMI.
[] Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - In the setting of the patient's systolic heart failure, the patient's CKD worsened with a maximum Cr of 3.8.
Optimization of her systolic function stabilized her renal dysfunction.
She has intermittently been hyperglycemia and has intermittently required insulin infusions.
The patient had expressed the willingness to go to a long term care facility (nursing home) but also had declined dialysis, making it difficult to tell whether she would want long-term or permanent mechanical ventilation or enteral feeding through a PEG if it allowed her to live.
