There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated The aortic valve is not well seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
There is a prominent left pleural effusion   Brief Hospital Course: Admitted preoperatively for heparin bridge from coumadin and was found to have elevted creatinine 2.4 and BUN 62.

On post operative day two chest tubes, foley and epicardial wires were removed, however due to failure to void her foley was reinserted.
