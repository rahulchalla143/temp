Staff tried applying cold packs to head, no response.
Wife tried to move his head which felt heavy and stiff, and entire body looked stiff with no spontaneous mvmt.
Had bedside EEG in the ER that did not show definite Sz activity, but Neuro recommends continuing Dilantin.
He has some urinary and bowel incontinence at baseline.
He has complained of no (and wife has noticed no) f/c/cp/sob/uri sx/gi/gu sx; he has chronic LBP and as usual took vicodin this am.
No visual, hearing, sp/sw problems, no new weakness/numbness; has fallen (falls occ.
at BL) but no head trauma.

New retrocardiac opacity, which likely indicates pneumonia.
Atelectasis is a less likely diagnostic consideration.
Brain MRI: No evidence of acute infarct.
There is no evidence of vascular occlusion seen.
There is diminished flow signal intensity visualized in the intracranial arteries which appears artifactual.
head CT: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
EEG: This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and sleeping states due to the low voltage slow posterior rhythm as well as bursts of bilateral frontal 4 Hz slowing.
This suggests an encephalopathic  pattern which may be seen with medications or toxic metabolic abnormalities.
pCXR: Mild CHF with left greater than right small pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU course: - CT, MRI/MRA, EEG all negative for acute pathology.
Etiology of altered mental status thought to be multifactorial - 1)By history patient took double of the usual dose of benadryl.
3) Renal failure.
4)All superimposed on baseline that per family is altered.
- Plan to go to dialysis [**2190-12-13**] with possible removal of tunneled catheter if dialysis through fistula is successful.
- Elevated potassium was treated with good effect with kayexalate, insulin and D-50.
- Patient was incidentally found to have a retrocardiac opacity but was not treated because of lack of fever and normal white blood cell count.
# AMS: unclear etiology although possible precipitants include hypoglycemia, seizure, altered BP; Neurology was consulted, EEG was performed and showed no seizure.
# CV: Had slight TnT bump though with no change in ECG and known ESRD; ruled out for MI, no CP/SOB.
# HTN: became very hypertensive to >200/100, not controlled on home meds, so patient was changed to labetalol 400 mg tid in addition to his norvasc for better BP control, his BP improved to 140/90.
His fistula has matured as was used for effective HD.
He will need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**] as an outpatient to have his tunnelled HD cath removed.
Benadryl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every [**6-24**] hours as needed for agitation.
Benadryl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every [**6-24**] hours as needed for agitation.
