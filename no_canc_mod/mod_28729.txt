female with pmh significant for CHF [**2-2**] 3+TR and 3+ MR, HTN, pulmonary HTN, presenting with increased lower extremity edema and severe dyspnea on exertion.
The patient has had CHF and DOE for years, but has been experiencing severe worsening of symptoms over the past month.
She presented in mid [**Month (only) 404**] with peripheral edema and acute on chronic renal failure.
Her pulmonary pressures were decreased with NO, and so she was placed on nifedipine to treat any reversible aspect of her pulmonary hypertension.
After she returned home, she progressively gained weight, had increased peripheral edema, and became more dyspneic on exertion.

Severe pulmonary hypertension 5.

The patient reported symptomatic relief by [**2-5**].
The patient had three teeth extracted and was begun on clindamycin to prevent systemic spread of oral flora.
She was brought to the CVICU sedated and ventilated in critical but stable condition.
On POD6 her Lasix was increased to 120mg TID and she was started on Spironolactone on based on her CXR that showed heart failure.
She was started on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
She developed stridor which improved with continued diuresis and cool nebs.
