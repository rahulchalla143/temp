He was in his prior state of health until earlier today when he developed chest pain and weakness at his [**Hospital3 **] facility.
In [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] ER he was found to have a HR in the 30 with otherwise normal VS. His ECG showed third degree heart block with junctional rhythm in the 30s.
He looked comfortable, had normal JVP, no canon waves, clear lungs and guaiac negative.
His ECG showed third degree heart block with junctional escape rhythm at a rate of 30 BPM.
No temporal wire or pressors were needed.
<br> On review of systems, he denies any cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
<br> Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
He did complain of nausea after he was started on dopamine, however this soon passed.
Past Medical History: TIA age 62 attributed to afib(unclear what documented) on dig and Coumadin ever since with no recurrence - Coumadin recently discontinued due to supratherapeutic INR Neuropsych testing/w/u around age [**Age over 90 **] negative, cleared to continue driving Hearing impairment, has hearing aides and complains they don't work well Melanoma of left ear, excised Multiple basal cell skin cancers Nocturia x 5, denies issues during day, not improved with Flomax      s/p tonsillectomy as a child  Social History: Widowed [**2132**], married for almost 59 yrs, wife was a former nurse.

There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the infererior and inferolateral wall.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitgation.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with no sig PMHx who presents from OSH with chest pain and bradycardia.
Found to be in complete heart block with atrial fibrillation.
Elevated cardiac enzymes as well.
# Complete Heart block - Patient presented from OSH with bradycardia in the 30s.
Diff dx includes ischemia of AV node, likely from RCA infarct as most people are right dominant.
He had a dig level of 1.2 at OSH and in the setting of renal insufficiency could be toxic.
He does not have any outdoor exposures that would predispose him to lyme disease.
EKG from OSH showed ventricular bigeminy and 3rd degree AV block with junctional rhythm, both of which can be seen with digoxin toxicity.
Patient showed no response to atropine and had ST depressions in V3-V5 when given dopamine.
Digoxin was stopped and patients heart rate improved over hospitalization, to levels in the 60s at rest and up to 90s with minimal activity.
Patient was asymptomatic at discharge with no lightheadedness, shortness of breath or chest pain.
# ACS - Patient had developed chest pain at home.
ECG showed ST depression in V3-V5 when given dopamine.
Patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes in setting of chest pain.
Patient was asymptomatic at discharge.
# Atrial fibrillation - Patient recently stopped on coumadin by his PCP as he was supratherapeutic and risk of fall was considered higher than benefit of coumadin by PCP.
Digoxin was held due to bradycardia and AV block.
Patient will continue on ASA and Plavix with no anticoagulation therapy.
# Renal insufficiency - Chronic per OSH records and daughter, with baseline creatinine between 1.5-1.7.
Patient was given gentle hydration with IVF and responded with slight decrease to patients baseline.
# Normocytic anemia ??????
Hct stable during his hospitalization with mild decrease likely secondary to hydration.
Patient did have positive guiac x1.
# Delirium- Patient had periods of delirium, particularly at night, but controllable without medication.
Daughter had some concern about his confusion and evaluation by by PT suggested rehab.
No obvious cause of delirium ??????
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for Chest pain.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Complete heart block, NSTEMI  Secondary: atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You came to the hospital after experiencing chest pain.
It was found that your heart rate was very slow and you also had a heart attack.
We treated your heart attack with blood thinners and took a picture of your heart that showed a small area of injury, but still good overall function.
We also stopped your digoxin because it was the likely cause of your slow heart rate.
