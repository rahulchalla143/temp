Admission Date:  [**2139-9-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-9-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-8-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: Substernal chest pain, diaphoresis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization and stent placement--[**2139-9-1**]   History of Present Illness: 60 year old male with DMII and no past cardiac history who experienced a sudden SSCP ([**8-22**]), a lightheaded feeling, and diaphoresis while talking on the phone.
No shortness of breath or radiation to his back.
He went to the [**Location (un) **] ED and was found to have ST elev in II, III, avF of [**3-18**] mm with reciprocal ST dep in I and avL.
Given TNK 45 IV at 9 pm, started on heparin drip, ASA, and morphine without total resolution of ST changes.
He was bradycardic on arrival.
In the lab here, he was found to have a Left dominant system with LCx having a hazy 60-90% lesion stented with Cypher DES with TIMI 3 result.
No cardiac disease history.
No focal deficits.
He was bradycardic and relatively hypotensive on admission.
1.CAD: He had an inferior STEMI and a DES was placed in his RCA.
A beta-blocker and ACE-I were initially held due to his bradycardia and hypotension.
He remained mildly bradycardic and hypotensive throughout much of the admission, and this limited our ability to add an ACE-I and B-blocker.
He had some minor chest discomfort one day after MI, but no EKG changes were seen.
2.Pump: Initially, he had an elevated PCWP and decreased CO(Fick=1.89).
Only overt symptom was mild pulmonary edema on chest X-ray.
He had a fairly loud murmur, so we got an echo the day after MI.
His HR remained slow for several days.
This is likely due to increased vagal tone from his IMI.
He also had minimal AS and mild MR.
As far as wall movement, "There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral wall and severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall.".
On D/C, he was still mildly hypotensive, but was able to tolerate lisinopril 5 mg qd.
A Beta-blocker was not started due to his vitals.
3.Rhythm: As above, his bradycardia is sinus and probably due to high vagal tone.
He did have several episodes of junctional rhythms to the 40s initially, but was in sinus for the rest of the stay.
His control was fairly adequate the rest of his stay, with some high values, but the majority were within acceptable ranges.
This was left overnight due to his recent lysis and the need to allow some of the effect of the TNK to subside.
We will give him permission to stay out of work for 2 weeks, and then light duty for another 2 weeks and he will talk to his employer about short term disability.
9.We arranged a VNA to visit his home for several days due to his need to start a large number of new medicines.
no snow shoveling.
If pain doesn't improve, take one every 5 minutes.
If pain still there after 3 tablets, come to the ED or call your doctor.
