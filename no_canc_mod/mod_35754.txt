Admission Date:  [**2170-1-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2170-3-19**]   Service:  THORACIC SURGERY  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 77-year-old patient with remote percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of RCA, referred for outpatient cardiac catheterization due to exertional symptoms.
Admitted to [**Hospital1 **] at the time where he underwent a stress test which was remarkable for 0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 28585**] depressions inferiorly in V4 through 6.
Imaging did not detect perfusion defects at that time, as ejection fraction was noted to be 50%.
He was told at that time the symptoms were attributable to reflex and he was started on Prilosec at that time.
He has since that limited his level of activity because of persisting symptoms.
He denies claudication, orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and lightheadedness.
Hypercholesterolemia 2.
Hypertension 3.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 4.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 5.
Coronary artery disease 6.
Hypothyroidism 7.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: GENERAL:  No acute distress.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
In summary, catheter showed low normal ejection fraction, LAD with 80% stenosis, left circumflex with an 80% to 90% stenosis and an RCA with a 90% stenosis.
On postoperative day 3, the patient was noted to have a fever of 100.1??????
A chest x-ray was done which at that time showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.
On the night of postoperative day #5, the patient was noted to have acute episodes of desaturation and shortness of breath.
He was noted to continue to have episodes of shortness of breath and desaturation.
At that time, the patient's chest x-ray showed right sided infiltrates as well as some congestive heart failure.
Chest CT done following his transfer to the Intensive Care Unit showed ARDS versus amiodarone fibrosis or a combination of both.
Bronchoscopy at that time showed small amount of blood and erythema with no endobronchial lesions.
On postoperative day 16, the patient experienced episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 150.
Also at that time he was noted to have increasing fever with a white count of 14.3.
Sputum cultures from that time showed gram positive cocci as well as yeast for which the patient was started on appropriate antibiotics.
The patient continued to have pulmonary problems over the next several weeks.
In addition to his ARDS, the patient also experienced recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation on more than on one occasion requiring electrical cardioversion.
Fever work up at that time showed positive blood cultures.
He continued to show slow pulmonary progress and on postoperative day 41 he was switched from pressure control ventilation to intermittent mandatory ventilation which he tolerated well.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft x3 with left internal mammary artery to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM and saphenous vein graft to distal RCA.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome 5.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 6.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 7.
