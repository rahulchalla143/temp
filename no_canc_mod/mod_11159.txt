HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and aortic stenosis who was admitted to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital on [**1-11**] complaining of chest pain substernal in nature.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed coronary artery disease with blockages in the posterior descending artery, PDL, total right coronary artery, LAV, first diagonal, second diagonal, total [**Last Name (LF) 11641**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ejection fraction of 40%.
The patient had an echocardiogram which showed aortic stenosis.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for further treatment of his cardiac disease.
Aortic stenosis.
Chronic abdominal pain.
Supraventricular tachycardia.
Pleural plaques.
Right bundle-branch block.
Coronary artery disease.
No jugular venous distention or bruits.
Chest revealed fine crackles.
Groin revealed there was no hematoma or bruits.
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on [**2101-1-14**] and underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed left main coronary artery was normal, left anterior descending artery with 60% middle subtotal distal and apex with diffuse first diagonal.
The patient also had critical aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of approximately 0.67 cm2.
In the Surgical Intensive Care Unit the patient continued to do well; however, on [**2101-1-19**], the patient had some right-sided weakness.
The patient was seen by Physical Therapy because of his cerebrovascular accident.
Because of his inability to wean off the ventilator, the patient underwent a bedside tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement.
On [**2101-1-25**], the patient also had a bronchoscopy for his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement which showed some mucous plugging.
Neurology saw him and felt that (you know) the fact on [**2101-2-6**] he had global aphasia, right hemiplegia, and a right field cut and felt his deficit was going to be severe, and there was some chance for more recovery, but his deficits would most likely be what they were; and they signed off.
He still had (you know) right hemiplegia and right-sided deficits, but his cardiac status was good.
He had no chest pain.
Status post right cerebrovascular accident with right hemiplegia, global aphasia deficits.
History of failure to wean.
History of coronary artery disease.
History of aortic stenosis.
History of chronic abdominal pain.
History of supraventricular tachycardia.
Pleural plaques.
