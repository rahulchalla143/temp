HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 33-year-old male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension, type 1 diabetes, and severe gastroparesis.
He was recently admitted from [**2182-1-3**] through [**2182-1-7**] for hypertensive crisis as well as exacerbation of gastroparesis.
He returned to be admitted to the CCU on [**2182-1-10**] for hypertension, hypertensive crisis with systolic blood pressures in the 200s, with diastolic pressures in the 100s.
On [**2182-1-10**] admission to the CCU, the patient had nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, diarrhea, myalgias, but denied chest pain, headaches, shortness of breath and cough.
The patient states that the morning of this admission, he had a fatty meal.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus since [**00**] years of age.
History of diabetic ketoacidosis.
History of hypertensive urgency.
Severe gastroparesis.
Hemorrhagic gastritis.
History of esophageal ulcer.
Coronary artery disease (please see discharge summary from [**2182-1-7**] for more details).
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for type 1 diabetes, gastroparesis, hypertension (please see previous discharge summary from [**2182-1-7**]).
NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 33-year-old male with type 1 diabetes who returns approximately two days after being discharged to the CCU with hypertensive urgency, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
The patient had marked orthostatic hypotension (lying down usually 150 - 170, sitting up decreased to around 120s, and standing up systolic blood pressures in the 90s).
He denied dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, or headache.
It was decided that the Florinef was not a good idea in this patient who not only has orthostatic hypotension but has very markedly elevated blood pressures as well.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] knows how to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60745**] with his blood sugars for the next couple of days while he is an outpatient for help with management.
Renal:  The Renal Team followed Mr. [**Known lastname **] for his chronic renal insufficiency.
However, when the patient had extremely high blood pressures, he did respond to I.V.
They recommended watching the dose of the ACE inhibitor, however, secondary to his chronic renal insufficiency.
Recurrent UTIs:  On admission to the CCU, the patient had a urinary tract infection, this time with pyuria (he has had several in the past without pyuria), which was asymptomatic, however cultures grew coag-negative Staph.
The patient has had several UTIs notable for a coag-negative Staph.
Occasionally with white blood cells in the urine and leukocyte esterase and other times without, most but not all in the setting of a Foley.
Urology was consulted and recommended renal ultrasound that showed bilateral echogenic kidneys consistent with parenchymal disease.
It also revealed an increased post-void residual volume of approximately 129 cc.
On the floor, the patient had post-void residual measured which only showed 20 cc, and this residual urine was sent for UA and culture after he had been on the oxacillin for four to five days.
The elevated post-void residual and frequent UTIs (note that a prostate ultrasound was checked and was negative on this admission) do support the possibility of a neurogenic bladder secondary to type 1 diabetes with severe autonomic dysfunction.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home and was given explicit instructions about his followup and recent change in medications.
Type 1 diabetes with autonomic dysregulation.
Hypertensive urgency.
Asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension.
[**Hospital 1800**] clinic, [**2182-1-18**], 3:00 pm, [**Street Address(2) 93185**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60745**] - to be set up for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, to rule out elevated aldosterone, to check plasma renin activity as well as to collect urine collection bottle to measure 24-hour cortisol).
