The patient was in his usual state of health until the day of admission when he had some question of confusion, temperature noted to be 104.8 and a pulse of 104.
The patient also was experiencing some tachypnea which developed over the previous hours and was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**].
The hospitalization was notable for likely left lower lobe pneumonia, discovery of an old cerebrovascular accident, right distal clavicular fracture managed nonoperatively.
The patient was also placed on an Aspen collar to be finished on [**2146-12-12**] as he was unable to clear his neck despite multiple imaging modalities being negative, the patient was unable to report clinical examination of the neck.
Cerebrovascular accident, small left frontal; 4.
Right distal clavicular fracture; 5.
History of Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 6.
Left lower lobe pneumonia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General:  Elderly male appearing somewhat uncomfortable with mild injection of the sclera bilaterally, cervical spine collar in place.
Extremities revealed no edema.
Neurological examination, the patient was disoriented, unable to follow commands, did react to painful stimuli, had 3+ reflexes bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 130, normal axis and intervals, slight ST depressions in lateral leads.
Computerized tomography scan of the head revealed no hemorrhage, mass or shift.
Bilateral thalamic hyperdensities in old frontal infarct and age-related atrophy.
Urinalysis was 3 to 5 red blood cells, 0-2 white blood cells, few bacteria, negative for nitrates, trace leukocytes.
The patient also had a spinal tap which revealed no evidence of infection in the cerebrospinal fluid.
Fever - The patient with evidence of pneumonia on chest x-ray.
The patient's sputum revealed coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was resistant to Oxacillin as well as two morphologies of gram negative rods.
The patient's fever subsided during his hospital course and the patient was afebrile at the time of discharge.
Change in mental status - The patient's mental status changes were likely due to the pneumonia.
Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for signs of infection in the cerebrospinal fluid.
There was no further evidence for an etiology of changes in mental status.
The patient was weaned from the ventilator and was able to tolerate approximately 12 hours a day on tracheostomy mask or with minimal assist CPAP with 5 of pressure support, however, the patient did occasionally fatigue and required assist controlled ventilation for resting.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - On admission the patient appeared volume depleted and was hypernatremic.
Cardiovascular - Repeat electrocardiogram on admission showed resolution of the ST depressions in the lateral leads.
This was likely due to weight-related changes.
Early in his hospital course the patient's blood pressure would occasionally drop, however, this responded readily to fluids and was likely due to dehydrations.
Pneumonia 2.
Methicillin-sensitive resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3.
Hypernatremia 4.
