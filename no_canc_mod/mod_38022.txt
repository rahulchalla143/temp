Pt took two sublingual nitro without relief before he alerted a passing police officer who brought him to the ED.
In the ED, the patient was made pain free with 3 SL nitro.
EKG showed no new ischemic changes and old Q waves in II,III and avF.
Had Stress MIBI which showed severe myocardial perfusion defect involving the entire inferior wall, partially reversible, moderate, myocardial perfusion defect involving the inferolateral and lateral walls.
It was decided to conservatively manage pt given his comorbitidies, and high risk of thrombosis.
EKG showed STE MI, with tombstoning in V2-V4, c/w anterior MI in LAd distribution.
He was urgently taken for catheterization which showed: LAD-90% before D1, 70% after D1; LCX-severe pro dz, mid occlusion, collaterals from left to right; RCA: diffuse disease with serial lesions to 70% just before bifurcation.
