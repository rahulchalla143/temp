Admission Date:  [**2101-4-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-4-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2041-12-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**] Chief Complaint: s/p cardiac arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: 52M with no significant PMH who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after Cardiac Arrest reportedly during sexual activity.
On the evening prior to admission, the patient was noted to be unresponsive during sexual activity and had reportedly taken sildenafil that evening.
After the patient became unresponsive, EMS was called and arrived to the scene soon thereafter starting CPR.
On arrival to OSH, the patient was noted to be in Ventricular trigeminy there, and was started on Amio and Heparin gtt.
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
No acute intracranial process.
If there is clinical concern, MR can be ordered.
Paranasal sinus disease.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The sulci are small and there is poor grey/white differentiation.
These findings are suspicious for global hypoperfusion and infarction.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No definite valvular pathology identified.
Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
There are low lung volumes.
There is hazy density and crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, but there is also concern for mild-to-moderate congestive failure.
- CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2101-4-12**] 7:51 AM IMPRESSION: Left small effusion and basilar atelectasis.
There is prominence of perihilar vascularity which may reflect pulmonary venous congestion.
At 2 p.m., there is a decrease in regularity and amplitude of GPEDs activity and with the reappearance of brief periods of suppression lasting between one to eight seconds.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were numerous entries in these files which show generalized high amplitude spike and polyspike and wave discharges.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are numerous entries in these files which consist of [**12-26**] Hz generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDS) but no electrographic seizures seen.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
QUANTITATIVE EEG: The review of the rhythmic run detection and display panel demonstrated a clear decrease in power across multiple frequencies in both left and right hemispheres occurring at 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m.
This corresponded with a decrease in regularity and amplitude of GPEDs activity and apearance of brief but variable periods of suppression in the raw EEG as described under "Continuous EEG."
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG telemetry due to the presence of frequent and often continuous generalized periodic epileptiform discharges at 1-2 Hz (GPEDs).
These time periods likely corresponded to the administration of sedative or antiepileptic medications.
There were no electrographic seizures seen.
Overall, compared to the previous day's recording there was no significant change.
- MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2101-4-13**] 11:05 AM IMPRESSION:  Diffusion abnormality involving bilateral occipital and parietal cortex and bilateral thalami.
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a differential in consideration; however, less likely, given the lack of white matter involvement.
Alternatively, these findings may represent transient changes related to recent seizure activity.
- MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2101-4-13**] 11:10 AM IMPRESSION: No evidence of malalignment or abnormal cord signal.
In the setting of trauma, CT spine should be obtained to assess for possible underlying fractures.
- BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT	Study Date of [**2101-4-18**] 8:15 AM  IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Unchanged mild cardiomegaly with bilateral areas of atelectasis.
The signs indicative of fluid overload have minimally improved.
Minimal bilateral pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
-EEG	Study Date of [**2101-4-21**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG due to the presence of frequent and prolonged bursts of [**2-1**] Hz GPEDs separated by brief periods of generalized suppression.
- EEG	Study Date of [**2101-4-20**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of a burst suppression pattern.
The bursts consist of variable frequency [**1-31**] Hz GPEDs lasting between two and eight seconds separated by periods of suppression lasting between two and ten seconds.
Burst suppression pattern is most commonly seen during pharmacologic sedation but after diffuse hypoxic brain injury portends a poor prognosis.
- EEG	Study Date of [**2101-4-19**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of a burst suppression pattern where the burst consisted of a [**3-29**] Hz frequency of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) lasting between one and five seconds with periods of generalized suppression lasting between one and ten seconds.
Overall, however, the quality of the record does not change significantly throughout the record and does not represent a significant change compared to the previous day's recording.
A burst suppression pattern is most commonly seen in pharmacologic sedation but after diffuse anoxic injury, portends a poor prognosis.
- EEG	Study Date of [**2101-4-18**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of a burst suppression pattern where the burst consisted of a [**1-28**] Hz frequency of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs), lasting between one and four seconds, with periods of generalized suppression, lasting between one and ten seconds.
Overall, compared to the previous tracing, there was no significant change.
A burst suppression pattern is most commonly seen in pharmacologic sedation but after diffuse anoxic injury portends a poor prognosis.
# s/p Cardiac Arrest: The patient was transferred to the CCU from OSH for Arctic Sun cooling protocol in the setting of recent cardiac arrest and poor neurologic status.
His cardiac markers were only slightly elevated on admission with TropT 0.44 and CK MB 39, with the tropinin trending downwards, attributed to the patient's receiving CPR as well as shocks.
Heparin gtt was similarly discontinued given no active signs of ischemia.
cardiac cath was deferred secondary to poor outcome secondary to neurologic status.
His ECHO showed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function without any evidence of focal wall motion abnormality.
# Possible Seizures:  Upon arrival to CCU, patient had brief [**1-27**] second sustained jerking movements of his extremities, associated with horizontal nystagmus.
Final read from Head CT in house showed small sulci and poor grey/white differentiation, suspicious for global hypoperfusion and infarction.
An MRI showed diffusion abnormality involving bilateral occipital and parietal cortex and bilateral thalami, concerning for global hypoxia/hypoperfusion injury.
Per Neurology, the patient was started on propofol, midazolam, keppra, pheytoin, and valproate, but despite this regimen continued to have the presence of frequent and  prolonged bursts of [**2-1**] Hz GPEDs separated by brief periods of generalized suppression.
During hospitalization, an attempt was made to wean the patient's anti-epileptic medications, but with only the weaning of the propofol the patient was noted to have small clonic motions of his head and arms, and propofol therapy was re-instituted.
# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Presumed secondary cardiac arrest; there was concern initally for [**Doctor Last Name **] given the P/F ratio less than 300, which the patient continued to have during his hospitalization; his ventilator settings were titrated to maintain low tidal volumes.
# UTI: The patient was noted to have a Klebseilla species growing in his urine; this was already appropriately being treated by [**Last Name (LF) 88643**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] no additional antibiotics were changed or added.
Urine lytes were checked and were consistent with central diabetes insipitus; the patient was started on ddAVP to help control urine output, as well as to help control the climbing hypernatremia which was resulting from his DI.
# Goals of Care: Several family discussions were held, with neurology present, to discuss the patient's poor prognosis in the setting of re-warming, as well as the patients generalized seizure activity not controlled on multi-drug anti-epileptic regimen.
