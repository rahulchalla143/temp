Admission Date:  [**2143-12-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2143-12-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2080-6-6**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and weakness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year old female with a past medical history of progressive multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes Type 1, obesity, saddle pulmonary emboli secondary to deep vein thrombosis, obstructive sleep apnea.
Over the past month she has been noticing increasing lower extremity weakness with recurrent falls as well as increasing shortness of breath.
Due to recurrent falls she has been using a wheelchair.
Her multiple sclerosis type is relaxing and remitting and she has had in the past bilateral optic neuritis requiring multiple hospitalizations as well as treatment for multiple sclerosis with Cytoxan, adrenocorticotropic hormone and high dose steroids.
Her multiple sclerosis has also resulted in the loss of gag reflex with increasing difficulty swallowing and a baseline very hoarse voice although she has had no documentation of aspiration pneumonia.
Her shortness of breath is described as progressive and she has significant dyspnea on even mild exertion.
There is no reported shortness of breath at rest or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea or chest pain.
She presented to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2143-12-11**] for a suspected multiple sclerosis flare due to weakness and falls.
[**Hospital1 **] was called for control of her diabetes on steroids.
Pulmonary was consulted to assess her shortness of breath on [**12-14**] and electrocardiogram was ordered and read as normal.
The patient was ruled out for acute myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.
The MIP of 67% which was indicative of mild respiratory muscle weakness.
A computerized tomography scan was ordered to assess for pulmonary emboli and was read as low probability.
Cardiac echocardiogram showed no significant abnormality and arterial blood gases taken with readings of 7.37 pH, pCO2 of 36 and pO2 of 73 on room air.
The patient then underwent a chest computerized tomography scan and was found to have evidence of severe tracheomalacia with narrowing of the trachea and main stem bronchi to a near crescent with partial collapse on inspiration.
There was no evidence of interstitial lung disease.
In addition the patient was found to have acute renal failure with a rise in creatinine from a baseline of .8 to 1.0 to a peak recorded value of 1.6 in the hospitalization on [**2143-12-23**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is significant for multiple sclerosis, diabetes Type 1, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea for which she does not use CPAP, saddle pulmonary emboli in [**2136**] in the setting of hospitalization and deep vein thrombosis.
The hospitalization was secondary to multiple sclerosis.
She has had thoracic herpetic eruptions status post excision of two benign breast masses and numerous basal cell carcinomas of the face.
FAMILY HISTORY:  She has two other siblings with multiple sclerosis and there is also significant coronary artery disease.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had no fevers, no nightsweats, no chest pain, no weight changes, no heat or cold intolerance, no headache, no urinary symptoms, no change in bowel habits, no bright red blood per rectum, no melena, no abdominal pain, no visual changes and no rashes.
Positive chronic lower extremity edema.
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.
General, she is not in apparent distress, morbidly obese with hoarse voice.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Respiratory, clear to auscultation bilaterally with mild upper airway noises.
Extremities, 2+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Multiple sclerosis - Neurological, the patient was treated with high dose steroids per routine for multiple sclerosis.
She was taken off Prednisone without a taper and then due to her electrolyte abnormalities there was worry of adrenal insufficiency and she was put back on Prednisone on a short taper.
There were no further neurological issues.
Shortness of breath - Initial differential for this patient's shortness of breath included cardiac, coronary artery disease, pulmonary emboli, pneumonia or interstitial lung disease, respiratory muscle weakness.
Tracheomalacia was found incidentally on computerized tomography scan as well as a mild respiratory muscle weakness.
As other causes of shortness of breath and dyspnea were ruled out it is felt that the patient's shortness of breath is multifactorial caused by a combination of morbid obesity, tracheomalacia and respiratory muscle weakness secondary to multiple sclerosis.
The patient's trachea and bronchi were stented open by Interventional Pulmonology with good effect and no complications which resulted in a subjective improvement in this patient's breathing.
She was also counseled and given a nutrition consult for weight loss which should improve her breathing as well.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Over the course of the hospitalization the patient had a recent drop in sodium and increase in potassium.
It is probable that she is having residual electrolyte balancing abnormalities secondary to the acute renal insufficiency complicated by the residual effects of Aldactone expected to resolve over time.
Acute renal insufficiency - This patient had her Pheno recorded at 0.6 which is less than 1% which is consistent with prerenal failure.
as well and was diuresed as well during hospitalization for thoughts of volume overload as the cause of shortness of breath.
Diabetes - With the help of [**Hospital1 **] attending this patient's glucose was well controlled throughout the admission observing no change from her insulin regimen and this will be followed up as an outpatient.
Cardiac - There was no evidence of substantial cardiac or coronary artery disease in this patient at this time.
Endocrine - This patient's thyroid function was assessed as a possible cause of the patient's dyspnea and contributing factor and obesity.
