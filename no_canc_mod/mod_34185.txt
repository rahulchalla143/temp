CT Abd/Pelvis [**2172-2-11**] CT ABDOMEN: There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.
Absence of intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the abdominal parenchymal organs and vasculature.
Liver is nodular in contour, and slightly shrunken, consistent with reported history of cirrhosis.
There is an ill-defined hypodensity in segment IV (2, 19), which is incompletely characterized without IV contrast.
Gallbladder is also filled partially with oral contrast, which appears to have entered the gallbladder via a fistulous connection from the second portion of the duodenum.
There is soft tissue prominence in the region of the ampulla, though no definite nodule or mass is seen, and this prominence may be post-procedural related to recent EUS.
There are prominent porta hepatis, and peripancreatic lymph nodes, but the non-contrast appearance of the pancreas itself is unremarkable.
Pancreatic duct is not dilated.
There are no pancreatic calcifications.
Prominent varices are seen throughout the left upper abdomen.
Spleen is mildly enlarged.
There is no free intraperitoneal air.
Urinary bladder is decompressed with a Foley catheter balloon in place.
There is no free pelvic fluid or abnormal pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
There is no osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy.
Mild lumbar spine degenerative changes are noted.
Pneumobilia, and air and oral contrast material within the gallbladder lumen, concerning for fistulous connection between the adjacent ulcerated second portion of the duodenum seen on recent EGD.
Cirrhotic liver, with incompletely characterized hypodensity in segment IV, prominent periportal lymph nodes, and numerous large splenorenal varices in the left upper quadrant.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions.

Upper endoscopy at OSH revealed two duodenal ulcers, one which had appeared to be perforated or fistulized.
Hepatology was consulted and recommended pantoprazole IV drip and octreotide.
Surgery was consulted and recommended repeat abdominal CT.  CT revealed pneumobilia, with air and oral contrast in gallbladder and CBD, which was thought to be most commmon with fistulous connection between the duodenal ulcer and gallbladder.
He underwent cholecystectomy with closure of cholecystoduodenal fistula for duodenal ulcer with cholecystoduodenal fistula.
Operative findings included cirrhotic liver with some ascites and the gallbladder was quite inflamed as was the entire porta.
IV methadone (10mg  q 12 hours) was started to assist with pain control as well as iv dilaudid and ativan prn for agitation given h/o substance abuse.
He did not have signs/symptoms of withdrawl on admission though he was given ativan for anxiety.
The volume of JP drainage decreased to ~ 110cc/day and became more consistent with ascites fluid.
Ativan and dilaudid doses were decreased with ativan later discontinued but restarted due to anxiety issues.
Prolene stitch placed to LRQ due to excessive drainage through dressings.
No thrombus in the deep veins of the left arm or in the central veins were noted.
The patient has a history of seizure disorder, but not history of seizures while withdrawing in past.
Lasix, spironolactone and inderal were restarted at the end of the hospitalization for cirrhosis management.
Chronic cholecystitis.
