Friend called EMS after pt found unresponsive.
Pt received 4 mg of narcan in the field with minimal responsiveness.
Afterwards, 2mg of narcan administered with improvement in MS and the pt became combative and was noted to vomit small amount of blood tinged fluid.
He denied any memory of the events leading to hospitalization but denied any illict or presciption drug use.
The patient's Mother briefly arrived and voiced concern of a suicide attempt.
The night prior, the pt told his mom he was the only one who loved him in a way which seemed in preperation for saying goodbye.
-Undefined psychiatric disorder  Social History: Homeless.
Notable for psychiatric disturbance in his mother.
The patient reports his father died of possible cardiac disease.
Physical Exam: Vitals: afebrile, BP:95/80 P:85 R:18 O2: 100% on 4L General: Lethargic, oriented x 2 (not time) HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP 6-8 cm above clavicle at 45 degrees, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley Ext: BL track marks.
cold fingers > feet, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema neuro: pupils constricted but responsive.
CXR [**5-17**]: FINDINGS: Heart size and pulmonary vascularity remain normal.
Previously described ground-glass opacity has progressed in the left lower lobe with consolidative appearance in the retrocardiac region.
Additionally, there is a new area of air space consolidation involving the right lower lobe.
The bibasilar distribution and rapid changes favor aspiration but differential diagnosis includes evolving infection, pulmonary hemorrhage, and less likely asymmetrical non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
R foot films: Fracture at the base of the right fifth metatarsal extending to the edge of the tarsometatarsal joint, with slight distraction .
CT head [**5-17**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.
No fractures or soft tissue abnormalities are identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
ECHO [**5-20**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with normal left ventricular diastolic function.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion (<0.5 cm) located adjacent to the right atrial free wall.
Mild mitral regurgitation in a structurally normal valve.
Very small pericardial effusion adjacent to right atrium.
The opacity of right lower lobe and left lower lobe have slightly improved.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
UE ultrasound [**5-20**]:  PRELIMINARY - superficial thrombophlebitis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 48 year old with hepatitis C + B and known IVDA who presented unresponsive.
# Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy in setting of drug overdose: Multiple contributing factors.
Positive opoid screen, empty oxycodone / oxycontin bottles, and response to narcan suggestive of acute opiod overdose.
Inital VBG with CO2 of 90 also suggests hypercarbia as a cause, perhaps as a results of hypoventilation from the opiods.
LP performed in ED without evidence of infection and CSF cultures negative to date.
# Hypotension with elevated lactate on arrival.
Elevated JVP on exam, but extremities cold and clammy, likely related to hypovolemia Pressures improved with IV therapy provided in ER.
TTE revealed normal function with small pericardial effusion.
# Polysubstance abuse/Opiod overdose - On further questioning, pt denied suicidal ideations, but later stated that he didn't remember if he did it as a suicide attempt.
# Aspiration pneumonia: BL infiltrates on CXR, appear posterior inferior lobes, consistent with aspiration.
# Demand ischemia: On admssion, EKG without evidence of acute ST-T wave changes.
Was likely elevated in the setting of recent hypotension, opiod overdose, acute renal failure and cocaine use.
He remained asymptomatic without chest pain.
ECHO revealed normal function with small pericardial effusion.
# Acute renal failure: Thought pre renal given elevated BUN/CR.
# Hepatitis C: Per patient, has not been followed by a hepatologist as an outpatient.
# R 5th metatarsal fracture - Had recently been discharged from [**Hospital1 112**] ED with a cast.
# Superficial thrombophlebitis:  Ultrasound on day of discharge revealed distal superficial thrombophlebitis.

You also had an inflamed superficial vein in your left arm.
New medications: Complete the course of clindamycin for pneumonia for another 5 days.
