He was admitted with persistent tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis to 16 with leftward shift with normal blood pressure.
He was initally admitted to the floor where a CT-PA showed RLL consolidation and small pleural effusion, but no PE.
He was continued on CTX and azithromycin (started in the ED), later broadened to CTX and levofloxacin out of concern for Legionella (despite negative antigen) with non-bloody watery diarrhea.
He complained of substernal chest pressure and EKG was mildly concerning for isolated ST elevation in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was ruled out for MI with serial troponins.
Leukocytosis worsened and imaging showed progression of a pneumonic process to include all right lung fields, along with evidence of volume overload with bibasilar crackles and worsening hypoxia, requiring NRB.
He was diuresed with furosemide 120mg IV, but patient's high oxygen requirement continued, so he was transferred to the ICU with sat drops to 80s on NRB.
Repeat chest CT showed a large, loculated empyema with significant associated right lung atelectasis.
Thoracentesis yielded 20 cc of purulent pleural fluid.
Following the procedure, he desatted again and was intubated for increased WOB and hypoxia with 7.5 ETT.
Pleural fluid studies were consistent with an exudative process with elevated LDH to 7072.
(+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough or wheezing.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:  Bilateral pneumonia consisting of left lung ground glass opacities and right lower lung consolidation have improved since last exam.
For example, right lower lobe consolidation has significantly improved.
Right loculated pleural effusion has significantly improved.
The first one goes posteriorly and ends at the apex without significant residual pleural effusion.
Minimal air is seen inside the pleural effusion.
Anterior pleural effusion has significantly improved and the thickness of the residual pleural effusion is 2 cm.
Pericardial effusion has been drained and is improved and the residual one is small.
UPPER ABDOMEN:  This study is not tailored for assessment for intra-abdominal organs.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no bony lesion concerning for malignancy or infection.
Right-sided empyema and pericardial effusion has been drained surgically.
There is no new loculation.
Bilateral pneumonia has also improved.

[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2618**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2619**] Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2165-9-19**] 10:39 PM  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 42 year old with evidence of emphysematous changes and remarkable smoking history, presenting with RLL pneumonia complicated by loculated empyema, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further ICU management.
# Pneumonia with empyema: He had recently presented to his PCP with sore throat,presumed to be viral.
He presented to OSH ED with dyspnea with CT showing RLL consolidation and small pleural effusion with thoracentesis at OSH and IV antibiotics given.
He developed rapid progression of pneumonic process despite IV abx to all right lung fields and development of a loculated empyema and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
He was also noted to have a pericardial effusion, with pulsus ranging [**9-9**].
He went to the OR for VATS and pericardial window.
Multiple pleural fluid aspirates and pleural tissue growing out strep anginosis although pericardial fluid has remained sterile.
It is likely that he had initially had a strep anginosis throat infection, aspirated the strep with subsequent development of the PNA and empyema, with a pericardial effusion developing as part of an inflammatory reaction.
He remained intubated briefly following his OR procedures.
Repeat CXR showed consideral improvement.
Prior to discharge one of the chest tubes was removed and the remaining two chest tubes were pulled back 5cm each and put on pleurastats.
Pt's pain initially controlled with IV medications and switched to long and short acting oxycondone, which he was sent home on.
# Anemia of acute inflammation:  Baseline HCT is 43 with HCT 28.7 on admission.
His Hct had no precipitous drops while on the floor.
# Pericardial effusion: No signs of tamponade.
Has pericardial window.
Etiology is thought to be severe systemic inflammation from above.
Bedside echo in ICU [**9-15**] showed no pericardial fluid, no vegetation, mitral valve looks okay  Medications on Admission: Medications at home (family to bring in doses/frequencies tomorrow): - Verapamil 240mg - Imitrex - Divalproex - vitamin D - Cepacol (sore throat)  Medications on transfer: - Vancomycin 1250mg IV q8h - Levofloxacin 750mg daily - Piperacillin/tazobactam 2.25gm IV q6h - Alteplase 10mg IV TID to chest tube - Morphine sulfate 2mg IV q4h PRN - Acetaminophen 650mg q6h PRN - Famotidine 20mg IV q12h - Propofol gtt - Lorazepam 1mg IV q4h PRN - Heparin 5000 units SC TID - Albuterol 6 puffs q4h PRN - Albuterol 2.5mg nebs q6h PRN  Allergies: metoclopramide  Discharge Medications: 1.
