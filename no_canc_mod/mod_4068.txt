Superimposed infection cannot be excluded by imaging.
No convincing evidence of pneumothorax on either side.

Routine sampling showed some left hemisphere slowing but no clear epileptiform features.
Automated detection programs captured no electrographic seizures.

Brief Hospital Course: # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, likely related to seizure (?
from alcohol withdrawal) versus hypoxia from COPD.
Reportedly, per the family, he has had cardiac arrests previously.
Subsequently, after cooling protocol was finished, he had residual mental status deficits that were evaluated by imaging as detailed below.
# Dyspnea: The patient has a history of smoking and COPD and his initial dyspnea was most likely related to a COPD flare.
No radiologic or clinical evdience of pneumonia.
He also had developed pneumothoraces noted after cardiac arrest, necessitating chest-tube placement by thoracic surgery service.
Required intubation for cardiac arrest and subsequent to extubation on [**2104-12-15**], had respiratory distress.
Albuterol was changed to xopenex due to tachycardia and agitation.
Required re-intubation for MRI on [**2104-12-22**], with difficulty, was eventually weaned and extubated on [**12-26**].
Subsequently, on medical floor, he had episodes of tachypnea at night that were thought to be related to agitation and delirium, and these improved with a standing quetiapine as recommended by psychiatry.
# ETOH abuse: It is unknown whether Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] has any history of withdrawal  seizures or DTs.
Serum tox initially with elevated  EtOH but then decreased to mid-20s prior to leaving AMA.
He may have had a seizure when leaving AMA given his unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and incontinence.
Initially while intubated he was given benzos for agitation and these were gradually weaned off.
He was also given thiamine, folic acid, and a multivitamin or banana bags when he was unable to take POs.
# Sepsis from endovascular Coagulase negative staphylococcus infection: The patient had Coagulase negative Staph aureus in cultures from [**12-15**], [**12-17**], [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles ??????
2nd showed no growth), and [**12-26**].
Transthoracic echocardiograms on [**12-22**] and [**12-29**] were negative for vegetation.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] and spine plain films to assess for possible osteomyelitis/abscess were negative.
# Altered Mental Status / Bipolar disorder: Combination of anoxic insult from cardiac arrest, underlying schizoaffective and bipolar disoder, history of alcohol abuse and possible Wernicke's, and sepsis.
No evidence of macroscopic anoxic brain injury or infarcts on brain MRI.
Per the family, the patient has untreated bipolar disorder and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.
He received IV thiamine for concern for Wernicke's encephalopathy.
He had 3 EEG studies during his ICU stay, none of which showed any evidence of seizure activity.
He eventually was able to communicate with caregivers and family, able to recall that he was born in [**State 9512**] and moved to [**Location (un) 86**] in the 80's, although he continues to have short-term memory deficits and marked cognitive impairment requiring re-orientation.
In mid-[**Month (only) 404**], patient became more agitated with staff, so quetiapine prn was restarted.
# Hypertension: HTN previously treated with lisinopril and atenolol.
# Man-in-barrel syndrome: Upon original admission, had diminished movement of upper extremities which were noted by neurology consult to be hypertonically flexed and adducted, concerning for man-in-barrel syndrome.
EEG studies and c-spine imaging were performed but were negative for seizures or C-spine cord compression respectively.
# Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and elevated bicarb.
Bicarb likely elevated secondary to acute/chronic respiratory acidosis.
Lactate may have been elevated secondary to hypoperfusion, increased work of breathing with respiratory distress, but this subsequently resolved.
# Anemia: Nutritional deficiency versus GI blood loss, since he did have guaiac + stools.
He was placed on a PPI intially for GI prophylaxis given his history of alcoholism and high dose steriods.
Iron studies, B12, and folate levels were checked and showed normal ferritin (63) but decreased Iron/TIBC ratio.
He will need outpatient colonoscopy for workup of guaiac positive stools.
# Nutrition: Initially received tube feeds through NG tube in ICU, but was transitioned to oral diet after speech and swallow evaluation.
# Urinary retention: Likely BPH.
