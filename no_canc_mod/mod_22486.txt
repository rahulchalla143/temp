The areas of penetrating ulceration continue into the upper abdominal aorta, with a 3.7 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm as described.
CXR [**2140-4-14**]: There is widening of the mediastinum, which has a slightly ill- defined margin.
Given that the recent CT scan, performed yesterday demonstrated an aortic ulcer with intramural hematoma and that there is a new left pleural fluid collection, clinical correlation and followup CT scan are recommended.
CXR [**2140-4-15**]: Left lower lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis.
CXR [**2140-4-16**]: There is continued marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Please refer to recent CT scan report.There is continued left lower lobe consolidation most likely indicating atelectasis.
The possibility of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
There is continued small left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is seen.
CXR [**2140-4-17**]: Mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion.
ECHO [**2140-4-20**]: Mild symmetric left ventricular systolic function with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Based on [**2131**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
CULTURE RESULTS:    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2140-4-17**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
PRESUMPTIVE STREPTOCOCCUS BOVIS.
This is a 77 F with history of HTN, AAA, and CVA who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain on [**4-13**].
CT done at OSH was concerning for aortic dissection.
Upon further evaluation of images and comparison with [**2137**] studies, it was found that descending aortic aneurysm was unchanged from 2 years ago and there was no dissection.
Her abdominal pain resolved without intervention soon after transfer.
CT did show that she had several large gallstones within the gallbladder.
There was no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Possible etiologies of her abdominal pain included passing of a gallstone or gastritis (later confirmed on EGD).
She remained asymptomatic and was tolerating po's well.
On [**4-14**], the patient developed T 102 with UCx positive for E. coli >100,000 and Strep bovis in urine.
Atrial fibrillation, new diagnosis.
[**4-16**] the patient was found with new onset Afib with rapid ventricular response 130-150 with decrease in BP (SBP from 130 to mid 80s for 3 minutes).
IV Lopressor was given without success and she was loaded with IV amiodarone with subsequent return to NSR.
Given history of a prior stroke which puts her at a high risk for thromboembolic events, it was felt that the patient needs to be bridged with Heparin to overlap with therapeutic INR x 2days.
The patient did have an echocardiogram during this admission which showed normal EF, symmetric LVH and mild MR.
There was no evidence of intracardiac thrombi.
H/o prior embolic stroke.
The patient needs tight BP control.
She had severe HTN with SBP in 200's requiring doses of IV Hydralazine.
The patient c/o increased cough during this admission and an ACE inhibitor was later changed to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] to eliminate it as a cause of her cough.
Iron studies revealed low serum Fe/TIBC ratio, but Ferritin was >500.
Given suspicion for iron deficiency anemia and need for chronic anticoagulation as well as finding of Strep bovis in urine, GI were consulted and the patient underwent EGD and colonoscopy which were significant for gastritis and diverticuli in duodenum and sigmoid but showed no evidence of malignancy in colon.
The was no h/o COPD documented.
She did not have evidence of bronchospasm and her only pulmonary complaint during this admission was cough, which could have been due to a respiratory infection, post-nasal drip or ?
CXR intially showed evidence of CH which improved clinically throughout her admission.
ACE was stopped to eliminate this as cause for cough.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: Two (2)  Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
