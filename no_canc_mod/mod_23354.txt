ABG showed severe hypercarbia and hypoxia.
Lower back pain leaving him unable to move for days at a time.
Depression Chronic lower back pain Conjunctivitis   Social History: recently lost job as chef; evicted today.

1+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis.
1+ BL edema to sacrum   Pertinent Results: I. Labs A.
There are diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities and marked widening of pneumomediastinum.
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study as above.
Signs of heart failure again noted.
TTE [**2165-12-6**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
No aortic stenosis and no aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen (suboptimal technical quality).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis suggestive of a primary pulmonary process or primary right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
No additional thrombus seen in either leg.
Extremely limited study; there is suggestion of a nodular liver parenchyma which could correlate with chronic liver disease, but evaluation is markedly limited.
Slightly distended gallbladder with no evidence of gallstones.
Significant image noise due to body mass index, allowing for this limitation, there is no evidence of a first to third order pulmonary embolism.
Multifocal lower lobe pneumonia.
Moderately severe pulmonary arterial enlargement suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
Global moderate cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxic and hypercarbic resp failure: Likely multifactorial, combination of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, fluid overload.
TTE showed EF of 55%, right ventricular cavity enlargment with free wall hypokinesis suggestive of a primary pulmonary process or primary right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was elevated at 36.
He was started on aggressive diuresis for CHF exacerbation with lasix drip and chlorothiazide which was later changed to metolozone.
He was ruled out for MI as source of CHF with cardiac enzymes x 3.
PE was also considered on differential for respiratory failure.
In addition, giving ongoing hypoxemia, a bubble study was performed to rule out shunt, but was poor in quality.
He was started empirically on heparin gtt which was eventually discontinued when pt began having bloody secretions.
After aggressive diuresis, he was able to undergo CTA that showed no PE in a large vessel but could not rule out PE in smaller vessels due to body habitus.
Bronchoscopy was performed to investigate bloody secretions that showed likely suction tube induced trauma but no actively bleeding vessels.
Sleep apnea was suspected given body habitus and desaturations to 80s during sleep.
Interval Lower Extremity [**Last Name (un) 7737**] was obtained which showed persistent bilateral calf vein DVT.
# Right-sided heart failure Course with diuresis as above.
# Bilateral lower extremity DVTs As per above.
# Chronic hypoxemia with pulmonary hypertension On admission, polycythemia and elevated HCO3 suggesting chronic hypoxia thought to be secondary to OSA given habitus.
Sleep was consulted and observed that CPAP did not appear effective for his likely sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
In addition on an outpatient basis, alternative etiologies of pulmonary hypertension including chronic thromboembolic disease, portal pulmonary hypertension, and hepatopulmonary syndrome should be explored.
# Pneumonia: Pt developed fever during MICU course; WBC peaked at 11.2.
CXR was concering for PNA and he was started on empiric tx with levofloxacin, vancomycin and cefepime initially for VAP.
# Hoarseness: Patient had hoarseness after extubation.
Likely trauma from intubation as difficult airway.
# Abnormal liver function tests: Patient with possible history alcohol abuse.
Found to have elevated T. bili, transaminitis and elevated INR 1.7 on admission with nadir to 1.3.
RUQ ultrasound was performed that was limited due to body habitus but was suggestive of nodular liver parenchyma concerning for chronic liver disease, slightly distended gallbladder with  no evidence of gallstones and splenomegaly.
Abnormal liver functions thought to be due to liver congestion +/- alcohol.
# Tinea Pedis and Onychomycosis: treated with topical anti-fungal.
Systemic therapy for onychomycosis is currently avoided in the setting of abnormal liver functions.
# Obesity Patient morbidly obese with 100-lb weight gain in over past 3 months with unknown etiology.
Suggest outpatient consideration of secondary causes of obesity such as testing for hypothyroidism and [**Location (un) 3484**] syndrome.
# Depression: Prior to this admission Mr. [**Known lastname **] seems to have undegone multiple social stressors including the loss of his job (worked as a chef) and housing and was finally found down at home with evidence of squalor and neglect.
He has no family and little social support and did not have health insurance or prior healthcare.
[**Name2 (NI) **] admitted to prior depression but denied any current or past SI/SA/HI and has never sought psychiatric care.
During this admission he was noted to have flat affect and was difficult to engage in conversation regarding his psycho-social issues.
Inpatient psychiatric consult was not indicated as he did not have any acutely concerning psychiatric issues and denied current depression.
In addition, secondary causes of depression should be considered such as hypothyroidism and [**Location (un) 3484**] syndrome given gained ~ 50 kg over past 3 months.
Thyroid tests deferred in setting of acute illness.
Respiratory Failure 2.
Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome 3.
Morbid Obesity 4. obstructive sleep apnea   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for respiratory distress.
You were found to have heart failure and were treated with diuretic medication which removed a significant amount of fluid.
You also developed a lung infection which resolved with antibiotics.
You were found to have blood clots in both your legs and will need continued treatment with blood thinning medication.
You had some elevation in your liver enzymes while you were here.
