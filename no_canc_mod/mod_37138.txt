Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Patient was admitted with blood in the rectal vault on exam in ED with three bloody bowel movements since.
Most likely source was diverticular bleeding given her history of diverticuli.
She continued to have BRBPR overnight in the ICU and a red blood cell scan was ordered but did not show active bleeding.
She was transfused 2 units of PRBC for falling Hct in the setting of minor ECG changes.
The patient's GI bleeding resolved and her hematocrit stabilized at 31-33.
GI was consulted but felt that another colonoscopy at this time was not indicated given the patient's recent colonoscopy in [**2126-8-28**] showing diverticuli.
ST Depressions: Patient presented with admission EKG with poor baseline tracing but possible small abnormalities; these resolved on subsequent EKG and ICU admission EKG and were likely due to demand ischemia.
She had no chest pain or difficulty breathing and ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes.
