At that time she was found by nursing home staff in respiratory distress with O2 sats of 70% on RA.
She was also noted to be hot (no document of temperature) with cough and green sputum.
CXR interpreted as concerning for CHF.
She was temporarily started on BIPAP however did not tolerate well with hypotension and tachycardia.
No respiratory distress.

IMAGING: [**2179-1-29**] EKG #1: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Poor R wave progression could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although cannot exclude ischemia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2179-1-29**] EKG #2: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Poor R wave progression could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although cannot exclude ischemia.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Mild cardiomegaly.
Acute right MCA distribution infarction with acute occlusion demonstrated within the right middle cerebral artery.
No collateral flow.
No evidence of vascular dissection.
Mild atherosclerotic plaque as detailed above.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 year old female with a history of schizophrenia and dementia who presented in repiratory distress and was found to have a new MCA stroke.
She was noted to be in afib with RVR, and CXR was concerning for pulmonary edema.
BiPAP attempted, but patient did not tolerate well; developed hypotension and increased tachycardia.
She was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of respiratory distress.
After Code Stroke called on arrival to ICU in setting of left hemiparesis (see below), and imaging revealed large R MCA infarct, decision was made to focus on comfort care only.
Patient transferred to floor, where she received morphine as needed for pain and SOB.
CVA: On arrival to ICU, patient was noted to have left hemiparesis.
Code Stroke called, and CT Head/Neck revealed right MCA infarct.
Given the history of recent falls and her limited pre-stroke functionality, the decision was made not to give heparin or tPA.
Atrial fibrillation: Patient noted to be in afib with RVR on presentation.
Rash: Patient noted to have papular rash on erythematous background on neck and abdomen.
Was felt to be most likely secondary to a drug rash.
Of note, patient received lasix, which may have caused reaction as patient has history of sulfa allergy.
- acetaminophen prn   Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Cerebrovascular accident (stroke), rash  Secondary Diagnoses: atrial fibrillation, schizophrenia, dementia   Discharge Condition: Patient expired.
