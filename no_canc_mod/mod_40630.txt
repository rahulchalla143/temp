# GIB: - NG lavage was negative in ED.
- She was brought down to the GI suite on [**12-2**] but became tachycardic into the 130s and so the procedure was cancelled and she was brought back up to the ICU.
- Tachycardia resolved with IVFs - Was kept NPO and had colonoscopy the following morning revealing diverticular disease but otherwise normal.
Diverticular disease likely cause of the LGIB.
# UTI: - evidence of UTI on U/A w/ positive nitrites and many bacteria but on [**3-3**] WBCs on micro.
She had no leukocytosis, left shift, fever, or leukocytosis and so she was not treated intially.
- However, in the setting of tachycardia and some subjective chills, as well as E. coli growing from the urine, she was started on Bactrim.
- tachycardia resolved on bactrim, and with restarting CCB as well as fluids so likely tachycardia was due to combination of all of the above .
