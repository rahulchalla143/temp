Patient states that his chest pain began suddenly at work, started with noted diaphoresis, then felt sub-sternal chest "burning".
The chest pain worsened and therefore patient called 911 and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**].
He otherwise denied radiation of the pain to jaw or arm, denied N/V, SOB, any other complaints.
Denies having had this pain before.
EKG was performed that demonstrated ST elevation with tombstoning in leads II, III, aVF with recipricol ST depression in leads I, aVL, V1-V5.
A right sided EKG was performed that demonstrated ST elevation with tombstoning in leads rV3-rV6.
Patient was given NS fluid bolus x 2, 4 baby aspirin, morphine, lopressor 5mg IV x 1, and started on integrillin and heparin drips, then transferred to cath lab for emergent cardiac cath.
Patient had onset of symptoms at 4:30PM, arrived in cath lab at 6:30PM.
In Cath lab, demonstrated 100% RCA occlusion, 40-50% stenosis in left main, 50-60% stenosis in LAD, 90% long lesion in long diag.
Post-cath course c/b onset of atrial fibrillation.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery diease.
The left main coronary artery had a distal 40-50% lesion.
The left anterior descending artery is a small vessel with diffuse disease (50-60% stenoses).
The mid RCA lesion was predilated with a 2.0 X 20 mm sprinter  balloon, stented with a 2.5 X 28mm Cypher stent and post dilated with a 3.0 X 13mm high sail balloon  with lesion reduction from 100% to 0%, also jailing and stenosing the ostium of the AM.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis in the stented segment with no embolisation or dissection.
ECHO [**2185-3-5**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis (focused views only) estimated LVEF ?50%.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen is focused views (parasternal long axis); valvular regurgitation was not fully assessed.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of pericardial tamponade.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Severe coronary artery calcifications.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior hypokinesis and basal inferoseptal hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 44 year old man with past medical history of borderline hypertension, borderline hypercholesterolemia, who presented to the emergency department with an ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Upon presentation to the ED, the patient was noted to have ST elevations in the inferior leads on EKG (II, III, aVF) and right-sided EKG demonstrated ST elevation in the Right sided precordial leads, including lead rV4.
These findings indicated an infero-posterior MI with RV involvement.
The patient was immediately taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, and time from onset of symptoms to intervention was estimated at approximately 2 hour (onset of symptoms at 4:30pm, in cath lab by 6:30pm).
The catheterization also demonstrated evidence of diffuse disease, with left main coronary artery with a distal 40-50% lesion, the left anterior descending artery noted to be a small vessel with diffuse disease (50-60% stenoses), the first diagonal branch (2.0 mm vessel) with a tubular 90% lesion, and the OM1 has a 60% ostial stenosis.
Post-cath course complicated immediately by atrial fibrillation, noted in the cath lab following the case.
It was believe that his atrial fibrillation was secondary to peri-MI, peri-cath circumstances and may have been contributed to by his PA catheter in place during the catheterization.
Later in hospital course, patient noted to have a slight Hct drop from 35->32->31.
Therefore a chest/abd/pelvis CT was obtained to rule out a bleed which was negative.
Given his lack of risk factors for cardiac disease, HgA1C was checked which was normal at 5.4, CRP was checked which was elevated at 2.3.
Patient underwent post-cath ECHO that demonstrated EF > 55%, mildly depressed LV function, resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior hypokinesis and basal inferoseptal hypokinesis, nl RV function, trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
