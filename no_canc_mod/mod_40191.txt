He had an episode of CP yesterday, lasting 2-3 minutes, that resolved on it's own.
This afternoon, he again experienced chest pain at around 2pm.
The pain lasted 45 minutes and was not relieved by resting or sitting down.
It was located was at the upper sternum, without radiation to jaw or arms and was accompanied by lightheadedness, diaphoresis and clamminess.
The sweating/clamminess lasted 30 minutes, but chest pain persisted.
Given concerning chest pain, his friend brought him to the [**Name (NI) **] for further evaluation.
In the cath lab, patient was found to have mid-LAD lesion that was angioplastied and DES was placed.
He remains chest pain free after procedure with subseqent EKG's demonstrating improvement in ST elevations.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems (at this time) is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes (last A1c 7.8%), benign prostatic hypertrophy, erectile dysfunction  Social History: Works as custodian, very active at work, can climb 6 flights of stairs without chest pain or difficulty.
Family History: Father with MI at 75 years old - No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
+right eye cataract NECK: Supple with no JVD.
No thrills, lifts.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
+right eye cataract NECK: Supple with no JVD.
No thrills, lifts.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
CXR portable [**10-21**]: IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
No pneumonia or pneumothorax seen.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to inferior and posterior hypokinesis, and anterior and apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis (no thrombus seen with Optison contrast).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic arch is moderately dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 71M with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia and DM presents with chest pain, found to have anterior STEMI s/p cath with DES to mid LAD lesion without complications.
# STEMI: Pt admitted to the CCU following immediate C.Cath after code STEMI was called in the ED with ST elevations in the anterior leads.
The pt was found to have diffuse disease in the proximal LAD and 95% stenosis in distal LAD.
He was chest pain free and remained hemodynamically stable without significant ectopy or arrythmias on telemetry.
ECHO showed LVEF of 30% with significant WMA in the LAD distribution.
He was also discharged with warfarin and lovenox twice daily as a bridge to prevent mural thrombus from forming given his low LVEF on echo.
# Hypertension: Stable.
# Hyperlipidemia: Undermanaged with a total cholesterol of 211 and an LDL of 129.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -He will need close follow-up of his INR and his lovenox bridging can be discontinued once therapeutic for an adequate amount of time -He will need tighter control of his HLD and DM to prevent further myocardial events -He cannot interrupt taking aspirin or plavix as he may risk another MI or in-stent restenosis  Medications on Admission: 1.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: ST elevation myocardial infarction Left ventricular aneurysm .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES Hypertension Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were in the hospital because you had a heart attack.
Because a large part of your heart is not pumping properly you will need to take blood thinning medications to prevent a clot from forming in your heart and causing a stroke.
We suggested that you stay in the hospital for a couple more days to prevent complications from your heart attack.
