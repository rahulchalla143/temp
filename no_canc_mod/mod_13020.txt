Central line placement   History of Present Illness: 082 y/o F w/Sjogren's syndrome s/p numerous prolonged hospitalizations at [**Hospital1 18**] earlier this year for GI bleed, pelvic abscess, complicated by hemoptysis, resp failure req trach, CDiff, adrenal insufficiency, anemia, ARF requiring HD, DVT, acute proliferative glomerulonephritis, transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**2177-5-12**] for further management.
Had a very long vent wean at [**Hospital1 **] but was doing well until 2 days ago, developed resp distress requiring increased ventilatory support, increasing secretions from trach, weight increased approx 10 pounds over 2 weeks and increased FiO2 requirement overnight.
CXR at [**Hospital1 **] showed RLL infiltrate vs atelectasis.
Her FiO2 requirement increased from 40% to 100%, and her ABG on the Fio2 of 100 was 7.34/45/102.
In the ED, she was afebrile (98.8) and hemodynamically stable (bp 140s, tachy in 100s).
She was noted to have acute renal failure at 1.8 (but 2.0 at [**Hospital1 **]), and was hyperkalemic at 6.3.
Respiratory failure: had large pleural effusions and bilateral pneumothoraces, s/p chest tube placement, s/p talc pleurodesis.
R popliteal DVT [**1-4**], rx with heparin gtt and coumadin for approx one month (stopped [**2-5**] when admitted with GI bleed) 5.
GI bleed adm early [**2-5**]: gastritis, esophagitis on EGD, proctitis with erythema and small ulcers, diverticulosis on colonoscopy.
Readmitted with GI bleed later that month, underwent left colectomy, appy, colorectal anastomosis, and gastrostomy.
Elevated LFTs during hospitalization, unclr etiology s/p extensive w/u 10.
Adrenal insufficiency 13.
Cryoglobulinemia 15.
Peripheral neuropathy 16.
Never married, has no children.
Family History: Positive for gastric cancer in father, otherwise negative.
No autoimmune disease.
Physical [**Month/Day (3) **]: T: 98.8  BP: 148/102  P:  105 Vent settings: AC  400 x 15 (breathing 25) FiO2 70% PEEP 5, PS 17, O2 sat 100% Gen: ill-appearing female, with tremor in upper ext and tongue, opens eyes to voice, responds to questions appropriately HEENT:  normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric, perrl, mouth open with dry mucous membranes Neck: trach collar in place, difficult to assess JVD, no cervical LAD Lungs: coarse rhonchi throughout, worst at left base, decreased breath sounds at right base CV: regular rhythm, tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Abd: mildly distended, tenderness to deep palpation in bilateral lower quadrants without rebound or guarding, +bs.
Ext: dressings in place over bilateral lower extremities, 2+ pitting LE edema Skin: innumerable areas of skin breakdown throughout, per nsg notes has stage II sacral decub.
no erythema or purulent drainage at catheter site.
Resp failure:  The etiology of this was felt to be a combination of pseudomonal pneumonia plus pulmonary edema.
She also had a pleural effusion that was very small (history of talc pleurodesis due to pleural effusion).
An ultrasound was done to evaluate the effusion but it appeared to be too small to tap.
She remained afebrile and her leukocytosis improved.
Her creatinine was elevated on admission but trended down to 1.1 by discharge.
This was felt to be due to intravascular volume depletion.
Her ACEi was held given her elevated creatinine.
Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: She has a history of chronic anemia and required numerous transfusions as well as epo during her prior hospitalizations.
She also has a hx of GI bleed but was guaiac negative while here.
Her thrombocytopenia has been worked up extensively in the past and was felt to be due to Cytoxan (numerous negative HIT antibodies).
Hyperkalemia:  Likely due to renal failure plus ACEi.
No ECG changes.
ECG changes:  Most likely demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia and sepsis, with new lateral TWI's.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have some beta-blocker withdrawal as it has been held at [**Hospital1 **] given her sepsis.
Beta-blocker was restarted with no adverse effects.
In terms of her elevated phosphate on d/c, the etiology of this was unclear but she has a history of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - pseudomonas pneumonia - pleural effusion - line infection Secondary: - bacteremia - hypertension - anemia - PEG leakage - renal failure - Sjogren's syndrome - CHF - thrombocytopenia - adrenal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: stable, on ventilator, to complete outpt course of antibioitcs, discharged to rehab for further vent weaning and management  Discharge Instructions: 1.
Seek immediate medical attention for fevers, chills, respiratory distress or worsening hypoxia, mental status changes or other concerning changes.
