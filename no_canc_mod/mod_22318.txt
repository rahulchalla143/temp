He woke up this morning with acute shortness of breath requiring tripod positioning.
EMS wa called, and he was intubate en route to the ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
On arrival, he was hypertensive, requiring a nitro gtt that bottomed out his pressures.
He was then started on a dopamine gtt, and right SC central line placement was complicated by arterial stick.
He became tachycardic to the 130's on dopamine, and he was changed to levophed for pressure support.

CAD: He has a history of severe 3vd, s/p CABG with recent catheterization showing patent grafts with totally occluded native vessels.
It is possible that his salty dietary indiscretions caused an increase in SBP leading to a ?new ischemic event leading to flash pulmonary edema.
He was continued on his outpatient regimen of Coreg, Lisinopril, and Imdur (Imdur at decreased dose of 60 mg daily secondary to low systolic blood pressures).
He never had any symptoms of chest pain or anginal equivalents.
CHF: He has a known ischemic cardiomyopathy with systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
Bedside TTE on admission showed EF=20% with 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] likely had flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension.
Rhythm: He was tachycardic on admission after dopamine (SVT), and he then had episodes of ?ventricular tachycardia.
His AICD (biventricular, atrial sensing with ventricular pacing) was interrogated by electrophysiology who believed that the device interpreted the SVT as possible v-tach, fired which caused actual ventricular tachycardia.
He was continued on his amiodarone and had no further events on telemetry.
Hypotension: He was likely in cardiogenic shock on admission and was started on dopamine, changed to levophed (tachycardia in response to dopamine).
Pt declined Swan, and his blood pressure improved when his tachycardia resolved.
Respiratory: He was intubated in the field for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to decreased gas exchange from pulmonary edema.
Leukocytosis: likely was a reaction to ischemia, but cultures were checked to rule out infectious etiologies.
All cultures were negative (urine, blood, sputum), and chest X-ray was without signs of infiltrate or focal process.
He was afebrile with a normal white count at time of discharge.
Anemia: He had a small hematocrit drop in the setting of some IVF, hematoma [**2-4**] a line, and guaiac positive stools (blood initially aspirated from NGT).
Serial CXR's were checked to rule out hemothorax given arterial stick when subclavian line was attempted.
He had some blood on top of stools attributed to his hemorrhoids.
