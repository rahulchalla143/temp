STRESS MIBI [**3-19**]: INTERPRETATION: This was a 45 year old DM2 woman with PVD, HTN and HLD who was referred to the lab from the ED after negative serial cardiac enzymes for an evaluation of chest discomfort.
She complained of mid-sternal chest pressure and nausea immediate post Persantine infusion, which was relieved with the administration of 125mg IV  Aminophylline.
There were no changes in ST segments or T waves noted during the infusion or in recovery.
IMPRESSION: No ischemic ECG changes.

The RCA was tortuous with diffuse disease.
There was a 40% proximal lesion and a 40% mid lesion.
There was a 95% mid to distal lesion.

She underwent PTCA [**3-20**] which revealed diffuse RCA disease with 95% mid-distal lesion.
She remained chest pain free but had ongoing chronic right shoulder pain.
Unstable angina: Patient had chest pain and pressure for 5 days at home that was partially relieved by her boyfriend's nitroglycerin.
On presentation, she had normal cardiac enzymes and no ecg changes.
Stress MIBI showed new partially reversible inferior wall mild perfusion defect.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her [**Last Name (STitle) 1106**] surgeon, as this was a limited tibial vein DVT, can stop coumadin now that she is on aspirin and plavix and patient would have increased risk of bleeding.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound also showed no DVT.
Shoulder pain: Patient is followed by rehabilitative services for chronic right shoulder pain.
Patient was treated for this pain with oral opioid analgesics and was discharged on home vicodin.
PVD: Patient takes cilostazol at home, which was held in the setting of dissection and 2 other antiplatelet agents: plavix and aspirin.
Per patient's [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], this should be restarted later, as it does not add additional bleeding risk.
OSA:  Patient was noted to snore and have oxygen desaturations overnight on the floor.
