Admission Date:  [**2190-12-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2190-12-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2141-1-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50 year-old male with a past medical history of hypercholesterolemia and borderline hypertension never treated with medication who presented to an outside hospital in Exedur, [**Location (un) 3844**] complaining of severe back pain, chest pain, nausea and vomiting.
The patient was found to have an elevated blood pressure of 200/100 and inconclusive chest x-ray with a questionable widened mediastinum.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation and for possible aortic dissection.
A CAT confirmed the presence of a thoracic aortic dissection.
An MRA was also performed, which showed the aortic dissection starting just distal to the left subclavian and extending down to the bilateral iliacs.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
CTA showed thoracic aortic dissection from take off of left subclavian to the both common iliac arteries, avulsed origin of the ciliac SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
TE was performed and showed no involvement of the ascending aorta and a aortic dissection in the descending aorta.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 50 year-old male found to have a thoracic aortic dissection with wide involvement and hypertension with systolic blood pressure in the 200s.
The patient had a fenestration performed by Vascular surgery.
The vascular surgery team felt that the elevated lactate was secondary to mesenteric ischemia.
The patient did not require surgery for his aortic dissection nor a step for his aortic dissection.
Due to his abnormal blood gas the patient was hyperventilated to rectify his blood pH.
The patient was able to be extubated two days after intubation with some initial confusion, which gradually cleared to a normal mental status.
Abdomen:  There was a concern for mesenteric ischemia from the beginning due to the elevated white blood cell count and the elevated lactic acid.
The patient had a esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed by the gastrointestinal team while he was intubated, which showed multiple stress ulcers in the stomach as well as the duodenum, which was consistent with his heme positive stools and gradually falling hematocrit.
The patient had laboratories drawn serially for electrolytes and initially had a high potassium, which corrected into the normal range.
Overall, the patient was able to tolerate his fenestration, his extubation and his low hematocrit and transfusion quite well and was able to walk with physical therapy, eat a full diet and have normotensive pressures by the day of discharge.
