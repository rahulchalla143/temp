The patient first noticed a pulsatile abdominal mass 1-2 months ago and feels it has gradually been growing.
He denies any associated pain or other symptoms related to this.
Today while working in his home he experienced 2 bouts of dull chest pain radiating to both armpits and his jaw.
These episodes lasted approximately 20 minutes, were associated with dizziness and resolved after 10-15 minutes of rest.

**FINAL REPORT [**2170-6-29**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2170-6-29**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Wet Read: WWM TUE [**2170-6-26**] 5:37 PM 8.2cm OD (4.3 cm ID) infrarenal AAA spanning from renal aa to bifurcation with fistula to L renal vein (3:144) [d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21134**] at 5:30p] incidentals: tiny layering gallstones, no cholescystsitis; emphysema; liver cysts; adrenal hyperplasia   Final Report HISTORY: 73-year-old male with AAA.
FINDINGS:  CHEST: There is no axillary, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Diffuse emphysematous changes are noted throughout the lungs.
A metallic density just inferior to the left main stem bronchus may represent prior surgical intervention.
The aorta demonstrates no evidence of intramural hematoma or dissection.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
These are most consistent with cysts.
Multiple small hypodensities are seen in the right lobe of liver, many of which are too small to characterize but likely represent cysts.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is seen.
Densities layering within the gallbladder are most consistent with cholelithiasis, although no pericholecystic fluid or wall edema is seen.
The small and large intestine show no evidence of obstruction or wall thickening, enhances normally.
No lymphadenopathy is seen.
No free air or free fluid is noted.
CTA: Just below the takeoff of the renal arteries, there is a fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm that extends down to the iliac bifurcation, but does not extend into the iliac vessels.
The height of the aortic aneurysm is approximately 154 mm from the renal artery takeoff to the iliac bifurcation.
In series 3, images 143 and 144, there is erosion of the aortic aneurysm into the left renal vein, signifying an arteriovenous fistula.
This leak of the abdominal aortic aneurysm appears to be contained within the venous system and no  retroperitoneal contrast collections are noted.
The celiac, SMA, renal, and iliac arteries opacify normally, although with the diversion of flow from the high pressure aortic system to the low-pressure venous system, decreased flow to the mesenteric and lower extremity circulations resulting in underlying ischemia cannot be ruled out.
BONES: There is a left total hip arthroplasty that shows no evidence of failure or loosening.
Degenerative changes are seen in the right hip in the form of subchondral sclerosis and subchondral cysts.
Degenerative changes are seen in the lumbar spine with grade 1 retrolisthesis of L5 on S1.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
Fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm extending from the renal artery takeoff to the iliac bifurcation; the aneurysm has eroded into the left renal vein creating arteriovenous fistula between the aorta and left renal vein.
No extravascular contrast leak is seen.
Diffuse emphysematous changes with numerous spiculated 4-mm pulmonary nodules; while the number of nodules is reassuring, the possibility of malignancy cannot be excluded and so a 6- to 12-month followup chest CT is recommended.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis  4.
Hepatic and renal cysts.
Upon arival a CT scan was done showing fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm extending from the renal artery takeoff to the iliac bifurcation; the aneurysm has eroded into the left renal vein creating arteriovenous fistula between the aorta and left renal vein.
No extravascular contrast leak is seen.
He was taken to the OR that afternoon where he underwent: Repair of ruptured juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a retroperitoneal approach and a 16 mm x 8 mm bifurcated Dacron graft.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was volume overloaded post operatively and was diuresed agressively with IV  lasix.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Ruptured juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and aortovenous fistula.
Discharge Instructions: Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Discharge Instructions  What to expect when you go home: 1.
It is normal to have incisional and leg swelling: ??????
Avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting without your legs elevated  3.
Eat small frequent meals ??????
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing over the area that is draining, as needed ??????
A sudden increase in pain that is not controlled with pain medication ??????
Bleeding from incision ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions  MEDICATIONS: You have been started on aspirin and metoprolol (for blood pressure/ heart rate control.
You will be on lasix and potassium for 1 week to help with fluid retention.
You have been given a prescription for oxycodone, which is a narcotic pain medication.
The statin medication is beneficial in people with a history of aortic aneurysm, and should be started at a low dose, even if your cholesterol is normal.
