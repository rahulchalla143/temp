Admission Date:  [**2109-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2030-12-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Atenolol / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4071**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: This is a 78 year-old male with PMH significant for AS, pafib, and COPD who presented to OSH with wheezing, cough and changes in mental status.
He was transfered from [**Hospital6 28728**] Center for evaluation and management of his tracheomalacia on [**8-16**].
The patient had an episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure on his initial day of admission to the OSH requiring BiPAP.
He also had an elevated ddimer at that time, 1.06 (range of 0-0.49).
Ruled out for PE and pneumonia.
Was treated for COPD exaccerbation at [**Location (un) 1121**].
It was believed his respiratory failure was multifactorial from TBM, AS, COPD, CHF, poor lung reserve.
While on the floor, he had flash pulmonary edema in setting of SBPs in 200s and was transferred to the SICU.
Past Medical History: - CAD, LAD-DES in [**2104**], subsequent cath in [**2105**] showing patent stent - PVD with claudication - Chronic diastolic heart failure, last EF >55% - Type II DM - COPD - CKD - Pafib, not anticoagulated prior  Social History: married, lives with wife.
[**Name (NI) **] etoh, tobacco or drug use  Family History: noncontributroy  Physical Exam: VS - T 96.6, BP 117/62, P P81, R 22, 99% on 1L Gen - in bed, sitting up [**Location (un) 1131**] a book, NAD HEENT - ATNC, EOMI, supple neck, no JVD noted, no bruits, no lymphadenopahty CV - 2/6 systolic murmur, regular rate, no rubs or gallops Lungs - coarse rhonchi throughout with diffuse expiratory wheezes Abd - soft, NT, ND, no hsm or masses, normoactive BS Ext - warm, no edema Neuro - CN intact, no focal deficits, moving all 4 limbs  Pertinent Results: CT Trachea: Multiple respiratory movements limit the evaluation of the lung parenchyma.
Mild centrilobular emphysema is mostly in upper lobes.
2-mm right upper lobe lung nodules are present (4:106 and 5:109).
Right upper lobe subpleural ill- defined opacity is present.
There is no significant collapse of the trachea, accounting for a suboptimal study.
Bilateral bronchial wall thickening is more prominent in both lower lobes.
Left fissural thickening is present and associated with lingular and bibasilar atelectasis.
Bilateral pleural effusion are small.
Right pulmonary artery enlargement up to 29 mm suggests pulmonary hypertension.
Severe calcifications of the aortic valve are present.
Multiple calcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes are present but not enlarged using CT criteria.
Incidentally, lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum is present.
Bones are normal except to note old left seventh and eighth rib fracture.
Suboptimal study with multiple respiratory movements.
Mild centrilobular emphysema.
Diffuse bronchial wall thickening, more prominent in lower lobes suggests peribronchial inflammation.
Small bilateral pleural effusion.
Left fissural thickening with lingular and dependent atelectasis.
Severe calcifications of the aortic valve are of unknown hemodynamic significance.
Multiple calcified mediastinal and bihilar lymph nodes suggest prior granulomatous disease.
Coronary artery calcifications and stent, aortic calcifications, and mitral annulus calcifications.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed non-obstructive and branch vessel disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LCx had a 60% lesion in the mid-vessel.
The RCA had a 30% stenosis in the mid-vessel.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left heart pressures with a mean RA of 9mmHg and mean PCWP of 13mmHg.
There was mild systemic arterial hypertension with a central aortic systolic pressure of 144mmHg.
There was moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 36mmHg and a calculated valve area of 0.94cm2.
Coronary arteries revealed non-obstructive disease.
Moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.94cm2.
Mildly elevated right and left heart filling pressures.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>70%).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Calcified lymph nodes are present in the mediastinal and hilar regions.
Lungs are grossly clear except for focal linear scar in the periphery of the left mid lung.
Focal opacity overlying lower spine on lateral view appears to correspond to a large lateral osteophyte on recent CT of [**2109-8-19**].
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o M with hx of CAD, COPD, CHF, AS, bronchotracheomalacia who was transferred from outside hospital for workup of BTM, but then had acute pulmonary edema before bronch was able to be done.
Acute diastolic heart failure results in acute pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension.
He did not require intubation, but was in severe respiratory distress.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] (the cardiology service) for workup of flash pulmonary edema.
Had cath [**8-22**] showing non obstructive CAD and mod-severe AS.
It was thought that medical management of hypertension would be required to prevent future acute decompensation.
Patient has had well controlled BPs since transfer, increased losartan on with goal of SBPs in 110s.
For COPD exaccerbation that likely contributed to respiratory distress, he was started on high dose steroids that are to be tapered over the next two weeks after discharge.
He does have a history of MRSA in his sputum from prior hospitalizations at an OSH, but MRSA screen was negative x2 here.
Will also complete a steroid taper, and continue his home inhalers of advair and spiriva, as well as albuterol nebs as needed.
Patient did have increasing leukocytosis, probably due to steroids, but might have an infection.
Patient has a hx of afib and should be anticoagulated.

You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to have a bronchoscopy, but while you were waiting for the procedure, you had an episode of flash pulmonary edema.
You heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, and COPD all contributed to your difficulty breathing.
When your blood pressure is controlled, you are able to continue to breath well without problems.
There were no major finds to suggest a specific cause for your flash pulmonary edema, and surgery would not be a good idea at this time.
Please return to the hospital with any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, fevers, chills or any other worries.
You are to follow up in about 2 weeks with the interventional pulmonologists to have a bronchoscopy.
