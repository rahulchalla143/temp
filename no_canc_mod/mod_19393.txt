Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals 101.4/100.1 HR 86 BP 128/64 RR 17 SAT 96/RA NAD, Ecchymoses NEURO Arouses to voice, GCS 8, (+)Gag/cough, (+)commands and purposeful movement CV RRR, no m/r/g PULM Coarse BS Bilat ABD (+)BS, Soft, NT, ND Ext Warm and well perfused  Pertinent Results: CT HEAD [**1-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No new hemorrhage.
2) Resolution of left lenticular extra-axial hematoma.
4)  Dense material within sphenoidal sinus may represent blood or inspissated mucus.
CT HEAD [**1-1**]: IMPRESSION:  1.3 cm diameter new focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe posteriorly in an otherwise essentially unchanged Head CT demonstrating subdural, subarachnoid, intraventricular, and intraparenchymal and epidural hemorrhage.
Large left parietooccipital parenchymal hematoma with surrounding edema and small pneumocephalus.
Contre-coup contusion of the right frontal lobe and right temporal pole.
Thin layering subdural hematoma on the left and possibly also on the right.
Bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Left occipital subgaleal hematoma with subcutaneous gas, laterally.
Left parietal bone fracture that extends to involve the occipital and temporal bones.
The temporal bone fracture extends through the middle ear cavity, mastoid air cells and the bony plate of the external auditory canal.
Well-defined hypodensity of the left occipital pole, most likely represents established encephalomalacia, secondary to prior infarction (concordant with the vague h/o "stroke," though in unknown distribution.
Less likely, this may represent acute infarction secondary to injury to the transverse venous sinus, given the fracture component and ill-defined hemorrhage in this region.
[**12-31**] CT C-SPINE: IMPRESSION:  No acute fracture or malalignment in the cervical spine.
[**12-31**] CT PELVIS: IMPRESSION:  Nondisplaced fracture of the right L4 transverse process, otherwise no acute traumatic injury in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
The patient's neuro exam improved somewhat with purposeful movements and spontaneous eye opening, no following of commands, with positive gag and cough.
[**1-2**] There was no change in the pt's neuro exam.
Family notified of poor overall prognosis by Neurosurgery.
