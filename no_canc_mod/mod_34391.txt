There is no pericardial effusion.
ECG [**6-2**] Sinus rhythm with atrial sensed and ventricular paced Since previous tracing of [**2174-5-31**], trate slower and atrial pacing not seen   .
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.
Linear atelectasis is noted within the left lung base.
Small left pleural effusion is visualized.

Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.
Etiology initially throught to be from atenolol and slight worsening renal function, but HR did not improve with washout.
The team also considered ischemic etiologies (accounts for 40% cases of AV block) but cardiac biomarkers were flat and no ischemic changes on EKG.
CXR showed proper lead placement and no PTX.
EKG without ischemic changes.
Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
Initially held ACE in setting of renal dysfunction but restarted on HD #2, increased to 40 mg because of high blood pressures.
Likely due to poor forward flow from decreased CO due to bradycardia.
