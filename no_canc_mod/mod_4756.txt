Admission Date:  [**2103-7-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2103-7-26**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 78 year old female with a past medical history significant for obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, chronic hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, who presented with worsening shortness of breath and decreased oxygen saturation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old woman with a history of long-standing obstructive sleep apnea and subsequent pulmonary hypertension.
Two days prior to admission, the patient reported experiencing gradual worsening shortness of breath.
She denied any chest pain at the time of Emergency Department presentation.
She denied any [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] fever or chills.
She denied any nausea or vomiting.
There was no abdominal pain.
She denied any urinary symptoms, and she denied any symptoms of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The patient was placed on full face mask BIPAP and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of her respiratory status.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Chronic hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery catheterization in [**2097-10-18**], which showed clean coronary arteries.
Status post inferior myocardial infarction approximately fifteen years ago.
Chronic anemia thought to be due to Vitamin B12 deficiency.
She had no history of tobacco use and no history of exposure to asbestos or known industrial agents.
Her skin examination was notable for pallor but no cyanosis.
Examination of the jugular venous distention revealed jugular venous pulse of 9.0 centimeters.
Her chest examination showed diffusely decreased breath sounds, decreased more so on the left side than on the right side, however, there were no wheezes or crackles noted.
Her cardiac examination revealed a bradycardic heart rate but at a regular rhythm with a harsh IV/VI systolic murmur heard across the precordium, an occasional S3 but no rubs.
There was no costovertebral angle tenderness.
There was 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.
She was also noted to have bilateral calf tenderness.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 beats per minute with some right axis deviation and right bundle branch block which was unchanged from previous electrocardiogram provided from outside hospital.
A chest x-ray showed opacification at the right mediastinal border and prominent pulmonary vasculature but no focal consolidation.
The patient was given a single dose of Levofloxacin in the Emergency Department to treat for community acquired pneumonia.
She was also given intravenous Solu-Medrol to treat for any underlying bronchospastic component contributing to her pulmonary decompensation.
On the evening of admission, ultrasound studies of the lower extremities were performed and revealed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
Further antibiotics were held at this time as the patient was afebrile and did not have an elevated white blood cell count and there was low clinical suspicion for pneumonia.
She subsequently ruled out for myocardial infarction via cardiac enzymes.
On [**2103-7-25**], hospital day two, an echocardiogram was obtained in order to assess the possible role of diastolic congestive heart failure contributing to pulmonary edema and the patient's shortness of breath.
The patient was noted to be profoundly cyanotic and also began to report left sided chest pain.
An electrocardiogram was obtained and showed no changes suggestive of acute ischemia.
Stat portable chest x-ray also showed no acute change from prior chest x-rays.
The echocardiogram ultimately showed an ejection fraction greater than 55%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There was an overall decrease in right heart function and there was severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Although previously obtained lower extremity ultrasounds had revealed no deep vein thrombosis, we continued to entertain the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
Therefore, we had been unable to send the patient for a CT angiogram study to prove the presence of pulmonary embolism.
Her Levofloxacin was also restarted to treat for a presumptive pneumonia.
This same day an initial blood culture taken in the Emergency Department returned positive for gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters in one out of two bottles and the patient was begun on Vancomycin.
The patient subsequently remained stable from a respiratory standpoint but was noted to have intermittent bradycardia with heart rates in the 30 or 40s which were transient and were not associated with any hypotension.
On the morning of [**2103-7-26**], the patient was restarted on Solu-Medrol to treat for any possible underlying component of bronchospastic disease and the decision was made to obtain a bedside abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the question of a pleural effusion at the right lung base seen on serial chest x-rays.
However, before the ultrasound could be obtained, the patient experienced another desaturation event early in the afternoon on [**2103-7-26**].
This was accompanied by bradycardia and eventually cardiopulmonary arrest and the patient ultimately succumbed and was declared deceased on the afternoon of [**2103-7-26**].
