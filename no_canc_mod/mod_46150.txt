RESPIRATORY:  The infant continues to be stable in room air and has had no apneic spells.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  She continues to have a Grade II/VI ejection systolic murmur.
An echocardiogram performed on [**2144-7-30**], reveals no evidence of a ventricular septal defect or PFO, however, the origin of the left coronary artery appeared to be abnormal arising from the very posterior aspect of the left coronary cusp, directly adjacent to the left non-commissure, however, the images were quite difficult due to the patient's size and marked tachycardia.
From the current data available, it was felt that the patient's well being at the present time would not be adversely impacted by the coronary abnormality, however, in children who are teenagers who die of sudden death, tended to have an increased frequency of coronary artery anomalies.
However, the Cardiology Team felt that her overall risk of sudden cardiac death was still low.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  She had no further Infectious Disease issues.
Immunizations recommended:  Synagis RSV Prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 5298**] through [**Month (only) **] for infants that meet any of the three criteria:  1) Born at less than 32 weeks; 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for day care during RSV season, with a smoker in the household, or with preschool siblings or 3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
