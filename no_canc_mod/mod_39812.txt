At that time, he developed a severe non-productive cough with intermittent SOB.
With his cough, he developed left-sided flank/chest pain, which he attributes to musculoskeletal pain from constant coughing.
A CTA was negative for PE but showed a large pericardial effusion; a CXR showed bilateral pleural effusion and cardiomegaly.
He has a dry cough and left sided-CP.
Family History: Mother had rheumatic heart disease.
Physical Exam: VS - T 99.6 BP 128/76 HR 84 RR 32 02sat 97 on 4L Fs 92 pulsus 10 Gen: pleasant overweight M, slight SOB with speaking, paroxysmal dry cough.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
CV: RRR, no murmurs, no rub.
Chest: decreased BS at bases, no crackles.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Unchanged from previous ([**3-28**]) except slightly decreased voltage in inferior leads ?
The exercise was stopped due to fatigue.
No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported during the procedure.
No significant ST segment changes were noted.
The rhythm was sinus with rare isolated aea noted.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes.
CTA ([**2191-11-25**]): No pulmonary embolism.
Large pericardial effusion with bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
CXR ([**2191-11-25**]): TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Cardiomegaly has increased, and is now associated with small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Increase in cardiomegaly; bilateral small pleural effusion.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%) with anteroseptal/anterior/apical hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion that is smaller adjacent to the right heart.
Additional views reveal right ventricular outflow diastolic collapse.
Initial hemodynamics revealed evidence of pericardial tamponade, with increased right sided filling pressures with mean RA pressure 18 mm Hg.
There was also elevated left sided filling pressure with PCWP mean of 22 mm Hg.
An Echocardiogram revealed minimal residual pericardial fluid with normal RA and RV diastolic wall motion.
Echo [**2191-11-30**]: There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the anterior septum.
There is abnormal septal motion suggestive of pericardial constriction.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Pericardial fluid cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pleural fluid cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo gentleman with h/o CAD, HTN, DMII presents with weight gain, cough, and moderate pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
# Pericardial effusion: On admission, patient had elevated JVP and distant heart sounds with a pulsus of 10.
Echocardiogram was significant for tamponade physiology.
Work-up for the cause of the patient's pericardial effusion was significant for CRP of 125.
Thyroid studies revealed subclinical hypothyroidism.
PPD was placed and was negative, although the patient did have close contact with his grandfather, who died of tuberculosis.
Cytology was negative for malignancy.
# Pleural effusions: Patient had b/l pleural effusions, left > right.
Cytology was negative for malignancy.
Pulmonary was consulted; the etiology of the patient's pericardial and pleural effusions remained unclear at the time of diagnosis.
He will have a CT of the chest and follow-up with pulmonary in [**3-27**] weeks to monitor him for reaccumulation of his pericardial and pleural effusions.
# AFib with RVR: Patient had no prior h/o of Atrial fibrillation.
He had several asymptomatic episodes of AFib with rate in the 130s to 140s.
# Chest Pain: Patient's chest pain was felt to be musculoskeletal from coughing, although it could also represent pericarditis.
His cough and chest pain prior to discharge.
He was advised to take ibuprofen 400-600mg TID prn pain if his chest pain should recur.
# HTN: As discussed above, patient's home dose of metoprolol was increased to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for control of his increased rate with AFib.
# Subclinical hypothyroidism: Diagnosed by labs during work-up for pericardial effusion.
Ibuprofen 200 mg Tablet Sig: 2-3 Tablets PO three times a day as needed for pain for 2 weeks: Please take with food.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion with tamponade Secondary Diagnoses:  Pleural effusions, Coronary artery disease, Hypertension, Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Improved.
Patient's shortness of breath and cough were better.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a pericardial effusion, which is fluid around the heart.
You also had some fluid outside of your lungs; this fluid was drained as well.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptom.
- Ibuprofen as needed for pain  Followup Instructions: 1.
