Admission physical exam revealed a premature, vigorous, nondysmorphic infant.
Anterior fontanel open and flat, positive bilateral red reflex.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY STATUS:  He was intubated at the time of admission for respiratory distress.
On day of life #2, he had a severe pulmonary hemorrhage and was transitioned to high frequency oscillatory ventilation.
He has a persistent oxygen requirement of 25 cc flow of 100% oxygen and this is what he is being discharged home on.
He was treated with caffeine citrate for apnea of prematurity from day of life #16 to day of life #26.
He was treated with Diuril for chronic lung disease from day of life #51 and that continues at the time of discharge.
On exam, he has a normal S1, S2 heart sound and no murmur.
GASTROINTESTINAL STATUS:  He was treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia from day of life #3 until day of life #14.
He was circumcised without complication on [**2178-6-1**].
INFECTIOUS DISEASE STATUS:  He was started on ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors.
NEUROLOGICAL STATUS:  The first week of life, a head ultrasound revealed bilateral subependymal hemorrhages and bilateral intraventricular hemorrhages.
Developed post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, treated with daily and then every other day lumbar punctures with improvement in the ventriculomegaly.
On [**2178-4-13**], his head ultrasound additionally revealed some left frontoparietal periventricular cysts.
His last head ultrasound on [**6-1**] was unchanged from previous studies, including small 2 to 3 mm cysts adjacent to the left lateral ventricle as well as stable mild lateral ventriculomegaly, left greater than right.
Prevnar (pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine)  Immunizations recommended:  Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis (Synagis) monthly between [**Month (only) 359**] and [**Month (only) 958**] for infants with chronic lung disease and/or gestation less than 32 weeks.
Influenza vaccine is also recommended for preterm infants with chronic lung disease (or for their family contacts if the infant is less than 6 months old at the start of flu season.)

Status post anemia of prematurity 9.
Status post hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity 10.
Bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage 11.
Post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus 12.
Periventricular leukomalacia 13.
