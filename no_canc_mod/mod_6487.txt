Admission Date:  [**2183-1-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-1-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 83 yo male with history of CAD, DM with significant neuropathy, HTN, CHF with EF 40-45% in [**2176**] presenting with acute dyspnea.
He also reports some sodium indiscretions including occasional bacon and corned hash.
Last night, he was awoken by the sensation of sudden severe dyspnea and tachypnea.
He was still hypoxic and tachypneic in the ED, and was therefore given another 40mg of lasix IV in the ED and was initiated on bipap.
After 30 minutes, however, he became hypotensive to the 80s/50s and thereore bipap was discontinued.
A nitro gtt was ordered but never given secondary to hypotension.
Of note, he had a recent hospitalization for acute heart failure and new onset atrial fibrillation at [**Location (un) 745**]-Wellesly ICU [**11-22**].
He was incidentally noted to have left 5th and 6th rib fractures on CXR secondary to recent fall.
He was given labetolol for RVR rate control but became hypotensive and given dopamine.
On arrival to the MICU, he denied complaints but felt cold.

Left posterior rib fractures are again visualized.
Possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes.
Cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-1-23**] irregular supraventricular tachycardia is present.
ST-T wave changes are more pronounced and possibly rate-related.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of all distal segments and the apex.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 30-45 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mildly reduced overall left ventricular systolic function with regional wall motion abnormalities as described above.
Elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
Mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis.
No clinically signficant valvular regurgitation.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressures.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2177-2-17**], mild to moderate aortic stenosis is new.
The overall left ventricular systolic function is similar although additional new wall motion abnormalities cannot be excluded given suboptimal image quality.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo male with history of CAD, DM with significant neuropathy, HTN, CHF with EF 40-45% in [**2176**] who presented to the ED on [**2183-1-23**] with acute dyspnea in the setting of recent discontinuation of lasix and dietary indiscretions.
#) Dyspnea: Most likely secondary to acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure secondary to 1 month of lasix nonadherance from a misunderstanding of PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 10700**].
#) The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by supraventricular tachycardia.
His SVT was likely related to missing several doses of metoprolol as well as volume shifts with diuresis in the setting of an abnormal LA.
After his SVT resolved the patient remained in sinus rhythm without event.
Of note, he did receive a new diagnosis of AFib from [**Hospital3 **] but is not on coumadin due to many recent falls.
8. oxazepam 10 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for Insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath.
You also had a fast, difficult to control heart rate likely related to volume shifts in the setting of heart failure and not receiving your regular medications (metoprolol) while in the ED and initially in the MICU.
