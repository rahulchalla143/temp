Cardiac catheterization took place on [**2-2**] prior to admission which showed a heavily calcified aortic valve that could not be crossed with guide wires.
The patient also had severe biventricular diastolic function as well as depressed cardiac output.
He echocardiogram on [**2195-12-16**] showed a calcific aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.6 cm2 with a peak gradient of 60.
The patient had a depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 30%, and pulmonary hypertension, as well as moderate mitral regurgitation.
Bilateral cataract surgeries.
Aortic stenosis.
Congestive heart failure.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.
He had increased jugular venous pulsation.
He had no bruits.
He had an aortic systolic murmur and an apical systolic murmur.
No peripheral edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Cardiac catheterization on [**2-2**] showed no significant coronary artery obstruction, severe aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, and biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Preoperative electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm with atrial ectopy and a long P-R interval, as well as some ST-T wave abnormalities in multiple leads, with a question of left ventricular hypertrophy.
A preoperative chest x-ray showed a slightly enlarged heart and a small 5-mm lung nodule in the right posterior lung field.
There was no other evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  On [**2-19**], the patient underwent aortic valve replacement with a 29-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue valve as well as a supracoronary ascending aortic graft with 30-mm [**Doctor First Name **] weave by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
Aortic stenosis.
Congestive heart failure.
Status post lumbar disc operation.
Recent sinusitis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
