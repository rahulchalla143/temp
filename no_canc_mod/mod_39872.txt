Admission Date:  [**2189-4-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-4-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-7-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 22964**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization, with 2 drug eluting stents placed in the mid-left anterior descending artery.
History of Present Illness: 70 yo M with PMH of HTN, HLD and recent admission (d/c [**2189-3-7**])for syncope attributed to orthostasis without appropriate heart response secondary to medications and beta blockade who presented to ED with four days of worsening SOB, chest fullness, diaphoresis.
He reports no antecedent symptoms such as fever, chills, or recent URI.
He denied sputum production or cough at the time of admission.
Triggered on arrival for tachycardia to 154 and found to be in AF with RVR.
Developed worsening hypoxia and O2 requirement increased to 4L nc, crackles on exam, got 20iv lasix.
He was subsequently found to have TWI on his ECG on the lateral leads and he underwent ECHO to determine whether or not need needs to undergo emergent Cath.
Upon evaluation on the floor, he endorsed the history given above but became acutely short of breath and desated to the mid 80's during a rectal exam, and became cyanotic.
His HR at the time was in the 100's with an ECG that showed a NSR at 97 with [**Female First Name (un) **] lateral TWI in V3-V6.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Notable small round prostate, posterior compressable hemorrhoid.
No palpable masses.
Moderate right and small left lower lobe consolidations, consistent with pneumonia.
Medial ground-glass opacity, smooth gravity dependent intralobular septal thickening and bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with pulmonary edema.
Coronary arterial calcification.
Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system demonstrates single vessel disease.
The left anterior descending  contains a long 90% lesion in the mid-vessel.
The left main contains no angiographically apparent disease, and circumflex contains minor disease only.
The right coronary is a small non dominant vessel that is free of angiographically apparent disease.
Hemodynamics demonstrate a low cardiac output with elevated biventricular filling pressures.
Successful PTCA/stenting of mid LAD with overlapping 2.5 X 18 mm and 2.5 X 23 mm PROMUS DES, post dilated to 2.75 mm with NC balloon at high pressure.
Final angiogram showed 0% residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and normal flow.
Mild systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Successful PTCA/stenting of mid LAD with overlapping PROMUS DES.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal two-thirds of the ventricle and preservation of the basal septum and inferior walls.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve is mildly thickened (?#) with no aortic stenosis or regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD, large wrap-around LAD territory lesion, or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old male with history of alcohol abuse, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents with congestive heart failure and new onset AF with TWI and depressed systolic EF [**1-7**] mid-LAD lesion, complicated by acute onset hypoxic respiratory distress.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient was initially admitted to the general cardiology service, but was found to have an increasing oxygen requirement, prompting transfer to the CCU.
His CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema, but also had multifocal infiltrates.
He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for HCAP, but he did not develop any systemic signs or symptoms to suggest pneumonia so these were stopped.
Given his effective diuresis and uptrending creatinine with decreased oxygen requirement, further treatments were discontinued.
We had some concern over his multifocal infiltrates and paucity of symptoms pointing to PCP as [**Name Initial (PRE) **] potential diagnosis, so we decided to test him for HIV to rule out causes for immunosuppression.
We also sent a urinary streptococcal antigen that was negative.
# Depressed systolic Function/Acute systolic CHF [**1-7**] ischemia: He had globally depressed systolic function on TTE (with EF of 20-25%) and he had concerning TWIs in the anterolateral region (V3-V6) with biphasic T waves in V1 and V2.
He was taken for cardiac catheterization, which showed a 90% mid-LAD lesion and 2 drug-eluting stents were placed.
Though this culprit lesion is a good reason for the depressed EF and pulmonary edema, there is also concern for a depressed systolic function from alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy in the long-term from heavy EtOH use.
Due to the apical akinesis on his ECHO he was started on anti-coagulation with Warfarin.
# HTN: After diuresis he was noted to have systolic blood pressures in the 130's-140's with diastolic blood pressures in the 90's.
Given his CAD, he was started on metoprolol in addition to after load reduction with Acei.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: He had a mild bump in his CR while he was hospitalized and diuresed prior to discharge his Cr was 1.1. .
# Anemia: He had a mild drop in his HgB while on heparin, and his HgB prior to discharge was 13.2.
# Afib with RVR: He was found to have Afib with RVR when he was admitted to the hospital the resolved after he was admitted for an acute systolic heart failure exacerbation in the setting of a Left dominant LAD lesion.
He had 1-2 episodes of SVT on Tele when he was admitted, but they were asymptomatic and he was HD throughout.

You were admitted with shortness of breath, due to fluid build up in your lung.
We believe that this was due to a decrease in your heart function from a blockage in one your coronary arteries.
We gave you medications to help get this fluid out of your lungs and your shortness of breath improved markedly.
