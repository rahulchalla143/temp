A small amount of subdural blood remains along the medial surface of the right frontal lobe, next to the falx.
The large right subdural collection is almost entirely removed.
There is a small focal hemorrhage evident in the lateral aspect of the right temporal lobe, which is probably a contusion.
There remains slight medial displacement of the right uncus, but the configuration of the suprasellar cistern is almost normal.
The left lateral ventricle may be slightly widened, but is no longer dilated as it was on the earlier study.
The right lateral ventricle remains somewhat flattened and there is still moderate impression on the right cerebrum and mild displacement of midline structures to the left.
There is a persistent right frontal and interhemispheric subdural hematoma, subacute in appearance.
There is no evidence of mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Postoperative changes are noted at the craniotomy bed.
A 1.5 cm linear region of increased signal intensity on FLAIR and T2- weighted images is seen in the medial aspect of the right hippocampus.
This is of uncertain clinical significance, as it could be either intra-axial (e.g.
edema), or extra-axial (e.g.
There is mucosal thickening of the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
Persistent right frontal and interhemispheric subacute subdural hematoma.
FINDINGS: The major vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent with no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.

He his transferred from outside hopital via [**Location (un) **] after head CT showing large right frontotemporal subdural hemorrahage.
Patient taken to OR emergently for right craniotomy for evacuation of subdural hematoma on [**2162-4-8**] without intraoperative complications.
Patient transferred to neuro ICU for hemodynamic monitoring and close neurologic examination.
His postoperative head CT reveales almost complete evacuation of subdural hematoma, with postoperaive changes with improved midline shift.
Over the next several days there was little improvement in his neurologic exam.
