Admission Date:  [**2104-8-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-9-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**] Chief Complaint: fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R hip hemiarthroplasty  History of Present Illness: Patient is an 88 yo F with Alzheimer's dz, depression, GERD who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab following an unwitnessed fall.
The patient was lying on the ground complaining of R hip pain.
The patient was complaining of pain everywhere so CT head, neck, CXR, R knee, and hips were performed.
Imaging was significant for a R femoral head fx.
She does complain of pain to her right leg .
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6. h/o pre-syncope and falls 7.
Per daughter, has been suffering from dementia for several years, has not been able to regularly recognize daughter in past 2 years.
EKG [**2104-9-1**] 11:35 am: NSR at 78, NANI, I and aVL with new 1mm ST depressions; II with new TWF, III and aVF with 0.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations and new TWF/TWI and deeper Q waves, V2 with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions, diffuse precordial T wave flattening.
EKG [**2104-9-1**] 3:49 pm: NSR with mult PACs, limb lead ST changes resolved, still with inferior TWF/TWI, V2 with 2mm ST depressions, diffuse precordial T wave flattening unchanged.
CT Head [**8-25**]: No ICH or fracture.
No definite fracture.
CXR [**8-25**]: Mild prominence of pulm vasculature.
Small Pericardial Effusion.
CXR [**2104-9-1**]: In comparison with the study of [**8-31**], there are even lower lung volumes with bilateral atelectatic changes, especially at the left base.
The area behind the heart is difficult to evaluate and the possibility of pneumonia in this region cannot be excluded in the absence of a lateral view.
XRay Hip [**8-25**]: displaced R femoral neck fracure.
abg: [**2104-9-1**] 12:45PM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-124* pCO2-37 pH-7.36 calTCO2-22 Base XS--3  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 88 yo F with Alzheimer's dementia p/w a fall resulting in a hip fx, s/p hemiathroplasty, complicated by C. diff infection.
She was transferred to MICU w/ hypoxic respiratory failure 2' to evolving MI, CHF, and pulmonary edema.
# R hip fracture: associated w/ fall at rehab.
Unable to assess pain due to decreased mental status.
Morphine PO was given for pain and continued with code status was made CMO.
# Acute myocardial infarction.
Pt suffered an MI that was likely the cause of her tachypnea.
She ruled in with positive troponin and MBI; she had ECG changes (ST elevation in III and aVF).
Likely related to acute MI, leading to CHF and pulmonary edema.
Pt was oxygenating and ventilating well in the MICU, but had very poor mental status.
She did have a significant non-gap metabolic acidosis, could be contributing as source of increased ventilation.
She was managed for her MI as above.
Her acidosis was corrected by lactated ringers and free water boluses 400cc q4h to reduce hypercholemic acidosis.
# C.diff colitis: Likely related to peri-operative antibiotics.
She was started PO vancomycin due to her worsening mental status.
# Depressed mental status/decreased responsiveness: Pt had dementia with subacute delerium.
She waxed and waned in her mental status, which was likely delerium related to her MI and infection.
With her multiple medical problems and her progressing non-responsive mental status, her prognosis was deemed extremely poor.
She was given Morphine and Zydis PRN for agitation.
# Leukocytosis.
No antibiotics w/ change in code status to CMO.
# Hypernatremia.
Likely due to intravascular volume depletion and diuresis.
# Dementia.
Held antipsychotics given depressed mental status and change in CMO status.
# Atrial fibrillation.
Nursing reports brief episodes of tachycardia to 160s.
# Depression: CMO as above, no meds.
# FEN: NPO given poor mental status and CMO.
# Dispo:  Expired while in hospital.
