Trends: Hct: 20.5 - 22.3 - 29 - 29 Creatinine 3.2 to 3.7 by discharge CK: [**Medical Record Number 107493**] - 63 - 66 - 64 CKMB: 6 Trop: 0.08 - 0.07 - 0.09 - 0.10 - 0.11 - 0.10 A1c: 6.7 CXR: R pleural effusion, mildly increased pulmonary vasculature  .
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 year old M with CAD, CHF, polysubtance abuse and prior GI bleed presents with 3 days of melena, BRBPR, hematemesis associated with chest pain and shortness of breath.
# Hypertensive emergency: Patient came in with SBP in the 200s.
He had an EGD which showed no active bleeding but multiple AVMs.
We controlled his blood pressure and the patient did not experience any further drop in his HCT.
# Cards Vascular: The patient experienced chest pain during his stay.
His CKMB remained flat and in the setting of acute renal failure we did not believe he was undergoing ACS.
An echo done on [**10-3**] showed resting regional wall motion abnormalities include with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis and an EF of 40-45%.
# Acute renal failure:  The patient has a baseline Creatinine of 2.5-2.7.
His ARF was thought secondary to hypoperfusion/ischemia/intrinsic renal disease.
# Diabetes type II.
# Left eye vision changes: Unclear etiology.
Patient has known DMII and this may represent some microvascular disease.
[**Last Name (un) **]:*120 strips* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - GI Bleed - anemia - Chest pain - cocaine abuse - acute on chronic renal insufficiency - left vision changes Secondary: - alcohol abuse - tobacco abuse - CHF - CAD - DMII - Chronic pancreatitis - HTN - hyperlipidemia - GERD - Gout - s/p inflatable penile prosthesis   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with fatigue, shortness of breath, and a GI bleed.
You received blood products and had a GI scope which showed no evidence of active bleeding.
You also experienced some chest pain which we thought was not a heart attack.
If you experience worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or GI bleeding please return to the emergency department.
