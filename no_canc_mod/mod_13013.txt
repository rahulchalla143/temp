Admission Date:  [**2112-2-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-2-18**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 13260**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Chinese speaking lady, baseline non-verbal, non-moving, current resident of [**Location **] Health has been experiencing increasing work of breathing per her family.
Per her daughter (via translator) she has been experiencing increasing work of breathing with a low growl that is not typical.
Pt appeared uncomfortable with paroxysms of redness and difficulty breathing.
ASA given for elevated troponin.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was non-verbal and had a low growling sound when examined.
For unknown reasons, the patient had an elevated lactate to 4.0.
On telemetry, the patient was having short intervals of sinus tachycardia to 120. .
Per Family/recordS: no fevers, chills, weight loss (Actually report weight gain), vomiting, diarrhea, melena, pruritis.
+ Constipation  Past Medical History: - Hip fx after fall in [**2109**] with L hip replacement, subsequent dislocation - 3 subsequent CVAs leaving her non-verbal and with very limited function.
- G tube placement ~ [**2109**] - paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  Social History: Lives at [**Location **] Health, Chinese Speaking, non verbal at baseline.
GEN: Reacts to all exam maneuvers with low non-verbal growl.
SKIN: No rashes or skin changes noted HEENT: No JVD, neck supple, No lymphadenopathy in cervical, posterior, or supraclavicular chains noted.
without murmur appreciated.
EXTREMITIES:no peripheral edema, warm without cyanosis NEUROLOGIC: Nonverbal.
Modest non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 107 0 64 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 59978**]0 ------------------- Imaging:  CT head ([**2-16**]): IMPRESSION: Extensive hypodensity involving the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes consistent with large vascular territory infarct.
No shift of normally midline structures.
No evidence of free air or free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis.
Left superior posterior hip dislocation.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
Allowing for the limitations, there are mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, with associated bibasilar relaxation atelectasis.
Assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma is markedly limited.
Nonspecific ground-glass and consolidative opacities are likely secondary to bronchovascular crowding but infectious etiology cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.
The trachea is tortuous with a moderate right-sided buckle.
The bilateral main bronchial diameter is moderately diminished, measuring approximately 3 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left.
The descending aorta is also tortuous with vascular calcification most severe along the aortic arch.
The heart is normal in size, and without pericardial effusion.
There is coronary artery calcification.
There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is noted.
There are mild-to-moderate multilevel degenerative changes.
No evidence of aspirated object.
Tortuous trachea, with moderately diminished caliber of the bilateral main bronchi, concerning for tracheobronchomalacia.
Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Tortuous descending aorta and tortuous esophagus.
Assessment/Plan  # Tracheobronchomalacia causing wheezing: This finding was seen on CT scan.
There was concern for upper airway obstruction, but no foreign object or edema seen on ENT scope exam.
There was no PNA on CXR but she did have bilateral pleural effusions and very mild pulmonary edema.
She recieved a couple doses of broad Abx but this was stopped as low concern for PNA (no fever, leukocytosis).
She was given a couple doses of IV lasix 10mg with -1.5L diuresis total with mild improvement (note from [**Hospital1 59979**], Echo [**9-30**] showed normal LVEF 55%, no DD).
In addition, she was found to have episodes of Afib RVR while here so she may have mild dCHF leading to her effusions.
We suspect she may have had a viral syndrome leading to reactive airways in setting TBM.
There was no foriegn object in her lower airways.
She will continue nebulizers until her wheezing resolves.
Acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure: The patient was noted to have pulmonary edema, however recent echo from [**9-30**] showed no diastolic or systolic dysfunction.
The patient most likely episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR which caused fluid to be retained in her lungs.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
She was noted to have an irregular heart rate with vitals and started on diltiazem.
Another issue is that she has a h/o Afib and several strokes.
Given her poor prognosis and unlikely she can have further loss of function beyond where she is now, coumadin may not be entirely  beneficial, but will defer this to outpatient.
Surgery evaluated the G tube and thought there was no infection around it.
Surgery felt that the erythema was likely due to irritation from gastric contents.
Acute renal failure: The patient was found to have an elevated Cr to 1.4 on admission (per [**Hospital1 3278**] records her baseline Cr was 0.6).
She has a history of constipation and should be on bowel medications.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for loose stools.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for loose stools.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal Daily:PRN as needed for Constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation Q3H as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -reactive airway diseae -paroxysmal atrial fibrillation -acute renal failure -tracheobronchomalacia .
Secondary: -Cerebral vascular accident   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable Activity Status: Bedbound   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].
You had an image of your chest (CT scan) which showed fluid in your lungs and a narrow trachea and bronchi.
You were also found to have acute renal failure.
You have a history of atrial fibrillation and your heart rate increased while in the hospital.
With guidance of the medical team, it was decided to not resusitate you if your heart stopped.
Your medications have changed: -Start Prednisone -Start diltiazem -Start ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers -Start colace/senna/bisacody/miralax for constipation  Followup Instructions: You should followup with your primary care doctor in [**1-28**] weeks.
