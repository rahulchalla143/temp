Aortic tortuosity is again seen.
There are no definite pleural effusions, although evaluation for small effusions is limited withsingle frontal view.
IMPRESSION: Increased cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo W h/o RA, osteoporosis, HTN, HL, PUD, Dementia NOS, h/o BOOP/COP, duodenal ulcer who presents w/SOB, dyspnea and non radiating chest pain at ortho clinic and sent to ED at which time she was found to be hypotensive.
HYPOTENSION/REPSIRATORY DISTRESS: cxr with multifocal opacities versus pulmonary edema.
Clinically given low grade temps and leukocytosis more consistent with infection.
It is possible she had secondary adrenal insufficiency in the setting of acute illness and chronic steroid use as the cause of her low blood pressure, so she was treated with prednisone 20mg po daily and this should be tapered back to her home dose of 10mg po daily over the next 5 days.
ECHO was performed and was normal, LE ultrasound of left leg which was mildly edematous was negative for DVT.
SACRAL INSUFICCIENCY FRACTURE: Subacute, noted on MRI of the L spine and sacrum in early [**Month (only) 116**] at the [**Hospital6 **].
She was also noted to have worsening of her chronic L1 L2 fractures on that MRI.
No acute issues, no neurologic compromise.
Given delerium her pain medication regimen was switched from oxycodone to tylenol standing and tramadol standing with low dose of oxycodone prn for breakthrough.
Additionally added was calcitonin salmon nasal spray daily for one month, as this may help with the pain of spinal compression fractures (this was recommended by the geriatrics consulting team while in the hospital).
DELERIUM / DEMENTIA: history of alzheimers dementia with some slow worsening over the past 1 year, but especially over the past month or so.
Given possibility of worsening dementia precluding discharge to home she was seen by geriatrics to help with long term disposition as well as acute delerium issues- geriatric recommendations were as follows to modify the pain medicatoins and timing and dose of seroquel admission.
She still experiences occasional hallucination and confusion in the evenings, however, on the day of discharge she was alert, oriented times 4, and was able to perform days of week backwards without difficulty or error.
PULMONARY EDEMA, DEMAND ISCHEMIA, ELEVATED TROPONIN: in the setting of LVH and likely diastolic dysfunction the patient had pulmonary edema on CXR, lung sounds likely pulmonary edema but in the setting of BOOP/COP this was difficult to determine.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob, wheezing.
