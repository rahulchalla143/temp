After that she was complaining of some nausea and a mild headache, but went to sleep.
She was taken to an OSH, where a head CT showed a significant amount of blood in her right ventricle.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     3 3 3  2   1 Left      3 3 3  2   1  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin  Upon Discharge: No neurologic deficits.
Redemonstration of right intraventricular hemorrhage extending from the right ventricular body into the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] as well as into the third ventricle with asymmetry and enlargement of the right ventricular body.
Leftward shift of ventricular septum and slight increase in shift of midline structures compared to CT this am.
No flow stenotic lesions or aneurysms greater than 2 mm noted in bilateral internal carotid arteries.
A small outpouching less than 2 mm is noted within the left anterior cerebral artery, which is worrisome for a small aneurysm, although a vascular loop is more likely.
Cerebral angiogram [**2155-11-28**]: IMPRESSION: Diagnostic cerebral arteriogram was done which showed abnormal tangles of vessels arising from P2 segments of the right PCA which could represent arteriovenous malformation AVM.
Persistent right intraventricular hemorrhage with bowing of the intraventricular septum to the left, increased as described above.
Mild dilatation of the temporal horns, bilaterally, concerning for early hydrocephalus.
No interval change in moderate right lateral intraventricular hemorrhage with mild ventricular dilatation and no transependymal edema.
No parenchymal signal abnormality.
A small vascular malformation cannot be excluded and should be correlated with follow-up arteriographic findings.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 38329**] [**Known lastname **] is a 32 yo femaled admitted on [**2155-11-27**] to the Neurosurgery service for a spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage with a concern for an underlying vascular malformation.
A repeat angiogram is to be repeated in one week time to assess with a less obstructive view secondary to blood.
The amount of ventricular blood was concerning and she remained high risk for hydrocephalus.
She did have a repeat angiogram on [**12-5**] which showed abnormal vasculature although no definitive draining vein although most consistent with AVM.
The patient did continue to have a headaches but they were improving with pain medication.
The patient refused PT evaluation but was ambulating independently without difficulty.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety for 3 days.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for anxiety for 1 months.
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Capsule Sig: [**12-20**] Capsules PO every four (4) hours as needed for pain for 1 months: Do not take more than 4 grams of Tylenol in 24 hours.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 3 days: No driving while on this medication.
?Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
?Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
?Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
