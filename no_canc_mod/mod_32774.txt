Unchanged and evolved appearance to left temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and small left subdural hematoma.
No new focus of hemorrhage or shift of midline structures.
[**2112-7-25**] EEG: This is an abnormal video-EEG study due to slow theta frequency background with left posterior sharp transients.
Breech artifact was noted in the left temporal and centroparietal regions.
The slow background suggests a encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no electrographic seizures or electrographic correlate to push-button activations.
Large right rectus sheath hematoma extending into the extraperitoneal pelvis as well as the retroperitoneum.
Mild right renal collecting system dilatation related to mass effect on the right ureter from the hemorrhage.
Extensive right rectus sheath hematoma extending into the extraperitoneal pelvis and also the retroperitoneum, not significantly changed since examination one day prior performed [**2112-7-29**].
No increase in size, and no evidence of active extravasation in arterial, venous or delayed phases.
Persistent mild renal collecting system dilation secondary to mass effect of the hemorrhage on the right distal ureter.
Cholelithiasis without secondary signs of cholecystitis.
Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
Bibasilar atelectasis and cardiomegaly.
Small hiatal hernia.
Probably standard position of endotracheal tube.
Perihilar predominant, ill-defined airspace opacification suggests pulmonary edema.
Underlying infection cannot be excluded.
[**2112-7-31**] CXR: There is a new left lower lobe infiltrate which given history likely represents pneumonia.
There continues to be bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
There is also pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with fluid overload.
IMPRESSION: New left lower lobe infiltrate.
[**2112-8-1**] RIGHT LE US: No evidence of DVT  [**2112-8-2**] RIGHT ANKLE/FOOT X-RAY: No previous images.
Three views of the foot and three of the ankle show some generalized soft-tissue prominence without evidence of acute bone or joint space abnormality.
[**2112-8-3**] VIDEO SWALLOW: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presents with mild oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by mildy reduced bolus formation, swallow delay and incomplete epiglottic deflection.
Patient was noted with one episode of flash penetration before the swallow with consecutive straw sips of thin liquids which cleared spontaneously.
No deep penetration or aspiration was observed.
Recommend a PO diet of thin liquids and small bites of soft solid consistencies.
This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of level 5, mild dysphagia.
Q8 oral care.
Brief Hospital Course: SEIZURE DISORDER: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the neurosurgery service after transfer from [**Hospital1 498**] for possible new head bleed.
Repeat head CT upon admission showed no evidence of acute bleed.
On the fifth hospital day, Ms. [**Known lastname **] complained of abdominal pain prompting abdominal CT on [**2112-7-29**] that showed a large rectus sheath hematoma on the right side.
There was no active bleeding at the time of the study, making it difficult to identify the source.
A prophylactic embolization of the right inferior epigastric artery was performed as it was felt this could have been the source.
There apeared to be partial compression of the right ureter on imaging, though no further intervention was performed on the ureter since her renal function remained relatively stable.
It is unclear what caused the hemorrhage and at what point it developed.
She was noted to be on SQ insulin sliding scale upon admission, though she has no prior diagnosis of DM (confirmed with patient and PCP).
ANTICOAGULATION, MECHANICAL MITRAL VALVE: Heparin was restarted on [**2112-7-31**] since the bleed appeared to be stable by that time and she was considered to be high risk due to a mechanical mitral valve.
Goal INR is 2.5 - 3.5 for mechanical valve.
VOLUME OVERLOAD: Patient was noted to be short of breath at rest and volume overloaded on exam in the setting of multiple blood transfusions and IVF for CT contrast exposure.
CXR was consistent with volume overload.
She had a slight troponin leak in this setting, though she had no chest pain and no EKG changes concerning for AMI (i.e., no T wave or ST segment changes).
Upon transfer to the medicine service on [**2112-7-30**], her WBS was still elevated at 17 and her O2 requirement remained at 2L, though she had been afebrile.
Blood and urine cultures as well as CXR were repeated for an infection work-up.
All cultures were negative, including a stool C diff from [**2112-8-2**] (when she finally had a BM).
She was continued on vancomycin + zosyn, and her leukocystosis slowly improved to 12.8 on discharge.
RIGHT ANKLE PAIN: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have some right lower leg and ankle pain beginning [**2112-8-1**].
She had slight asymmetric swellin of the right leg.
RLE ultrasound was performed since she was considered to be at risk for DVT with her immoblization and being off anticoagulation for several days; the ultrasound was negative for DVT.
She also had difficulty bearing weight on the right foot and focal tenderness at her right lateral malleolus.
X-ray of the foot and ankle were nagtive for fracture and showed generalized soft tissue swelling.
It was recommended that her husband bring this to the rehab facility, and it is suspected that she may have some foot/ankle pain secondary to not wearing this brace in recent days.
DYSPHAGIA: The patient was followed by speech and swallow for mild dysphagia.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1970**] - [**Hospital1 1559**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: (1) Rectus sheath hematoma (2) Pneumonia (3) Seizure disorder  Secondary Diagnoses: (1) Subdural hematoma (2) Mechanical mitral valve requiring anticoagulation   Discharge Condition: Stable.
With minimal swelling of right lower leg compared to the left.
You had a bleed in your abdomen called a rectus sheath hematoma, which was treated by a procedure called "embolization" that helps block bleeding in the artery.
You were also treated for a pneumonia and for extra fluid on your lungs.
Please call the doctor or return to the emergency department if you feel short of breath, develop fevers, or feel lightheaded or dizzy.
