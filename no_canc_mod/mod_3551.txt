6 days ago he had severe [**11-10**] LLQ abdominal pain worsened with movement, bending over, going over bumps in the car and palpation but that has since resolved.
He has had intermittent BRBPR over the past week, mostly very light, but since earlier today with three episodes of large bright red blood.
He had a sigmoidoscopy performed on Friday without cause for bleeding seen, and is scheduled for colonoscopy tomorrow.
He does not report LH, CP, SOB, fevers or chills.
He did have nausea today associated with drinking the Mg Citrate very quickly but that has since resolved.
He has a history of many prior polypectomies in the past with prior colonoscopies  Upon arrival to the floor, the patient continued to have BRBPR and developed LH with standing.

Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to cecum ------------------- Colonoscopy [**2168**] Diverticulosis of the sigmoid [**Year (4 digits) 499**] Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: High fiber diet Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as needed Colonoscopy in [**5-6**] years Additional notes: The efficiency of colonoscopy in detecting lesions was discussed with the patient and it was pointed out that a small percentage of polyps and other lesions can be missed with the test.
Degree of difficulty = 2 (5 most difficult) ------- Colonoscopy [**2163**]: Polyp at distal sigmoid -------  Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: ==================================== Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 y/o M with a hx of CAD (s/p DES to LAD in [**2166**]), atrial fibrillation, diverticulosis, and massive GIB in the [**2131**], who was admitted with lower GI bleed 2 months after starting Pradaxa for AFib; likely Diverticular Bleeding  ACTIVE ISSUES: ======================= # Lower GI bleed:  Most likely diverticular bleed in setting of new dabigatran use.
The patient was initially admitted to the medical floor but was transferred to the ICU because of brisk GI bleed.
A CTA was performed while bleeding on [**7-28**] which showed descending colonic diverticulitis with active extravasation from a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery.
He had no further events but Hct trended down from baseline 44 to 26.4 at lowest and he required transfusion of 5 units of packed red cells.
A colonoscopy was performed on [**2173-7-30**] which showed only diverticulosis with no source of bleed.
After that point he stabilized without further evidence of bleeding and his HCT trended up to 35 prior to discharge.
Patient had already stopped Dabigatran several days prior to admission and it was not continued.
- Patient will follow-up with his gastroenterologist ~1week after discharge for a possible repeat colonoscopy.
If there is no evidence of further bleeding then patient may be started on anticoagulation at follow-up with his cardiologist.
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had patient had been diagnosed ~2 months prior to admission and had successful cardioversion.
He had been on sotalol for maintenance of sinus rhythm.
During the admission he went into afib with rapid ventricular response.
He converted to sinus rhythm after a single dose.
- Patient discharged on Dofetilide 500mg [**Hospital1 **] - Patient was counseled extensively on risks of QT prolongation and to avoid any medications or herbal supplements that could increase risk of torsade.
# Diverticulitis: Patient had abdominal pain on admission and CTA showed diverticulitis.
Unclear if this is related to bleed or incidental finding.
- He will continue colchicine 0.6mg daily after dicharge  CHRONIC ISSUES: ======================= # CAD (s/p DES to LAD in [**2166**]): no signs of ischemia during this admission.
If he goes back on anticoagulation then can switch back to ASA 81mg daily - continued Atorvastatin 40mg  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ============================= # Patient will follow-up with his gastroenterologist ~1week after discharge for a possible repeat colonoscopy.
If there is no evidence of further bleeding then patient may be re-started on anticoagulation if benefits are deemed to exceed the risks.
Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg PO DAILY RX *metoprolol succinate 25 mg 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily Disp #*30 Tablet Refills:*2   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Lower GI bleed - Diverticulosis - Diverticulitis - Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response - Aspirin Allergy  Secondary - Coronary Artery Disease  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because of rectal bleeding.
Eventually your bleeding stopped on its own and your blood counts started to recover.
You had no further bleeding for several days prior to discharge.
During the admission your heart went into an abnormal rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
There is risk of life-threatening arrythmias if dofetilide is combined with certain other medications.
If there is no evidence of further bleeding then you may discuss with your cardiologist about going back on a different blood thinner to help prevent stroke.
