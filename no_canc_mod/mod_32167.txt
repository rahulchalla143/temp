Admission Date:  [**2175-7-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-7-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-2-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation PICC line placement Lumbar puncture   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 15685**] is a 55 y/o female with a PMH significant for EtOH abuse, who was transferred from an OSH on [**2175-7-1**] for further evaluation s/p fall of a subdural hematoma.
The patient initially presented to the OSH ED the day of initial transfer s/p fall febrile to 104, hypotensive with a SBP of 58/p, and tachycardic to the 140s.
OSH CTH revealed an evolving SDH with an ABG of 7.48/22/78 on RA, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
She was evaluated by NS, which felt that no acute surgical intervention was indicated, as the SDH was stable.
CT revealed an approximately 3mm of midline shift associated with the acute hemorrhage, but no intraventricular extension is noted.
CT c-spine demonstrated no acute fracutre or dislocation, although there were multilevel degenerative changes.
She was initially admitted to the ICU where lumbar puncture results were consistent with bacterial meningitis which on gram stain revealed GPCs in pairs and chains but a negative culture.
On [**7-5**], she became increasingly tachycardic with and stable BP, and had an increased O2 requirement, with desaturations.
A speech and swallow evaluation revealed chronic aspiration and she was made strict NPO and transferred back to the MICU in the setting of repeated desaturations.
Per ID recs, she was then converted back to ceftriaxone for unlikely aspiration pneumonia and more likely to be an aspiration pneumonitis or flash pulmonary edema as indicated by rapid improvement.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS: T 96.7 HR 78 BP [**11/2127**] RR 16 sat 99% AC 50% 450x16 PEEP 5 GEN: older than stated age, intubated, agitated HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP dry  NECK: Supple, unable to assess JVP as pt is currently lying flat  CV: tachycardic, distant, Reg rate, normal S1, S2.
+systolic murmur heard best at RUSB radiating to carotids BL, no rubs/gallops.
CHEST: BL rhonchi anteriorly, + expiratory wheezes no crackles noted.
ABD: Soft, NT, slightly distended, no HSM EXT: No c/c/e 2+ PT pulses symmetric BL SKIN: No rash, ecchymoses on right sacrum, left shoulder Neuro: intubated, moving all 4 extremities, not following verbal commands but seems to react to verbal stimuli.
4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2175-7-7**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
Relevant Imaging: 1)CT head ([**7-1**]): Small right frontal subdural hematoma.
No evidence of fracture.
2)CT C-spine ([**7-1**]): No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
3)CT head ([**7-2**]): No interval change in small right frontal subdural hematoma compared to 8 hours earlier.
4)Abdomen ultrasound ([**7-2**]): Unremarkable study without evidence of biliary dilatation, cholelithiasis or son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of liver cirrhosis.
4)ECHO ([**7-3**]): Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Redemonstration of the right frontal and right interhemispheric subdural hematomas.
Mild restriction of diffusion can be seen in the setting of the hematoma; however, followup in one week is recommended to ensure stability of these findings.
1.7-cm area of T2 signal prolongation as well as mild restriction in the diffusion, without evidence of blood products in the left basal ganglia, may represent possible stroke or area of contusion, if there is a history of prior trauma.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 15685**] is a 55 year old woman who was transferred from an outside hospital for further evaluation and treatment of a subdural hematoma, subsequently found to have bacterial meningitis.
Her hospital course was complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure of uncertain etiology (flash pulmonary edema secondary to pulmonary HTN vs aspiration event).
Bacterial meningitis: Initial LP gram stain consistent with bacterial meningitis, likely Strep pneumo with questionable Listeria, although culture results were negative.
She did have positive blood cultures from an outside hospital that were speciated as S. pneumo sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Likely etiologies to her altered mental status are hypernatremia versus effects of subdural hematoma versus meningitis/encephalitis.
Subdural Hematoma: The patient had a subdural hematoma on transfer from an outside hospital.
She was followed by neurology and also evaluated by neurosurgery during her hospital course, and was also treated with dilantin for 14 days for seizure prophylaxis.
Anemia: The patient had a mixed anemia with a high-normal MCV on admission with a HCT that trended down during her hospital course.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure that led to reintubation in the MICU.
This was most likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema secondary to pulmonary hypertension or aspiration, which is less likely.
