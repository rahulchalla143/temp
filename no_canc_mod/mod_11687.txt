Admission Date:  [**2127-11-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2127-11-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-3-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine/MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a critically ill 36 year old male who was transferred from the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**2127-11-15**] for further management of presumed intoxication complicated by acute renal failure requiring dialysis, pancreatitis, hepatitis and meningitis.
The patient's wife noted that, after the ingestion, the patient had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.
The patient had low Tylenol levels.
The wife had noted that, in the past, the patient had ingested Scope and cough syrup and had taken Tylenol P.M., regularly, approximately five pills at a time.
At the outside hospital, the patient was emergently dialyzed and intubated for a severe metabolic acidosis and impending respiratory failure.
A head CT showed sinusitis but no acute intracranial pathology.
He was noted to have increased agitation and was given significant amounts of Ativan and Haldol.
On presentation, the patient was somnolent and unresponsive to voice, but responded to pain.
His pupils were 3 mm and unresponsive to light.
The patient also had a paradoxical breathing pattern and was intubated for both airway protection and respiratory distress.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 36 year old critically ill male, intubated, with presumed ethylene glycol ingestion complicated by meningitis, unresponsive mental status, acute renal failure, on dialysis, hepatitis, pancreatitis and possible aspiration/ventilator associated pneumonia.
Cardiovascular/labile blood pressure:  Since the patient presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], and at the outside hospital, he has been largely hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure at approximately 180 and diastolic pressure at approximately 100.
At first, hypertension was partly attributed to withdrawal, however, now it appears that his hypertension may be neurologically driven.
Pulmonary/intubated with possible ventilator/aspiration pneumonia:  On [**2127-11-19**], the patient had episodes of hypoxia and hypotension.
A chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates consistent with possible aspiration pneumonia.
Renal/anuric, acute renal failure:  This was thought secondary to toxic ingestion.
During his hospitalization, the patient has had significant hyperkalemia with a potassium of 7.4 and peaked T waves on electrocardiogram.
Infectious disease/meningitis and increasing white blood cell count:  Due to the patient's poor mental status, a lumbar puncture was done which showed 95 white blood cells, 3 red blood cells with a differential of 68% polycytes, 7% lymphocytes and 27% monocytes.
The patient is currently on intravenous levofloxacin 250 mg every other day, ampicillin and vancomycin to cover for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria, atypical bacteria and Yersinia.
There is a question of whether the family history of hemochromatosis may invoke Listeria, Yersinia, Vibrio and fungal cryptococci.
The suspicion of hemachromatosis in the patient is low, with an iron of 26, low TIBC but ferritin of greater than 1,000.
Upon presentation, he had reflexes and was moving all extremities.
Currently, the patient does not have any spontaneous movement and pupils remain unreactive.
The meningitis is most likely a chemical meningitis but the patient is being empirically treated with antibiotics.
The patient had an apnea test.
Toxicology/presumed ethylene glycol ingestion:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted and believed that this presentation is consistent with ethylene glycol ingestion, however, no crystals were seen on cerebrospinal fluid or urine samples.
The patient became asystolic at 12:17 and was pronounced at 12:32.
The patient did not demonstrate any signs of discomfort.
