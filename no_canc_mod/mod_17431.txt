Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is likely trivial mitral stenosis though the smallish area may be due to poor cardiac function..
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 70223**] is a 73 year old with a history of coronary artery disease status post a stent placed in the mid RCA, LAD, L Circ who presented to an OSH on [**2186-5-23**] for shortness of breath.
He was found to have critical aortic stenosis and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for aortic valve replacement and a coronary artery bypass.
On [**6-2**] he underwent an aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve and a coronary artery bypass grafting.
He did develop atrial fibrillation and was started on coumadin and amiodarone.
