C7 burst fracture with spinal cord compression with lower extremity paresthesias requiring steroids.
Postoperative delirium requiring Intensive Care Unit monitoring.
Left lower extremity weakness requiring AFO brace.
Posterior fusion from C6 to T9 with posterior instrumentation from C6 to T1 and T2 to T9 with multiple thoracic laminectomies, autograft and open treatment of C7, T4 and T5 fractures on [**2184-4-7**].
The patient was helmeted and did not have any loss of consciousness.
He did have an .................... on the front of his head, and he initially complained of mild numbness and tingling of his bilateral lower extremities which improved upon admission to the Trauma Bay.
On admission to the Emergency Room, the patient complained of minimal left lower extremity numbness with some chest tightness and "lung pain."
The patient denied abdominal pain or shortness of breath.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
There was no crepitus over his chest.
On extremity examination, his lower extremities did have mild weakness in his left lower extremity; however, his right lower extremity was [**4-7**].
The patient did have a positive subtle Hoffmann sign bilaterally with 1+ clonus in his gait.
He had slight decreased sensation in his left lower extremity in the T5 to T10 dermatomes.
A computed tomography of the cervical spine revealed a C7 fracture with cord impingement.
A computed tomography of the chest showed a rib fracture on the right.
A magnetic resonance imaging of his spine showed T4 through B6 compression fractures with no significant spinal stenosis as well as a C7 fracture with burst (as previously noted).
The patient was placed in the Intensive Care Unit for every 1-hour neurologic checks given his C7 burst fracture with spinal cord compression.
The patient did not tolerate tube feedings, and his nasogastric tube was placed to low wall suction with moderately high output.
On the evening of [**4-6**], although the patient was intubated his sedation was decreased and he was noted to be moving his left lower extremity slightly.
The patient underwent a posterior fusion from C6 to T9 and a posterior instrumentation from C6 to T1 and T2 to T9 with multiple thoracic laminectomies and autograft and open treatment of his C7, T4, and T4 fractures.
It was thought that possibly his delirium was secondary to Reglan, and this was discontinued.
The patient did have some continued weakness in his left lower extremity with 4/5 strength in his quadriceps, 3/5 strength in his tibialis anterior, [**2-6**] in his extensor hallucis longus, and [**3-8**] in his hamstring flexors.
The patient was fitted with a AFO brace for his left lower extremity.
