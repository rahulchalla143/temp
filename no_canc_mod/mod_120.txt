The left upper lobe consolidation appears larger, which is probably due to rotation.
There is increased opacification of the left lower lobe.
There is a hazy opacity over the lower left hemithorax, which may represent a layering pleural effusion.
There is no right effusion.
2) Interval progression of left lower lobe consolidation.
3) Possible left pleural effusion.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No evidence of endocarditis seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of [**2142-12-26**], there has been no significant change.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.

Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 45 yo man with h/o HIV (CD4=227) and multiple past pneumonias presents with acute LUL pneumococcal pneumonia ans sepsis.
PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA AND SEPSIS The patient presented with a cough productive of brown sputum, pleuritic left sided chest pain, and a large left upper lobe infiltrate on his CXR.
In the emergency department he became tachypnic, hypoxic and hypotensive, with pressures that were not responsive to fluid boluses.
He was intubated, started on pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics, and admitted to the MICU.
His admission blood cultures showed high grade bacteremia with pneumococcus (3/4 bottles positive).
Once the blood culture data returned his coverage was initially narrowed to levaquin, but he had persistent low grade fevers and a worsening of his leukocytosis, so was again started on broader coverage with cefepime and vancomycin for a question of ventillator associated pneumonia.
On the floor his coverage was again narrowed, but again he seemed to decompensate with low grade temps and worsening leukocytosis, so cefepime and vancomycin were restarted.
Serial CXRs done on [**3-15**] and [**3-18**] showed improvement in the LUL opacity but development of a new LLL opacity and left sided pleural effusion.
On [**3-20**], a chest CT was done which revealed a significant left pleural effusion with LLL collapse.
600cc was removed from the left lung, and sent for testing, which revealed an exudative effusion without malignant cells.
He had evidence of progressing pneumonia, with new right sided tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities.
However clinically he appeared to be improving, with decreased oxygen requirement and no further fevers.
Interventional pulmonary and pulmonary were consulted for re-evaluation, but neither bronchosopy or re-tapping of left sided pleural effusion were felt to be indicated.
He remained afebrile on 3 days of IV therapy and was therefore switched to PO regimen.
At that point he may need chronic suppressive therapy, possibly with penicillin.
CHEST PAIN On admission the patient complained of pleuritic left-sided chest pain.
EKG did not show changes consistent with ACS, and one set of cardiac enzymes was negative.
Once extubated and transferred to the floor, he comtinued to have significant discomfort.
His pain was pleuritic but was also worse with palpation.
The pain was attributed to left-sided pleural inflammation secondary to his known infection.
The main concern over opiate analgesics was his prior history of substance abuse.
However after discussion with the team, it was felt that he had a legitimate reason for pleuritic pain, so he was kept on both oxycontin and methadone for optimal pain control, in addition to lidoderm patch.
Therefore the plan is to taper off methadone slowly as pain continues to resolve concurrently with his pneumonia.
We will taper him down to 5mg [**Hospital1 **] Methadone, and this may be tapered off over the next 1-2 weeks as his symptoms continue to improve.
He may be maintained on the oxycodone as needed for long-term pain control.
At the time of discharge he was also re-started on Neurontin for his chronic neuropathic leg pain.
HYPOTENSION As above, the patient became hypotensive in the ED.
This was thought to be likely [**1-9**] septic shock, and he was quickly weaned off pressors.
Therefore, he was given a 7 day of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for suspected adrenal insufficiency.
He did have a subsequent transient episode of low blood pressures to 80's systolic, felt likely to increased pain medications and volume depletion to poor PO intake.
ANEMIA The patient is s/p an extensive prior workup.
Iron studies were repeated during this admission and were consistent with an anemia of chronic disease, possibly secondary to his HIV.
He has been off HAART medications given significant depression and suicidality at times.
Depression The patient is not currently on treatment for his depression and did not express any suicidal ideation during this inpatient stay.
He was seen by [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1060**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1061**] while here, with plan to follow-up in clinic after his rehab stay to readdress any social needs or possible drug rehabilation program if needed.
