Admission Date:  [**2118-2-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-3-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-4-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2927**] Chief Complaint: Seizures  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 37 year old primarily Spanish-speaking gentleman who was found confused and wandering in the streets earlier today.
There was a mention of possible seizure-like activity.
He was taken to [**Hospital6 3105**] where he continued to be confused and agitated.
He was therefore given 5mg IM haldol around 4pm and 2mg IM lorazepam around 5pm to sedate him long enough to obtain a NCHCT, which showed a 2cm mass-like hyperdensity in the L frontal lobe.
The hyperdensity was associated with hemorrhage causing mass effect on the L lateral ventricle but no evidence of herniation.
The patient denies loss of consciousness and is able to recollect the events leading up to his being brought to LGH.
In fact, he says for a week now he has been experiencing intermittent episodes where his left lower extremity feels "cold" and he has carpopedal spasms.
He currently denies headache, vision changes, motor or sensory changes.
He primarily complains of pain from his Foley catheter.

No shift of normally midline structures or central herniation.
No new intracranial hemorrhage  MRI Head [**2-23**] 2.1 cm T1 focus of hemorrhage which may represent a cavernoma.
There is a prominent vessel just inferior and lateral to it which may represent a DVA or less likely a small AVM.
There is surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect over adjacent brain parenchyma with 1 cm herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum  EEG [**2-23**] Negative for seizures  [**2118-2-22**] 05:56PM BLOOD ASA-NEG Ethanol-NEG Acetmnp-NEG Bnzodzp-NEG Barbitr-NEG Tricycl-NEG [**2118-2-23**] 02:00AM BLOOD Phenyto-8.1* [**2118-2-24**] 01:26AM BLOOD Phenyto-14.3  Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the neurosurgery team and the ICU.
He had a seizure upon admission and became hypotensive and was intubated.
He was extubated without difficulty.
After extubation his neuro exam was intact with the exception of a pre-existing left facial droop from previous facial surgery.
He continued to be monitored on LTM without evidence of seizure activity but EEG did show some bursts of generalized rhthymic frontal 4-5hz theta frequency activity with left frontal predominance that did not have any clinical correlation.
He had one pushbutton [**2118-2-26**] in the morning for headache and he was asking for pain medications without EEG changes.
EEG was discontinued on [**2-28**] and he remained in the hospital for evaluation of clinical events while level of PHT was allowed to decrease.
He had no events into [**3-1**] and was cleared for discharge home.
Cardio/Pulm: stable on RA while on the floor but with chest pain on the evening of [**2-27**].
