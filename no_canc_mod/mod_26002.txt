She was doing well on a rehab, but on [**2121-1-15**] she presented again to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] Hospital  with fevers to 101.9 and an hypoxic episode with Sats down to the 60's.
She was worked up and had a bronchoscopy on [**1-16**] and was noted to have a tracheostomy tube completely occluded by a tissue mass - ?granulation tissue.
The bronchoscope could not advance past the mass, so the trach tube was pulled back slightly and the mass was better visualized.
The mass was washed with saline but not biopsied.
She is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of the mass and possible resection.

The profunda femoris was not seen due to obesity.
IMPRESSION: Monophasic common femoral waveform with monophasic flow in the proximal SFA with mid SFA occlusion and reconstitution of the popliteal artery  [**2121-1-23**] Venous duplex: FINDINGS: RIGHT: The right greater saphenous vein is occluded.
It is possible that this represents an occluded right lower extremity bypass graft given the overlying surgical scar.
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
She also has a tracheal laceration that measured approximately 1 cm in length.
The patient also has some necrotic areas of cartilage just proximal to the tracheal defect.
CT neck and chest were done revealing a 3-cm long, subcutaneous, pretracheal, low cervical tract, without clear intrathoracic extension or abscess, and multifocal atelectasis, less likely pneumonia.
No subcutaneous emphysema, adventitious gas or gas- or fluid-containing tract in the anterior cervical soft tissues to specifically suggest persistent "false channel" communicating with the cervical trachea.
Cultures grew out pseudomonas only sensitive to tobra and gent.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2121-1-27**] showing trauma to posterior wall.
