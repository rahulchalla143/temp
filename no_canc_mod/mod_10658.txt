2) Slightly enhancing lesion involving the posterior aspect of the pons with extension into the superior fourth ventricle.
There is no obstructive hydrocephalus.
The presence of magnetic susceptibility might suggest that the lesion could represent a developmental venous anomaly or a cavernous angioma with secondary hemorrhage.

This may represent an area of hemorrhage, tumor, or thrombosed aneurysm (most likely posterior inferior cerebellar artery).
