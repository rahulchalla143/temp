Imaging:  Chest X-ray [**2105-6-4**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Chest X-ray [**2105-6-6**]: In comparison with study of [**5-5**], there are patchy areas of increased opacification involving the right mid and lower lung zone.
Although some of this could represent asymmetric or dependent pulmonary edema, the failure of cardiac enlargement goes against this possibility.
There are no focal liver lesions identified.
There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
The common bile duct is markedly dilated and measures up to 12 mm in maximal diameter.
There is a simple cyst measuring 2.1 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm in the mid pole of the right kidney.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, renal masses or renal calculi.
No evidence of biliary obstruction or common bile duct calculus.
Bilateral renal cysts, multilobulated at the upper pole of the right kidney.Some heterogeneous enhancement in the right renal upper pole is non specific, but could represent evidence of recent pyelonephritis.
Moderate right pleural effusion and patchy right lower lung consolidation.
Small left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 62 year old female with h/o frequent UTIs who presents with fevers, flank pain, nausea, cough, pyuria, admitted to MICU for hypotension.
1) Pyelonephritis with hypotension and sepsis In the emergency department, the patient had fever to 102F, right flank pain with right costovertebral angle tenderness, pyuria, and hypotension to 80s/50s.
She was started on ceftriaxone as she had prior urinary tract infections with amoxicillin/augmentin resistent E. coli.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn which eventually grew E. coli sensitive to ceftriaxone but resistant to TMP/SMX (which the patient had taken at home).
In the ICU, she received a 4L normal saline bolus with improvement of SBP to 100s.
Symptomatically, the patient complained of chills, headache, dry cough, persistent right flank pain, chest pressure worse with deep inspiration.
An renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis, masses, calculi, or abscess.
On hospital day 1, patient's oxygen saturations dropped to the high 80s%, she was ~13L positive, and CXR showed fluid overload.
On hospital day 2, her symptoms improved and she was transferred to the general medicine service.
She remained afebrile without leukocytosis.
She was treated with additional IV lasix and her oxygen requirement resolved.
She was initially treated with IV morphine for her pain until her pain improved.
2)Transaminitis Elevated liver enzymes were noted on presentation and an adominal ultrasound showed common bile duct dilataion.
MRCP showed no evidence of biliary obstruction.
These elevations were believed to be due to decreased hepatic perfusion during the period of hypotension.
Her GTT was elevated at 119, suggesting a hepatic origin to her elevated AP.
3) Anemia Hematocrit stablized at approximately 30 after IVFs (baseline in [**2103**] was 38-40).
MCV was normal, with a decreased reticulocyte index.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease; Fe/TIBC was < 20 indicating iron deficiency, concerning for GI bleed.
At the time of discharge, the patient had symptomatically improved and was afebrile without leukocytosis.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) inhalations Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses 1) Pyelonephritis 2) E. coli bacteremia  Secondary Diagnoses 3) Anemia  Discharge Condition: Ambulatory.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a kidney infection (pyelonephritis) and bacteria in your blood (bacteremia).
We retested your blood and urine and the tests now show no sign of infection.
You also have anemia, low blood counts, from low iron.
Please call your primary care physician ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]) or come to the emergency department if your fever returns, if your pain worsens, if you notice cloudy or foul-smelling urine or for any other symptoms that you find concerning.
