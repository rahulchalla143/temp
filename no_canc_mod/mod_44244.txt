for afterload reduction.
During her last couple of weeks of hospitalization, the patient had relative hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 80s, most likely due to hypovolemia, poor p.o.
intake and Lasix on top of multiple, complex, other hemodynamic lesions including decreased ejection fraction, valvular disease and pulmonary embolus while she was in the cardiac care unit.
Although her white blood cell count was increased in the last two days of admission, she was not febrile and there were no other signs of sepsis.
She had also received Percocet for pain and this might have exacerbated her hypovolemia.
A chest x-ray was repeated on [**2138-9-19**] because the patient had an increased respiratory rate and an oxygen saturation in the mid 80s on room air.
This showed no pneumothorax or infiltrate, but she was status post pleurodesis when the x-ray was taken and this could have complicated the picture.
Since [**2138-9-20**], the patient had no further episodes of hypotension.
(C) CONDUCTION:  The patient had a history of atrial fibrillation.
PULMONARY:  After extubation, the patient was found to have an increased respiratory rate and decreased breath sounds by examination.
On [**2138-9-13**], a chest x-ray showed pleural effusion, left greater than right, which was tapped on [**2138-9-13**] with symptomatic relief and an output of 750 cc of bloody fluid.
This repeat chest x-ray showed some return of the left sided pleural effusion.
The analysis of her pleural fluid was consistent with an exudative bloody effusion with a broad differential including being secondary to her pulmonary embolus, congestive heart failure in the setting of heparin and diuresis or eosinophils secondary to air/blood; cancer was always a possibility as well as pneumonia.
Output from this was a total of 1100 cc of serosanguinous fluid with 800 cc upon initial placement of the tube.
On the morning of [**2138-9-17**], it was placed on water-seal with no air leak.
On [**2138-9-18**], talc pleurodesis was done without complications and was placed to suction.
On [**2138-9-19**], her chest tube was removed by the cardiothoracic surgery service and she was given Percocet for pain treatment.
NEUROLOGY:  The patient was found to have left sided hemiparesis in the cardiac care unit.
She also had a history of a seizure disorder and she had been continued on her Dilantin throughout this hospitalization.
On [**2138-9-13**], the neurology team saw the patient for persistent left upper extremity hemiparalysis.
They recommended a repeat of the head MRI to rule out watershed infarct, since they also saw proximal right sided weakness.
The MRI did show a new right sided posterior parietal lesion.
The patient has also been relatively aphasic, most likely secondary to the stroke.
On [**2138-9-20**], a head CT scan was repeated secondary to her acute and chronic hypotension.
The head CT scan was negative for an acute process.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On [**2138-9-14**], the patient complained of pain at her Foley catheter site and the urine looked dirty.
She was started prophylactically on three days of ciprofloxacin for a possible urinary tract infection.
