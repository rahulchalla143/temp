Admission Date:  [**2172-3-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-4-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-8-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Norvasc / Morphine / Niacin / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right renal artery catheterization and stenting Right renal artery gelfoam embolization Temporary hemodialysis line placement Exploratory laparotamy Right hemicolectomy Intubation and mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old with DM2, HTN, HLD, extensive vasculopathy including CAD s/p RCA stent [**2161**], bifemoral disease s/p L common iliac stent x 2, aortic stent who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital for stenting of renal artery stenosis.
Catheterization occurred on [**2172-3-31**] and was complicated by post-procedure hypotension and retroperitoneal bleed.
Due to concern for perinephric/RP bleed a massive transfusion protocol was initiated.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken emergenty for CTA of the abdomen which demonstrated a large perinephric hemorrhage with extension into the retroperitoneum.
Due to persistent hyperkalemia (K of 6.4) she was given calcium gluconate, insulin and dextrose.
Several amps of bicarb were administered for persistent lactic acidosis (HCO3 ~18-19) with ABG 7.17/43/116/17.
Increasing abdominal girth and increasing peak pressures to 40 were noted during the procedure, and surgery was consulted for possible compartment syndrome.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on Thursday when her BP was elevated to 200s whilst recieving procrit, per the family her BP was in the 150s at home.
She was treated for a CHF exacerbation thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
RUS demonstrated > 60% stenosis of the R renal artery.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Family History: Family history is significant for father who died from an MI at age 30 and a brother who died at 38.
LUNGS: CTAB anteriorly, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Unable to assess tenderness secondary to sedation.
Multiple foci of active extravasation from the right kidney with extensive perinephric, and other retroperitoneal hematoma as well as extension of hematoma into the mesentery.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions as well as moderate pericardial effusion, likely related to recent volume resuscitation.
Extensive vasculopathy as delineated above.
Heterogeneous hepatic attenuation, raising the possibility of partial hepatic infarction.
There is trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Emergent study with poor parasternal and apical views.
Cannot assess for mitral or tricuspid regurgitation.
Embolization Report: HT RENAL ANGIOGRAM AND GELFOAM EMBOLIZATION, FOLLOWED BY TEMPORARY HEMODIALYSIS CATHETER PLACEMENT  INDICATION: 71-year-old woman with right renal arterial bleeding, status post right renal arterial stent.
A Renegade STC microcatheter was then used to sequentially access the caudal branch of the interpolar artery, caudal branch of the lower polar branch and subsequently, a peripheral (fourth order) branch arising from the cranial branch of the interpolar artery to perform Gelfoam embolization to near stasis, with appropriate pre-embolization arteriograms from these branches via the microcatheter, and post-embolization arteriograms from the right renal artery via the main catheter.
No immediate post-procedure complication was seen.
Multiple angiograms performed from the right main renal artery, and from the caudal branch of interpolar artery, caudal branch of right renal lower polar artery and subsequently a peripheral branch (fourth order) branch of the cranial branch of interpolar artery demonstrated multiple foci of active extravasation (corresponding to those seen on CT dated [**2172-3-31**]), and two possible foci of contained extravasation or pseudoaneurysms.
Post-embolization arteriograms demonstrated good angiographic results in their appropriate territories, no significant residual extravasation, and contrast enhancement of approximately 70% of the right kidney on the final angiogram.
During these arteriograms, abnormal renal contrast withholding with delayed clearance was noted, most likely related to the underlying renal insufficiency.
Angiography re-demonstrated complete abdominal aortic occlusion below the take-off of the SMA/renal arteries.
The recently placed right renal stent was patent, and no main renal artery dissection or rupture was seen.
Right renal angiography demonstrated multiple foci of active extravasation, followed by successful targeted Gelfoam embolization of distal branches of right renal interpolar and lower pole arteries.
Pending Studies: Bowel Tissue Pathology   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a 71 year old woman with extensive vascular disease including coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diastolic congestive heart failure who presented with uncontrolled hypertension and and a diastolic CHF exacerbation likely secondary to renal artery stenosis.
She was transferred from an outside hospital for renal artery stenting which was unfortunately complicated by perinephric hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock with resulting multisystem organ failure and death.
# Hypovolemic Shock/Hemorrhage: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from an outside hospital for management of resistant hypertension which had resulted in an episode of flash pulmonary edema.
Following a successful stenting of a near 99% stensosis of the right renal artery, Ms. [**Known lastname **] became hypotensive in the holding area .
The hypotension (to systolic BPs in the 40s) was accompanied by back pain, and given concern for a retroperitoneal/perinephric bleed a massive transfusion protocol was initiated.
She was initially hemodynamically stable on dopamine, and a CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained which demonstrated a large perinephric hematoma with extension into the mesentery and retroperitoneum.
There was concern for septic shock given dirty right femoral line, abdominal compartment syndrome, cardiogenic shock, new bleeding, and end organ ischemia.
A stat echo was obtained which demonstrated normal LV systolic dysfunction and a patent IVC, making cardiogenic shock and abdominal compartment sydnrome less likely.
Given her rising lactate, worsening acidosis, persistently distended abdomen, and high bladder pressures in the 20s an exploratory laparotomy at 7am was undertaken to evaluate possible abdominal compartment syndrome versus bowel ischemia.
Intraoperatively the ascending and transverse colon was found to be necrotic, and the remaining areas of small and large bowel were discovered to be diffusely ischemic.
A right colectomy was performed, and the abdominal cavity was remained open for possible re-exploration.
# Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Ms. [**Known lastname **] became increasingly hypoxemic following her initial hemorrhage.
The differential diagnosis of her hypoxemia includes hypervolemia from massive transfusion leading to pulmonary edema, ARDS (secondary to pro-inflammatory state vs. TRALI), aspiration in the setting of her initial intubation.
Respiration was also difficult due to massive abdominal distension in the setting of intraabdominal hemorrhage.
# Metabolic acidosis: Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed a profound AG metabolic acidosis, likely from elevated lactate and renal failure.
Lactic acidosis likely secondary to RP bleed and hypovolemic shock as well as bowel necrosis.
# ESRD: Given hyperkalemia to 6.1, profound acidemia, and volume overload, a temporary HD line was placed at the time of her renal artery embolization and CVVH was initiated on [**2172-3-31**] when she arrived to the CCU.
