Admission Date:  [**2112-9-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-10-6**]   Service: CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Massive nasopharyngeal bleed requiring intubation for airway protection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male with hypertension, high cholesterol, status post cerebrovascular [**8-30**], [**Month (only) **] from [**Hospital6 2018**] on [**9-7**] on Coumadin and Aspirin presumably for ischemic stroke and bilateral MCA stenosis.
He developed profuse hemoptysis at 6 p.m. on the day of admission while at a rehabilitation facility.
There is a questionable history of vomiting blood.
INR was noted Vitamin K.  Shortly after the bleeding began, the patient became acutely short of breath believed to be due to aspiration of blood.
He was sent to the [**State 28978**] Emergency Room and was intubated for respiratory distress and airway protection.
In the Emergency Room, a large nasopharyngeal mass was noted in the posterior pharynx during intubation.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates, and the patient was started on Levaquin 500 mg. White blood count was 16.2 with 14% bands.
Status post cerebrovascular accident times two; the first one was two years ago; on the second one, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2112-9-7**], with right hemiparesis and aphasia.
Head MRI was consistent with ischemic cerebrovascular accident of the left ventricular nucleus.
Other medical history consist of thoracic aneurysm.
Difficulty hearing.
Recent partial small bowel obstruction on the last admission which was managed medically.
Recent pansensitive E. coli urinary tract infection which was treated with Levaquin.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  On admission the patient was intubated and sedated but was bleeding from his nares and oropharynx.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy.
There was a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the apex.
Extremities:  No edema.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia, prolonged PR interval at 0.28, no ST or T-wave changes noted.
Hematology:  The patient had a significant nasopharyngeal bleed and was transfused 2 U of packed red blood cells at an outside hospital.
The patient's bleeding was believed to be an upper respiratory source while on supratherapeutic Coumadin.
No mass was noted; however, the endotracheal tube partially obstructed the view.
A thorough exam of the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, and hypopharynx revealed no masses or lesions.
Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated for hypoxia and airway protection.
There were no attempts to extubate the patient secondary to persistent thick, yellow-brown pulmonary secretions.
The patient was also believed to have an aspiration pneumonia.
Additionally, the patient had persistent hiccups which appeared to be quite uncomfortable to the patient.
On [**10-3**], a repeat chest x-ray showed a persistent left lower lobe infiltrate; however, at that time, the patient was afebrile with a normal white count.
On [**10-3**], the patient received a bedside tracheostomy with no complications.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was tachycardiac on presentation and hypotensive.
Most likely the etiology was believed to be septic shock secondary to an elevated white count with bands and likely aspiration pneumonia.
The patient has a history of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.
On [**9-17**], a chest CT was obtained which showed an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysmal dilatation to a maximum diameter of 5 cm.
There was no evidence of dissection.
It also showed a persistent left upper lobe and right lower lobe consolidation with a small left upper lobe nodule.
Lastly a lower thoracic spine wedge compression fracture was noted of unknown age.
During the course of the hospitalization, the patient had several episodes of low blood pressure with a systolic blood pressure down to 70.
Admission electrocardiogram showed no evidence of ischemia.
Infectious disease:  The patient was believed to have an aspiration pneumonia.
The results of that study showed no intracranial hemorrhage, evolution of a left hemisphere stroke and extensive sinus disease.
The results of that study showed chronic paranasal sinus disease with significant opacification of the left maxillary sinus suggestive of obstruction to the left ostial meatal complex.
Left-sided [**Doctor Last Name 13856**] bullosa bilaterally sphenoid and minor right-sided maxillary and frontal disease was also seen.
On [**9-30**], the patient developed right arm swelling.
An ultrasound was obtained on that day which showed no right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
The jugular vein was not identified secondary to central line placement.
The patient had been afebrile for greater than a week prior to discharge.
The most recent episode involved right-sided weakness and hemiparesis.
This was believed to be due to hypovolemia and swallowing of blood.
An abdominal x-ray was obtained which showed a small left effusion.
There was no evidence of a bowel obstruction, although the radiologist could not exclude the possibility of fluid-filled distended loops of the small bowel.
A PEG was placed [**10-5**] for long-term nutrition.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Nasopharyngeal bleed, severe (?posterior).
