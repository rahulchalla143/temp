Pt did not have BM or urinate during seizure, and did not have a "feeling of this seizure" happening, no strange smells/color changes.
He related no CP/SOB assoc with sz, but developed CP while in ED; initial ECG on arrival was like prior but repeat ECG with T changes in lateral, I, aVF (lead placement not changed), no ST elevations.
Pt explains CP as a non-radiating right sub-sternal pain, [**2-21**], that felt like an ice-cube resting on his chest.

Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with LMCA that had 70% lesion distally.
The distal LAD filled from the LIMA but was a small diffusely diseased vessel.
LCX had an 80% lesion in the proxinal vessel and there was an occluded OM that was grafted.
Native RCA had a 60% lesion distal to the patent stents.
SVG to OM was patent but had 40% lesions at the valves.
Thepresence of beta activity can be seen with the intercurrent use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
There is plate-like atelectasis at the lung bases.
There are linear opacities in the left paramediastinal region which may represent atelectatic changes or scarring.
No pulmonary edema is seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Plate-like atelectasis at both lung bases.

Pt had trigger event around noon on [**6-3**] for pt becoming altered and for high BG-396, pt received 8 units of humalog.
Pt had no CP, no SOB.
Had additional trigger event at 17:18 found to be unresponsive to sternal rub.
Pt had noticable foaming from the mouth, without tonic-clonic movement, VSS were stable.
The meropenem was later stopped due to possibility for causing convulsions.
Pt recieved his cath on [**6-6**], showed three vessel disease with patent OM and LIMA grafts.
He does have an occluded RCA graft.
No stents or angioplasty was done.
Pt never experienced another bout of CP since the presentation in the ED.
