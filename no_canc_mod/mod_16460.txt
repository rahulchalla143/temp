ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Blood Culture [**2110-3-5**] at 12:26 and blood culture from [**2110-3-6**]: NGTD  Urine Culture [**1-27**] [**2110-3-5**]: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2110-3-6**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
============== OTHER STUDIES ============== TTE [**2110-3-5**]: IMPRESSION: Preserved regional and global left ventricular function.
Mild right ventricular dilatation with mild global hypokinesis.
Moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
A large 14 mm stone and large amount of sludge were extracted successfully using a 15 mm balloon.
Chest Radiograph [**2110-3-5**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-1**]: Severe cardiomegaly has worsened and there is mild interstitial edema, but most significant change is new moderate right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.
Moderate intra- and extra-hepatic pneumobilia, findings consistent with recent ERCP and sphincterotomy.
Vascular calcifications with moderate plaque seen at the origins of the celiac axis and right renal artery.
No free fluid within the peritoneal cavity or retroperitoneum to suggest hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo F with afib/TIA on coumadin, systolic heart failure (unknown EF), COPD on 3L NC, DM2, gastroparesis and gastritis who was for planned biliary stent removal with course complicated by cholangitis/sepsis.
Soon after presenation to the medical procedure post procedure developed hypotension requiring pressor support and was transferred to the MICU.
Presumed source of sepsis was her biliary tree given interventions so she was empirically covered with IV piperacillin-tazobactam.
Discussion regarding removing her port-a-cath was carried out between IV team, ID, and medicine and given that this was not likely the source of her transient bacteremia and gram negatives less likely to seed port immediate removal was not pursued.
2) Acute blood loss anemia: Patient had gastrointestinal blood loss in the context of sphinctertomy and received three units of pRBC's in the MICU with improvement of her hematocrit, which was stable thereafter.
Given no obvious large volume bleed CT scan of abdomen was performed to rule out RP bleed and this was negative.
3) Bacteriuria: Though initial urine culture was negative repeat culture with small organism burden of E coli.
ID and team felt possibly due to hematogenous spread from bacteremia.
Patient does have an indwelling foley for chronic incontinence and habitus, which could serve as a portal for infection.
4) Dysphagia: Pt reported dysphagia in the AM notable of accumulation of a "ball of spit" in the throat.
Pt had ERCP and passage of large scope for this procedure essentially rules out significant peptic stricture (and none was seen).
Video swallow study showed no clear dysphagia and patient had no choking, coughing, or worsened hypoxemia so no suggestion of aspiration.
If this continues to be an issue barium swallow should be considered.
5) OSA: Patient with known OSA and echo with pulmonary hypertension.
She has refused CPAP in past due to intolerance.
She understands this poses a risk of long term damage to her heart.
6) Atrial fibrillation: She remained in slow afib throughout her hospitalization.
8 )Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient with EF of 55 but given pulmonary hypertension high suspicion of some degree of diastolic CHF.
She was not on ACEi but starting this was deferred given complicated medical situation and lack of acute issues with her dCHF.
10) Neuropathy/ Chronic lower extremity pain: She was continued on her gabapentin and oxycodone.
-She should have PT to work on increasing functionality and ability to ambulate independently  -She should complete here course of antibiotics for cholangitis.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 9188**] Care and Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Gram negative bacteremia and septic shock from cholangitis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Obesity Chronic Systolic Heart Failure Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a severe infection related to an obstruction of your biliary tree.
