Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
There is a slightly more confluent nodular opacity within the area of edema as above in the right upper lung.
Cardiomegaly and large hiatal hernia again noted.
Moderate cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema.
Right pleural effusion.
Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
[**2181-10-26**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2175-6-14**], LV systolic dysfunction appears more regional and reflective of CAD on today's study.
Polyvalvular regurgitant valvular disease has progressed and pulmonary pressures are estimated to be higher.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2181-10-26**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 81M with CAD s/p PCI, RCC, CKD (baseline Cr 2.5), presentes with shortness of breath over the last 3 days, found to have elevated BNP and asymmetric pulmonary edema on CXR.
Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  This may have been due to dietary indiscretion.
He was not started on an ACEI due to his creatinine.
Chronic kidney disease, stage III:  His Cr during his hospitalization was at baseline.
8. triamcinolone acetonide 0.1 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for rash/pruritis.
Rowasa 4 gram/60 mL Kit Sig: One (1) application Rectal once a day as needed for colitis.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure Hypertension Chronic kidney disease, stage III   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for trouble breathing.
This was due to congestive heart failure with fluid in the lungs.
