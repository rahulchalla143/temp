Admission Date:  [**2123-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-3-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-3-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfur / Morphine / Imipramine / Oxybutynin / Oxycontin / Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] for respiratory distress, elevated troponins and pneumonia.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac cath s/p 2 bare metal stents to SVG-OM  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 27671**] is a 60 year-old patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11493**] with a long history of CAD s/p 2-vessel CABG in [**2100**] (SVG to LAD and SVG to OM), s/p PTCA to RCA and multiple PTCAs and brachytherapy of the SVG to OM (last in [**2121-1-29**]), who was admitted to [**Location (un) **] with cough and wheezing, as well as anginal symptoms on [**2123-3-8**].
She describes a sore throat with "gland swelling" for 2-3 days PTA, anorexia, as well as a productive cough and wheezing on the day prior to presentation.
She also had several anginal episodes in the day prior to admission, some at rest, relieved with NTG SL.
She presented to the OSH on [**2123-3-8**], and was found to have a temperature of 101.4 in the ED, WBC 13.1, 18% bands, and CXR revealed a LLL infiltrate on CXR.
While in hospital, her cardiac enzymes rose with peak CK-MB 41.6, Troponin I 13.02, and EKG revealed ST depressions in anterolateral leads.
On [**2123-3-9**], she also developed what seems to be acute respiratory distress in the setting of elevated blood pressure with SBP 150-200, and desaturation to 60s on 2L via NC.
Of note, by the patient account, she recently had an echo and had her Nitro patch increased to 0/8 mg/24 hours over 24 hours because of accelerating anginal symptoms.
Coronary artery disease, s/p CABG in [**2100**] with SVG to the LAD and an SVG to the OM.
Last cath in [**7-/2122**]: SVG to the LAD had mild diffuse disease up to 30%, patent SVG to OM with 40-50% stenosis in the mid distal graft section not hemodynamically significant to the obtuse marginal and the previously placed stent was widely patent.
Concern over possible ostial RCA lesion, but could not be engaged.
Peripheral vascular disease 3.
Depression 7.
Basal cell carcinoma removed from face  Social History: She lives alone.
She has a housekeeper who comes in once a week to help with her laundry.
Mildly tachypneic.
Bilateral clavicular bruits (?
JVP difficult to assess secondary to body habitus.
RESP: Distant breath sounds.
GI: Obese abdomen.
Difficult to assess for bruit secondary to body habitus.
1+ bilateral edema, slightly more on the right.
ST elevation in aVR (and V1, V2 on different EKGs), 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in I, II, aVF, V3-6.
No T wave inversion.
Less than 1mm ST elevation in V1,V2.
ST depression I, II, aVL, V5.
Selective graft angiography revealed a SVG->OM with a 60% lesion in the distal segment followed by a 70% lesion in the distal anastomosis into the native OM.
Hemodynamic evaluation revealed normal right and left heart filling pressures.
There was no evidence of significant pulmonary HTN.
Final angiography revealed 10% residual stenosis in the distal SVG, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Normal right and left heart filling pressures.
Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.

1) NSTEMI: Ruled in at OSH with elevated CK-MB, troponin I. Cath was attempted after pt diuresed, however cath was aborted d/t pt discomfort and desaturation on table.
She likely became anxious, which caused tachycardia, demand-mediated ischemia, and then flash pulmonary edema.
The suspicion of renal artery stenosis was raised.
3) CHF: She had flash pulmonary edema at the OSH, likely due to ischemia as described above.
There was no need for steroids.
6) Hyperglycemia: Patient denies history of DM type 2.
Her HBA1C = 6.1%, consistent with borderline diabetes.
9) Left forearm thrombophlebitis: Due to an IV, with no evidence of infection.
NSTEMI s/p cardiac cath with 2 bare metal stents to SVG-OM 2.
LLL Pneumonia 4.
Anemia NOS 5.
Hyperglycemia 7.
Hypothyroidism  Discharge Condition: Pt had stable vital signs, a blood pressure around 140 systolically, with a Hct of 34, able to ambulate with walker, saturating > 91% on room air, weighing 133.8 kgs, which is her dry weight.
