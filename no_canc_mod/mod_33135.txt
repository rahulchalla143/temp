History of Present Illness: This is a 74 year old male with known coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis who presents today for surgical evaluation.
Past medical history notable for prior myocardial infarctions and RCA stenting at [**Hospital6 **] in [**2172**](bare metal) and stenting at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2182**](drug-eluting).
He also has severe COPD on chronic steroids and intermittant home oxygen use.
He was recently admitted to OSH with worsening shortness of breath and COPD exacerbation.
There was no history of chest pain, syncope, diaphoresis or lightheadedness.
He admits to severe dyspnea at less than 20 feet and he is often unable to walk up a flight of stairs.
Extensive cardiac evaluation showed worsening aortic stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 74-year-old male with worsening symptoms related to critical aortic stenosis presenting for aortic valve replacement.
He also has coronary artery disease and had multiple interventions to his coronaries.
Preoperative steroids were resumed for his significant COPD history.
Nicardipine, as opposed to beta-blocker was utilized for increased cardiac selection and to minimize bronchospasm.
General surgery was consulted for concern of bowel ischemia and rising lactate.His respiratory status remained tenuous post extubation and on POD#2 he was reintubated for  worsening respiratory distress and lactic acidosis.
CT scan of his abdomen revealed dilated loops of bowel but no evidence of bowel ischemia per General Surgery.
Adenosine was administered to assess the acutely rapid rhythm which was revealed to be atrial fibrillation.
Amiodarone and Lopressor were administered with conversion to normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.
He was intermittently between sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin.
His pulmonary status remained tenuous postoperatively requiring ventilatory support with noninvasive biphasic positive airway pressure intermittently.
He was reintubated on [**2184-9-7**] for respiratory failure and aggressively diuresed with a Lasix drip.
Epinephrine and Levophed drips were started for hypotension and they were weaned off in the following 2 days.
He had a right upper quandrant ultrasound which was negative for choleycystis due to abdominal distention and hypotension.
The infectious disease team was consulted for a leukocytosis and recommended discontinuing the Cefepime (which he was on for Serratia in the sputum) and continuing Vancomycin for a total of 7 days for coag negative staphylococcus in [**12-1**] blood cultures.
