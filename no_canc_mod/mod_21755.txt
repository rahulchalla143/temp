Admission Date: [**2172-5-20**]        Discharge Date: [**2172-6-2**]   Service:  CME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 56406**] is an 80-year-old male with past medical history significant for peripheral vascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented initially to [**Hospital6 8283**] with the complaint of chest pain.
The patient was ambulating at 4 a.m. on the day of admission, reported feeling an "awful" chest pain associated with dyspnea but not associated with nausea or diaphoresis.
However, the pain recurred at approximately 9 a.m. on the day of admission while performing landscaping work in his yard.
Upon resumption of his activity the patient again had recurrent pain and was taken to [**Hospital6 4299**] by EMS.
On further review of systems the patient reports similar symptoms with exertion over the past several weeks.
Each resolved with rest but was severe in character.
Upon presentation to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department the patient reported minimal residual chest pain and denied it ever radiating to his arm, jaw, or back.
He was not complaining of shortness of breath.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Alcohol consumption of greater than 12 ounces of brandy each day with subjective report of prior minor withdrawal symptoms upon cessation.
No history of DTs or seizures.
In general, this is a pleasant, elderly man in no apparent distress.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally; notable for distant breath sounds.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs or rubs; normal S1, S2.
Extremities:  No edema, no clubbing, no cyanosis appreciated; pulses 1 plus femorals bilaterally, dorsalis pedis not palpable on either side but Dopplerable.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was felt to have symptoms consistent with unstable angina; thus the Heparin and nitroglycerin drips were continued.
Upon coronary catheterization the patient was found to have one-vessel coronary artery disease with a 90 percent ostial lesion of the left anterior descending.
In light of the patient's elevated creatinine on admission the patient received peri cath hydration and Mucomyst in attempt to further prevent rises in serum creatinine.
On the day following catheterization the patient was noted to be persistently hypertensive with a gradually declining mental status with agitation.
The patient was noted to be somewhat tremulous with disorientation, at which time he received 2 mg of Ativan for concerns of alcohol withdrawal.
Repeat EKG at this time revealed no other changes.
A chest x-ray at the time revealed findings consistent with mild failure and an ABG indicated hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The patient was immediately evaluated by the Cardiac Care Unit team, and despite aggressive diuresis and increased afterload reduction with nitroglycerin and Hydralazine, the patient continued to have rising PCO2s.
A head CT was performed which showed no evidence of acute hemorrhage, however revealed chronic white matter infarctions.
While in the CCU the patient was maintained on an Ativan drip given the presumptive diagnosis of delirium tremens given his history of alcohol abuse and presentation of altered mental status.
His Ativan drip was gradually weaned off following the course of his CCU stay, and upon transfer out to the floor the patient was without evidence of further withdrawal symptoms or signs.
The patient's renal failure was thought to be due to a combination of prerenal azotemia with subsequent contrast nephropathy from the dye administration during cardiac catheterization.
The patient was noted to have a hematocrit drop to 25 during his CCU stay, at which time a CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to ensure that there was no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or hemorrhage as a potential complication of his cardiac catheterization.
The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to congestive heart failure in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension secondary to his DTS.
After weaning his Ativan drip as described above and sufficient diuresis, the patient was extubated with follow up chest x- rays revealing a potential aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was afebrile with a minimal cough that was nonproductive.
However, given radiographic demonstration of potential aspiration and the patient's history of intubation, he was given ceftriaxone and Flagyl for this potential aspiration pneumonia.
The patient received blood cultures during his CCU course that revealed one out of four bottles positive for gram positive cocci subsequently identified as coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
Initially vancomycin was administered given the concern for a gram positive bacteremia.
However, upon further identification and failure of the other cultures and subsequent surveillance cultures to grow out, the vancomycin was held.
The patient was demonstrated to have evidence of aspiration of thin liquid, and aspiration precautions were requested.
Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Acute renal failure.
Anemia of chronic disease.
Repeat video swallow study in one to two weeks to evaluate    ongoing risk of aspiration.
