Admission Date:  [**2167-9-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-9-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Insertion right radial line  History of Present Illness: HPI: 83 male w/ oropharyngeal carcinoma s/p laryngectomy, copd, reported frequent aspiration pna, now being admitted for further evaluation and monitoring of acute respiratory distress.
History and records limited but apparently pt recently d/c'd from VA for reported RLL PNA for which recently completed course of Ceftriaxone and Zithromax.
Reportedly became diaphoretic, tachypneic and hypoxic to low 80's, improving to low 90's on several liters of nasal cannula.
Wet read CXR demonstrates r. sided pleural effusion, mildly enlarged cardiac silohette.
Pt subjectively still SOB but feeling improved.
Given concerns about persistent tachypnea and poor functional status, transferrd to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring.
On arrival to [**Name (NI) 153**], pt in respiratory distress with RR 40, HR 130s, SBP 160s, diaphoretic, accessory muscle use.
Deep suctioning by RT returned thick, copious secretions but minimal improvement in respiratory status.
Of note, he had previously signed a DNR/DNI order but in the ED the patient reportedly expressed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the desire to undergo a limited intubation if there was a reversible process.
Past Medical History: -squamous cell carcinoma of right tongue base, s/p supraglottic laryngectomy and radical neck dissection with postoperative radiation therapy -depression -COPD -vocal cord paralysis -recurrent aspiration pna s/p recent admit to VA for reported RLL and RML PNA -s/p G tube -OA -asbestosis bilateral knee athroplasty -bilateral frozen shoulder s/p XRT -chest wall pain  Social History: Patient came to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 1186**] where he had been for rehab after recent VA hospitalization.

ecg: nsr, nl intervals/axis; isolated q-wave III, PRWP, no ischemic ST/T wave changes  CXR [**9-14**]:  1.
Mild pulmonary edema superimposed on emphysematous changes.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Brief Hospital Course: 83m w/ significant h/o oropharyngeal carcinoma s/p laryngectomy and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from rehab facility following witnessed aspiration event, subsequently intubated [**3-11**] respiratory distress.
Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated shortly after his arrival to the ICU [**3-11**] significant respiratory distress in the setting of copious secretions/ mucous plugging.
He maintained good oxygen saturations and he experienced no further respiratory distress.
After two days on mechanical ventilation he an SBT with a RSBI of 42 and was subsequently extubated without complication.
After being extubated he maintained good O2 sats and was able to handle his secretions with much less difficulty than on admission.
Pneumonia He was started on Clindamycin initially for anaerobic coverage of a presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Shortly after he was put on Vancomycin when a sputum culture on admission grew out gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
Sputum culture later more suggestive of oropharyngeal flora but continued Vancomycin as he had clinically improved and he was recently hospitalized with a pneumonia.
Patient kept NPO as patient seemed to have an aspiration event that triggered his respiratory decompensation.
It is possible that he never fully recovered from his recent pneumonia and that it may have worsened at rehab precipitating his current admission.
As noted above, unclear as to whether or not patient had primary bacterial PNA or aspiration PNA.
It is clear however that hospitalization was precipitated by aspiration event after witnessed episode of emesis.
Reportedly patient has had recurrent aspiration events and has had frequent episodes of emesis for a long period of time.
Patient currently tolerating tube feeds with no nausea and vomiting.
Hypotension/Fluid Balance:  Patient became hypotensive after intubation.
This was thought [**3-11**] to sedation and decreased preload.
He was diuresed around the time of extubation for possible fluid overload after receiving several liters of IVF.
He has residual scarring in the neck area and has had swallowing difficulties subsequent to his treatment, likely contributing to his significant aspiration history.
Patient had right clavicle osteomyelitis following his treatment and subsequently had part of his clavicle removed.
Pain Management: Patient has significant pain from his shoulders, right clavicle OM and bilateral knees.
[**Month (only) 116**] need another [**Doctor Last Name 360**] if pain worsens again.
Was kept NPO in setting of recurrent aspirations.
It was determined that should the patient redevelop respiratory distress we would NOT reintubate.
