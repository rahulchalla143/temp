Evidence of extensive air space consolidation of the left side.
Silhouetting of the left heart border in the lingula, and also some partial silhouetting of the left lower lobe.this has progressed over the course of the day.
In the right lung, there is faint opacification in the right mid zone.
The bones are unremarkable without evidence of dystrophy.
Extensive left sided air space consolidation.
Patient now intubated   Brief Hospital Course: Breifly: This is a 54 yo man with DM and ESRD due to anti-GBM disease who was admitted on [**9-19**] with ecoli sepsis and pneumonia.
He then developed a necrotizing left lung pnemonia.
1) Bacteremia-- The patient presented with Ecoli pneumonia and bacteremia thought to ne due to an infected HD line.
The patient was started on double coverage for gram nbegative rods with zosyn, levoquin, and vancomycin to cover gram positive cocci.
2)Septic shock--The patient has a increased lactate and hypotension on admission.
He remained normotensive or hypertensive off of pressors from [**9-22**] on.
3)Respiratory failure: Elective intubation in the setting of mental status change and decreasing O2 sats.
However, the patient has a large Left lobe pneumonia and L pleural effusion contributing to hypoxemia.
CXR and Chest CT from [**9-21**] revealed nearly majority of left lung with solid consolidation, no evidence of empyema.
His mental status and ventilation improved and he was weaned until [**9-24**] when developed increasing copious secretions, good cough but decreased MS again.
Over [**Date range (1) 103957**], he continued with increasing secretions and worsening mental status, no longer with successful weaning of ventilator despite CXRs with no interval change (still with majority of lung solid consolidation).
[**9-30**] CXR with small ?cystic lesions in L upper lobe consolidation, CT chest consistent with large confluent lucencies of left lung likely secondary to necrosis and Right lung base patchy infiltrates.
Bronch [**9-30**] with large amount of grey purulent material from the left lung, BAL sent for fungal, bacterial, viral, and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 103958**]; all were negative.
However, with trending of DIC labs, pt never with full manifestation of DIC and thrombocytopenia resolved with d/c of zosyn.
When Zosyn was started again for pnemonia, the patient did not have thrombocytopeina and in fact had a reactive thrombocytosis from infection.
Pt required QD or QOD dialysis since admission, which was helpful in maintaining patient's delicate fluid balance in the setting of sepsis.
Now he is getting M,W,F dialysis during which at leadt 4 lbs is taken off.
He gets dialysis through his fistula.
6)Anemia: Chronic anemia, guaiac +; likely [**2-5**] chronic dz and ESRD.
However, RUQ US was negative for obstruction or cholelithiasis/ cholecystitis.
9) HTN:  After trach and PEG placement, he had continued difficulty with hypertension with SPB in the 190-200 range.
10) Nutrition: He had a percutaneous enteral gastric tube placed on [**10-3**] with no complications.
12) Pain: The patient has chronic lower back pain secondary to herniated disk.
He is no methadone and oxycodone for breakthrough.
Avoid benzos and excessive short acting narcotics, as these measures have helped him during the past week.
Oxycodone HCl 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for back pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: necrotizing ecoli pneumonia ecoli sepsis requiring pressors ESRD and HD DMII   Discharge Condition: stable with persistent secretions.
[**Hospital1 **] will work on removing tracheostomy and PEG once your pneumonia has cleared  Followup Instructions:  WIll need to follow up with nephrologist and PCP.
