Suspect that there is a component of hypoxic brain injury.
# Shock: Likely hypovolemic shock in the setting of narcotic overdose and poor PO intake for several days.
# Acute kidney injury: Admission creatinine was 4.1 which was felt to be secondary to poor renal perfusion in the setting of hypovolemic shock.
