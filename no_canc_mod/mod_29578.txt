****************** IMAGING & STUDIES ******************  ECG The rhythm is atrial sensed ventricular paced with some ventricular paced beats as an escape in the absence of atrial activity.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2170-4-22**] no diagnostic interim change.
Extensive bilateral patchy infiltrates in predominantly a perihilar distribution.
The distribution in light of cardiomegaly favors pulmonary edema in an adult respiratory distress syndrome-type distribution.
CT Head w/o Contrast ([**2170-10-30**]) No acute intracranial findings.
Lungs are incompletely imaged on this study but are remarkable for slight improvement in degree of alveolar pulmonary edema.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present as well as adjacent basilar atelectasis and edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 14879**] is a 75 year-old retired firefighter with an extensive past medical history including chronic systolic CHF, afib s/p ablation on coumadin, HTN, and adrenal insufficiency who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with fevers, hypotension and respiratory failure and was found to have MDR Klebsiella Pneumonia.
HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE/ HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA- Mr. [**Known lastname 14879**] was intubated in the Emergency department on [**2170-10-30**] due to increased work of breathing and a respiratory rate of 40.
He was also pan-cultured and sputum cultures returned positive for multi-drug resistant klebsiella pneumonia.
HYPERTENSION: As the patient improved, he became hypertensive and was restarted on his home anti-hypertensive medications.
ANEMIA: Between [**2170-11-3**] and [**2170-11-4**], the patient had a hematocrit drop from 26.0 to 22.8 in the setting of trace guaiac positive stool.
ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF: In the context of receiving fluid boluses for pressure support in the context of sepsis the patient became significantly volume overloaded.
He was satting 92-99% on 2L of oxygen and noted symptomatic relief in his SOB and cough.
He was continued on the meropenem for his pneumonia while in the hospital, but discharged on ertapenem (for ease of administration) for a total coverage of 14 days.
Hypertension Patient was hypertensive on transfer to the floor while awaiting receiving his BP meds.
Anemia Patient's hematocrit was stable during his time on the [**Hospital1 **].
Alkalosis The patient had a respiratory alkalosis at the time of his arrival to the floor.
Chronic Systolic CHF The patient remained euvolemic to slightly volume depleted on the floor after intensive diuresis in the unit.
His furosemide was held in the context of the contraction alkalosis as noted.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR 3*/wk and adjust coumadin dose to goal INR of [**1-30**]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2732**] & Retirement Home - [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Multiple drug resistant Klebsiella Pneumonia Chronic systolic Congestive Heart Failure w/ exacerbation Hypoxic respiratory failure  Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital with fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
You were found to have a pneumonia.
Because of your difficulty breathing you were intubated and cared for in the Intensive Care Unit.
You also required a blood transfusion as a result of a low hematocrit.
