Admission Date:  [**2120-12-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-7-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2120-12-2**] Five vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending; saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, first and second obtuse marginals, and posterior descending artery [**2120-12-5**] Exploratory laparotomy, liver biopsy and cholecystectomy   History of Present Illness: This 66 year old woman has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes.
Several weeks prior to admission, she reported that she has had two episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath.
She describes having very severe shortness of breath and a feeling that there was no way she would make it to the top.
She again described having severe shortness of breath and chest pains, resolving with relaxation.
She has since seen Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 33428**] [**Name (STitle) **] in consultation and underwent stress testing that was positive for ischemia.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization on [**2120-11-21**] revealed three vessel coronary artery disease and a reduced ejection fraction without evidence of mitral regurgitation calculated at 34%.
Coronary angiography showed a codominant system; the LAD showed a 80% stenosis of the midsegment followed by sequential 80% stenosis in the distal segment, accompanied by a 80% proximal D1 stenosis; the LCX was a large, codominant vessel with an 80% midsegment stenosis and 80% OM2 and 80% OM3 stenoses; the RCA showed an 80% midsegment stenosis with a 100% distal occlusion and left to right collaterals filling the codominant RPDA.

She weaned from inotropic support without difficulty and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day one.
On postoperative day two, she developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone and beta blockade.
Early on postoperative day three, she complained of right sided abdominal pain and concomitantly experienced altered mental status.
Initial abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable while a head CT scan found no evidence for hemorrhage, or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
She rapidly declined clinically, becoming unresponsive and hypotensive with increasing oxygen requirements and decreased urine output.
She required pressors and was profoundly acidotic with an elevated lactate, low bicarbonate and high white count.
Operative findings were notable for severe liver and gall bladder congestion - there was no evidence of mesenteric ischemia as the large and small bowel appeared normal.
Liver pathology was consistent with ischemia while gall bladder findings revealed mild chronic cholecystitis.
Her acute renal failure was attributed to acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypoperfusion.
Her urine output and hyperkalemia gradually improved with intravenous Lasix and Diurel.
She concomitantly continued to experience episodes of atrial fibrillation and sinus bradycardia.
By postoperative day 10, she weaned from sedation and was re-extubated without incident.
She remained neurologically intact and weaned from pressor support without difficulty.
She maintained mostly a normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the 60-70's but continued to experience paroxsymal atrial fibrillation.
Her sternotomy and laparotomy incisions appeared clean and dry while her bilateral lower extremity incisions appeared moderately erythematous and slightly warm to touch.
