Persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ECHO Study Date of [**2115-4-25**] Conclusions: There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse; although there is no frank diastolic collapse of the right ventricle, this chamber appears compressed.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Selective coronary angiography was performed which revealed a right dominant system.
There was no angiographically apparent CAD in the LMCA, LAD, LCX, or RCA.
Hemodynamics on entry showed markedly elevated right and left heart filling pressures (RVEDP 21 mm Hg, PCWP mean 30 mm Hg), depressed cardiac index (1.6), and mild pulmonary hypertension (PASP 47 mm Hg).
The patient became hypotensive to SBP in the 70s by noninvasive measurement with a HR of 105.
An emergent echo was done, which showed a large pericardial effusion with signs worrisome for tamponade.
Post procedure, patient developed severe pericardial tamponade.
Mild pulmonary hypertension, elevated filling pressures, low cardiac output.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-4-10**] 9:16 AM  IMPRESSION:  1) Unchanged appearance of 9-mm noncalcified nodule in the right lower lobe, please follow in 3 months.
2) Increase of bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial effusion, associated with atelectasis.
3) Focal area of consolidative opacity in the posterior segment of right upper lobe, which probably is representing atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
5) Decreased ascites and splenomegaly in this patient status post liver transplant.
6) Extensive diffuse subcutaneous edema.

Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
ABDOMINAL DOPPLER US DONE SHOWED:Flow is identified within the main hepatic artery, but no definite intrahepatic arteries were visualized with flow.
*** Large pericardial effusion**** On [**2115-4-25**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization for right ventricular biopsy to assess the cause of her biventricular heart failure.
She has no coronary artery disease.
Her catheterization was complicated by a right ventricular perforation which resulted in a large pericardial effusion with evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse and tamponade.
The drain was then removed  on [**2115-4-27**] without further accumulation of the pericardial effusion.
The last echocardiogram was performed on [**2115-4-28**] and should be repeated on [**2115-5-1**] with monitoring daily of a pulsus and signs of tamponade.
She was given 60 mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **]  with minimal diuresis.
She developed a slight contraction alkalosis on the day of discharge.
As a result, our plan is to slow down her diuresis and give her diamox for her alkalosis.
Her CXR shows severe CHF and thus an infiltrate cannot be excluded.
She does admit to chronic yellowish sputum which she feels his sinusitis.
**** Liver transplant**** The patient has end-stage liver disease secondary to EtOH.
