Admission Date: [**2165-5-4**]        Discharge Date: [**2165-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-7-25**]        Sex:  Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old male with past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation, eosinophilic gastritis, coronary artery disease, and CHF who presented with bright red blood per rectum.
Patient with eosinophilic gastritis reports history of bright red blood per rectum in the past.
His symptoms have been ongoing for greater than one year in association with his eosinophilic pneumonia.
The patient denied any complaints of dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or other complaints.
Finally, a right IJ central line was placed; and at this time, his INR returned, which was noted to be elevated at 31.
Subsequently, he developed a large hematoma in his right subclavian region.
On arrival in the MICU, the patient denied any acute complaints.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or shortness of breath.
Positive chronic pain in the lower chest region ongoing for greater than one year.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, type II, on insulin.
Diabetic neuropathy.
Diabetic retinopathy.
Diabetic nephropathy.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.8.
Coronary artery disease, status post multiple stents.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 35 to 40 percent.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on amiodarone and Coumadin.
Zoster with chronic pain in T8 dermatomal distribution.
Chronic bowel and bladder incontinence.
Eosinophilic gastritis with peripheral eosinophilia.
Iron deficiency anemia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He is widowed with his wife recently dying from colon cancer in [**2163**].
No alcohol or IV drug use.
Chest: A 10 x 15 cm hematoma extending from the manubrium to the right distal edge of the clavicle.
Cardiovascular:  Distant heart sounds, regular rate, S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No hepatomegaly.
No femoral bruits.
A 1 cm hematoma is in the bilateral groins.
No acute ST or T wave changes.
Intraventricular conduction delay unchanged from previous EKGs.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  GI bleed:  The patient presents with bright red blood per rectum x 2 days.
Patient with known eosinophilic gastritis with a recent exacerbation and had been on steroids for approximately one day.
His GI bleed was thought to be most likely due to his combination of gastritis and steroids in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
Upon arrival in the emergency department, he had a rectal exam, which showed dark blood.
He then underwent anoscopy, which showed blood in addition to some nonbleeding internal hemorrhoids.
No active source of bleeding was localized.
The proximal bulb did show mild erythema consistent with duodenitis.
This study was also normal with no clear bleeding source localized.
Given the patient's lack of any further bleeding with normalization of his INR and no clear bleeding source localized with multiple GI studies, decision was made to send the patient home with close monitoring as an outpatient.
Eosinophilic gastritis:  Patient with history of eosinophilic gastritis with difficult to control symptoms over the previous year.
He had recently been started on steroids given his acute exacerbation of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the previous month.
Upon admission, steroids were held given concern for his GI bleed and he did have mild diarrhea.
During his EGD, a biopsy of his stomach was obtained, which did return as consistent with eosinophilic gastritis as per his previous diagnosis.
The patient is to follow up with GI as an outpatient with possible consideration of the initiation of steroids for symptomatic relief should his symptoms otherwise remain stable.
He reports he had been taking his home dose of Coumadin as directed and denies any medication or dietary noncompliance.
Hematoma:  Patient with multiple central line placement attempts in the setting of an elevated INR.
Felt multiple hematomas including small groin hematomas bilaterally and a large right subclavian hematoma.
Vascular surgery was consulted and ultrasound was obtained, which was negative for pseudoaneurysm.
Anemia:  Patient with acute anemia in the setting of GI bleed.
Cardiovascular:  Patient with atrial fibrillation on amiodarone, beta-blocker, and Coumadin.
He had ________ ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35 to 45 percent.
Psychiatric:  Patient with chronic pain.
He was continued on methadone and Neurontin as per his outpatient regimen with Percocet for breakthrough pain.
This was thought to be improving in the setting of GI bleed and hypotension.
His creatinine gradually returned to his baseline, and he had no further renal issues.
No active COPD exacerbation.
Eosinophilic gastritis.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
Acute renal failure.
Chronic pain.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
