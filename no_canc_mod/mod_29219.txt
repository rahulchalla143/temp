Pt had low flow via PD catheter during last few days prior to admit and therefore went to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheter revision.
Procedure completed without complications, but pt developed respiratory distress after extubation.
CXR showed mild flash pulmonary edema.
MICU evaluation requested due to respiratory distress.
Renal attg also consulted by surgery team and overnight monitoring in MICU was requested with possible peritoneal dialysis.
Past Medical History: # ESRD on PD # HTN # Diastolic CHF   Social History: # Tobacco: Never # Alcohol: Rare # Personal: Lives with three children at home.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS (in PACU): T Afebrile, BP 126/80, HR 55, RR 24, O2sat 100% on BiPAP 5/8 GEN: Uncomfortable [**1-25**] BiPAP mask, but NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, BiPAP mask in place NECK: No JVD elevation, supple RESP: Coarse BS throughout with crackles up to mid-way b/l CV: RR, S1/S2 WNL, no m/r/g ABD: Soft, ND, +BS, tender over PD catheter site EXT: No c/c/e, warm, good pulses SKIN: No rashes/no jaundice NEURO: A&Ox3, moving all extremities   Pertinent Results: Admission labs: .
EKG: Sinus bradycardia at 54, normal axis, normal intervals, no acute ST changes, minimally peaked T waves in V2, V3.
No clear infiltrate.
Brief Hospital Course: 47M h/o ESRD on PD, HTN, diastolic CHF p/w respiratory distress after elective PD catheter revision.
# Respiratory distress: Pt initially admitted for peritoneal catheter revision, but BP to 190/90 after extubation post-procedure with acute SOB and desat to 80s.
CXR showed likely pulmonary vascular congestion in setting of known diastolic heart failure.
Ambulatory O2sat later 93-97% with no SOB.
# ESRD/PD revision: Pt producing urine, PD catheter operating.
Also issued script for oxycodone 5mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN pain x 2 days.
# Hyperkalemia [**1-25**] ESRD: K = 5.7 in PACU with EKG demonstrating only minimal peaked T waves in V2, V3; pt on standing Kayexelate as outpatient.
# Sinus bradycardia: Pt transiently bradycardic, resolved during MICU admission.
# HTN:  Brief episode of hypertension to 190/90 after extubation likely contributing to respiratory distress.
Oxycodone 5 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for pain for 2 days.
Disp:*4 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) Peritoneal catheter revision 2) Respiratory distress likely secondary to pulmonary edema 3) End stage renal disease .
Secondary: 4) Hypertension 5) Diastolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: Ambulatory oxygen saturation 93-97%   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital to readjust your peritoneal catheter.
After the surgery, you had a high blood pressure which caused you to become short of breath due to excess fluid in your lungs.
When you leave the hospital you will need to take some additional mediations: 1) Lasix 200mg by mouth twice daily 2) Kayexalate 15grams daily (to help control your potassium level) .
