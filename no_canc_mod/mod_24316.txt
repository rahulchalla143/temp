Patient was admitted on [**2165-6-5**] for complaints of a progressive severe cough for 2 months with three days of coughing up blood tinged mucus mixed in with some clots.
A CT scan was ordered which revealed a 4.8 cm thoracic aortic aneurysm.
PET CT showed multiple bilateral FDG avid nodules.
In the interim, a pANCA level came back positive, along with an ESR of 115 and a newly discovered anemia of 8.0, and she was seen by Rheumatology, who facilitated elective admission to the hospital for further workup.
She was admitted to MICU for monitoring in setting of blood loss, CXR appearance showing diffuse opacities, and concern for hemoptysis.
Chest tube removed on [**6-8**] without complications.

Renal and lung biopsy negative for infectious agents .
Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody is clinically significant and capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions.

There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidation are nonspecific.
However, given the clinical and laboratory data for this patient, they are most consistent with widespread hemorrhage likely secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis or other vasculitis.

[**6-12**] Renal Biopsy: Necrotizing extracapillary (crescentic) glomerulonephritis ,pauci-immune type consistent with glomerulonephritis of the ANCA-associated vasculitic syndromes (see note).
NOTE: Sections reveal fragments of renal parenchyma containing approximately 30 glomeruli, two of which are globally sclerotic.
About 20% of the others show cellular/fibrocellular crescents of varying sizes and associated with fibrinoid necrosis (the extent of involvement by crescents varies greatly from level to level, up to 50%).

Brief Hospital Course: 66yo woman with a h/o HTN, CAD s/p CABG and mechanical [**Hospital3 9642**] bileaflet aortic valve placed 20 years ago on coumadin, presented with hemoptysis, lung nodules, microscopic hematuria with positive P-ANCA, elevated ESR, CRP.
Renal biopsy showed necrotizing extracapillary (crescentic) glomerulonephritis, pauci-immune type consistent with glomerulonephritis of the ANCA-associated vasculitic syndrome.
[**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by a post renal biopsy perinephric bleed and then a larger more expansive retroperitoneal bleed which ultimately self tamponaded with no need for open surgery or IR guided interventions.
# Hemoptysis/Microscopic hematuria: Patient presented with hemoptysis,lung nodules with +pANCA with working diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis/Microscopic Polyangiitis and admission was facilitated by outpatient rhuematology for INR reversal and lung biopsy.
Due to worsening hemoptysis and anemia she was directly admittted to MICU.
She had CT chest consistent with widespread hemorrhage thought to be secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis or other vasculitis given concurrent renal insufficiency and active urinary sediments.
She then had a renal biopsy on [**2165-6-11**] which confirmed diagnosis of ANCA associated vasculitis.
Her course was complicated by an initial perinephric hematoma with bleeding and later by an expanding retroperotineal bleed after being re-bridged back to oral coumadin over a week after her surgery.
Throughout the later half of her hospital course she continued to have hematuria on urine studies but no gross hematuria appreciated.
She had no recurrent bouts of hemoptysis after initial few days in the hospital and this issue appeared to have stabilized by time of discharge.
# [**Last Name (un) **]/Microscopic hematuria: On UA patient had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria with active sediments with a large amount of WBC and RBC and fat bodies.
Renal biopsy showed necrotizing extracapillary (crescentic) glomerulonephritis ,pauci-immune type consistent with glomerulonephritis of the ANCA-associated vasculitic syndromes.
There was a maximum increase to Cr 1.5 during mid-[**Month (only) 205**] with potential pre-renal and intrinsic kidney damage to blame in the setting of known blood loss issues at that time.
Of note, after she was started on IV cytoxan the first week in [**Month (only) 205**], it was noted that just after one week there was noticeable improvement in renal function as well as decrease in active urinary sediments.
# Perinephric and retroperitoneal bleeds: Two days after renal biopsy patient was started on heparin bridge to coumadin.
7 days later, while waiting for the INR to become therapuetic she developed severe abdmominal pain with CT scan showing perinephric and subcapsular hematoma.
Two days after being put on heparin she again developed worsening abdominal pain with hemodynamic instability and was found to have a worsened retroperitoneal bleed.
She was taken to interventional radiology for embolization, but no active source of bleeding was found.
She had a brief hematocrit drop on [**2165-7-11**] to 22.8, for which she was transfused an additional unit of blood and subsequently had a CT abdomen and pelvis which revealed no new bleeding source and stability of her perinephric bleed.
# Anticoagulation: Ms. [**Known lastname 88713**] has an aortic mechanical AVR that was placed over 20 years ago at [**Location (un) 511**] [**Hospital **] Hospital.
Per ECHO and patient's cardiologist she has bileaflet mechanical valve with normal EF, no history of afib, or additonal hypercoagulable conditions.
in the setting of a pulmonary biopsy, then later for her renal biopsy.
After realizing active intra-abdominal/RP bleeding with dropping HCTs she also had her anticoagulation held in the ICU setting later in her hospital course.
Heparin was briefly stopped given a small hematocrit drop on [**7-6**] while INR was 1.8, but soon thereafter it was restarted with Coumadin.
#Anemia: Patient became anemic one month prior to presentation most likely in the setting of hemoptysis and microscopic hematuria.
10 days after the renal biopsy patient developed a retropertotenial bleed further contributing to her anemia.
Plan at discharge was for VNA and PCP to help check her Hct within a few days of discharge to make sure it continued to remain stable.
# Elevated LFTs: During the hospital course patient had mild elevation in LFTs and increased in D-bili most likely cholestasis from Bactrim.
Patient did not have any active signs or symptoms of infections.
# HTN: Blood pressure was initially on the low side and her captopril, lasix, spironolactone were held in the setting of low BP and RP/perinephric bleeding issues.
Several days after her active bleed seemed to have stabilized in the ICU she had blood pressures adjusted again to include labetolol, TID captopril and amlodipine in order to ensure elevated blood pressures did not set off additional bleeding.
# CAD: Stable.
Patient did not complain of any chest pain during hospital course.
Aspirin was held in setting of numerous biopsies and then her bleeding complications.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: ANCA-associated vasculitis, Anemia secondary to perinephric hematoma and retroperitoneal bleed  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension, Coronary Artery Disease, Gout   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were directly admitted to the ICU where your symptoms and blood levels were closely monitored.
Therefore, at the recommendations of our rheumatology and renal teams, you underwent a kidney biopsy on [**6-11**] which demonstrated inflammatory changes in your kidneys consistent with ANCA-associated vasculitis.
You received your first treatment of Cytoxan on [**2165-6-13**] without experiencing any decreased white blood cell counts.
Unfortunately, your red blood cell levels (Hematocrit) decreased significantly due to a bleed around your kidneys which occurred after the renal biopsy.
This bleeding complication was likely because your blood was thinned on recent anticoagulation medicine.
This bleeding was in your abdomen and pelvic area (retroperitoneal space) and it was monitored on both abdominal ultrasounds and CT scans.
Your anti-coagulation medication was stopped and later restarted once your bleeding appeared to have stopped.
You eventually stabilized in the ICU, and you were then transferred back to the general medical floor on [**2165-7-6**] where you fortunately did not have any further bleeding complications until your discharge on [**2165-7-13**].
He will be organizing your monthly Cytoxan therapy for your new diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis.
In addition, we changed your medications to allow for better control of your new ANCA-associated diagnosis and blood pressure.
