He was given IV antibiotics and had new implant later that year and has no complicated since then.
Few days later, noted right knee pain when he stood up and "twisted" his knee.
He came to the OSH ED where he was febrile and found to have right septic knee.
He met sepsis criteria with fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis and was started on ceftriaxone (day 1/1/8 in evening) and vanco (day 1=[**1-20**]).
Pt had arthrocentesis on [**1-22**] which showed frank pus.
no ST or TWI changes.
Pt also reported indigestion pain.
No chest pain.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was in moderate distress with venturi mask in place.
He is c/o dyspnea and mild Gerd-like symptoms.

No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
However, due to suboptimal bolus timing, evaluation of subsegmental arteries is limited.
Ground-glass opacities at the right lung base, likely a combination of atelectasis and aspiration.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule measuring 5 mm.
Prominent right and left pulmonary arteries, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
Left adrenal adenoma.
Diffuse thickening of the esophagus, likely due to diffuse esophagitis, with a small hiatal hernia.

The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M with COPD, CAD and b/l knee replacements, transferred from OSH on [**2198-1-22**] with a septic right knee, underwent debridement with hardware repair by ortho surgery.
Hospital course complicated by aflutter with RVR and hypotension, fluid overload with pulmonary edema, knee hematoma s/p repeat washout, postop ileus, retroperitoneal bleed, UGIB from esophagitis, delerium and [**Last Name (un) **].
# Septic R knee - Initially admitted to the medicine service for a septic R knee, then sent to ortho for debridement.
He required a second debridement of hematoma a few days later, and was then treated with a wound vac until wound could be closed.
# Atrial flutter - Found to be in aflutter on admission.
Thought to be related to his septic knee.
Post-ablation he had atrial fib/aberrancy requiring diltiazem for rate control eventually requiring maximum dose diltiazem as well as increasing doses of metoprolol.
However, anticoagulation was held due to multiple bleeding risks, including active UGIB, a large RP bleed and hematoma s/p washout of the right knee.
# Retroperitoneal bleed - On [**2-4**], his Hct began to trend down to around 22.
He then complained of L back pain and was found to have an RP bleed.
# Suspicion for coronary disease- on [**2-12**] he had some episodes of tachycardia, during which time an EKG showed anterior ST depressions.
These resolved with decreased heart rate.
This implies he may have some coronary plaque burden.
# Melena: The patient's Hct continued to trend down in the setting of a stable RP bleed.
During his MICU stay, the patient had 2-3 episodes of black tarry stool.
The patient underwent an EGD that showed esophagitis, gastritis, and duodenitis, but no active bleeding and no intervention was undertaken.
# Hypoxia/hypercapnia/delirium - His ventilation and oxygenation status varied throughout his hospitalization.
He was very tachypneic due to infection on admission, and then intubated in the SICU.
After extubation his delirium slowly resolved.
On [**2-5**], he required MICU transfer for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Chest imaging showed slight pulmonary edema, but no consolidations.
His hypoxia resolved by the time of discharge with daily lasix doses.
# Acute kidney injury - His basline creatinine was around 0.8.
He had intermittent kidney injury with cr up to 1.4 during the hospitalization.
Likely ATN in the setting of hypotension vs. contrast.
CHRONIC # COPD - does not use O2 at home.
Required O2 while in hospital likely due to pulmonary edema.
-- consider resuming coumadin after his repeat EGD in mid-[**Month (only) 958**] -- PFTs should be repeated, with possible sleep study to evaluate for OSA -- Lung nodule seen on imaging that needs to be followed up with repeat CT scan in [**6-26**] months.
