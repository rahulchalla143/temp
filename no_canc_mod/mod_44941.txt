with history of CHF unkown EF who recently stopped taking her medications admitted [**4-14**] with increasing progressive SOB at OSH who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization and work-up for CAD.
She reports an occassional cough that is not productive.
The patient reports that she has not had increasing frequency of of PND.
Denies LE edema or weight gain.
In addition to SOB, the patient reports weakness and inability to push a vaccuum cleaner, a normal activity of hers also within the time frame of when she developed SOB.
She denies chest pain accompanying her SOB.
She presented to the OSH ED with SOB because it was not improving.
Patient's shortness of breath continued and for further work-up the patient underwent a Persantine stress which showed an old IMI, moderate inferior wall ishcemia and an EF 22%.

The patient also has CAP w/ associated pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and e/o granulomatous lung/liver/mediastinum lesions, which is chronic.
Acute systolic congestive heart failure: Patient presented in a hypervolemic state with crackles at the lung bases bilaterally, anteriorly and trace pitting edema of right LE.
Patient's persantine stress test at the outside hospital showed an EF 22% and evidence of old inferior MI and moderate inferior wall ischemia.
The patient was diuresed with 80mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] with diuresis of approximately 1.5 liters of fluid daily.
Discussion with the patient's outpatient cardiologist revealed that the patient had a dilated cardiomyopathy in the setting of a stressful situation that then resolved.
Prior ECHOs as an outpatient did not show evidence of ischemia.
Coronary artery disease: Patient found to have disease in the LCx, LAD, and RCA on left heart catheterization upon presentation.
No intervention was done as the patient did not tolerate the procedure well secondary to respiratory status.
# Left Ventricular Thrombus and Cardioembolic Stroke: Patient was noted to have a left ventricular thrombus present on TTE [**2137-4-16**].
Patient was initiated on anticoagulation with warfarin, bridging with IV heparin, given risk of cardioembolic stroke.
On [**2137-4-21**], she was noted to have a R gaze deviation and left hemiplegia.
A CTA Head/Neck and CTP were performed showing an increased MTT suggestive of a large ischemic area.
An MRI revealed small punctate DWI/ADC changes suggesting acute cerebral ischemia, predominantly in the R hemisphere.
Given these small strokes, the recommendation from the Stroke Service is to delay PCI/stenting for at least one week (ideally [**5-10**] weeks) to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic conversion when giving dual antiplatelet therapy and therapeutic anticoagulation.
Her neurologic deficits lessened with only mild L hemiparesis (4+ to 5- in an upper motor neuron pattern) on [**2137-4-22**], and nearly completely resolved by time of discharge.
# Chronic Granulomas: The patient had significant evidence of bilateral granulomas in lungs, liver, mediastinum are chronic (>10yrs old, from [**Hospital6 10353**]) based upon prior imaging that was ascertained from previous hospitals.
Pt had a adenosine deaminase that was very low, and not suggestive of TB in pleural fluid.
In the setting of no symptoms such as fever, cough, we had very low likelihood that this was active TB.
The patient had a weakly positive histoplasma urine antigen and the patient said she spent a lot of time on farms growing up.
Chronic granulomas are likely secondary to a chronic or old process, and no intervention since patient is asymptomatic.
Pleural effusion likely secondary to another process (CHF).
# Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia: Patient with 27 beats of asymptomatic NSVT at the outside hospital, prior to transfer.
Patient's runs of NSVT were thought to be due to ventricular stretch in the setting of poor systolic function.
Patient was asymptomatic through these episodes, and they were thought to be secondary to underlying systolic CHF.
Infectious disease was consulted given the unusual bacteria isolated from culture.
Under infectious disease's guidance, the patient was transitioned to antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia with Ceftiraxone and Azithromycin.
Given that the patient was not treated with any antibiotics that would treat VRE while at OSH or here, and no growth on our pleural fluid cultures, we believe this "broth" finding may have been a contaminant.
# RUE Hematoma: On approx [**4-23**], it was noticed that the patient had a significant, likely intramuscular, hematoma near the proximal humerus area.
No trauma was noted by pt throughout hospitalization.
The patient had a Xray and ultrasound, consistent w/ hematoma and some chronic changes.
Patient's acute kidney injury likely due to pre-renal etiology, possibly secondary to underlying systolic heart failure.
Hypertension: Patient denies, though the patient's history of hypertension was confirmed with her outpatient Cardiologist.
Patient was continued on Metoprolol and lisinopril through her inpatient hospitalization, without episodes of hypertension.
Follow-up with outpatient cardiologist for both CHF and regarding intervention for known coronary artery disease.
Follow-up with [**Hospital1 18**] neurology 3. follow-up with PCP once pt returns from [**Hospital1 1501**] 4. follow-up with [**Hospital1 18**] pulmonary disease 5. follow-up with [**Hospital1 18**] infectious disease 6. f/u TFTs as an outpatient 7.
Ovoid sclerotic density centered in the posterior cortex of the proximal humeral diaphysis, slightly exophytic.
No clearly aggressive features.
In the absence of known malignancy, sclerotic metastasis is considered much less likely.
Clinical correlation and, if indicated, follow-up radiograph in [**4-7**] months could help to assess for stability.
