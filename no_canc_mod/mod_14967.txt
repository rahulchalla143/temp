Blood pressure at [**Location (un) 8641**] was initially 169/91, and per report was "moving only left arm to painful stimuli" and left pupil was fixed and dilated.
She was med flighted by helicopter from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 1170**] after head CT there showed large left thalamic bleed.
Repeat head CT after arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] showed extension of the bleed and now involvment of all ventricles, shift to the right, and obstructive hydrocephalus.
The Neurosurgery team evaluated the patient in the ED and did not recommend any surgical intervention given extent of bleed and poor prognosis for meaningful recovery.
Per discussion with Mrs.[**Name (NI) 57229**] son, her wishes in this case would be DNR/DNI with no aggressive surgical interventions.
Hypertension 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction 1-2 years ago, status post stents 4.
History of gastrointestional bleeding 5.
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia   Social History: Lived alone.
No spontaneous eye opening.
No scleral icterus or injection.
2+ peripheral pulses throughout.
No Doll's eyes.

There is also blood in the right lateral ventricle, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle.
There is mild subfalcine herniation, left to right.
There is left to right subfalcian herniation and transtentorial hernaition of the left medial temporal lobe, although the suprasellar cistern is preserved.
There is subfalcine and transtentorial herniation secondary to a large hemorrhage centered in the left thalamus and basal ganglia.
In addition, there is evidence of developing obstructive hydrocephalus.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 76 year old woman with history hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease who presented with large intracranial hemorrhage after being found down at home.
On initial exam, she had evidence of brainstem compression; however, she still had some brainstem reflexes.
