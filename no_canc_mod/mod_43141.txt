# Hypoglycemia: Likely due to starvation and EtOH leading to decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis.
Anion-gap 17 but urine from ED notable for absence of ketones.
Other etiologies includes exogenous use of insulin, renal failure and hypothyroidism.
# Seizure: Unclear if actual seizure vs. acute intoxication.
If true seizure, possibly EtOH withdrawal vs. hypoglycemia vs. other toxic-metabolic cause.
No evidence brain mass or CNS infection was noted on imaging or LP.
