Because of the change in mental status as well as right hemiplegia, he was taken to the OR for a craniotomy and evacuation.
Currently, he will move his upper extremities purposefully, however, he has no promixal lower extremity movement but will wiggle his toes.
He is tolerating his tube feeds, his staples were removed from his head and the incision was well healing.
He was noted to have a right arm cellulitis so he was started on Keflex.
He had some low grade temperatures.
A CBC did not show any evidence of a leukocytosis and UA was negative.
Because he has been sedentary, lower extremity dopplers were obtained, which did not show any evidence of DVT.
The low grade temperatures are likely secondary to the cellulitis.
Patient has also had low calcium and phosphorus, which has been repleted.
He should also have a Dilantin level repeated on Tuesday.
