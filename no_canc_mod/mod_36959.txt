Admission Date:  [**2126-6-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-6-9**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 812**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 85 yo F with a past medical history of afib, avr/mvr, SSS s/p pm, CHF presents with altered mental status.
Throughout this time, patient had been interactive, lucid and with baseline mental status.
She was reporting some mild dyspnea, and a horase voice, but denied dysuria, chest pain, palpitations, and syncope.
Family reports poor po intake over the last several weeks, and that patient has been overall discouraged with need for two hospitalizations in the last 6 weeks.
CXR, per ED interpretation, was concerning for right sided consolidation.
Family decided to make patient DNR/I, with decision to treat with antibiotics, but without central lines, pressors or invasive procedures.
Patient received 1 L NS, Vancomycin 1 g IV x1, Zosyn 4.5 g IV x1, and Vitamin K 10 mg IVx1 for an elevated INR at 12.
In the ICU, patient is sedated and only grimaces to verbal and mechanical stimuli.

Increased regions of consolidation in the right lung, which may indicate infection.
Followup chest radiograph after appropriate therapy is indicated to exclude underlying pulmonary mass.
No acute intracranial abnormalities.
Specifically, no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
Echo ([**2126-6-3**]) - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Portable CXR [**2126-6-7**]: Compared with earlier the same day, there ay be mild increase in the degree of vascular plethora.
Pacemaker with tip in enlarged RV and prosthetic heart valve noted.
ECG [**2126-6-7**]: Atrial fibrillation.
Left axis deviation is probably due to left anterior fascicular block but consider also possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Probable prior anterior wall myocardial infarction.
ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2126-6-2**] axis appears further leftward and delayed R wave progression is more prominent.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo F with a past medical history of afib, avr/mvr, SSS s/p pm, CHF who presented with fatigue, was found to have hypoxia to 68% at triage, and progressively worsening mental status in the ER.
Pneumonia: Patient with R infiltrate on CXR with relative leukocytosis and recent AMS which may secondary to infection/PNA.
She was placed on BiPAP, given her hypercapnia and poor respiratory status.
Given the patient's poor clinical appearance at that time, her antibiotics were broadened back to HCAP and aspiration PNA coverage, with vancomycin, cefepime, and cipro.
She remained at goal with 1-2L oxygen via nasal cannula until night of [**2126-6-7**] when she was found to be tachypneic with RR 50s.
Labs revealed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis with HCO3 41; ABG pH 7.41, pO2 54, pCO2 65.
Altered mental status: Unclear precipitant, but likely influenced by hypercarbia and pneumonia.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have had some confusion from mild uremia and UTI (although UA dirty).
Given elevated INR, head CT was done which was negative for acute bleed.
ACS seemed less likely as EKG was at baseline, but troponin was mildly elevated in the setting of renal dysfunction.
Pneumonia was treated as above, but mental status continued to wax/wane.
Mental status transiently improved somewhat after patient received trazodone to help sleep but thereafter worsened upon onset of respiratory distress (see above).
Unclear if altered mental status was causing retention of CO2, or if altered mental status was created by [**Name Initial (PRE) 109031**].
Patient had history of low FEV1, but was a nonsmoker and had no spirometry for the last 15 years.
Son, however, reported long term second hand smoke exposure so may have had some component of obstruction based on prior smoke exposure.
No prior ABG was available for comparison but we started albuterol and ipratropium nebs for possible obstruction.
Pneumonia was treated as above but ultimately patient passed due to worsening respiratory distress.
Goals of care: On presentation, family aware that patient had acute on subacute decline, and understood that patient would not want artificial life support for extended period of time.
Family opted to treat all reversible processes, but did not want CVL, mechanical ventilation, or invasive procedures.
# Supratherapeutic INR: Patient had been placed on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
On admission, INR was elevated to 12, may be secondary to poor nutrtion or medicine malcompliance.
# CKD: Since [**2126-1-7**], baseline Cr 1.4 - 2.
Cr 1.8 on admission, likely secondary to prerenal etiology given dry appearance.
# UTI: Patient had history of multiple UTIs.
Patient's broad spectrum antibiotic regimen for pneumonia would have also covered urinary pathogens.
Lasix was initially held during hospital course because she appeared dry on exam and had history of minimal po intake.
BNP 25,000 but there were no priors for comparison.
Repeat TTE showed moderate TR and moderate pulmonary HTN improved from prior.
On [**2126-6-6**] patient showed increasing tachypnea and had crackles on exam; she improved with 20mg IV lasix.
# SSS: No acute issues.
