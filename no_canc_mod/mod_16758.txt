HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63 year old male with a history of hypertension and colon cancer status post hemicolectomy who is status post a nine foot fall from the cab of his truck on [**2188-10-2**].
The patient was reportedly down for about two hours before help arrived and has had changes in mental status since his fall.
He was originally seen at the [**Hospital 1558**] Hospital where he was admitted and found to have a left scalp abrasion that was sutured, a left clavicle fracture, left rib fractures and a head CT scan that did not show any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
His next CT scan was also negative for fracture.
The pain was controlled there with percocet and he was cleared by Physical Therapy for discharge home with a creatinine of 2.4 at discharge.
At home, however, he was unable to carry out his activities of daily living, became short of breath and was brought to an outside hospital Emergency Room where his CK was noted to be 2456 and he was noted to have a troponin T of 2.4, creatinine of 3.5, and had an O2 saturation of only 81% on five liters nasal cannula.
A chest CT scan demonstrated right upper lobe and right lower lobe consolidation consistent with bronchopulmonary pneumonia thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
No pneumothorax was seen.
Given the patient's white blood cell count elevation, infiltrate and hypoxia, he was given one gram of ceftriaxone, aspirin for positive cardiac enzymes and morphine sulfate for pain and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further care.
The patient was noted to have unequal blood pressures in his arms and a transthoracic echocardiogram was carried out to rule out dissection.
The transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence of aortic or thoracic dissection and showed mile regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with posterior and apical hypokinesis.
Colon cancer status post hemicolectomy in [**2175**].
Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy.
Remote history of Hepatitis B approximately 25 years ago.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Has occasional ethanol.
Neck with no lymphadenopathy.
Chest with diffuse rales and rhonchi on the right; clearer on the left but dullness is present at the left base.
Extremities with no edema, clubbing or cyanosis.
There are no ST or T wave changes.
Chest x-ray demonstrates minimally displaced rib fractures within the fifth, sixth and seventh left ribs posteriorly as well as a depressed fracture of the left clavicle which is displaced inferiorly by the width of the bone.
There is no pneumothorax.
Mild congestive heart failure is evidenced by vascular engorgement.
The patient was begun on antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia and was placed on aspirin, beta blockers, given the elevated cardiac enzymes on admission.
The patient's O2 saturations initially stabilized on therapy for presumed aspiration pneumonia and the patient was transferred to the Floor.
However, on the day of transfer, the patient had a further episode of hypoxia and hypotension with a drop in his systolic blood pressure to the 80s.
The patient demonstrated increasing agitation and required 50 mg of Haldol for sedation.
PULMONARY:  The patient's hypoxia was most likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia as well as fluid overload.
CARDIAC:  The patient was noted to have nonspecific inferior ST depressions with T wave inversions, that were 1 mm in V4 through V6 in the setting of sinus tachycardia.
On another occasion, the patient was noted to have T wave inversions in III and AVF with 1/[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in V4 and V5.
On a further occasion, the patient was noted again in the setting of sinus tachycardia to have [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in V4 through V6.
The patient was monitored on Telemetry and was noted to undergo atrial fibrillation at a rate of 140 on the [**10-10**] with V4 through V6 ST depressions of 1 mm.
Telemetry demonstrated further intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation with rates up to 160 and a possible ten beat run of Ventricular tachycardia.
Transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation, mildly depressed ejection fraction with posterior / apical hypokinesis and no evidence of dissection.
Furthermore, the transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis.
His elevated cardiac enzymes were thought to be primarily due to renal failure in the setting of rhabdomyolysis as well as demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia.
The patient was begun on high dose beta blocker for rate control of his atrial fibrillation and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
He was anti-coagulated with heparin for prophylaxis of his atrial fibrillation.
Persantine MIBI was carried out on the [**10-15**] and did not demonstrate any significant ischemic ST segment changes.
There was no evidence of fixed or perfusion defects on nuclear study.
Diffuse hypokinesis and depressed ejection fraction of approximately 30% was noted.
The patient was initially taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on the [**10-23**], but was unable to undergo the procedure at that time secondary to mental status changes and the cardiac catheterization was deferred to a later date.
The patient was noted to have intermittent episodes of hypotension during subsequent hospitalization and his beta blockers and ACE inhibitor doses were titrated.
It was difficult to ascertain the patient's baseline creatinine level as he is not per report had blood work done recently prior to this admission; however, on admission to the [**Hospital 28978**] Hospital, shortly after his fall, he was noted to have an elevated creatinine of 2.6.
Renal ultrasound was carried out on the [**10-7**] and revealed diffusely increased echogenicity of the renal parenchyma bilaterally consistent with chronic parenchymal disease.
Overall, the study was consistent with arterial vascular disease.
No hydronephrosis or proximal hydroureter was seen on the study.
The patient's change in mental status were characterized by confusion that appeared to have a temporal component to it, with confusion occurring at its greatest at night time.
At times, the patient was noted to have paranoid delusions.
However, he never demonstrated any clear auditory or visual hallucinations.
A CT scan of the head was obtained and did not demonstrate any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
