At that time cath demonstrated clean coronaries, but trop reached 3.0, and regional LV systolic dysfunction.
No echo performed.
Went to OSH with coffee ground emesis.
OG tube was flushed and did not clear, but no BRB - was dark colored.
No further emesis.
CT torso obtained given recent instrumentation that showed airspace opacities in right, middle, and upper lobes, c/w aspiration and pneumonia.
GI consult felt this was likely not variceal bleed and said would see first thing in AM.
At time of transfer, HR 105, 124/69, RR16, 93%2-3L NC, patient with 4 large guage peripheral IV's.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Extensive right diffuse airspace opacification in a pattern that suggests aspiration or bronchopneumonia.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: No active bleeding seen, no varices.
CTA abdomen/pelvis ([**3-17**]): The lung bases demonstrate scattered patchy opacities which are more prominent on the right and may represent small foci of pneumonia.
There are small bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The liver, spleen, adrenals, pancreas and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are unremarkable.
Wall thickening and stranding along the hepatic flexure to the mid ascending colon is slightly less conspicuous since [**2193-3-16**].
Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of lesions that is suspicious for metastatic or infectious focus, with multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine which are similar to [**2193-3-16**].
A linear lucency along the superior right acetabulum (3B:372) likely represents nondisplaced fracture.
There is no evidence of ischemia with resolution of portal venous and mesenteric air since yesterday.
CXR ([**3-19**]): Bilateral airspace with greater involvement on the right is slightly improved.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Old rib fracture noted on the right.
IMPRESSION: Improving aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.
Microbiology: urine cx ([**3-16**]) negative blood cx ([**3-16**]) no growth to date MRSA screen ([**3-16**]) negative Influenza a/b antigen negative ([**3-16**]) C diff toxin negative ([**3-18**])  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 51 y/o M w/ hep C who presented with UGIB after 3d of high dose ibuprofen for new dx of myopericarditis manifested by coffee ground emesis and aspiration pneumonia.
# GI Bleed: Evidence of gastritis and [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear on endoscopy with hematocrits stable after 2 U prbcs given in the ICU.
He also had a new finding of colitis on colonoscopy but this was not likely source for bleed.
- PPI [**Hospital1 **] - Monitor Hct daily  # Aspiration pneumonia: The patient presented after vomiting with fever, elevated WBC count, and CXR/CT findings of infiltrate, making pneumonia likely [**2-25**] to aspiration of gastric contents.
He was negative for influenza on admission.
# Tachycardia: Tachycardia on admission resolved with volume repletion, likely resultant from bleeding.
Tamponade was considered but echocardiogram showed a trivial pericardial effusion.
# Myo-pericarditis: Enzymes were trending down on admission.
Echo showed trivial effusion as above.
# Colitis: Unclear etiology but considered etiologies include ischemic vs. inflammatory.
Surgery evaluated the patient after portal gas was seen on his first CT chest; on repeat CTA the next day, there was no evidence of portal gas.
Pain was controlled with PO morphine.
# Acetabular rim fracture: The patient was found to have a fracture on CT scan of the abdomen.
Orthopedic consultation was obtained who recommended two months of touchdown weight bearing and two months of posterior hip dislocation precautions.
# Hepatitis: No evidence of varices on endoscopy.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 1474**] Veteran's Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia Right-sided colitis, NOS Gastritis, probably NSAID-induced Upper GI bleed secondary to [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear Right acetabular rim fracture Recent viral myopericarditis  Discharge Condition: Afebrile, normotensive, comfortable on room air/ 2L NC  Discharge Instructions: You have been evaluated for your nausea/vomiting and were found to have an irritation of the stomach ("gastritis") as well as a small tear in the lining of the esophagus.
You were also found to have a right hip fracture; you will need to continue touchdown weight-bearing only for two months.
You were treated for a pneumonia while in the hospital.
Please contact your primary care physician or return to the emergency room should you develop any of the following: fever > 101, chills, difficulty breathing, increased cough, increased abdominal pain, inability to take in liquids or medications due to nausea or vomiting, blood in the stools, or any other concerns.
Please call his office at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2007**] if there are any problems with this appointment.
