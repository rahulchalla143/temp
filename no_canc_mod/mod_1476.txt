Withdrawal symptoms are abating on transfer from MICU.
He was given zofran for nausea (amylase/lipase normal).
Consistent with prior labs.
Continued effexor at home dose given that he has been stable on this, may need dose reduction if liver impairment increases.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE Creatinine elevated to 1.3 (baseline 1.1-1.2) on admission.
Likely somewhat prerenal in the setting of recent binge.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS Likely due to starvation ketoacidosis, alcohol, ARF.
HYPERTENSION Patient hypertensive on admission, likely secondary to ETOH withdrawal.
On admission you had signs of withdrawal and were admitted to the intensive care unit because you required high doses of benzodiazepines (a medication which prevents alcohol withdrawal).
Eventually you no longer needed these medication to prevent withdrawal symptoms and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] thought it was okay for you to leave given your great desire to do so.
