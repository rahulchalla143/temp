The patient reports that he was standing in his kitchen at rest this afternoon around 4pm and he had sudden onset of chest pressure, which is how his angina always presents.
On arrival to the cath lab, he reported his pain as [**4-13**].
There was thrombosis of the distal RCA that was refractory to balloon angioplasty, despite IV heparin, IV integrillin and prasugrel.
The final injection showed TIMI 1 flow into the distal vessel and ST segment elevation consistent with continued inferior wall STEMI.
The patient reports that he has been in his baseline state of health since [**Month (only) 116**], when he was experiencing increasing anginal symptoms and so he had repeat coronary angiography, done as an outpatient, where he was found to have severe in stent restenosis of the RCA and had DES placed.
Since that time, he has had much improved symptoms and has been able to keep up with his exercise regimen of walking 2miles 5 days a week at a speed of [**3-7**] miles per hour.
On Sunday, 2 days prior to presentation, the patient had acute onset of chest pain and realized he had forgotten to take his am meds, so he took them and he took one nitroglycerin and felt resolution of the pain.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 53 year-old Male with past medical history significant for CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCIs, p/w STEMI s/p DES to RCA with poor flow after stenting ho presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and underwent cardiac catheterization.
ACUTE CARE: .
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE - The patient has had multiple PCIs and is s/p CABG.

CHRONIC CARE: .
# HYEPRTENSION - We continued home Lisinopril but at 10 mg daily and resumed his Metoprolol medication.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - Continued Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily.
