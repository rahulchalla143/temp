He denied any chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, lower extremity edema, fevers, chills, cough, or sputum production.
He was treated as an acute on chronic CHF exacerbation with diuresis as well as a COPD exacerbation with steroids and nebulizers.
He was seen by Cardiology and Pulmonology consults, and repeat TTE showed an LVEF of 20-25% with global LV hypokinesis and chamber dilatation, and the possibility of an apical thrombus could not be ruled out.
Catheterization here showed diffuse 20-30% stenosis with mid-vessel 80% stenosis of the LAD and mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel 60% eccentric stenosis of the LCx.
He complains of mild left groin pain at the catheterization site.
ROS: He acknowledges a prior history of TIA but denies any history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Past Medical History: - severe COPD / bronchial asthma - cardiomyopathy w/ EF 30-35%, cause unknown - suspected TIA - h/o recent pneumonia - LBBB on ECG - nephrolithiasis - s/p cataract surgery - s/p hernia repair   Social History: Lives with his wife, fairly independent until symptomatic w/ SOB.

ECG ([**2131-12-24**]): Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats and possible first beat being a ventricular premature beat.
Left bundle-branch block.

Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed one vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LAD had diffuse 20-30% lesions throughout with a mid vessel 80% stenosis.
The Lcx had mild luminal irregularities with a mid vessel 60% eccentric stenosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary artery pressure of 47/21 mmHg.
There were moderately  elevated left sided filling pressures with a PCWP mean of 24 mmHg.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate diastolic dysfunction.
Elevated RVEDP .
Hazy opacity in the lingula and left lower lobe, concerning for early pneumonia versus asymmetric edema.
Mild vascular congestion with interstitial edema.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = [**10-9**] %).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricular cavity with severe global hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
There is no evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
Marked asymmetric enlargement of the proximal right thigh musculature, consistent with the patient's history of a known hematoma.
Small left greater than right pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis of the posterior lung bases.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Femoral Vascular U/S ([**2131-12-26**]): FINDINGS: There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or A-V fistula, as questioned.
There is a large right groin/thigh hematoma as seen on CT, measuring at least 13.0 cm in greatest dimension.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm of AVF.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 73-year-old man with severe COPD and recently-diagnosed cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, who presented to an OSH on [**2131-12-21**] with symptoms of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization to assess for ischemic cardiomyopathy, which showed LAD disease.
He completed the protocol overnight, but approximately 1 hour after completion he suffered from acute-onset of severe respiratory distress with chest tightness and wheezing, consistent with anaphylaxis.
He was seen by the Allergy consult service, who felt that this was consistent with anaphylaxis, and recommended repeat desensitization after a couple weeks if needed.
Acute on chronic systolic CHF - The patient was recently diagnosed with a cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology, and was being treated for acute on chronic systolic heart failure prior to transfer.
On transfer, he was still mildly fluid overloaded, so diuresis was continued with Lasix and spironolactone.
Repeat TTE here revealed EF 15% with global LV dysfunction and no wall-motion-abnormalities to suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Coronary artery disease - The patient underwent cardiac catheterization that showed a left-dominant system, an LAD with diffuse 20-30% lesions throughout and mid-vessel 80% stenosis, and a LCx with mild luminal irregularities and mid-vessel eccentric 60% stenosis.
It was also suggested that he would need a viability study to assess for antero-apical myocardial viability in preparation for a potential PCI of his mid-LAD lesion, but his TTE showed no wall-motion-abnormalities to suggest ischemia as the reason for his cardiomyopathy, so there was felt to be no indication for viability study at this time.
Apical thrombus - The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for apical thrombus as the TTE done at OSH was unable to properly assess the apex.
He was transferred on an IV heparin gtt, but TTE here showed no evidence of apical thrombus, so this was discontinued.
# COPD - The patient has a history of severe COPD, with mild wheezes on exam on admission.
This was significantly worsened after his intubation for anaphylaxis as above, so he was treated with IV Solu-Medrol and then quickly transitioned to Prednisone for a rapid taper.
Coronary artery disease 4.
Severe COPD 5.
Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization, and you were found to have a blockage in one of the arteries of your heart.
At the end of the desensitization you had an anaphylactic reaction that required intubation.
You also have atrial fibrillation but were not treated with blood thinners because you were not on this medication at home.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet  You should call your doctor or return to the Emergency Room for any concerning symptoms, including: - chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing, palpitations - allergic reaction - leg swelling, feeling faint - fevers or chills - any other concerning symptoms.
