ECG [**8-19**] Atrial fibrillation 94bpm.
Modest low amplitude lateral lead T wave changes are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2201-6-8**] no significant change.
CXR [**8-19**]: IMPRESSION: Right mid to lower lung opacity concerning for pneumonia.
Cardiomegaly with bilateral effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion also present.
Echo [**8-20**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The component of the pulmonary edema has resolved.
Persistent right mid and right lower lobe opacities concerning for pneumonia are unchanged.
Evaluation of pleural effusion included.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Repeat TTE [**2201-8-24**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of apical setments.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-8-20**], the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are slightly reduced.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3989**] is a 57 yo man with a PMH of AF on coumadin, h/o DVT, CHF, CAD h/o MI, COPD on home O2 of 4L, h/o of intubation 4 x during previous admissions for pneumonia, on methadone who presented with a 4d history of worsening SOB, principally secondary to CHF.
The shortness of breath was likely multifactorial, with CHF as the major contributor.
The patient has had difficulty with fluid overload in the past.
On admission, he had a CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema so was diuresed on a Lasix drip overnight in the MICU, with follow-up CXR showing resolution of the edema and lung exam free of rales.
On the floor, he was diuresed with a goal of negative fluid balance 1-2L/d and was euvolemic by discharge, with no crackles or edema.
Past echos had shown diastolic failure with preserved EF, but echo on this admission showed new systolic failure with EF of 30%.
Cardiology felt this might be secondary to poorly controlled hypertension and fluid overload rather than interval ischemic event so recommended up-titrating his carvedilol dose, as per below.
Afib/History of PE & DVT/anticoagulation: The patient suffers from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and also has a history of PE and DVTs.
# Chronic pain:  patient was discharged on methadone 10 mg QID, per discussions with patient's PCP about decreasing dose from 20 mg.
