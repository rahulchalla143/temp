IMAGING: [**10-19**] CT HEAD: FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction, edema, or shift of normally midline structures is present.
Extensive confluent periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are consistent with small vessel ischemic changes.
The ventricles and sulci are enlarged consistent with cortical atrophy, likely secondary to patient's known multiple sclerosis.
Air-fluid levels in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses are consistent with sinusitis.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process .
[**10-20**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: CHEST: There is a consolidation in the right lower lobe, consistent with patient's history of aspiration pneumonia.
There are bilateral trace effusions.
There are no pulmonary nodules or masses.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are no discrete hepatic masses.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation.
There is no gallbladder.
In the right kidney, there is a large renal staghorn calculus without hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
In the left kidney, there is a 16 mm calculus within the left proximal ureter.
There is associated mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis, likely secondary to ureteral obstruction.
The left ureter has peripheral rim enhancement, suggesting underlying infection.
There are no stones seen within the bladder.
There is no mesenteric stranding.
There is a large amount of fecal material within the rectum.
There is some fat stranding in the left retroperitoneum, which is likely due to the kidney and ureter, rather than the colon.
There are multiple diverticula, but no definite evidence of diverticulitis.
There is no abdominal, mesenteric, pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There are no fractures.
16-mm calculus within the left proximal ureter with moderate hydronephrosis.
Heterogenous enhancement of the kidney and rim enhancement of the ureter suggest infection.
Right renal staghorn calculus without hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
Right lower lobe consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old female with history of recurrent urinary tract infections, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing organisms, multiple sclerosis with spastic bladder, and nephrolithiasis admitted for urinary tract infection, E. coli septicemia, and sepsis.
coli bacteremia/urinary tract infection/nephrolithiasis/hydronephrosis: Patient was admitted with sepsis and was admitted to the intensive care unit.
She required vasopressor support and was noted to have an obstructing left renal stone.
Although it was noted that without removal or the left renal stone the patient would be at risk for recurrent infections, the patient was felt to be at too high risk for surgical nephrolithotomy or extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy.
#Respiratory failure/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/Multiple sclerosis: Patient developed hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of her infection and required intubation.
She was extubated but had a persistent oxygen requirement felt to be due to a combination of respiratory muscle weakness in the setting of multiple sclerosis and infection.
There was also intermittent aspiration that improved when diet was changed to a dysphagia diet.
Head CT was negative for bleeding and mental status improved slowly over hospital course.
She had worsening respiratory distress with elevated blood pressures.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM: #Hyperlipidemia (HLD): Continued statin .
# Depression: Citalopram was initially held then restarted .
11. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
18. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 583**] House Rehab & Nursing Center  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS Septicemia/bloodstream infection secondary to urinary tract infection urinary tract infection.
You were admitted to the hospital because you had an infection in your bloodstream which caused your blood pressure to drop and you stopped breathing.
Start Meropenem IV for 5 more days for your urinary tract infection Stop norvasc due to normal blood pressure  Followup Instructions: Department: SURGICAL SPECIALTIES When: MONDAY [**2118-11-28**] at 2:00 PM With: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 161**] [**Name6 (MD) 162**] [**Name8 (MD) 163**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 164**] Building: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage
