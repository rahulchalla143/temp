HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2125**], history of hypertension and history of hypercholesterolemia who presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] with complaint of shortness of breath and substernal chest pain that had lasted for two days.
There were no associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or palpitations.
The pain was worse while lying down.
There is a question of myocardial infarction versus myopericarditis at [**Hospital3 1280**].
Cardiac catheterization at the outside hospital showed three vessel disease with 90% occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and total occlusion of the right coronary artery.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization in [**2128-3-16**], which showed diffuse 50% obtuse marginal one stenosis at the stented site.
The area was patent by angiography and IVUF.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction, also with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent of the obtuse marginal one.
The patient had a myocardial infarction in 11/96 and she was found to have a residual EF of 60%.
She had question of congestive heart failure in the past and history of hypertension, history of hypothyroidism, history of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes.
The patient also had a history of osteoarthritis status post left knee replacement.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's sister died at 69 of a myocardial infarction.
General appearance, tired ill appearing female without much movement and in no acute distress.
Dry mucous membranes.
No scleral icterus.
No carotid bruits.
No murmurs appreciated.
Distant heart sounds.
Pulmonary distant breath sounds.
Patient with very little air movement.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Very faint dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulses.
Electrocardiogram showed question of idioventricular rhythm, ST depressions in AVL, retrograde T waves and left bundaloid morphology.
Cardiac catheterization showed elevated wedge pressure of 37 and otherwise findings of markedly increased filling pressures, left main with 30% diffuse disease.
Left anterior descending coronary artery with 90% proximal occlusion with TIMI two flow after the balloon was inserted, 3.8 by 8 mm hepacoach sent, ramus to intermedius had the ability to rescue it.
The patient has a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock with a PA saturation of 42%.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 15937**]ssment and recommendations from the cardiac catheterization included anterior myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock, aspirin and Plavix for thirty days at least, ace inhibitor when the creatinine stabilized, heparin half dose while on Integrilin for 24 hours and an intraaortic balloon pump.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the above the patient was diagnosed with a large anterior myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.
Subsequently she was diuresed with Lasix for presumed congestive heart failure.
She was started on ianatrops for one day, however, this was discontinued secondary to abnormal and occasional supraventricular tachycardias on telemetry.
For ischemia she was continued on Plavix, aspirin and her heparin drip.
Pulmonary:  The patient had periods of apnea on her monitor prior to the catheterization.
Endocrine:  The patient had a question of diabetes mellitus and a history of hypothyroidism.
Given the above the patient had some difficulty being weaned off the intraaortic balloon pump, however, this was achieved after days.
However, the patient continued to experience significant congestive heart failure and it was the families decision given the severity of her congestive heart failure and her frequent episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and apnea that she be made comfort measures only.
She was given multiple medications for her major complaint, which was cough and this very pleasant female died probably of supraventricular tachycardia on [**2133-10-29**] at 11:20 a.m.                                 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15176**], M.D.
