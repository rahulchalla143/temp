IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for multilobar pneumonia.
Pending labs: [**2102-3-23**] 02:41AM BLOOD VITAMIN D 25 HYDROXY-PND Blood cultures  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 44 year old female with PMH of right thyroidectomy who presented with fevers and SOB with findings consistent with pneumonia.
Pneumonia: The fevers, rigors, and myalgias with positive sick contacts was most consisitent with a superinfected viral infection resulting in pneumonia.
Initial chest xray was negative, but on day of transfer to the floor PA and lateral CXR showed multifocal pneumonia.
Flu was ruled out with a nasal swab and a nasal viral panel was not checked given that it would not change her clinical management.
She was continued on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for 72 hours for CAP and will be discharged with moxifloxacin for an additional week.
She had tachycardia and low blood pressures in the setting of infection, consistent with SIRS.
She had sinus tachycardia to 140s likely related to dehydration and fevers which improved with fluid repletion.
Her nutrition status is normal and she has no evidence of alcoholism.
Given the h/o hemithyroidectomy, the initial concern was for parathyroid/thyroid abnormality, but her TFTs and PTH was normal.
Her urine electrolytes did not reveal electrolyte wasting and her electrolytes remained stable for 24 hours without repletion.
The abnormalities were likely due to her acute inflammatory response.
Anemia: Normocytic anemia with no previous hematocrit levels to trend.
It is likely dilutional in the setting of massive fluid repletion.
Her anemia labs revealed a borderline low iron, but elevated ferritin and haptoglobin.
CBC should be rechecked after recovery from acute infection.
