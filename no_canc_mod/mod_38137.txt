She has also had weight loss over the last several weeks.
The patient denies chest pain or syncope.
The patient presented for an echocardiographic evaluation of her heart and will undergo aortic valvuloplasty on [**2125-5-10**].
Critical aortic stenosis.
Status post aortic valvuloplasty in [**2123-8-7**] with aortic valve area going from 0.4 to 0.7; previous echocardiogram in [**2124-10-7**] showed an ejection fraction of 55%, moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis, 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The neck had no jugular venous distention.
The lungs had faint crackles at the bases.
First heart sound and second heart sound.
A [**3-14**] high-pitched systolic ejection murmur.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram had a left bundle-branch block at rate of 79; this was new compared to [**2123-8-7**].
Chest x-ray showed slight congestive heart failure.
Although is elderly and has an overall poor prognosis, it was felt that she would obtain benefit for aortic valvoplasty, as she was not a surgical candidate.
For her congestive heart failure, she was continued on Lasix 40 mg p.o.
Indications were coronary artery disease, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, and critical aortic stenosis.
Her left main coronary artery had mild calcification.
The left anterior descending artery had no significant lesions.
The left circumflex was a nondominant vessel without critical lesions.
The right coronary artery was a dominant vessel without critical lesions.
The patient went into complete heart block and had a transvenous pacemaker placed.
The complete heart block spontaneously resolved and was felt to be due to irritation of the right bundle-branch in the setting of the left bundle-branch block.
On [**2125-5-12**], the patient was doing well with no complaints.
She was afebrile with stable vital signs.
Her groin had no hematoma, oozing, or bruits.
The patient was able to ambulate 60 feet with slow gait and frequent standing and rest breaks.

On [**2125-5-14**], the patient was doing well with no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.
She report some mild nausea which is chronic in nature.
Telemetry revealed a normal sinus rhythm with premature ventricular contractions.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  We will continue the Lasix and digoxin for the patient's congestive heart failure and maintain her fluid balance.
The patient should have a cardiac low-salt diet.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient has had nausea and reflux for months.
CODE STATUS:  The patient's code status is no chest compression and do not intubate.
Critical aortic stenosis.
Status post aortic valvuloplasty.
Congestive heart failure.
