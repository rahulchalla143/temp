CXR on admission: Chronic bronchiectatic changes of the right lung, unchanged in comparison to the prior [**Month/Day/Year **].
No new pneumonia.
CXR on day following admission: Fluid levels within the cystic bronchiectasis foci of the right lung and new subtle left perihilar opacity.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed multi-vessel coronary disease.
The RCA contained mild luminal irregularities but was without flow limting disease.
Left ventriculography revealed a calculated ejection fraction of 42% with anteroapical severe hypokinesis.
There was no mitral regurgiation.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a minimally elevated PCPW of 15mmHg.
The PA diastolic pressure was approximately 5mmHg higher than the mean PCPW consistent with mild elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance.
There was an oxygen step up on multiple samples from the RA to the SVC (85% to 88-92%) of unclear significance.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Chest CT: 1) Increased bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis.
2) Slight worsening of extensive cystic bronchiectasis associated with infectious process, representing multiple air-fluid levels, predominantly in the right lower lobe.
3) Severe tracheobronchomalacia.
4) Enlarged main pulmonary artery, which can represent pulmonary artery hypertension.
5) Small ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo female with history of asthma, bronchiectasis, brochomalacia and recent pneumonia p/w recurrent respiratory infection c/b diarrhea, respiratory distress, NSTEMI.
1.Respiratory Failure: Patient was initially admitted for concern of bacterial pneumonia vs. influenza, however, patient decompensated on floor on hospital day 3 despite treatment.
Patient became increasingly tachypneic and was intubated for respiratory failure.
Patient then underwent bronchoscopy on the following day and was found to have Influenza A, and a course of oseltamivir was initiated.
In addition, it was noted during bronchoscopy that patient had severe bronchomalacia, and that airways closed with minimal suction.
Despite being afebrile with minimal secretions, patient continued to remained difficult to wean to extubation nearly two weeks following intubation.
On pressure support trials, patient would become tachypneic and agitated or apenic and hypercarbic during spontaneous breathing trials.
Patient was initiated on quetiapine for maximal non-narcotic sedation and anti-agitation, however, patient continued to have agitation when efforts were made to wean towards extubation.
Pt is able to tolerate pressure support and short trials of trach mask.
Patient had trach leak and had 2 trach changes.
Bacterial Pneumonia/ Influenza: As noted above, patient was initially found to have Influenza A by broncheoalveolar lavage, and patient was treated with a seven day course of oseltamivir.
In addition, patient was found to have gram-negative rods in sputum cultured from samples from hospital day 1 and 2.
Therefore, patient was initiated on a two week course of meropenem for broad-spectrum coverage of the unspeciated gram-negative rods and concern of recurrence of infection in the setting of severe bronchomalacia and bronchiectasis.
Of note, CT chest did reveal cystic bronchiectasis with air-fluid levels.
Pt became afebrile after initiation of meropenem which she completed a 14-day course of.
Late in the hospital course, pt spiked another fever and was found to have MRSA in her sputum.
Also, she was found to have copious thick nasal secretions and she was started on a 7-day course of Ceftazidime for presumed sinusitis.
Coronary artery disease:  At the time of acute respiratory distress, patient complained of chest pain, and EKG and cardiac enzymes were evaluated, revealing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
On this regimen, patient remained stable, and no longer had any new chest pain or arrhythmias.
Diarrhea: On admission, pt had some diarrhea which appeared to be chronic.
Pt has a hx of c diff colitis s/p treatment with Flagyl.
Skin: After several days in the ICU, it was noted that pt had erythema in the folds of her neck, in her groin and around the area of her buttocks.
After treatment with po diflucan, miconazole powder and nystatin cream there was marked improvement.
Also noted were some vesicles around the rectum which were scraped and sent for DFA to rule out herpes.
She became increasingly agitated while intubated requiring boluses and Fentanyl and Versed and the initiation of propofol.
When pt became hypotensive off the propofol, it was determined that she had a component of septic shock and as her pneumonia and sinusitis were treated, her blood pressure improved to MAP of 60-65.
Nutrition: Thoracic surgery opted not to place the PEG tube secondary to the patient's large ventral hernia.
Pt has a hx of guaic positive stools and she should have a GI work-up as an outpatient.
PO Q24H Albuterol  90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol  Sig:  1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Influenza Pneumonia sinusitis non ST elevation MI s/p tracheostomy for respiratory distress  Secondary Distress: asthma chronic bronciectasis tracheobronchimalacia Diabetes h/o c diff colitis GERD Hypertension hiatal hernia   Discharge Condition: Stable on trach ventillation; mental status alert  Discharge Instructions: Take medications as prescribed.
Call your doctor or go to the ER if you have shortness of breath, fevers, increased respiratory secretions, chest pain, or any other worrisome symptoms.
