Her injuries noted were a C7 fracture, and chronic-appearing bilateral pleural effusions.
HTN 4.
Acute fracture involving the superior endplate of C7 vertebral body with approximately 2 mm of retropulsion of the posterior cortex without significant canal stenosis.
Degenerative disease with facet changes as described above.
Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectatic changes are better assessed on corresponding CT torso performed concurrently."
[**2194-1-2**] ECHO: "Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension."
C7 compression fracture and T2 horizontal vertebral body fracture without evidence of ligamentous injury or cord injury."
She was switched to a softer collar that allowed for slightly more flexion.
CV: An ECHO on [**1-2**] did not demonstrate significant cardiac abnormalities.
Mild aortic stenosis was noted.
Geriatrics was consulted and suggested giving seroquel 12 mg qhs for agitation instead.
Resp: In contact with her PCP who noted that her pleural effusions were chronic.
We attempted extubation on Hd #2, but she developed tachypnea and respiratory distress and was reintubated.
It was thought that her pleural effusions may have contributed to her respiratory compromise, and she had a right and left-sided thoracentesis on Hd #3 and 4 (respectively).
A CVL was also placed at this time -- on imaging, she was noted to have persistent right pleural effusion and a small apical pneumothorax.
Given concern that she had respiratory distress upon extubation, and was now currently on positive pressure ventilation, a 20Fr chest tube was placed in her right side.
Pleural fluid analyses demonstrated a transudative fluid, which was not infected.
At this point, there was concern that there may be an anatomic component to her respiratory failure -- Interventional Pulmonary was asked to evaluate the patient's airways.
Her son had given a vague history of a possible prior tracheostomy, and radiation to her neck -- perhaps causing some tracheal stenosis.
On bronchoscopy, close evaluation demonstrated upper airway edema, with no leak when the cuff was down.
On [**1-11**] she had a episode of desaturation to the 80s for which she underwent another bronchoscopy that revealed thick brown sputum.
On [**1-11**] she had several loose stools and the tube feedings were held.
Heme: She is on Coumadin at home for her history of atrial fibrillation; she was maintained on a heparin drip while in the unit until she became therapeutic.
On [**1-11**] she had an episode of desaturation and a bronch revealed thick brown mucous.
On [**1-11**] she also had an episode of hypotension concerning for septic physiology.
