History of Present Illness: This 89 year old white male who had a week of productive sputum, weakness and malaise and presented to the [**Hospital3 10494**] ED and was found to have elevated troponins and ST depressions on the lateral leads of his EKG.
He had CHF on CXR and was admitted to the telemetry floor and was given 300 mg of Plavix and was also given IV Lasix and Lopressor.
Diffuse vascular calcifications of the thoracic aorta, most marked in the arch and descending region, but also involving the ascending aorta.
These images are available for review for preoperative planning.
Small left and trace right pleural effusions.
Multifocal bronchial wall thickening, small airways disease and patchy dependent consolidation, likely due to multifocal infection.
Distribution and appearance favors aspiration pneumonia, but a mycoplasma or other atypical infection is also within the differential diagnosis.
If infectious symptoms are absent, followup CT may be considered in two to three months to exclude a more chronic cause for these findings.
Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail of the anterior leaflet and posterior leaflet restriction.
An eccentric, inferiorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved.
