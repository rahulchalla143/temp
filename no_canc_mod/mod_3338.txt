RADIOLOGY: ============ HEAD CT [**2151-9-7**]: Large(6 x 3 cm) mass w/ surrounding edema + leftward subfalcine herniation; prob sm hemorrhagic component; centered in R basal ganglia .
[**Last Name (STitle) 18954**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as revealing "brain mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and subfalcine herniation, which could represent a neoplasm or an infection such as toxoplasmosis."
FINDINGS: A nearly 3 cm, markedly enhancing mass is centered in the region of the anterior limb of the right internal capsule with extension into the adjacent globus pallidus, head of the right caudate nucleus and anterior thalamus.
The enhancement pattern suggests a solid type of lesion.
Within the area of enhancement, the lesion's T2 signal pattern has irregular peripheral T2 hypointensity and a more hyperintense center.
Taken together, these findings suggest a mass lesion with at least an area of central necrosis.
The extensive surrounding edema and enormous mass effect, described in detail on the previous CT scan are unchanged compared with that study.
There are no other areas of pathologic enhancement seen intracranially.
A punctate area within the mass seems to exhibit elevated diffusion signal.
There are no other areas of abnormal contrast enhancement or edematous regions seen within the brain.
There is a moderate-sized air-fluid level within the left maxillary sinus with moderate mucosal thickening seen also within the sinus.
A smaller air-fluid level was seen in the right maxillary sinus with minor mucosal thickening as well.
There is moderate bilateral ethmoid sinus and prominent left sphenoid air cell/pterygoid recess high T2 signal.
These sinus abnormalities could represent an inflammatory process.
Given the solitary nature of the mass and HIV history, a tumor such as lymphoma needs to be considered.
Sinus abnormalities as described above.
CT head stereotaxis with contrast ([**9-7**]): FINDINGS:  Again seen is a large heterogeneous mass centered within the right basal ganglia and internal capsule and significant surrounding vasogenic edema.
There remains leftward shift of normally midline structures and complete effacement of the right lateral ventricle.
The mass extends inferiorly to exert mass effect on the suprasellar cistern, though the cistern remains preserved inferiorly.
Stereotactic frame has been placed.
There are air-fluid levels and mucosal thickening involving the maxillary sinuses, air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses, and scattered opacification of multiple ethmoid air cells.
2) No significant interval change in large mass centered in the right basal ganglia/internal capsule, with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema causing subfalcine herniation and severely compressing the right lateral ventricle.
3) Sinus disease as described above.
CT Head s/p biopsy ([**9-8**]): FINDINGS:  There is a new intracranial air, which is related to recent biopsy and a new cranial defect through the right side of the frontal bone.
However, there is no evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.
The mass, measured in the same way as the comparison study is essentially unchanged, measuring 5.7 x 3.6 cm in axial dimensions with surrounding vasogenic edema and a similar degree of leftward shift of the midline structures.
There has been no other significant change.
IMPRESSION:  Other than post biopsy changes, which are anticipated, namely intracranial air, no significant change is seen.
No focal testicular lesions identified.
No evidence of any increased [**Month/Year (2) **] flow within this epididymis.
Several cystic areas are identified which represent epididymal cysts.
Mild hydroceles bilaterally.
Prominent right epididymis with cystic components which represent epididymal cysts.
There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
There is mild right lower lobe atelectasis.
Peripheral posterior opacities are present in the dependent portions of both lungs which are also atelectasis.
Multiple small nodules are redemonstrated in both lungs, the largest of which is a 3-mm right middle lobe nodule which is unchanged in size or appearance since the prior study.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The previously described tiny low-density liver lesion is not identified on the current study, likely due to small size and slice selection.
There is no biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no ascites.
There are multiple small retroperitoneal lymph nodes which do meet size criteria for pathological enlargement.
There is a tiny amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
There is no pathological inguinal or pelvic nodal enlargement.
Multiple rounded calcific densities with lucent centers are present in the right inguinal region which are likely phleboliths.
No lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged bilateral pulmonary nodules.
Right lower lobe atelectasis.
No acute abnormality.
B cells are 17% of lymphoid solid events, and do not express aberrant antigens.
Clonality could not be reliably assessed due to non-specific staining.
B-cell clonality could not be reliably assessed due to cytophilic staining with immunoglobulin light chain antibodies.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST ([**9-11**]):  Again seen is a mass centered within the right basal ganglia, and containing a small amount of increased density, which is not significantly changed in comparison to the prior study.
There is a surrounding edema within the adjacent white matter.
The mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, and shift of normally midline structures is stable.
No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
IMPRESSION:  Again seen is a large mass centered within the right basal ganglia, with surrounding edema and associated mass effect.
No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage identified.
From T11-12 to L3-4, no abnormalities are seen.
IMPRESSION:  Overall no significant change since [**2146-10-28**].
A broad-based, central and left paracentral disc protrusion is again seen at L4-5 level .
FINDINGS:  No pre-gadolinium images are obtained.
There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement of the nerve roots.
There are no epidural collections.
IMPRESSION:  No abnormal enhancement along the nerve roots.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Doctor Last Name 18955**] is a 36 yo HIV positive male who presented with fevers and headache.
His CT scan was consistent with a large 3x3cm brain mass in the basal ganglia region with midline shift.
Patient was initially taken emergently to brain biopsy, and was admitted to the ICU, where concern was for toxoplasmosis vs. CNS lymphoma.
Patient developed fecal incontinence during admission and had an MRI performed, which showed no enhancement of his leptomeninges consistent with leptomeningeal spread.
He also had a repeat head CT performed due to concern for worsening neurological symptoms, which was negative.
Patient was also initiated on HAART during his admission, and CT torso and testicular ultrasound was performed due to concern for primary malignancy as cause for disease.
His G6PD screen was intermediate, and patient was not placed on sulfa treatment due to concern for hemolysis.
An LP was not performed due to concern for herniation.
Patient developed oral mucosal candidiasis while on prednisone.
Patient was also noted to have intractable hiccups.
He had no signs of subphrenic abscess on CT scan.
This was thought secondary to his brain mass.
Patient was noted to have steadily decreasing hematocrit.
He had an inappropriately low reticulocyte index, which was thought possibly secondary to bone marrow suppression either from HIV or pyrimethamine or TMP-SMX.
Metoclopramide 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for hiccups or nausea.
If you develop a severe headache, nausea, vomiting, weakness, or any other worrisome symptoms, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
