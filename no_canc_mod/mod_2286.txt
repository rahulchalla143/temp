Admission Date:  [**2103-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-5-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-7-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Dilaudid  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**] Chief Complaint: Back pain for one day  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 14164**] is a 22 year-old African-American woman with known [**Known lastname 14165**] cell disease, who presents with a 1-day history of right-sided posterior chest pain.
She notes that she was well until 4-days prior to admission when she developed URI symptoms, including headache, rhinorrea, and generalized fatigue.
She subsequently developed a cough, productive of small amounts of dark yellow sputum.
Yesterday, she developed right-sided posterior chest pain, pleuritic in nature, worse with coughing, deep breathing and lying on the culprit side.
She reports only mild SOB.
No GI or urinary complaints.
No lightheadedness, no dizziness.
A CXR revealed a RLL infiltrate.
She was also given Morphine 1 mg IV X1, Benadryl 25 mg X1, and Dilaudid for pain control.
[**Known lastname **] cell disease, with 1 admission per year since [**2100**] for acute pain crisis.
History of gonorrhea 3.
Prior pneumonia versus acute chest syndrome in [**2100**] 4.
History of pre-eclampsia during her first pregnancy 5.
LN: No cervical lymphadenopathy.
No bronchial breathing.
+ egophony, + whispered pectoriloquy.
Soft, late systolic murmur at apex, non-radiating.
Abdomen soft and non-tender.
No pedal edema.
Interval development of patchy opacity in right lower lobe, no pleural effusion.
[**2103-5-20**] CXR: Heart size is within normal limits and there is no evidence for CHF.
There is consolidation in the right middle and right lower lobes with an associated small right pleural effusion, increased when compared with the prior film of [**5-19**], 05.
There is atelectasis at the left lung base as previously demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Increase in extent of right middle lobe and right lower lobe consolidation with small right pleural effusion.
Left basilar atelectasis.
[**2103-5-21**] CXR: The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and there is slight increase in pulmonary vascularity, consistent with the patient's known [**Year/Month/Day 14165**] cell status.
There are multifocal areas of consolidation involving the right middle and both lower lobes, which have progressed in the interval.
There are also bilateral probable small pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal consolidation suggesting multifocal pneumonia.
[**2103-5-22**] CXR: No significant interval change.
[**2103-5-23**] CXR: Increased mild to moderate left pleural effusion.
Persistent right middle and lower lobe infiltrate with right pleural effusion, stable.
Stable left pleural effusion with left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis.
[**2103-5-26**] CXR: Improving right middle lobe and left lower lobe opacities.
There is a small left-sided pleural effusion unchanged.
******** [**2103-5-22**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly elongated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is trivial mitral regurgitatino.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 22 year-old African-American woman with [**Year/Month/Day 14165**] cell disease admitted with respiratory symptoms and right-sided back pain, found to have RLL infiltrate + hypoxemia.
1) Pneumonia +/- acute chest syndrome: CXR on admission revealed a RLL infiltrate suspicious for pneumonia, although acute chest syndrome can not be ruled out.
Examination was also remarkable for hypoxemia, with saturation in the low 80s.
She was empirically started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for coverage of Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Hemophilus and pneumococcus, and hydrated.
She was afebrile on admission, but subsequently developed a fever in hospital with rising WBC up to 34.6 on [**5-21**].
She also developed worsening hypoxemia on [**5-21**] with increasing SOB in the setting of decreasing hematocrit to 15.5, then 14.3.
Sputum cultures returned as OP flora, without predominance of organisms (can not rule out Chlamydia or Mycoplasma).
Serial CXRs initially revealed worsening picture, with interval development of a LLL infiltrate consistent with multilobar process, and bilateral pleural effusions.
The effusions were ultimately felt most likely [**3-21**] fluid overload in the setting of aggressive IVF administration, and she was diuresed with Lasix on [**5-23**] and [**5-24**].
She also has persistent leukocytosis with WBC 16.2 at discharge.
She will need follow-up imaging after completion of her antibiotic course to document complete resolution of infiltrate/effusion, as well as repeat WBC.
If the effusions persist, then a thoracentesis would be indicated to rule out a parapneumonic effusion.
Ms. [**Known lastname 14164**] has multiple allo-antibodies and HRB absent which is rare except in some African-Americans.
She was transfused 1 unmatched unit on [**5-22**] after pre-medication with Prednisone 60 mg PO QD, without response.
Of note, ferritin was sent to rule out concomitant iron deficiency, and returned elevated at 791.
She was switched to PO OxyContin 10 mg PO BID and oxycodone for breakthrough on [**5-26**], with fair pain control.
She completed a 5-day course of Flagyl in hospital, with resolution of her symptoms ([**5-22**] --> [**5-26**]).
5) Oral lesions: While in hospital, she developed oral lesions suspicious for oral HSV.
Disp:*28 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: [**Month/Year (2) **] cell disease Anemia Pneumonia RBC antibodies  Secondary diagnoses: Bacterial vaginosis Probable oral herpes simplex  Discharge Condition: Patient discharged home in stable condition.
Discharge Instructions: Please return to the hospital or call your PCP if you develop worsening respiratory symptoms, including increasing shortness of breath, or increasing cough.
Please take Oxycontin 10 mg twice daily for pain control.
You can also take oxycodone 5 mg as needed every 4 to 6 hours for breakthrough pain.
