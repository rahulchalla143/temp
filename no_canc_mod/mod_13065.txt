ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
There is a nonspecific left subinsular hyperintensity.
There is no evidence for mesial temporal sclerosis, cortical dysplasia, or heterotopia.
There is no pathologic enhancement.
IMPRESSION:  No lesion to account for patient's seizures.
He continues to have premature spillover and a mild swallow delay resulting in penetration ad intermittent aspiration.
This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 6, wfl with modified independence.
Small single sips of thin liquid only.
Impression: Friability, erythema, congestion and erosion in the antrum compatible with portal gastropathy Grade I varices at the lower third of the esophagus Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Increase nadolol to 40 mg if tolerated from hemodynamic standpoint.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Summary of Course: 52 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia.
Evaluation of shaking episodes revealed that they were seizures AKA Epilepsia Partialus Continua.
Pt experienced a number of small both electrographic and clinical seizures.
Pt was noted to have guiaic positive stool which were followed along with following his hemocrit q12.
Sepsis: Mr [**Known lastname 61747**] was admitted to the MICU on [**11-10**] with evidence of multifocal pneumonia, leading to septic shock.
He had a prolonged course on the ventilator and had a vasopressor requirement until [**11-24**], after which he was entirely pressor-independent.
On [**11-16**] meropenem was started with concern for possible occult ESBL organisms, given that his pneumonia was continuing and he grew GNRs from his sputum; this was continued through [**11-28**].
In terms of microbiology, he grew pan-sensitive E. coli from his sputum on [**11-11**] and coag-negative staph from a blood culture on [**11-12**]; and yeast and GNRs from a sputum of [**11-16**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 61747**] had a bout of acute renal failure in the setting of his sepsis.
He was found to have coagulase negative Staph in one set of blood cultures from a periperhal site on [**2130-11-23**].
He was found to have a urinary tract infection, and was treated with ceftriaxone [**Date range (1) 61749**].
Neurology consult felt that this was more likely to be action myoclonus related to his metabolic disturbances rather than epileptic seizures, and initial, routine EEG was normal.
He subsequently had a more prolonged episode of bilateral extremity shaking on [**2130-12-4**], followed by prolonged unresponsiveness (about 20minutes).
This [**Month/Day/Year 3780**] at least 11 episodes of stereotyped clinical and electrographic seizures.
On video, these begin with frequent and rhythmic right arm jerking, followed by apparent stiffening and a lifting and tilting toward the left of his head/neck, followed by jerking of the RUE again.
Mr. [**Known lastname 61747**] felt these events as "tightening".
Electrographically, they appeared to have onset in the left temporal region and were characterized by high amplitude rapid sharp activity centered there, but also visible more widely bilaterally.
Notably, on other occasions, nurses saw increased RUE shaking when they were manipulating the patient, but those episodes do not appear to have electrographic correlate.
It it likely that he has a mild baseline tremor, but rhythmic twitching in the arm is thought to be due to EPC (epilepsy partialis continua).
Weakness: After extubation, he was noted to have dysphagia and generalized weakness, and reported a possible history of 3 years of wasting and weakness, though this was confounded by his encephalopathy.
Examination revealed weakness in all muscle groups, most prominently in his hands, right more than left, arms more than legs, and distally more than proximally.
He underwent EMG on [**2130-11-30**] with "electrophysiologic evidence for a generalized, motor>sensory polyneuropathy with predominantly axonal features, of at least moderate severity and a superimposed mild, chronic, generalized myopathy.
Incidental note is also made of a mild ulnar neuropathy on the left."
The polyneuropathy and myopathy were thought to be secondary to critical illness.
Pt was noted to have a bilateral foot drop, left worse than right so bilateral AFO should be worn.
His cirrhosis is also complicated by grade II varices for which he received Nadolol for bleeding prophylaxis.
He has a small amount of ascites, and underwent a paracentesis to evaluate for SBP on [**11-22**].
Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety and PTSD.
Dysphagia: Following extubation, he was noted to have dysphagia that was likely due to prolonged intubation.
Video speech and swallow showed some aspiration initially, though this improved and the patient was cleared for regular solids, though nectar-thick liquids.
He requires feeding (because of his tremors & myoclonus) as well as close supervision during meals.
He will require re-evaluation and treatment w/ speech and swallow therapists.
Pancytopenia: The patient was noted to have chronic, stable pancytopenia during his hospital stay that is likely due to his cirrhosis.
His stools later became guaiac positive and he was re-evaluated by the hepatology team and underwent an EGD.
This showed that he had a bleeding gastritis that was most likely the cause of his drift down in hemoglobin.
EGD was performed which showed an active gastritis.
Wound care: He was noted to have Stage 2 decubitus ulcer on admission.
There were no active signs of infection at the site.
He was also noted to have a R heel blister during his hospital stay & was given heel support for this.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for joint pain.
Alum-Mag Hydroxide-Simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 15-30 MLs PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: river ridge  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Multifocal pneumonia with septic shock Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia Urinary tract infection Acute renal failure Seizures Right arm myoclonus Critical illness polyneuropathy Critical illness myopathy Left ulnar neuropathy Stage 2 decubitus ulcer  Secondary: Cirrhosis Pancytopenia   Discharge Condition: Improved: Still with mild cough, but no longer febrile.
Minimal bifacial weakness.
Mild tremor of right arm, with movement more than at rest.
Strength as follows (R/L): delts 4+/5-, [**Hospital1 **] 5-/5, tri 4+/5, WE 3-/4, FE [**2-14**]+, IP [**3-17**], H [**4-17**], Q [**4-17**], limited movements of R ankle, flexion of L ankle, able to wiggle toes on L but only a small twitch on the R. No seizures.
Does have signs of encephalopathy on exam with trace asterexis vs. tremor, but significantly improved.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with severe pneumonia, requiring the treatment of a breathing machine for about two weeks.
You were found to have seizures during your hospital stay as well.
Call your doctor with any recurrent seizures, loss of consciousness, change in alertness, worsening cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
