No intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hematoma identified.
Interstitial and ground-glass opacity at the right lung base, with multifocal small irregular nodules.
This could represent atypical infection, but the possibility for metastatic disease cannot be entirely excluded.
Multiple small gallstones in otherwise normal gallbladder.
Brief Hospital Course: Thrombocytopenia/heme: This patient appears to have increased platelet destruction although his bone marrow not entirely consistent w/ ITP (no increase in megakaryocytes); no evidence of lymphoma by flow or markers.
According to hematology, the patient is thought to have idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.
Given his ITP and very low platelet count, he ikely experienced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and eventual ARDS causing further diminution of his respiratory status.
Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and nodules.
He has had progressive increase in his oxygen that eventually required intubation.
ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies were to determine etiology of DAH but both came back negative.
Patient also felt to have VAP and started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for treatment  His respiratory function continued to deteriorate most likely secondary to worsening of ARDS or diffuse alveolar hemmorrhage.
Anemia - patient has had + guiaic in ED and evidence of bleeding such as petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis.
Patient not have expanding hematoma in thigh per CT.
Patient continued to have BRBPR most likely from stress ulcer given patient on steroids and also thrombocytopenia.
Renal: While in ICU patient BUN/Cre continued to rise and eventually stablaized around 1.9-2.2  A renal U/S was done which showed no hydronephrosis and urine lytes suggested prerenal with FeNa of < 0.78% but patient remained positive fluid balance.
No further workup of renal failure was persued as patient respiratory status continued to deteriorate.
Cardiac:  Patient remained in atrial fibrillation while in hospital that was difficult to control with beta-blocker.
