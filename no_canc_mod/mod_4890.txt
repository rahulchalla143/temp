Admission Date:  [**2193-2-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2193-2-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-5-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (with an ejection fraction of 20%), rheumatic heart disease, status post aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement in [**2186**], chronic atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin), status post pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement for symptomatic bradycardia in [**2192-10-22**] who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital on the day of admission for a cardiac catheterization in the setting of congestive heart failure exacerbation and elevation in cardiac enzymes (thought to be associated with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction).
The patient presented to the outside hospital on [**2193-1-28**] with abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath.
Her troponin I was checked at that time and showed a peak at 6.44.
She had a B&T level also checked which was elevated at 1600.
The patient went to catheterization at the outside hospital which showed a left anterior descending artery lesion of 85% occlusion which was increased from a 50% occlusion in her catheterization in [**2192-4-22**].
She was also noted to have elevated filling pressures.
She had an episode of acute pulmonary edema prior to catheterization and was given intravenous nitroglycerin, intravenous Lasix, and 4 mg of morphine with improvement in her oxygen saturations.
Atrial fibrillation.
Rheumatic heart disease.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy (with an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%).
History of gallstone pancreatitis.
Automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator and dual-chamber pacemaker placed in [**2192-10-22**] for symptomatic bradycardia.
Baseline renal insufficiency (with a creatinine of 1.3 to 1.5).
In general, she was in no acute distress.
No carotid bruits evident.
Respiratory issues revealed she had decreased breath sounds at the bases with crackles on the right side greater than the left.
Her heart examination was irregularly irregular with a 3/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border with radiation to the apex and the back.
She had a first heart sound and second heart sound mechanical click.
Lower extremities revealed she had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema and 2+ distal pulses.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING FINDINGS:  Her electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a left bundle-branch block with occasional A-paced rhythm.
Her cardiac catheterization on [**2193-2-1**] showed a left-dominant system with left main coronary artery with a 40% lesion, a left anterior descending artery 80% lesion to the bifurcation of the diagonal, and a left circumflex lesion of 50% at the obtuse marginal with distal occlusion, the left posterior descending artery and right coronary artery with luminal irregularities, and a Taxus stent was placed in her left anterior descending artery lesion.
Her filling pressures with a right atrial pressure mean of 12, right ventricular pressure of 45 systolic and 5 diastolic, and a wedge pressure of 25, and a pulmonary artery diastolic of 25, cardiac output of 4.8, and an index of 3.04.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Pump:  The patient had a high wedge pressure and a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
She had 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative sparing of the inferior and posterior walls.
She was also placed on a by mouth nitrate of Imdur for her chronic angina.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation and is status post dual-chamber pacemaker with automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator.
She was placed on Toprol-XL prior to her discharge for rate control and also for her heart failure.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient was given Mucomyst after her catheterization given her baseline renal insufficiency and her dye load during the procedure.
On the day of discharge, the patient was complaining of some nausea with minimal abdominal pain.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable; without chest pain, without shortness of breath.
Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease.
Mitral valve replacement and aortic valve replacement from rheumatic heart disease.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy (with an ejection fraction of 25% to 35%).
