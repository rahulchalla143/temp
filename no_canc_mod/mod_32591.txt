Aspiration of the right lateral pharyngeal space.
History of Present Illness: 18 F college student, no past medical history, admitted with sepsis, GNR bacteremia, hypoxia, and cranial nerve palsies.
Continued to be ill and presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] yesterday with worsening PO intake due to difficulty opening mouth.
Labs notable for leukocytosis with ~25% bandemia, ARF to 2.5, platelets of 101K and elevated coags.
Today, [**2-20**] blood cultures grew out GNRs (anaerobic bottle - zosyn given)and she was noted at 2 pm to have R ptosis with inability to open eye; fixed dilated R pupil and gaze abnormalities.
Noncontrast head and neck CT performed and per report did not show any abnormalities (other than lymphadenoapthy).
Currently complains of R facial numbness, feeling of swelling and tenderness in the right side of her neck, mild abdominal pain (similar to menstrual cramping).
Eyes / Conjunctiva: R ptosis with minimal ability to open eye.
Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic Lymphatic: Cervical WNL Cardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal) no murmurs appreciated.
Breath sounds mildly rhonchorous on left.
Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present Extremities: no edema.
Skin:  Warm, no rashes over trunk or extremities.
Reports hypoaesthesia throughout right side of face, maximal in V2 distribution.
Uvula deviated to the left but palate elevated symmetrically.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2105-12-29**] - TEE - No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
The tricuspid and pulmonic valves appear structurally normal, with no regurgitation or abnormal masses.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of endocarditis.
Multiple nodular areas of lung consolidation could be due to severe infection, septic emboli.
Partial atelectasis of left lower lobe, most likely due to malpositioning of endotracheal tube.
Small amount of free fluid in pelvis.
Hypodense nodule in left lobe of the thyroid.
Non-specific hypodense wedge-shaped area in the right kidney that could represent an area of infarction or pyelonephritis  [**2105-12-28**] - CT neck - 1.
Multiple hypodensities within the pterygoid muscles, parapharyngeal space, longus [**Last Name (un) **] with faintly hyperintense rims suggestive of early abscess formation.
No discrete abscess is identified.
Right neck soft tissue swelling with intracranial extension.
Massive right neck soft tissue swelling involving the pterygoid and masseter muscles with associated lymphadenopathy, most prominent at stations two and five of the neck consistent with right external neck infection.
There is intracranial extension of infection through the foramen ovale with associated right cavernous venous thrombosis and diffuse meningitis.
There is no definitive fluid collections on this MR study that would be indicative of abscess.
Interval development of decreased caliber of the right internal carotid artery in the cavernous and the carotid segments, with decrease in the flow voids and associated enhancement along the margins of the artery since [**2105-12-27**].
This likely indicates possible ongoing thrombosis of the artery, secondary to the cavernous sinus thrombosis, with or without inflammation.
Diffuse increased signal in the mastoid, middle ear cavity and the petrous bones, and the air cells, from fluid and mucosal thickening.
No obvious intraparenchymal abscess.
No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect on the CT of the head.
Markedly narrowed petrous and pre-cavernous as well as cavernous right internal carotid artery, which could be secondary to inflammatory changes of the wall as seen on the previous MRI.
Filling defect is seen in the right cavernous sinus secondary to inflammatory changes but flow is visualized in its lateral portion.
No evidence of distention of the superior or inferior ophthalmic veins identified to suggest collateral venous flow.
Other changes as described above including normal appearance of the arteries around the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] with fenestration of the anterior communicating artery is an incidental finding.
Abscess/cellulitis of right infratemporal space.
Cavernous sinus thrombosis.
Aspiration of the right lateral pharyngeal space.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female presenting with septic shock, with likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia/Lemierres, and DIC.
1) Septic shock.
Patient initially presented with sepsis progressing to hypotension despite fluid resuscitation during the first several hours of her admission.
She improved with treatment of underlying infection as detailed below.
2) Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.
Patient with right ptosis and dilated pupil as well as gaze palsies upon admission.
Given these findings, attention raised for possibility of cavernous venous thrombosis.
Spinal tap performed with 990 WBCs, elevated opening pressure to 52, elevated protein, mildly low glucose.
Likely all consistent with septic thrombosis of that region.
Blood cultures from OSH eventually grew Fusobacterium, consistent with concurrent diagnosis of likely Lemierres disease.
Anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT of 50-60.
The likely inciting source to the infection was pharyngitis with resulting seeding of an impacted wisdom tooth which eventually spread to the masseter space, ptyerigoid region, and eventually to cavernous sinus with resulting meningitis.
The cavernous sinus portion of the right internal carotid artery showed marked narrowing likely from inflammatory changes around the artery.
She had no additional focal neurologic findings corresponding to arterial insufficiency.
3) Respiratory failure.
Patient with initial O2 requirement by nasal cannula, which worsened quickly.
CT chest showing likely septic emboli, which fits with clinical diagnosis of Lemierres.
Also required diuresis to correct volume overload componenet of respiratory difficulties.
Elevated INR/PTT, decreased platelets.
5) Septic emboli.
Found to have septic emboli on chest ct (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres with IJ thrombus, though IJ thrombus was not seen by the time she had imaging).
Also noted to have possible renal ?infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.
No other identified potential systemic lesions.
No vegetations.
6) Renal failure.
Post extubation, likely due to med effect (benzos +/- steroids).
Forward result to [**Hospital3 **] (fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3534**])   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 511**] Home Health Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis Septicemia complicated by septic shock acute renal failure hypoxic respiratory failure septic pulmonary embolism wisdom tooth impaction complicated by abscess disseminated intra-vascular coagulation  Secondary: Chronic blood loss anemia   Discharge Condition: stable.
right eye with ptosis, lateral deviation, fixed dilated pupil.
Discharge Instructions: You were evaluated for a severe infection in the veins behind your sinuses.
Your course was complicated by low blood pressure, damage to your kidneys, trouble breathing, and low platelet counts.
You also had a wisdom tooth pulled that was a potential source to the infection.
If you develop any new or concerning symptom such as weakness orf your arms or legs, slurred speech or trouble speaking, weakness, fever, headache or mouthache, pain or redness at the PICC line; please come to the emergency room immediately.
