He walked back and forth to the bathroom and became extremely short of breath prompting him to call an ambulance.
He had epigastric discomfort last night but declines chest pressure.
Of note, he has had multiple admissions for SOB and chest tightness in the setting of crack cocaine use and attributed to crack pneumonitis, most recently [**Date range (1) 35039**]/12 and [**2196-2-29**] - [**2196-3-5**].
During his last admission from [**Date range (1) 63678**], he was treated for with solumedrol, oxygen, and lasix for presumed toxic pneumonitis and systolic CHF exacerbation.
He was initially treated with antibiotics in the MICU, but these were discontinued on the floor as there was no evidence of infection.
TTE was obtained which showed a decrease in LVEF to 20%.
His edema and shortness of breath resolved within one day and he was subsequently transferred to general medicine.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed secondary to moderate-severe global hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
CXR on admission ([**3-9**]): IMPRESSION: Increased asymmetric predominantly basilar diffuse airspace opacifications likely represent acute non-cardiac edema vs pulmonary toxicity from inhaled substance.
[**2196-3-9**] 7:00 am [**Month/Day/Year 3143**] CULTURE     [**Month/Day/Year **] Culture, Routine (Pending):   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] is a 52M with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), crack cocaine abuse c/b crack pneumonitis, COPD, and Type I DM who presented to the ED with dyspnea on exertion for 36 hours.
He was admitted secondary to hypoxemia a combination of acute systolic heart failure with an LVEF of 20% and hypersensitivity pneumonitis secondary to extensive history of smoking crack-cocaine and cigarettes.
Acute respiratory distress secondary to acute on chronic systolic heart failure 2.
Hypoxemia secondary to hypersentivity pneumonitis secondary to crack-cocaine exposure 3.
Schizophrenia       Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] presented to the ED with acute respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and extensive pitting lower extremity edema several days after being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for a previous episode of crack-cocaine induced pneumonitis.
Given his known history of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a depressed ejection fraction.
An echo was obtained in the MICU which showed a depressed LVEF of 20%.
By hospital day 2, his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and he had no lower extremity edema.
Pulmonary medicine was consulted and they recommended that the patient's respiratory distress was a direct result of reactive inflammatory changes secondary to crack and other unknown environmental triggers which resulted in a picture of hypersentivity pneumonitis.
Given the very low suspicion for acute bacterial pneumonia his antibiotics were stopped after one dose.
The patient has follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for PFTs and further pulmonary work-up in [**Month (only) 547**].
Despite 80mg of lantus with an aggressive humalog sliding scale, his finger sticks would be as high as 400.
During his hospitalization, he never became ketotic nor did he become hypoglycemic.
He was discharged on lantus 60mg [**Hospital1 **] and a novolog sliding scale.
His schizophrenia is currently well controlled on seroquel.
He shows no signs of paranoid, delusional, or disorganized thinking.
In addition, if the patient and PCP agree he is welcome to attend heart failure clinic.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**],  You were admitted for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema caused by lung irritation secondary to former crack cocaine and cigarette smoking.
Also, you have heart failure which means your heart does not pump [**Known lastname **] as well as it should, so fluid can accumulate in your lungs.
Please attend this program as it will your ability to perform day-to-day activities without becoming short of breath.
Also prednisone can cause agitation and insomnia.
If you are having difficult side effects from prednisone please talk to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 31365**].
If you experience any of the danger symptoms below, please call your primary care doctor and go to the nearest emergency department.
