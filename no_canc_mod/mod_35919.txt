She was doing well until three days ago when she fell on her back without head trauma, LOC, chest pain or palpatations while getting up because her legs gave up.
She presented to the ED and was noted to have hypoglycemia to 42 which improved with D50.
In the ED initial vital signs were 98.6 HR 68 BP 188/48 RR 16 97%RA Exam was notable for poor joint sense in L>R LEs, stance and gait unsteady, unable to ambulate without assistance.
No spine tenderness.
CXR was done revealing mild fluid overload and could not exclude pneumonia.
She was seen by case management and admitted to [**Hospital1 **] observation for dialysis tomorrow morning since she missed HD yesterday.
Denied HA, blurry vision or CP at any time throughout episode.
Given the persistently elevated BP, the decision was made to admit her to the MICU yesterday.
On the floor, she does not report headache, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, myalgias, abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting or dysuria.
She reports bilateral ankle pain L > R.  Past Medical History: - CAD: s/p 5V CABG [**2180**]; echo [**3-24**] 45-50%; cath [**4-20**] showed 3V disease.

Left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2201-7-22**] repolarization abnormalities are somewhat more pronounced, a non-specific finding.
[**2201-7-23**] CXR Findings compatible with fluid overload with possible pneumonia in the right lower lung.
Brief Hospital Course:  83 year old female with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, chronic diastolic CHF, diabetic neuropathy who presented with subacute progressive weakness and subsequently missed HD admitted to ICU with hypertensive urgency.
# Hypertensive Urgency: Was likely due to volume overload from missing HD.
BP was unresponsive to medications, but after HD the following day, her pressures normalized.
2L of fluid was removed with HD and she returned to dry weight.
# Weakness/Gait instability: Progressive weakness seems to have been present over several months.
Pt does have h/o spinal stenosis, PVD and diabetic neuropathy which could certainly contribute to feelings of weakness and gait instability.
Lastly, on presentation to ED, she was hypoglycemic which might have explained weakness.
A B12, folate and ESR level were all normal indicating that weakness is not secondary to B12/folate deficiency or inflammatory condition like PMR.
#Type II Diabetes Mellitus: throughout hospital course, pt was on ISS.
She was discharged on home regimen and continued with gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy.
#Chronic back pain: Likely secondary to spinal stenosis, which as per patient will not be managed surgically.
