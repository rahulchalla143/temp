Mother was not in labor and there was no evidence of intrapartum maternal fever or fetal tachycardia.
The infant was a nondysmorphic premature infant in moderate respiratory distress with moderate tachypnea and an oxygen requirement of approximately 25 to 30 percent.
Chest revealed mild to moderate retractions with moderate aerations and minimal scattered crackles.
Cardiac was regular rate and rhythm without murmur or gallop.
Abdomen was soft and nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly.
A small 1 cm superficial laceration was noted in the anterior aspect of the left thigh.
Respiratory:  The infant exhibited mild to moderate respiratory distress from birth that gradually worsened over the first one to two hours of life.
X-ray revealed findings consistent with hyaline membrane disease.
The patient was not treated with caffeine and has not had significant issues with apnea of prematurity.
By the time of discharge the patient has been stable on room air for over one week without apnea, bradycardia or desaturation episodes.
Cardiovascular:  The patient did exhibit mild to moderate hypotension and required blood pressure support with dopamine up to 6 to 10 mcg per kilo per minute over the first 40 to 72 hours of life.
A murmur was heard at approximately day two to three; an echocardiogram was performed on [**6-21**], day of life three, which revealed a structurally normal heart with the exception of a small ventricular septal defect; no PDA was present and function was normal bilaterally.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient did exhibit mild to moderate hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity requiring photo therapy for approximately five days.
There were no subsequent infectious disease issues in hospitalization.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  At time of discharge the patient is clinically stable, breathing comfortably on room air without recent desaturation, apnea or bradycardic episodes.
The patient does have an occasional murmur but is hemodynamically stable.
f) Immunizations recommended:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  1) born at less than 32 weeks, 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for day care during RSV season with a smoker in the household or with preschool siblings or 3) with chronic lung disease.
