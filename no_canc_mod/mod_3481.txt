Admission Date:  [**2200-8-7**]       Discharge Date: [**2200-8-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-7-27**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old female who fell down two stairs in a witnessed fall and landed on her right-hand side and struck the right side of her head and was transferred to [**Hospital3 2063**] where a computerized axial tomography scan showed a right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The patient was also found to have an INR of 3.1 and she was given Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma and transferred to [**Hospital6 256**].
Upon arrival at [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room the patient was complaining of a headache and also right hip pain.
The patient denied any loss of consciousness, preceding dizziness, palpitations or chest pain prior to the fall.
There was no seizure activity.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Previous medical history is significant for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, status post aortic valve and mitral valve replacement in [**2198**], status post breast cancer and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
There was no midline cervical tenderness.
Breathsounds were equal bilaterally and there was an old median sternotomy scar.
There was no stepoff in the back and the back was nontender.
Cervical spine series revealed no fracture, no dislocation and the pelvic AP revealed a right intertrochanteric femur fracture.
Computerized tomography scan of the head repeated again showed a right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There was no mass or shift.
Orthopedics, Cardiology and Neurosurgery were all consulted regarding the risks of anticoagulating the patient and expanding her subarachnoid hemorrhage, versus leaving her on unanticoagulated and putting her at risk for valve leaflet thrombosis and embolization as a result of her atrial fibrillation.
The decision was made to perform open reduction and internal fixation of the right femur fracture while the patient was in an unanticoagulated state for her subarachnoid hemorrhage with the attempt to resume anticoagulation on heparin as soon as possible.
Serial head computerized tomography scans up to this point had revealed an unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Postoperatively the patient exhibited some confusion and magnetic resonance imaging scan/magnetic resonance angiography was obtained that revealed no new hemorrhage, although it was difficult to rule out an embolic event.
Her symptoms improved and she was back to her level of baseline mentation over the course of two days.
Subsequently it was found that the patient had a urinary tract infection for which she was treated with Levaquin.
An abdominal computerized tomography scan was performed to rule out any abdominal bleed.
She has been guaiac negative throughout her hospital stay and no source of bleeding was able to be found.
She has also had diarrhea for which she has been Clostridium difficile negative repeatedly and has had a normal abdominal examination for which on source of diarrhea could be found.
