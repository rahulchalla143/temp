Admission Date:  [**2121-11-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2121-11-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2062-4-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension and question of an MI per the patient in the past, who underwent a stress test in [**2121-5-13**] with borderline EKG changes, no chest pain and achieved 84% maximal heart rate.
He was in his usual state of health until trying to lift a heavy object on the day of admission when he developed sudden [**8-22**] substernal chest pain, epigastric pain with radiation, diaphoresis, nausea, no vomiting, palpitations, shortness of breath or lightheadedness.
He went to [**Hospital 931**] Hospital Emergency Room where he was found to have an inferior myocardial infarction with sinus bradycardia to the 50's and inferior ST elevations.
His pain initially resolved but then increased with worsening of ST elevations inferiorly.
Also noted was a run of idioventricular rhythm.
He went directly to the cath lab on arriving at [**Hospital1 69**] where he was hemodynamically stable, found to have total occlusion of the mid right coronary artery which was PTCA'd.
Right heart cath showed right atrial pressure of 12, right ventricular pressures of 40/10, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18.
Procedure was complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation for which the patient received Lopressor IV and decreased his rate from 130's to 90's.
He continued to have residual [**2130-1-14**] chest pain on arrival to the CCU and heart rate of 90-110 atrial fibrillation, systolic blood pressure 130-140.
He denied all other symptoms at that time including orthopnea, PND, shortness of breath.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for lower extremity edema, decreased exercise tolerance, history of recurrent chest pain, melena, bright red blood per rectum.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, asthma, question of an MI two years ago where the patient got chest pain, went to the ER, was never cathed but was told he might have had a heart attack.
High cholesterol and diabetes.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired, lives with his wife, smokes [**3-16**] cigars every day, no alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for early coronary artery disease.
EKG after catheterization revealed atrial fibrillation at 114, ST elevations 2-3 mm in F, 3 and 2, small Q waves inferior [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V2 to V3, normal axis and intervals.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was in atrial fibrillation at a rate of 110-120's, blood pressure 140/90, satting 99% on two liters, respiratory rate 12.
Neck revealed JVP to angle of the jaw at 15 degrees, carotids 2+ without bruits, trachea midline, chest was clear to auscultation without wheezes or rales.
Cardiovascular exam was irregularly irregular, tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Groin had a right groin sheath in place, no bleeding or hematoma.
Lower extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or erythema.
CCU day #2 he had no events overnight, no complaints.
The patient continued to have an idioventricular rhythm but was hemodynamically stable.
This rhythm was believed to be a peri MI event and was monitored in tele.
Also noted was severely depressed right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
The right ventricle was moderately dilated and the patient had inferoseptal akinesis.
At that time it was decided to take him back to the cath lab for stenting of his left circumflex lesion which had also been noted on initial cath although it had not been addressed due to his complications in the cath lab.
The patient went to the cath lab, had his 90% left circumflex lesion stented with no significant complications.
At that time he developed a small left groin hematoma approximately 1 cm by 2 cm which remained stable overnight.
Inferior myocardial infarction, status post right coronary artery and left circumflex stent.
