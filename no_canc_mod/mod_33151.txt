Large right MCA distribution infarct involving just over 50% of the territory with associated deep hemorrhagic conversion and moderate local mass effect without herniation.
Critical stenosis at the origin of the right internal carotid artery with no evidence of flow above the skull base, with no flow within the right M1 segment.
Marked segmental narrowing and/or occlusion of the vertebral arteries bilaterally, left greater than right, with what may represent old post-embolic encephalomalacia within the pons.
Moderate brainstem and cerebellar atrophy out of proportion to the supratentorial volume loss.
Unchanged size and appearance of large right MCA territory infarct with stable edema and internal hemorrhage.
No new focus of hemorrhage or additional infarction is present.
Expected evolution of large right middle cerebral artery territorial infarction as above.
The region cytotoxic edema has increased over the past 48 hours, but there is signficant shift of midline structures or herniation.
Hemorrhagic transformation involving small regions of the infarcted corona radiata and deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter structures, stable, with no new focus of hemorrhage.
Global cerebellar atrophy.
No acute fracture or malalignment.
Degenerative change as above, most significant at C5 through C7.
No focal consolidation within limits described above.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old man with a past medical history including previous posterior circulation stroke (age 37) with residual ataxia requiring a wheelchair for mobility, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who was "found down" by his house keeper on [**2176-1-25**] (last seen normal [**2176-1-17**]).
A head CT head showed a right superior MCA territory stroke with hemorrhagic transformation.
NEURO Upon his arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**],  the patient had a CTA in the emergency room which showed a R ICA occlusion.
No anti-epileptic drugs were restarted as there did not seem to be a clear nidus of seizure.
ID At the time of admission, the patient was found to have a large pressure ulcer on his left hip.
As there was cellulitis surrounding the wound, treatment with clindamycin was initiated.
In the course of the admission, a stool culture was discovered to be positive for c. difficile colitis ([**2176-1-26**]).
It was decided that continuing aggressive care would not be consistent with the patient's wishes and therefore he was transitioned to comfort-measures only.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for agitation.
Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 0.25-0.5 mL PO Q1H (every hour) as needed for pain or air hunger.
Scopolamine Base 1.5 mg Patch 72 hr Sig: One (1) Patch 72 hr Transdermal DAILY (Daily) as needed for secretions.
Hypophonic voice.
You were found to have a large stroke on the right side of your brain.
After discussion with your family, you were transitioned to comfort care as it was thought this would be consistent with your wishes.
