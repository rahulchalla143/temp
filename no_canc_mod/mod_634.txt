The aortic root is moderately dilated.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Lcx 100% occluded in OM1, OM2 had diffuse 80% proximal disease.
RCA was non-dominant, and was 100% occluded at the mid level.Coronary angiography of the bypass grafts showed widely patent LIMA to LAD.
Left vetriculography demonstrated mild anterolateral and inferior hypokinesis with contrast estimated EF of 60%.
There was 2+ mitral regurgitation.
There was wide aortic pulse pressure (40 mmHg) with marked elevation of LVEDP (36 mmHg) to near aortic diastolic level (40 mmHg), consistent with severe aortic insufficiency.
PCW pressure was elevated with a mean of 29 mmHg.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve.
Fick calculated cardiac ouput and cardiac index were 4.8 l/min and 2.4 l/min/m2, respectively.
