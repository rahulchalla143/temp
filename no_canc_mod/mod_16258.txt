He ruled in for a myocardial infarction.
This was also complicated by bleeding from his heparin and Integrilin which were discontinued.
He was taken to catheterization at the outside hospital which showed a 90% proximal right coronary artery, severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.5 cm sq.
In total, he had some hemoptysis and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**].
He had no regular doctor's visits and he does state that he had a prior history of a heart murmur.
ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.
He did rule in for myocardial infarction with elevated troponins and CPKs.
No jugular venous distention.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a systolic murmur that was harsh.
He had 2+ bilateral carotid radial and femoral pulses with no DP and PT palpable pulses but positive by Doppler.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  Showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and trileaflet aortic valve with 1-2+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation although there was no mention of his aortic stenosis at that point.
Diuresis helped his pulmonary edema.
He also did not have any history of transient ischemic attacks.
His hematocrit was stabilized after his gastrointestinal bleed at the outside hospital.
