She was diuresed, ruled out for myocardial infarction and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization.
Echo revealed 4 + mitral regurgitation and she was referred for surgical evaluation.
She was found to be in acute systolic heart failure and was admitted preoperatively.

Suboptimal image quality - poor suprasternal views.
Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with basal to mid inferior akinesis (LVEF = 30 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased.

DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1569**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11006**] Approved: MON [**2138-12-15**] 11:34 AM    Imaging Lab    Brief Hospital Course: Ms.[**Known lastname 65138**] presented to the office for preoperative evaluation and was admitted to the hospital for acute systolic heart failure.
Surgery was consulted for a thyroid nodule and recommended follow up as outpatient for biopsy which  will be arranged after 4 weeks.
Dermatology was consulted in relation to multiple pruritic nodules with excoriations/ulcerations that began one month ago and are most likely due to prurigo nodularis with a distribution of lesions in areas she can reach, which is consistent with the diagnosis.
Please refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative note for further details.
The epinephrine was weaned off over 24 hours and she was extubated on [**12-11**], however, required reintubation on the next day due to respiratory distress.
Amiodarone was utilized for atrial fibrillation with maintenance of sinus rhythm and beta blockade was reintroduced.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
