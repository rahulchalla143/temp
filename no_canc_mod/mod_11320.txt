Ceftriaxone was given, and the patient had a corrected sodium at this time of 179, with a free water deficit calculated at 8 liters.
Chest x-ray was consistent with pneumonia.
The patient had no complaints, but was aphasic, answers questions with shaking of head.
Bipolar disorder 2.
Dementia 4.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 5.
Urinary/fecal incontinence 7.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat anicteric, clear.
Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, II/VI systolic murmur at left upper sternal border.
Pulmonary showed crackles of the right lung three-quarters of the way up.
Extremities: Trace edema bilaterally.
Neurological:  Patient responds to questions with head shakes.
CKs showed progression from 90 to 101 to 164 to 175.
On [**12-8**], chest x-ray left hilar opacity, acute aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonia, no congestive heart failure, central line intact.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is an 88-year-old resident of [**Hospital1 5595**] with a past medical history of bipolar disorder, Parkinson's, dementia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, status post right hip open reduction and internal fixation, urinary and fecal incontinence, who presents with hypernatremia, pneumonia, decreased platelets, troponin elevation, and laboratories consistent with pancreatitis.
Hypernatremia:  The etiology was thought to be secondary to hyperglycemia combined with decreased thirst related to dementia.
Infectious Disease:  Patient with unclear source to elevated white count.
This was thought to possibly represent aspiration pneumonitis.
The patient had a nadir of platelets at 38.
It was thought that her thrombocytopenia was secondary to DIC.
Gastrointestinal:  Patient with laboratories consistent with pancreatitis.
The patient did have mild tenderness in the epigastrium to deep palpation.
This pain appeared to resolve over the next several days.
Triglycerides were checked and came back at 216 and were not thought to be the cause of her pancreatitis.
The patient did not have an obstructive picture.
The patient's amylase and lipase declined and, at the time of discharge, lipase was mildly elevated and amylase normal for two days.
Endocrinology:  Patient admitted with extremely high blood sugar.
There was thought given to starting an oral hyperglycemic medication.
Pulmonary:  Patient with oxygen requirement on admission.
The patient continued to have oxygen requirement throughout her hospital stay of 3 liters.
It was unclear what the cause of the hypoxemia and hypoxia was.
Patient with question pneumonia per chest x-ray.
This seemed to clear a lot of yellowish secretions.
These did not show any PMNs, and Gram stain was not positive for bacteria.
There was a possible diagnosis of ongoing aspiration.
Type 2 diabetes 2.
Hypernatremia 3.
Mild DIC 5.
Possible pneumonia  FOLLOW UP: 1.
The patient needs checking of her blood sugars with recent diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes.
The patient will need continued assessment of fluid status to prevent future hypernatremia.
