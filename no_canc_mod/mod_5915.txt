he also noted that he had transient speech difficulty near that same time that also subsequently resolved.
He denies any additional complaints including nausea, vomiting, sensory changes, vision changes, diplopia, chest pain or shortness of breath.
He states that earlier in the day he had a headache and he also has had a headache over the last few days up to one week prior to this sudden left-sided weakness which was relieved by Tylenol.
A CT scan of the brain at that time was performed and showed a 2.1 by 1.1 cm acute hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia and right putamen on five cuts.
On arrival, Neurosurgery saw him and recommended no surgical intervention.
He is from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] but has been here for many years.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Other than cocaine and alcohol use, he has no known hypertension and he denies any other history except for some occasional easy bruising on the arms and chest.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He was well nourished and no acute distress.
His cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm, S1-S2 with no murmurs.
Neurological exam showed a mental status.
He had no dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
He had no apraxia or neglect.
His facial sensation was normal and he had a very slight left facial droop.
He had normal bulk and tone, no tremors.
His strength, he had a 4+ to 5- out of 5 weakness on the left upper extremity, distal greater than proximal.
He had a slight pronator drift on the left.
He had slight ataxia on finger-nose-finger on the left and his rapid alternating movements were essentially normal but slightly slow on the left compared to his right.
ADDENDUM:  His hospital admission was also notable for an angiogram which was done which was negative for vasculitis or aneurysm.
Therefore his basal ganglia bleed is presumed to be likely secondary to hypertension which is secondary to cocaine use.
