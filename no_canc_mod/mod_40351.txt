The patient remained afebrile after the lines were pulled for the remainder of her hospital course.
However, in anticipation of discharge, and given her MRSA+ foot wound culture, she was switched back to Vancomycin, to be given at dialysis to complete a 2-week course.
The patient's mental status improved over the course of her hospitalization.
The patient was also noted to have marked asymmetry between her right and left calves, R>L, no erythema or tenderness to palpation.
Although this was felt to be most likely due to [**Last Name (STitle) 1106**] drainage as a result of her LE bypass surgery, she was evaluated for deep venous thrombosis with LENI's, which were found to be negative.
Anemia of chronic disease.
Hypophosphatemia, likely due to malnutrion.
