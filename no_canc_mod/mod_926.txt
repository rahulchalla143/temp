At OSH, the pt became somnolent and less responsive after receiving pain meds (dilaudid 1mg IV), and was intubated electively for airway protection.
Reportedly only able to visualize counting fingers w. R eye at OSH prior to intubation During transport had difficulty sedating with propofol, titrated up to maximal dosing, switched to versed and fentanyl on arrival for better sedation.
Neuro: Mental status: intubated GCS 7T Orientation/Recall/Language: patient is non verbal , intubated, not opening eyes  Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils NR 2.5 bilaterally III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements-eyes are fixed V, VII: Facial strength appears grossly symmetric VIII: Hearing unable to test IX, X: Palatal elevation unable to test [**Doctor First Name 81**]: Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius- unable to test XII: Tongue - unable to test  Motor: Normal bulk and tone bilaterally.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Pupils minimally reactive bilaterally.
There is no proptosis.
The lateral eyelid laceration is ~1cm partially avulsed skin flap, the upper laceration is a complex macerated and abraded 2-2.5cm laceration.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**5-29**]: No acute intrathoracic process.
Slightly anteriorly displaced fracture of the body of the right scapula.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis without evidence of visceral organ, bowel or mesenteric injury.
No pneumothorax.
No fracture or malalignment.
Interval slight progression of the right anterior temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage adjacent to a sphenoid fracture consistent with intracerebral contusion.
On attending overread, this was read as "The anterior temporal abnormality appears to be an epidural hematoma."
Unchanged and two small foci of right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Slight increase in size of small epidural hematoma overlying the right temporal lobe, now measuring 7 mm, previously 5 mm.
Small right frontal lobe contusion, stable.
No new intracranial hemorrhage seen.
Multiple facial fractures with associated hemorrhage, stable.
CT sinus/max/face/mandible [**5-29**]: Fractures of the right orbital superior, lateral, and inferior walls are unchanged with stable 5-mm depression of the inferior orbital wall.
There is a hemorrhage within the right frontal sinus with fracture of the posterior wall.
Fracture and slight widening of the frontozygomatic suture is stable.
Small focus of air and hematoma seen adjacent to a minimally depressed right superior orbital wall fracture, unchanged.
Subcutaneous emphysema and soft tissue swelling over the right face remains stable.
A small epidural hematoma overlying the right temporal lobe and contusion of the right frontal lobe is also stable, and better described on same-day head CT. Communited fractures of the right aspect of the sphenoid sinus /optic strut region are also seen.
R arm xrays: Three views of the right elbow demonstrate no evidence of acute fracture, dislocation, or joint effusion.
Apparent lucent and slightly expansile lesion in the proximal shaft of the radius measuring 2 cm in diameter has well-defined geographic margins favoring a non-aggressive lesion.
However, if symptoms are localized to this region, a bone scan may be considered for further evaluation.

They determined that it was difficult to rule out traumatic or compressive optic neuropathy given poor view of optic canal, with a poor view of optic nerve.
He became hypotensive with precedex so this was discontinued.
His R frontal laceration was repaired by plastic surgery and he was noted to have a R facial nerve paralysis, mostly in the frontotemporal branch as well as the zygomatic branch.
Upon transfer to the floor, he was reevaluated by Opthamology who did not note any major acute injury and recommended follow up with his ophthalmologist for visual field testing given his retinitis pigmentosa.
He is tolerating a liquid diet/soft  but continues to report pain upon jaw movement.
