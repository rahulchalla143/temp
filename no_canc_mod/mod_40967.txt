The mode switch feature is ON for atrial rates greater than 171 bpm.
Initial EKG showed sinus rhythm, rate 57, normal axis with old inferior and high lateral TWI with several PVC of right bundle, superior axis morphology.
During evaluation, he developed similar symptoms and on telemetry had NSVT at a rate in the low 200s lasting up to ten seconds.
CXR showed AICD in place with no acute process.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
regular rhythm, S1, S2, no murmur appreciated, distant heart sounds LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular hypokinesis with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls, apical inferior wall and apex (LVEF = 25-30%).
The inferior septum is hypokinetic.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with overall EF of 25-30% and wall motion abnormalities as described above.
Moderate MR, trace TR and AI.
Aortic stenosis is present.
However, the severity cannot be reliably estimated given depressed systolic function.
-CXR ([**2101-1-26**]) - No acute chest pathology; there is no radiographic evidence for pulmonary edema.
Prominent air-filled mildly dilated loops of small bowel are most consistent with an ileus, although a partial or early small-bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.
Marked gastric distention.
There is no free subdiaphragmatic gas.
Lung volumes are low exaggerating heart size, probably top normal.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in standard placements respectively.
Interval decrease in gastric distention and dilation of small bowel loops.
There is no definitive evidence of free air.
There is no evidence of bowel dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease s/p inferior myocardial infarction, infarct-related cardiomyopathy with LVEF 25-30% and [**Company 1543**] ICD implantation in [**2096**] for primary prevention who presents to the emergency department with non-specific symptoms found to have intermittent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with appropriate ICD shock.
# Ventricular tachycardia - After ICD interrogation, it was found that he had many episodes of NSVT, some of which required antitachycardia pacing and eventually shocks.
This was stopped after less than 24 hours because of nausea and some vomiting which may have been caused by the lidocaine.
He will be anticoagulated for 3 months after the ablation because of the elevated risk for stroke.
# Nausea/vomiting - At presentation, he had some mild nausea, some of which was attributed to the lidocaine drip which was started at admission.
He had projectile bilious vomiting and a KIB showed significant gastric dilation.
This was presumed to be a post-anesthesia ileus, he had a similar reaction after his AAA repair which required decompression with an NGT.
An NGT was placed again this admission and his symptoms improved.
His abdominal exam remained benign with no tenderness to palpation.
The tube was removed after 48 hours when his KUB showed resolving gastric dilation.
# CAD - He did not have any complaints of chest pain and his cardiac enzymes were negative.
# Hyperlipidemia - Continued on home dose of atorvastatin .

Ventricular tachycardia status-post ablation procedure .
Coronary artery disease 2.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF=25-30%)   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit because you were found to have frequent episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) which was causing your ICD to discharge.
You had a VT ablation and did not have any further episodes of VT afterwards.
After receiving general anesthesia, you had nausea and projectile vomiting which required placement of a nasogastric tube, which has subsequently been removed.
Your symptoms improved and the tube was removed prior to discharge.
