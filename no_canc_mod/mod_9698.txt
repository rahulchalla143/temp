The stress test last Tuesday prior to admission showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history of polys removed from the mouth in [**2094**], mouth surgery for cancer in [**2114**] with external beam therapy, left carotid endarterectomy in [**2131**], and a right hip replacement in [**2124**].
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history is significant for a stroke at age of 83; father who had blood problems and died in [**2130**].
