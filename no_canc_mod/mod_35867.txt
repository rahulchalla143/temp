Stable appearance of small bilateral pleural effusions.
EKG: Afib at 47, peaked Ts, narrow complexes   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with multiple medical problems was admitted with asymptomatic bradycardia and worsening renal failure.
She developed respiratory failure during her admission, was intubated, extubated, and eventually passed away while on comfort measures.
Hypoxia: Patient developed hypoxia during her admission and was intubated.
She did well after extubation for several hours, but then developed worsened hypoxia again.
Given progression of renal failure and multiple system issues, a decision was made by the ICU team and the patient's sister to make patient comfort measures only.
The patient passed away at approximately 10 pm on [**2193-2-4**] secondary to respiratory arrest.
Bradycardia-  On admission, patient was asymptomatic with HR as low as 35, which then improved to 60s while holding antihypertensives.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended elective pacer placement if patient/family wished.
A fib- in A Fib during admission with slow response.
Likely had a new baseline (3.5-3.8).
She was rehydrated gently, as patient has diastolic dysfunction and easily develops CHF.
Hyperkalemia resolved.
Renal US r/o obstruction/hydronephrosis and showed changes consistent with chronic parenchymal disease.
CHF- Diastolic dysfunction.
Pt with history of deveoping CHF with fluid hydration so fluid status monitored closely.
