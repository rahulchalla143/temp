Admission Date:  [**2104-2-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-2-26**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Lorazepam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: transfer from OSH for head bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation.
His wife noted that he had no difficulty walking or talking or coordinating movements.
She called EMS after his headachepersisted despite tylenol as his last ICH presented with a headache.
At [**Location (un) 620**] he was found to have ICH and thus electively intubated for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical backup.
Wife reports no falls or trauma, no anticoagulants, aspirin, alternative medicines.
No fevers, chills, recent illnesses, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, GI bleeds, dysuria, or incontinence (bowel or bladder).
Previous interventricular hemorrhage [**6-7**] that resolved as of repeat head CT one month later.
No residual deficits.
2.  pacemaker placement for arrhythmia 3.  history of slowness of gait, ?parkinsons?
Depression 5.
COPD 6.
High cholesterol?
WIfe states that he would NOT want to be recussitated, and that OSH placed ETT before asking her.
Family History: no kids, no bleeds or strokes in other family members   Physical Exam: Vitals:  60, 86/43->136/68, 14, 100% on ventilator GEN: elderly man laying in stretcher, intubated, sedation turned off for low BP HEENT:  NC/AT, anicteric sclera, mmm NECK: supple, no carotid bruits CHEST:  course BS bialterally CV: regular, without murmur/g/r ABD: soft, NT/ND, +BS EXTREM: no edema  NEURO: MENTAL STATUS: opens eyes to voice, awake, follows axial and midline commands, ETT in place prohibits speech CRANIAL NERVES:   Pupil exam: pinpoint, minimally reactive   EOM exam: looks to left and right well, may have limited up and down gaze though as this is not clear   Corneal reflex: + bilaterally   Facial symmetry: forehead wrinkles symmetrically, mouth is wide open with ETT thus limits lower facial exam MOTOR: lifts all extremities off the bed (including both legs at the same time) and holds for 5-10 seconds each.
No pneumonia or CHF.
NCHCT [**2104-2-21**]:  Again seen is an area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema within the lateral aspect of the right temporal lobe.
Additionally, there is some asymmetric thickening of the right tentorium, representing supratentorial subdural hemorrhage, and foci of increased density seen within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally, representing intraventricular hemorrhage.
A small subdural hemorrhage is also seen along the inner table of the right parietal bone.
There is intraventricular hemorrhage, and this appears to have increased in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], suggesting interval bleeding since the prior exam.
Intracranial hemorrhage.
82 yo man with no history of hypertension (in fact, took midodrine to keep BP up), who was admitted to neurology with his 2nd intracranial hemorrhage.
Etiology for his intracranial bleeding is likely secondary to amyloid given age and the location of bleed.
This hemorrhage extended to the ventricles and there are also subarachnoid and subdural components.
He did not require any IV meds for BP control.
He was loaded with dilantin given presence of bleed in the medial temporal lobe for seizure prophylaxis.
Repeat head CT in AM after admission showed no worsening of the bleed.
He did not required insulin for glycemic control.
The patient was evaluated for speech and swallowing and found to have no deficits with swallowing.
Because of constellation of gait abnormalities, incontinence and dementia LP was performed on [**2104-2-26**] to rule out hydrocephalus.
His dilantin will need to be in the therapeutic range for 14 days post-hemorrhage for seizure prophylaxis.
On the day of discharge, the patient developed post-LP headache.
If the patient continues to have post-LP headaches would recommend managing with IVF boluses, Tylenol, recumbent position.
The patient denied suicidal or homicidal ideation.
He is not a candidate for anticoagulation given second intracranial hemorrhage (was not on anticoagulation to begin with).
The patient was started on Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po QD to complete 7 days of therapy for empiric treatment of UTI diagnosed by urinalysis results.
Intracranial hemorrhage.
Urinary tract infection.
Dementia 4.
Depression 5.
Status post pacemaker   Discharge Condition: Patient with cognitive deficits, unable to ambulate without assistance, flat affect, no focal motor or sensory deficits.
