Admission Date:  [**2129-9-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2129-10-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2057-12-23**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old female, a nursing home resident, with a history of schizophrenia, hypertension, and seizure disorder who was admitted to the Medical Service at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2129-9-30**] with a one month history of worsening dysphagia and a new left lower lobe pneumonia possibly caused by aspiration.
The patient was placed on levo and Flagyl for her aspiration pneumonia and was admitted for a dysphagia workup.
While on the floor, the patient received a bedside swallow evaluation showing nonfunctioning swallow with recommendations to keep the patient n.p.o.
She was being seen by the Endocrine Service as well as the Neurology Service to determine the cause of her dysphagia.
While in MRI, the patient went into a PEA arrest and the Code Team was called.
Schizophrenia with delusional features.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  I first met the patient after her PEA arrest.
She was intubated, not responding to voice, sternal rub, or other noxious stimuli.
She had no gag reflex.
She had absent corneal reflex on the right, but it was present on the left.
A II/VI systolic murmur was noted.
The EKG at that time showed a narrow complex tachycardia with a rate of 150, Q waves were noted in III, aVF, V2 through V4.
There were ST depressions noted in V5 and V6.
The ST depressions were new compared with the prior done on [**2129-9-30**] on admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the MICU following her PEA arrest in Radiology.
The degree of down time that she had during the code was unknown and it was suspected that there was some degree of anoxic brain injury.
Emergent CT was acquired after stabilization which showed loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation consistent with early edema.
The MRI of the brain acquired prior to her arrest showed no acute territorial infarct.
There were some periventricular microvascular ischemic changes noted as well as some mild atrophy of the left temporal lobe with T2 hyperintensity in the left subinsular region and temporal white matter suggestive of some chronic ischemia or gliosis.
The source of her hypotension was initially unclear.
MI was ruled out with serial enzymes and an echocardiogram in order to rule out pump failure as the cause of the hypotension.
Antibiotics were continued for her aspiration pneumonia in the event that it might have been a septic shock from a pulmonary source.
She had an arterial line placed at that point in order to better maintain awareness of her pressure levels.
The echocardiogram report showed that left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function were within normal limits with an ejection fraction of over 55%.
There was some moderate thickening of the aortic valve leaflets and 1+ AR.
There was mild thickening of the mitral valve leaflets.
There was a small pericardial effusion noted, possibly thought to be secondary to CPR.
The patient had some witnessed head jerking motions in the MICU.
The EEG was read as abnormal, suggestive of severe diffuse encephalopathy.
There were no epileptiform foci noted.
The patient remained unresponsive despite absence of any sedating medications.
She began to develop some temperature fluctuations treated with a Bear Hugger as well as some blood pressure fluctuations treated with fluid boluses.
She made several calls to family members regarding withdrawal of ventilatory support and the decision was made to make the patient DNR/DNI and to withdrawal the ventilator on the morning of [**2129-10-7**].
I was called to the room at 8:46 a.m. on [**2129-10-7**] for apnea and pulselessness in the patient following the tube being removed.
She was unresponsive with fixed dilated pupils and absence of brain stem reflexes.
She was apneic and auscultation revealed no heart sounds.
