Radiography was consistent with a possible aspiration pneumonia into the left lung.
The patient has a #6 fenestrated Shiley tracheostomy secondary to supraglottic stenosis, copious secretions, and the risk of aspiration.

Throughout administration of antibiotics the patient has remained afebrile without leukocytosis.

CT scans of the head were performed two times, but no interpretation was performed secondary to poor quality of the films.
