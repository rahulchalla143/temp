Admission Date:  [**2157-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-7-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-7-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2157-7-12**] Cardiac Catheterization with Placement of IABP [**2157-7-13**] Mitral Valve Repair utilizing a 30mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Annuloplasty Ring   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year old male with remote history of mitral valve endocarditis and known mitral regurgitation who presented with two week history of worsening shortness of breath.
His shortness of breath improved with rest and most recently with supplemental oxygen.
Patient reports mild associated cough, nonproductive.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]; per report from PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has had serial echocardiograms since establishing w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], which have not shown any significant increase in end-systolic dimension of the left ventricle, although he has been noted to have left atrial enlargement previously.
Per PCP notes, patient's symptoms would briefly improve with daily Lasix dosing.
Patient initially presented to OSH, had CT chest that did not demonstrate signs of infection and was discharged.
As symptoms continued to worsen he presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.
Exam was significant for crackles and systolic murmur.
EKG w L atrial abnormality (?p-mitrale), peaked twaves in precordials w ST changes.
OSH CT scan was re-read and w/o sign of PE.
CXR did not demonstrate any acute process.
Past Medical History: - History of Mitral Valve Endocarditis(following dental work) - Mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation - Hypertension - Psoriasis   Social History: - Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 1887**], MA.
Family History: No family history of early cardiac/valvular disease  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Vitals: T: 98.3 degrees Farenheit, BP: 110/70 mmHg supine, HR 80 bpm, RR 20 bpm, O2: 100 % on 2L.
Wt 64.7kg on standing scale Gen: Pleasant, calm HEENT: No conjunctival pallor.
No thyromegaly.
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Patient acutely short of breath just with sitting up.
[**2157-7-11**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is partial posterior leaflet flail with torn mitral chordae attached (cannot exclude vegetation if clinically suggested).
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderat to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  demonstrated no angiographcially apparent, flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamcis revealed  mildly elevated right and severly elevated left ventricular filling pressures, with a RVEDP of 16mmHg and an LVEDP of 28mmHg.
There was severe pulmonary hypertension, with a PASP of 63 mmHg.
There was no transvalvular gradient to suggest aortic stenosis.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Aortic regurgitation is seen.
The aortic regurgitation is at least mild to moderate in intensity.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is extensive posterior mitral leaflet flail.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Initially after separation from bypass, the right ventricle displayed continued moderate global hypokinesis.
The left ventricle displayed septal dyskinesis likely secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass.
There is also some moderate inferior wall hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular function improved though inferior hypokinesis and septal dyskinesis remained - ejection fraction approximated 40-45%.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is in situ.
There is some redundant anterior leaflet beyond the coaptation point but no significant mitral valvular systolic anterior motion is noted.
Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid and aortic regurgitation is unchanged from the pre-bypass period.
[**2157-7-17**] Chest x-ray: Status post median sternotomy with placement of mitral annular ring.
Heart remains enlarged with left ventricular prominence, suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy.
No evidence of pulmonary edema, although there is mild cephalization suggestive of pulmonary venous hypertension.
The lung volumes are slightly improved, although there is residual linear opacity at both bases, likely representing subsegmental atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are seen.
No pneumothorax.
No overt pulmonary edema.
DISCHARGE LABS: pending   Brief Hospital Course: Dr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted under cardiology with congestive heart failure secondary to mitral regurgitation and acute renal insufficiency.
His acute renal insufficiency was attributed to recent dye load from CTA at outside hospital.
Ischemia was ruled out as cause of this event with negative cardiac enzymes and no ECG evidence of ischemia.
CTA at outside hospital preliminary read showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed a partial mitral leaflet flail, torn mitral chordae, and an eccentric mitral regurgitation jet with severe (4+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] prior to cardiac catheteriation, patient developed respiratory distress and became less responsive.
He required intubation and transfered to cath lab where catheterization revealed no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease, cardiogenic shock with elevated biventricular filling pressures and severe pulmonary hypertension.
He developed atrial fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone per protocol.
He remained in a normal sinus rhythm and no further episodes of atrial fibrillation were noted.
