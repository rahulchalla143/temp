Admission Date:  [**2149-4-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2149-4-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2149-4-6**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEONATOLOGY  HISTORY:   Baby Girl [**Known lastname 1453**] [**Known lastname 40930**], twin number one, delivered at 24 5/7 weeks gestation, weighing 460 grams, and was admitted to the Intensive Care Nursery for management of extreme prematurity.
[**Known lastname 1453**] expired on day of life five ([**2149-4-11**]) secondary to respiratory failure.
Mother's obstetric history was notable for [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4585**].
Her first child was born at term without complications at two and a half years ago.
This pregnancy was complicated by dichorionic diamniotic twin gestation, cerclage placement at 18 weeks, and cervical shortening with ballooning of cervix at 22 weeks, treated with bed rest.
On the day prior to delivery, the mother developed possible rupture of membranes with leakage of amniotic fluid.
On day of delivery, cervical dilation with maternal fever to 100.1 with concerns for chorioamnionitis prompted delivery by cesarean section.
[**Known lastname 1453**] emerged with poor tone and poor respiratory effort, with a good response to positive pressure ventilation with bag and mask, heart rate greater than 100.
Genitourinary: Extremely immature external genitalia.
Pulmonary status continued to worsen on day of life four, and was noted to have prominent pulmonary interstitial emphysema on chest x-ray.
On day of life five ([**4-11**]), [**Known lastname 40931**] respiratory status worsened with more severe pulmonary interstitial emphysema and inability to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90% despite increased settings on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and 100% oxygen.
In discussion with the primary team and parents, we reviewed her worsening pulmonary failure and increasingly high risk of mortality.
Cardiovascular:  Echocardiogram showed no structural heart disease, and a small patent ductus arteriosus.
She was treated with indomethacin on day of life three for signs and symptoms consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus.
[**Known lastname 1453**] also required hydrocortisone and dopamine for blood pressure support, with maximum dopamine infusion of 25 mcg/kg/minute.
Was maintained on glucose water, and total parenteral nutrition, following serum electrolytes every six to eight hours, and fluids and electrolytes adjusted to maintain within normal limits.
There were several brief episodes of hypoglycemia, treated with D-10-W boluses and adjustment of glucose and fluids.
Genetics:  Trisomy-21 was suspected on initial examination that included prominent tongue, low-set ears, increased nuchal skin, and single palmar crease on the right hand.
Neurology:  Head ultrasounds were done on day of life three and day of life five, and showed no intraventricular hemorrhage.
