Admission Date:  [**2183-11-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2183-11-25**]  Date of Birth:              Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 9919**] is a 73 year old Caucasian male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who was in usual state of health until [**2183-7-9**], when he wanted to join a gym.
Due to his age, he was requested to have a stress test which showed abnormal results, including regional wall motion abnormalities, severe hypokinesis in the anterior wall, and apex, and anterolateral central septal walls on the echocardiogram.
Due to the result of this echocardiogram, the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization [**7-23**], showing 90% proximal right coronary artery stenosis, diffuse disease in mid-RCA and 40% distal right coronary artery stenosis, 30% proximal left anterior descending stenoses, 90% mid-LAD stenosis and 60% distal left anterior descending stenosis.
There was also 90% stenosis in the diagonal branches.
The patient tolerated his procedure well and was doing well after his catheterization until [**2183-11-16**], when he presented with a temperature of 101.0 F., to the Emergency Department with right lower quadrant abdominal pain similar to his diverticulitis which he has had before.
While drinking Baricon contrast in preparation for an abdominal CT scan in the Emergency Department, the patient developed 10 on 10 chest pain while he had no history of chest pain ever in the past, with a [**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in leads V3 to V6, [**Street Address(2) 7093**] depressions in leads II, III and AVF.
However, his pain recurred and his ST depressions became more pronounced.
A study of the patient's coronaries showed mild disease of the left main coronary artery.
The left anterior descending had 40% proximal stenosis and 90% in-stent restenosis with a 99% ostial D1 disease.
The left circumflex was without critical disease.
During the procedure, the patient became hypotensive requiring Dopamine for pressure support.
Overall, the patient received intervention of a kissing balloon inflation in left anterior descending and D1 with 30% residual stenosis in D1 as well as a balloon in the right coronary artery with zero percent residual stenosis.
Diabetes mellitus.
Diverticulosis in [**2178**].
Coronary artery disease.
A recent course of Amoxicillin stopped on [**11-22**] for right lower lobe pneumonia.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His father died of myocardial infarction at age 53.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The patient has a left upper lip laceration which was oozing slightly on anti-coagulation.
Chest examination revealed rhonchorous breath sounds in the right anterior chest with decreased breath sounds at the right lung base.
There was no murmur appreciated.
Abdomen examination revealed a soft abdomen with diffuse normoactive bowel sounds with questionable suprapubic tenderness.
Extremity examination revealed warm extremities with no edema.
With the patient's presenting symptoms of left lower quadrant pain to the Emergency Department, and an elevated white count with 10% of bandemia, it was highly suspected that the patient had a recurrence of his diverticulitis.
except for medications.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2183-11-17**], to evaluate the patient's cardiac function post his acute myocardial injury.
There was severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with some preservation of basal septal lateral and posterior wall motion.
There was no significant valvular regurgitations or stenoses seen on this echocardiogram.
On the Swan-Ganz catheter, the patient was found to have low pulmonary artery diastolic pressure which raises a question of volume depletion in the setting of a possible inferior myocardial infarction.
The patient was bolused with normal saline for volume repletion.
There were no sources of bleeding notable except for minor oozing from his left lip laceration.
The patient responded very well to volume repletion with normal saline as well as a unit of packed red blood cells and was able to be weaned off intra-aortic balloon pump on [**2183-11-19**].
This was thought to be due to a minor congestive heart failure for which he received Lasix for gentle diuresis.
By [**2184-11-19**], when the patient was extubated and weaned off sedation, the patient reported no left lower quadrant discomfort.
On this echocardiogram, he was found to have severe depressed left ventricular systolic function.
He was found to have left ventricular hypokinesis with akinesis of the interior and apical inferior wall with relative sparing of the base.
On the [**11-24**], the patient complained of hoarse voice and difficulty swallowing.
The patient was found to have no abnormalities on examination.
He had no gastrointestinal symptoms.
Acute coronary syndrome.
