She had diffuse abdominal discomfort and bloating associated with this.
She had subjective (but not objective) fevers, chills, and sweats as well as lightheadedness and dizziness.
These signs and symptoms resolved spontaneously by the morning of [**4-2**].
She reports watery, black stools for the past week but denies BRBPR or melena.
Past Medical History: 1. alcoholic cirrhosis c/b grade I varices on EGD [**12-22**] 2. hepatic encephalopathy [**3-23**] 3. hepatic hydrothorax 4.
MRSA-infected pleural effusion [**12-22**] 5. childhood pyelonephritis  Social History: The patient drank [**5-24**] alcoholic drink daily for many years; her last drink was on [**2136-12-25**].
Family History: One paternal uncle had alcoholic cirrhosis, otherwise no known family history of liver disease.
HEENT: NCAT, no sinus tenderness, conjunctivae clear, OP clear, MMM, NGT in place Neck: Soft, supple, no JVD, no cervical adenopathy CV: Tachycardic, regular, S1/S2, soft flow murmur Pulm: Decreased bibasilar breath sounds (R >> L) with left basilar crackles, no rhonchi or wheezes Abd: Soft, non-tender, moderately distended, active bowel sounds, no palpable organomegaly, dullness to percussion diffusely Back: No spinal or CVA tenderness Ext: 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally, no edema Skin: Spider angiomata anterior chest wall, no palmar erythema, no icterus or jaundice  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs WBC-13.8 (N-70 band-0 L-16 M-12 Atyp-2) HCT-18.7 MCV-101 Plt-146 PT-17.4 PTT-40.0 INR-1.9 Na-127 K-5.2 Cl-94 Bicarb-27 BUN-48 Cr-1.1 Glu-115 ALT-37 AST-78 TBili-1.6 [**Doctor First Name **]-71 Lip-102  U/A: Trace protein, trace ketone, RBC-0, WBC-0-2, Bact-none, Yeast-none  EGD3/16 Blood in the stomach body.
Pt may have bled from either esophageal varices or portal gastropathy Mosaic and giraffe skin appearance in the fundus and proximal body compatible with portal gastropathy.
Snakeskinning and congestion in the stomach body compatible with portal gastropathy.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 yo woman with alcoholic cirrhosis admitted to MICU for upper GI bleed due to esophageal varices, stabilized by banding.
UGIB: Presented with hematemesis and coffee grounds in NG lavage.
Underwent EGD ([**2137-4-3**]) grade II varices were seen in the esophagus, no active bleeding but blood in stomach, s/p banding.
Nadolol was held due to low SBPs and can be reinitiated as an outpatient.
Additionally, a urine culture ([**4-5**]) had enterococcus and MRSA [**Last Name (un) 36**] to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she received vancomycin for a short course ([**Date range (1) 26124**]); subsequent UCX [**4-6**] neg; UCx [**4-14**] pending on discharge.
Pulmonary: The patient was noted to have a chronic right sided pleural effusion on admission that was transudative on a diagnostic tap.
The size of this effusion grew in serial CXRs and the left side of the lung showed increased opacification consistent with pulmonary edema/CHF.
Her oxygen requirement increased and she was requiring a non rebreather mask.
Subsequent CXRs revealed a new LLL opacity thought to be a nosocomial pneumonia (?
The patient's oxygen requirement decreased after the second thoracentesis and diuresis for CHF, but she was still requiring 2L NC with ambulation; therefore she was discharged with home oxygen as needed while ambulatory.
She was continued on lasix and spironolactone, and her nadolol was continued apart from a brief period when it was held given her low blood pressures.
*Liver nodule: Her abdominal U/S also showed a hyperechoic nodule in the R lobe of the liver which was concerning for HCC with an AFP of 8.7.
F/E/N: Hyponatremia ?
Line care Midline care as needed   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: - ETOH cirrhosis - Esophageal varices complicated by upper GI bleed - Hydrothorax s/p 2 therapeutic paracenteses - Left sided pneumonia - Coagulopathy   Discharge Condition: No further episodes of hematemesis following initial presentation, stable, ambulatory, tolerating an oral diet, no temperatures >100.5 over the past 24 hours.
