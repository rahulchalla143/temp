Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened and immobilized.
There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.4cm2).
Trace to mild aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a bioprosthesis located in the aortic position.
The mitral regurgitation is worsened -compared to pre-bypass.
There is no focal lung consolidation.
There is subtle bibasilar atelectasis of the lung bases.
There is new mild engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, suggesting new mild pulmonary edema.
New mild pulmonary edema, with bilateral small pleural effusions, and bibasilar atelectasis, and retrocardiac atelectasis.
He experienced intermittent bouts of rapid atrial fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone in addition to beta blockade.
Due to persistent bouts of paroxsymal atrial fibrillation, Coumadin was started and dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 and 2.5.
