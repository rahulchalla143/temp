Admission Date:  [**2175-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-3-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-2-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Keflex / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**] Chief Complaint: B/L LE edema and non healing ulcers, now awaiting ICD placement by EP  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Abdominal aortogram.
Debridement of bilateral venous stasis ulcerations.
8. single chamber ICD implantation  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo male with known long standing DM II, and chronic non-healing ulcers of the LE's bilaterally.
After this, he was sent to a cardiac rehab where he was noted to have worsening LE edema and ulcers of the calves and shins.
On removal of the unaboots, there was worsening of the ulcerations and the toes became more discolored.
He has a history of PVD, and underwent LLE angiogram with Left AT angioplasty in [**2172**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He most recent NIVS showed B/L tibial disease.
On the day of admission, he came from wound care clinic where his affected toes were noted to be black and bleeding and he was admitted to the vascular service.
While on the vascular service he was felt to have non healing ulcers, necrotic toes and likely venous insufficency.
He underwent angiography on [**2-24**] which revealed severe PVD and bilateral lower extremity ischemia with gangrene.
Patient had a witnessed syncopal episode and was found to be immediately non-responsive, pulseless.
Received 1 dose epi, and 2 grams magnesium for prolonged QT and possible torsades.
Initial ECG post-code showed no ST/T changes c/w ischemia.
EP was consulted and felt that his arrest was most likely secondary to underlying familial prolonged QT syndrome in setting of fluoroquinolone use, so ciprofloxacin was stopped.
There were no deep tissue cultures to tailor therapy but tissue swabs grew diptheroids, citrobacter, staph, bacteroides.
He also had debridement of bilateral venous stasis ulcerations.

No deep tissue cultures sent so covering broadly with meropenem and vancomycin for a 2 week course for soft tissue infection.
According to vascular surgery attending, patient did have bone involvement at the time of surgery but he felt that all of the involved bone was debrided so at this time he does not require treatment for osteomyelitis.
He has not had any significant fever, leukocytosis, or abdominal pain.
He will require 2 weeks of flagyl after completion of his broad spectrum antibiotics.
Unfortunately, his foley could not be removed due to penile and scrotal edema but as he continues to diurese (below) and his swelling improves, his foley should be removed.
# volume overload: patient notes several months of volume overload and weight gain following his AVR.
Potential contribution of recently decreased lasix prior to admission as well as acute renal failure on admission.
He should continue this medication and should have his electrolytes monitored daily to ensure he does not go into renal failure or have significant electrolyte abnormalities.
# acute on chronic renal failure: Prior baseline Cr of 1.3.
Potentially related to volume overload and poor forward flow.
# AF: history of paroxysmal AF.
No evidence of ischemia at the time of his arrest.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1. toe gangrene s/p amputation 2. non-healing ulcers of lower extremities 3. cardiac arrest due to long QT syndrome (?
familial) 4. acute on chronic diastolic heart failure 5. acute on chronic renal failure  Secondary: 1. atrial fibrillation 2. diabetes mellitus 3. hyperlipidemia 4. coronary artery disease 5. peripheral vascular disease   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable.
No sustained VT or ICD shocks since ICD placement.
No abdominal pain.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for ulcers and infections of your legs and toes.
During your hospitalization, you had a cardiac arrest.
This may be due to an inherited abnormality in the electrical system of your heart.
You were also diagnosed with an infection in your urine and in your stool.
