No further vomiting.
Hepatology fellow arrived to scope pt, was found to have multiple grade 3 varices with stigmata of recent bleeding, s/p banding x 4.
He did not have any further episodes of hematemesis or even abominal pain.
Pt's first bowel movement since the bleed was melanic, as expected after an UGI bleed.
After that bowel movement his subsequent ones were normal in color and did not have any further epsisodes of melana.
LEFT ELBOW PAIN: Pt had a history of probable gout.
He had not had a joint aspiration previously, and dx was made on high uric acid levels.
Pt had a near fever at 100.2 on the floor.
CXR was negative for pneumonia.
Pt had a painful L elbow, warm with an effusion, no erythema noted.
It was thought this was likely due to his gout, but septic arthitis could not be ruled out.
Thus a joint aspiration was done, which showed a WBC 200, which r/o septic arthtis.
No crystals were seen so gout vs. pseudogout could not be confirmed or excluded from the aspiration - since pt's joint flare was resolving at that point.
CIRRHOSIS: Pt's cirrhosis is [**1-13**] NASH plus alcoholic liver disease.
Colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: can increase dose when pain is worse  .
Disp:*2 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: - Hematemesis  Secondary diagnosis - NASH + alcohol cirrhosis - Gout ?
- hypertension - hyperlipidemia - history of psoriasis   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You had an hematemeis (vomitted blood) due to esophageal varices.
The varices developed because of your liver disease.
The varices were banded on EGD to reduce the risk of future bleeding.
Your joint was also aspirated was not a septic joint and most likely gout.
Medication changes: - take 1 more day of Cipro 500mg once tomorrow - Nadalol 20mg was added to reduce risk of bleeding from the varices - take lacutlose if needed to have 1 bowel movement per day to help with your liver disease - sucrulfate was added to help stop further gi bleeding - prednisone 20mg for 2 more days - one tablet per day for joint pain - oxycodone if needed for this pain temporarily  If you vomit blood again, or develop a fever > 100.4 return to the ED immediately.
