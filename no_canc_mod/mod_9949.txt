Admission Date:  [**2106-4-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-4-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-11-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3266**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal Pain, Fevers, Diarrhea   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 55 year old male with ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and cirrhosis who presents s/p pullback cholangiogram today to evaluate for biliary drain leakage with fever and abdominal pain.
Developed pain around biliary drain 4-5 days ago, worsening as the week progressed.
Called [**Hospital **] clinic and was electively scheduled for [**4-9**] for cholnagiogram to evaluate for possible biliary leak.
Last night had fever to 101 and multiple episodes of watery diarrhea.
Awoke this a.m. with lower quadrant abdominal pain, different from the evolving pain over the past week.
Presented to GI suite where pullback cholangiogram was performed which showed free passage of bile into jejunum without evidence of leak.
However, has had continued lower crampy abdominal pain every 30 minutes with max fever of 102.4 and continued diarrhea.
Additionally, he never has this type of abdominal pain with UC exacerbations.
No BRBPR or melena.
Nausea/vomited x 1 last night at MN with no repeat episodes.
ROS: Notes 40 pound weight loss over past 4 yrs.
+ decreased appetitie.
Past Medical History: # Primary sclerosing cholangitis - s/p CBD excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
PET scan with multiple areas of FDG1 avidity concerning for malignancy # Cirrhosis - Thought to be secondary to PSC; complicated by esophageal varices - three cords with grade I varices - and splenomegaly (liver biopsy showed bridging fibrosis, but varices and splenomegaly suggestive of cirrhosis).
# S/p cholangiogram [**11-27**] which demonstrated irregular dilation and stricture of the left-sided intrahepatic bile duct with no communication to the right side.
Biliary drain placement in [**11-27**] with biopsies that revealed fibrosis, but no evidence of a tumor.
HEENT: PERRL/EOM intact, +scleral icterus, OP clear, MMM, no JVD, no carotid bruit.
Cardiac: RRR, nl s1s2, no MRGs Lungs: CTA b/l, no crackles or wheezes.
Abd: diffusely jaundiced, soft, +BS, very tender to palpation in lower quadrant diffusely, not tender around catheter drainage site, dressing in place and clean and dry, no rebound or guarding, no ascites extr: warm well perfused, 2+ dp pulses, no cyanosis, no LE edema.
[**2106-4-9**] CXR: No effusions.
No infiltrates.
No free air under the diaphragm.
Pullback cholangiogram via the existing percutaneous biliary access into the left intrahepatic biliary duct demonstrated no dilatation of the left intrahepatic biliary duct, minimal filling of the nondilated side branches, and free passage of contrast past the biliary/enteric anastomosis.
New colonic thickening involving the cecum and ascending colon up to the proximal transverse colon most consistent with inflammation or infection.
The adjacent appendix is enlarged with intraluminal fluid and peripheral enhancement concerning for associated appendicitis.
New mild intraabdominal ascites.
[**Name (NI) 44264**] PTC drain extending from stably dilated left-sided intrahepatic ducts into the proximal duodenum.
A left-sided periductal cystic region has increased in size from prior exam as described above.
Interval improvement in colonic wall thickening of the cecum and ascending colon consistent with inflammation or infection.
New small-to-moderate right pneumothorax.
[**4-12**] CXR: Marked interval improvement in previously identified right hydropneumothorax with small residual right pneumothorax.
Unusual cystic lucencies in right perihilar region which could represent additional loculated areas of pneumothorax.
[**4-12**] Pleural drain placement CXR: After placement of pleural drain, there is now a combination of moderate right pneumothorax with layering pleural effusion or hemothorax.
Increase in right basilar atelectasis .
Mild rightward mediastinal shift is stable.
[**4-14**] CXR: Right apical pleural tube unchanged in position projecting over a small apical pleural air collection.
Small fissural right pleural effusion increased slightly.
Mild rightward mediastinal shift stable.
[**4-15**] CXR: Small right apical pneumothorax persists, apical pleural tube in place.
Atelectasis at the base of the right lung which may be considerable in the lower lobe has increased since [**4-14**].
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
[**4-16**] CXR: Persistent small, unchanged right pneumothorax .
Dilated left-sided biliary ducts.
Multiple prominent mesenteric lymph nodes, some may be slightly more prominent than before.
[**4-19**] CXR after removal of chest tube: Comparison to prior chest x-ray of [**2106-4-18**] at 11:38 a.m. shows no appreciable change in the appearance of the chest with a small persistent right apical pneumothorax .
Pullback cholangiogram via the existing percutaneous biliary access into the left intrahepatic biliary duct demonstrates no dilatation of the main left intrahepatic biliary ducts.
There is minimal filling of side branches in the left lobe and this raises the likelihood of progression of the PSC with significant obstruction to many more intrahepatic ducts, Clinical correlation recommended to decide if additional duct drainage should be attempted.
Free passage of contrast was noted through the biliary/enteric anastomosis without evidence for biliary leakage.
Replacement of the 10 French external-internal biliary drain with a 10 French external-internal biliary drain, which was capped .
Multifocal areas of mild-to-moderate intrahepatic segmental biliary dilatation, most prominent in the left lobe in keeping with background of primary sclerosing cholangitis.
No mass lesion.
Splenomegaly, small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
Moderate right basal pleural effusion and some associated right basal atelectasis similar to recent CT. .
[**4-12**] RUL wedge resection specimen: Emphysema with bleb formation and subpleural fibrosis.
[**4-21**] EGD/colonoscopy biopsies: Gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies, six: A. Antrum:  Fragment of unremarkable superficial gastric foveolar epithelium.
B. Cecum:  Fragment of unremarkable superficial intestinal mucosa.
D. Ascending colon:  No diagnostic abnormalities identified.
E. Splenic flexure:  No diagnostic abnormalities identified.
Note: No granulomas or dysplasia seen.
# Abdominal pain:  Cholangiogram had no evidence of biliary leak as a possible cause of abdominal pain.
He had evidence of appendicitis, which was thought to be secondary to inflammation from the colitis.
He continued to spike fevers and was subsequently started on Zosyn to increase gram negative coverage to cover Pseudomonas, and oral vancomycin for the possibility of C. diff resistant to Flagyl.
Stool studies were negative for C. diff.
He subsequently underwent colonoscopy on [**4-20**] that showed chronic inflammation and esophageal varices, but no acute UC flare.
He was able to resume eating with no complications, and his diarrhea decreased in frequency.
He completed a course of ciprofloxacin and was discharged on no antibiotics.
# Pneumothorax:  Spontaneous right pneumothorax was incidentally found on CT abdomen on [**4-11**].
He was initially asymptomatic, but subsequently had some respiratory distress.
His pneumothorax was increasing on chest x-ray.
He subsequently developed a hemopneumothorax.
Chest x-ray the next day showed stable residual small apical pneumothorax.
His elevated bilirubin gradually tranded down, but his alkaline phosphatase continued to trend up.
This did not reveal any acute process or obstruction.
If it has no effect in reducing his diarrhea, it will be restarted in [**12-25**] days.
# Ulcerative Colitis: He was initially continued on colazol and flagyl at his outpatient doses.
No acute UC was found, only chronic inflammation, pan-colonic diverticulosis, and esophageal varices.
His cirrhosis is complicated by esophageal varices and splenomegaly.
He had a small amount of ascites of CT abdomen.
# FEN: He has had poor PO intake with chronic weight loss.
