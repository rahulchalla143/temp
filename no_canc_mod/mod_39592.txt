Brief Hospital Course: 34 yo M with h/o AVM as a child with resultant left hemiparesis, VP shunt, spinal stenosis who presented to an OSH on [**4-18**] with acute respiratory distress and RUQ pain.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where he was intubated in the ER for respiratory fatigue.
Pan CT scan showed distended gallbladder with sludge/multiple small layering gallstones without pericholecystic fluid or fat stranding.
He had an episode of hypotension and hypoxia, which improved with suctioning.
He was febrile on [**4-21**], and pan-cultures, including bile, showed no growth.
It was noted that he was as high as 17 liters positive LOS, and so a lasix gtt was started with good effect, and propofol was added to precedex for sedation.
A family meeting with multiple providers was held on [**4-26**], and the family expressed strong wishes against tracheostomy, as the patient has tracheal stenosis as a complication of a prior tracheostomy.
A chest x-ray was taken on the day of discharge at the request of his family, which showed (prelim read) continued right basal atelectasis with elevated hemidiaphragm, some mild congestion (improved from prior), resolving infiltrate, and no effusion.
He also developed diarrhea (C. difficile negative) which was attributed to his recent antibiotics.
Finally, on the evening prior to discharge, he began to develop a rash along his left flank.
This progressed the following morning [**5-3**] to a maculopapular morbilliform rash covering most of the trunk and also in patches on the lower extremities consistent with a drug reaction.
The patient has also been asked to follow up with his PCP to discuss resumption of full-dose aspirin (held during this admission) as well as proper follow up for his liver biopsy findings (NASH vs. toxic-metabolic injury).
