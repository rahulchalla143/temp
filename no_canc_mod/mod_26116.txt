Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2187-12-17**]: Status post extensive bilateral craniotomy with encephalomalacic changes in the right temporal lobe.
Status post bilateral cranioplasty with adjacent bilateral hyperdensities in the extra-axial spaces consistent with blood products as well as pneumocephalus with minimal mass effect on adjacent sulci.
These are likely sequelae of postoperative changes.
[**12-27**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Status post bilateral cranioplasty.
However, since the previous study, there has been an increase in the amount of fluid overlying the left frontoparietal lobes in the extradural space with slightly more mass effect of the underlying sulci.
Also, there is more fluid overlying the left cranioplasty within the subcutaneous tissues as described above.
