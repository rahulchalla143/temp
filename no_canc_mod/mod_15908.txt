Admission Date:  [**2137-10-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2137-11-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2068-1-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presented as a transfer from an outside hospital with respiratory failure and hypotension.
Per the patient's wife, the patient had been experiencing flu-like symptoms with fevers to 101, chills, and progressive malaise.
The patient also reportedly had respiratory symptoms including dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis.
On the day of admission, the patient reportedly developed increasing dyspnea and acute shortness of breath and 911 was called.
In the ambulance, the patient was treated with morphine, nitroglycerin, and 80 mg of intravenous Lasix for congestive heart failure.
The patient required intubation while in the ambulance for hypoxic respiratory failure and subsequently developed pulseless electrical activity arrest.
On arrival to the Emergency Department at the outside hospital, the patient again developed pulselessness and was treated with 1 mg of epinephrine and dopamine.
An electrocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated sinus tachycardia to the 120s, new right bundle-branch block, and 1-mm to 2-mm ST depressions in the precordial and inferior leads.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Pulmonary examination revealed bilateral rales anteriorly with bronchial breath sounds at the left base.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardic with normal first heart sound and second heart sound.
No third heart sound or fourth heart sound.
No significant murmurs.
Abdominal examination revealed soft, mildly distended, hypoactive bowel sounds.
No masses were appreciated.
Extremities were warm with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
No edema was appreciated.
Normal liver function tests and coagulation studies.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray at the outside hospital demonstrated bilateral alveolar infiltrates.
The patient remained intubated with adequate ventilation; however, relatively poor oxygenation with large bilateral pleural effusions and alveolar infiltrates.
The patient developed a ST-elevation myocardial infarction with peak creatine kinase of greater than [**2134**], and an ejection fraction of 10% to 15%, secondary to global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The patient continued with persistent hypotension requiring pressor support felt secondary to a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock.
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for persistent fevers to 104; however, multiple sets of cultures including sputum, blood, and urine were without growth.
The source of the infection was initially felt likely to be a pulmonary process; however, given the persistent fevers despite broad spectrum antibiotics, the patient underwent head, thoracic, and abdominal CAT scans for evaluation for potential additional source of infection.
The head CAT scan was notable for diffuse (predominantly posterior) edema with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter distribution.
The chest CAT scan demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions with pulmonary edema, and no lymphadenopathy.
Neurology was consulted for evaluation of neurologic status.
The patient was weaned off of sedation with minimal neurologic responsiveness to stimuli.
Neurology recommended electroencephalogram and nuclear brain perfusion scan.
The assessment; based on the results of the studies, per Neurology, was extremely poor prognosis for meaningful recovery.
