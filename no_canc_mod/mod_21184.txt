A single cratered ulcer was found in the duodenal bulb.
A clot suggested recent bleeding.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
A single superficial ulcer was found in the distal bulb.
A visible vessel suggested recent bleeding.
She had no further BMs or melena.
She had an EGD performed by GI which demonstrated a single cratered ulcer in the duodenal bulb with stigmata of recent bleeding.
This was injected with epinephrine and clipped; GI indicated that a risk of rebleeding remained.
# A-fib/SVT: At the time of admission, the pt was taking ASA 325 [**Hospital1 **] for her prior history of PAF; this was stopped at the time of admission.
In the setting of having her beta blocker held, the pt was noted to have several episodes of AF with RVR (HR to the 140s), as well as two episodes of SVT (HR again to 140s) that was thought to likely represent AVNRT.
We would suggest possible up-titration of her diltiazem as allowed by her HR and BP, and eventual conversion to the long-acting form of the medication.
# Diastolic dysfunction: The pt appeared euvolemic throughout her stay.
A chest x-ray after several days without Lasix did not demonstrate any evidence of failure.
When her HR was elevated, the pt was noted to have fairly diffuse ST depressions which resolved with better HR control, thus continued aspirin therapy, likely at 325 mg daily, would be ideal.
# Dementia: The pt remained pleasantly and mildly demented throughout her hospital course.
There was no evidence of delirium.
