There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and very mild inferolateral hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
An eccentric jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Well-seated mitrla annuloplasty ring with slightly higher-than-expected gradients.
Mild residual mitral regurgitation.
No pericardial effusion seen  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year old male who was admitted with hypotension and dehyration.
He was seen by VNA earlier and was found to have orthostatic hypotension.
He reports feeling dizzy over the past several days, leading to decreased oral and fluid intake.
He was admitted to the CVICU for 24 hour observation and a cardiac echocardiogram to evaluate for pericardial effusion.
Echo showed EF unchanged, no pericardial effusion.
Oral and fluid intake were encouraged, as well as Ensure as a supplement to meals.
