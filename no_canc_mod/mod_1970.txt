Incision and drainage.
[**2192-4-24**]: G-tube placement via interventional radiology  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 13060**] is a 68 year old man with history of cervical spondylysis and disc degeneration who underwent C4-C7 discectomies and C4-C7 spinal stabilization on [**2192-2-13**].
His post-operative course was complicated by fever and leukocytosis on [**2-23**]; a urine culture grew E. coli, and an infected PIV site grew MSSA; he was started on Cipro and Vanco on [**2-23**] and then was transitioned to Levofloxicin for 7 day course on [**2-28**].
He initially did well after discharge, but for the past 5-6 weeks he has been complaining of neck pain and restricted movement.
His symptoms have worsened over the past ~ 10 days, with difficulty swallowing, decreased PO intake, rigors and possibly fevers.
On [**4-13**] his symptoms worsened further, with [**10-13**] pain and inability to move his right side.
He was referred to the emergency room early in the morning on [**4-14**] where an MRI revealed an epidural abscess from C2-C4, with spinal cord compression.

He has a sister with diabetes, another sister with MS, and a 62-year-old brother who died from a myocardial infarction.
HEENT: limited ROM of head and neck secondary to pain.
Left leg [**4-8**] hip flex, knee flex/ext, ankle DF/PF On transfer to medicine service... VITALS: Tm 99.7F, Tc 99.7F, BP 140/90 (140-185/72-118), HR 104, Sat 94-97% GENERAL: C-collar in place, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, OP clear without lesions NECK: Unable to examine because of neck brace CARD: RRR, normal S1/S2, no m/r/g RESP: Course rhonchi bilaterally ABD: Soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly BACK: No spinal tenderness below cervical region EXT: No clubbing/cyanosis/edema, 2+ DP pulses NEURO: CN II-XII (grossly; difficult to perform full exam given limited patient cooperation), A&O x 0, Strength 3-/5 in right upper and right lower extremity, full on left.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-2-14**] poor R wave progression is not seen on the current tracing.
[**2192-4-14**] CT Head: No acute intracranial process.
[**2192-4-14**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Fluid collection in the epidural space from C2 to C4 level with compression of the spinal cord.
The fluid collection could represent an epidural abscess or hematoma.
Spinal cord edema at C2 level.
Prevertebral soft tissue swelling, which could be due to combination of abscess or hematoma or inflammatory changes.
[**2192-4-14**] Spine film: 1) Status post laminectomy, with marked prominence of soft tissues both anterior and posterior to the cervical spine, with small locules of air as described.
3) The cortical surfaces of the C4, C5, and C6 levels are not well demonstrated in part this likely relates to degenerative changes.
However, review of prior studies suggests that there has been prior instrumentation and intervertebral fusion devices at these levels and this may represent residua from that.
Possibility of superimposed osteolysis due to infection cannot be excluded.
[**2192-4-15**] Tissue: Intervertebral disc, C3-C4, excision: Fibrocartilage and bone with acute inflammation and fibrin, consistent with abscess formation.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
Aside from atelectasis in the right base the lungs are clear.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
[**2192-4-15**] C-spine MRI: Progression of abnormality since the cervical spine MR of [**2192-4-14**].
Markedly increased spinal cord edema.
Enlarged anterior epidural fluid collection.
Increased abnormal signal in the C7-T1 intervertebral disc, worrisome for discitis.
Extensive epidural and leptomeningeal enhancement compatible with epidural abscess as well as meningitis.
[**2192-4-16**] CXR: Small left pleural effusion and pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion suggest volume overload and/or cardiac decompensation, increased since [**4-15**].
No pneumothorax.
[**2192-4-16**] Left upper extremity ultrasound: No left upper extremity DVT.
[**2192-4-17**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**4-16**], the hemidiaphragm on the left is more sharply seen, suggesting some decrease in the left pleural effusion.
Again, there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
No acute intracranial process.
New opacification of the ethmoidal sinus and sphenoid sinuses and decreased opacification of the mastoid air cells.
Extensive post-surgical changes as described above with no findings to suggest hardware failure status post recent corpectomy with C3-C5 anterior fusion.
Air pocket with simple-appearing fluid collection noted adjacent to the right hyoid, also likely postoperative.
Poor visualization of remaining epidural phlegmon/fluid collection which is better depicted on recently performed [**2192-4-17**], C-spine MRI.
No definite findings of infection identified.
Equivocal small epidural hematoma noted at the L4-L5 interspace likely in conjunction with regions of ligamentum flavum hypertrophy at this level.
Mild inflammatory changes are noted around the L5 and L3 spinous processes.
This should be correlated with the site of recent lumbar puncture.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
There is no significant change compared to the prior study in bibasal opacities consistent at least partially with atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusion.
The patient is in mild pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
Left lower lobe aeration has markedly improved.
Right lower lobe atelectasis is persistent.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Almost complete resolution of left lower lobe atelectasis.
Persistent pre-existing right-sided basal atelectasis, otherwise, the lung parenchyma is clear, there is no evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
No pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.
[**2192-4-24**] CT Abd/Pelvis without contrast: No interposed loops of large bowel between the stomach and the anterior abdominal wall.
[**2192-4-28**] CXR: There is an unchanged left sided central venous catheter.
There is a right upper abdomen pigtail catheter.
Lungs are grossly clear without evidence for overt pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or focal consolidation.
There are no pneumothoraces identified.
There is an unremarkable bowel gas pattern with air and stool seen throughout colon.
No dilated loops of small bowel are seen.
There are no signs for free intra-abdominal air.
Interval development of bilateral basilar opacities which may indicate aspiration or atelectasis.
[**2192-5-1**] MRI C-spine: Persistent extensive inflammatory changes after repeated anterior and posterior decompression and fusion.
However, the intensity of enhancement, the size of epidural fluid collections, the spinal cord edema, and prevertebral fluid and enhancement have all improved dramatically since the examination of [**2192-4-17**].
Little change to region of old left basal ganglia hemorrhage.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, masses, or infarction.
Sinus disease.
Mild cerebral atrophy.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE ON SURGERY: Mr. [**Known lastname 13060**] is a 68 year old man with history of cervical spondylysis and disc degeneration who underwent C4-C7 discectomies and C4-C7 spinal stabilization on [**2192-2-13**].
His post-operative course was complicated by fever and leukocytosis on [**2-23**]; a urine culture grew E. coli, and an infected PIV site grew MSSA; he was started on Cipro and Vanco on [**2-23**] and then was transitioned to Levofloxicin for 7 day course on [**2-28**].
He initially did well after discharge, but for the past [**5-9**]  weeks he has been complaining of neck pain and restricted movement.
His symptoms have worsened over the past ~ 10 days, with difficulty swallowing, decreased PO intake, rigors and possibly fevers.
On [**4-13**] his symptoms worsened further, with [**10-13**] pain and inability to move his right side.
He was referred to the emergency room early in the morning on [**4-14**] where an MRI revealed an epidural abscess from C2-C4, with spinal cord compression.
He underwent anterior and posterior approach removal of hardware and evacuation of epidural abscess with a posterior laminectomy to decompress.
Post-operatively he developed right sided hemiparesis and went back for repeat operation on [**4-15**] after repeat imaging showed increase in size of the epidural abscess.
He was initially started on vancomycin, ceftazidime, and metronidazole (on [**2192-4-14**]) for broad empiric coverage.
A repeat MRI was performed [**4-17**] with continued expansion of the epidural abscess and leptomeningeal enhancement.
An LP was performed on [**4-17**] concerning for meningitis with high protein (590), low glucose (34), 33 WBC, but negative gram stain and culture.
He was found to be C. diff positive on [**4-19**], and PO vancomycin was initiated.
He was transferred out of the ICU to the surgical floor, seen by medicine for altered mental status, and transferred to the medicine service.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE, BY PROBLEM, WHILE ON MEDICINE SERVICE: Mr. [**Known lastname 13060**] is a 68yM with history of cervical spondylitis s/p C4-C7 discectomies and C4-C7 spinal stabilization on [**2192-2-13**] complicated by epidural abscess s/p evacuation and hardware removal on [**4-14**], growing MSSA, elevated WBC/protein in CSF concerning for meningitis, now extubated and transferred to the medical service for altered mental status/confusion.
#) Altered mental status.
All altering medications (benzodiazepenes, narcotics) were held, and his infection was treated as below.
His mental status was thought likely to be multifactorial from infection, medications, ICU/hospital stay, and chronic sleep deprivation.
His chemistries were initially notable for hypernatremia, which was corrected with free water repletion; at the time of discharge, they are within normal limits.
He is not uremic; his transaminases were mildly elevated (thought secondary to meropenem, which was discontinued on [**5-2**], RUQ ultrasound negative).
MRI head showed no structural abnormalities or evidence of septic infarct.
CT C-spine showed extensive inflammatory changes, but improved appearance overall.
<br> #) Elevated white blood cell count.
Unclear source, but resolved; known C. diff positive, but with benign abdominal exam.
Has been afebrile since [**4-30**].
Stable, with benign abdominal exam; abdominal x-ray showed no dilatation.
<br> #) Risk for aspiration.
Given posterior oropharyngeal swelling, has silent aspiration.
Appreciate speech & swallow recommendations.
Thought mildly elevated secondary to meropenem.
Held statin for now given elevated transaminases.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Epidural abscess, MSSA C. difficile infection Aspiration Delirium  Discharge Condition: Stable vital signs, neurologic exam as documented in the discharge summary  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with neurologic deficits and were found to have an epidural abscess, which was treated neurosurgically by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**].
In addition, because of the swelling around the site of the spinal infection, you have difficulty swallowing, for which a tube was inserted directly into your stomach.
As the swelling improvees, and as you continue your rehab, this tube will likely be able to be removed and you will be able to eat on your own.
If you develop any shortness of breath, high fever, worsening pain, worsening neurologic deficits, chest pain, or other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately.
