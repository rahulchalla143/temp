CLINICAL INDICATION: 78-year-old man with history of thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, rule out basilar infarct.
FINDINGS: HEAD CT: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shifting of the normally midline structures.
Vague areas of low attenuation are noted in the centrum semiovale, likely representing edema or areas of small vessel disease, previously demonstrated by MRI of the brain on [**2153-1-30**].
The orbits and mastoid air cells as well as the paranasal sinuses are grossly normal.
There is vascular enhancement along the internal carotid arteries with no evidence of critical stenosis throughout the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries.
The origin of the supra-aortic vessels appears normal with no evidence of critical stenosis including the cervical carotid bifurcations.
The left carotid bifurcation demonstrates mild irregular contour at the posterior wall of the left internal carotid artery, consistent with soft plaque material.
There is no evidence of dissection.
The bony structures demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine with anterior and posterior spondylosis, more severe at C3/C4, C4/C5 and C5/C6 levels.
There is no evidence of acute or subacute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Vague areas of low attenuation are identified in the subcortical white matter, likely representing areas of small vessel disease and subacute ischemic changes, previously noted on MRI of the head dated [**2153-1-30**].
There is no evidence of flow stenotic lesions in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
The neck vessels demonstrate mild irregular contour in the posterior wall of the left internal carotid artery at the cervical bifurcation, likely consistent with soft plaques, however, there is no evidence of significant stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old male with abdominal pain and CTA demonstrating thoracic aortic aneurysm descending to level of celiac artery with contained rupture into lateral wall at level of diaphragm.
On [**2153-1-27**] he was taken to the OR for an emergent repair of ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with a 30-mm Dacron tube graft from just after the left subclavian artery takeoff all the way down to the mid visceral bearing segment of the abdominal aorta using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and a separate side branch to revascularize the celiac artery.
In summary: he  had a very complicated postoperative course due to cerebral and spinal infarcts with scans showing multiple areas of slow diffusion, predominantly in Left parietal and occipital lobe concerning for sub-acute infarcts, paraplegia, S. marascens bacteremia with presumed graft infection, VAP and  post-op wound infection at the back of the thoracotomy site with coag negative staph.
[**Name8 (MD) **] RN, Mr.[**Known lastname **] never followed commands for her and noted a change with the lack of gross motor movement of his extremities.
He was noted not to be moving the lower extremities, and had asymmetry in the exam of the arms, along with mental status changes after transient episode of hypotension/ atrial arrhythmia and shocks necessitated.
MRI of brain showed no significant ischemic changes to explain such a poor mentation.
Neurology was consulted and felt imaging findings are consistent with  multiple brain infarcts (left > right) and cord infarction; likely attributed to perioperative hypotension and aortic manipulations.
The patient remains with afluent aphasia and paraplegic.
Mr.[**Known lastname 11700**] postoperative course continued to get more complicated when he became bacteremic.
Cultures revealed E Coli UTI, serratia PNA and S. marascens bacteremia.
POD 15 from initial TA AAA repair now with ischemic eschar around the inferior portion of the wound.
Due to the perigraft and surrounding intrathoracic inflammatory changes and fluid evident, all teams agreed that debridement was required.
On [**2-14**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] debridement of open wound left scapular region with debridement of muscle, subcutaneous tissue, and skin; latissimus flap reconstruction.
The patient had a flexiseal in place for several days in the setting of his critical illness.
Hematochezia became evident.
The patient was scoped by GI who visualized active rectal bleeding and was concerned for perforation on anoscopy likely secondary to flexi-seal s/p packing, seemingly with hemostasis.Hematocrits remain stable.
ID signed off after recommending: antibiotics for wound infection: would continue Vanco/Flagyl for 2 weeks from day of debridement ([**Date range (1) 11701**]),for Serratia AAA graft infection: Plan to continue cipro IV for 4 weeks for presumed serratia endovascular infection ([**Date range (1) 11702**]).
He weaned to trach collar and PMV during the day hours and is rested overnight on CPAP.
After a complicated course from his initial emergent repair of ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, Mr.[**Known lastname **] has made slow progress.
