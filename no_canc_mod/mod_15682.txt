HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 68-year-old gentleman who has had lower gastrointestinal bleed now which was unrelenting and initially admitted to the Medicine service.
He subsequently underwent an emergent partial colectomy for presumed left colon bleed and required damage control procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42928**] with an abbreviated laparotomy stapling off the right colon and moving the left colon due to ongoing coagulopathy and intraoperative near cardiac arrest.
Two days postoperatively, he developed worsening signs of sepsis and taken back to the operating room for exploration, where he was found to have an ischemic right colon and this was removed and ileostomy was performed.
His postoperative Intensive Care Unit course was significant for development of a fungal infection resistant to [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] requiring amphotericin treatment and also ventilator-associated pneumonia.
