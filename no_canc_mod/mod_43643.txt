Admission Date:  [**2197-8-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-9-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2173-1-19**]     Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 24-year-old male with a past medical history of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea who presented with complaints of increased swelling and a neck mass times one and half weeks.
Approximately one and a half weeks prior to admission the patient noticed increased pain and swelling in the lateral aspect of his neck on the left side.
However, the pain and swelling did not resolve.
The patient then began to experience fevers and difficulty swallowing and difficulty turning his head.
The patient has not had difficulty breathing.
[**Name (NI) **] presents for evaluation of his expanding neck mass.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was remarkable for diabetes mellitus in multiple first-degree relatives.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Neck examination revealed a warm mass posterior to the left ear about 20 cm X 8 cm long.
Pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds throughout.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended, with no rebounding, guarding or hepatosplenomegaly, and there were bowel sounds times four.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   CT scan of the neck revealed a splenius capitus myositis and cellulitis overlying with fluid tracking between plains.
There was no evidence of abscess at that time.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.
Serial neck CT examinations revealed increase in edema, fat stranding, and possible abscess formation.
On [**2197-8-29**], the patient was taken to the operating room for drainage of a left posterior neck abscess, and 30 cc to 40 cc of pus was expressed and drained.
He was followed by the Medicine consultation team for ongoing diabetes management.
Clinically, the patient's neck mass began to increase in size again.
That day the patient suffered an episode of hypotension to a systolic blood pressure in the 90s, and he was tachycardic.
He responded well to this treatment; however, over the course of that evening the patient developed atrial flutter.
The wound was explored at bedside.
There was no new drainage, but there were increased adhesions.
The patient was seen in consultation by the Cardiology Service to evaluate for his atrial flutter and to receive a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out endocarditis.
Transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis.
Hypotension continued to be treated with large volume intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure.
Over the evening of [**2197-9-2**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation to the 130s.
A repeat CT scan was suspicious for persistent pus in the neck.
On [**2197-9-3**], the possibility of meningitis was entertained, and a lumbar puncture was attempted to rule out meningitis.
The patient's fevers continued, and the patient developed an increasing oxygen requirement.
A repeat CT scan revealed a possible persistent neck abscess and possible lower lung collapse, possibly consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The patient continued to have very high fevers with very elevated creatine kinase levels.
The diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia was entertained.
The patient's urine output declined, and the possibility of acute tubular necrosis secondary to rhabdomyolysis or sepsis was entertained.
For the patient's persistent very high fevers dantrolene was given for possible malignant hyperthermia.
The patient continued to have a worsening metabolic and respiratory acidosis over the day of [**9-6**].
Additionally, the patient's platelets were declining, and this was felt to be consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation.
During the day of [**9-6**], the patient continued to have hemodynamic instability.
On the morning of [**9-6**], the patient suffered an episode of hypotension and asystolic arrest.
During that day, further arrests times two occurred with successful revival but continued hypotension, septic physiology, and bradycardia.
At approximately 6:15 p.m. on [**2197-9-6**], the patient became bradycardic and hypotensive.
No intervention was undertaken.
The patient became asystolic.
Diabetes mellitus.
