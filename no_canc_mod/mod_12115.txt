Admission Date:  [**2188-4-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2188-4-21**]   Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman status post fall at a nursing home from her bed to the floor transferred from outside facility with a question of a C3 fracture and questionable basilar skull fracture.
The patient has a baseline dementia and was found down next to her bed after being seen approximately five minutes prior complaining of neck pain.
The patient was initially seen at the [**Last Name (un) 4068**] Emergency Department and noted to have the above mentioned findings on CT and was transferred for further evaluation by the trauma team.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Degenerative joint disease.
Cerebrovascular disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient was alert and in no acute distress.
Chest without deformities or tenderness.
Back without deformities or tenderness.
Extremities left shoulder contusion with small skin tear.
CT of head with contrast revealed fluid within the sphenoid sinus potentially concerning for occult skull base fracture without obvious fractures seen and a small asymmetric fossa of hyperdensity in the left basal ganglia potentially consistent with small focus of hemorrhage versus calcification.
CT of the C spine with reconstruction without evidence of fracture.
CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was without evidence of acute injury.
TLS film was without evidence of fracture.
Repeat head CT on the [**2-20**] indicated no change in the fluid seen in the sphenoid sinus or the potential with basal ganglia hemorrhage, however, a small to medium size subacute subdural hemorrhage was seen around the left frontal and temporal regions.
Given this and the stability of findings on head CT, there was nor further need for intervention or imaging.
Neck injury:  The patient was initially transferred for the concern of a potential fracture of C3 spinous process on initial imaging at [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital.
The patient initially complained of neck discomfort during her hospital stay.
The patient was unable to cooperate with flexion and extension plain films to further evaluate the stability of her cervical spine.
After discussion with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**] regarding the need for magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine to further evaluate potential injuries it was determined that given the nature of potential injuries and the limited interventions possible the patient was to be discharged to outpatient follow up with a soft collar.
Urinary tract infection:  Urinalysis showed greater then 50 white blood cells per high powered field with many bacteria with urine cultures growing out E-coli.
The patient received a three day course of Levofloxacin and remained afebrile throughout hospitalization.
Anemia:  The patient has a history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding and has a baseline hematocrit of approximately 26.
However, repeat laboratory draws revealed a CBC with a hematocrit of 26, which is at the patient's baseline.
Urinary tract infection.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Degenerative joint disease.
Cerebrovascular disease.
