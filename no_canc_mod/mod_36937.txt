According to her husband the patient had dialysis the day prior to admission without any problems.
Around 2pm the patient began to become increasingly agitated and confused, stating "I want to go home" even though she was at home.
The husband gave her some labetalol and tylenol without improvement.
Multiple efforts were made at redirecting her but without success and she was brought to the ED for further evaluation.
They were unable to obtain a head CT due to agitation so the patient was intubated and sedated with propofol and a head CT was performed; the preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] was negative for bleed.
Chest XR with mild pulmonary edema, EKG with LVH, NSR at 73, no evidence of ACS.
Pertinent recent medical history course as per [**Location (un) **]: From [**Date range (1) 77609**], she was admitted to the surgical service for pain  over transplant site.
Initially given antibiotics (Vanc/Cipro) for line infection and UTI, renal US showed signs of graft rejection, was hypertensive (up to SBP 220s) treated with labetalol and valsartan.
She was asymptomatic from the elevated BPs and underwent transplant nephrectomy on [**7-13**] without complications.
From [**Date range (1) 106065**], she was admitted for Hypertensive urgency (BP 222/107) with no chest pain, EKG unchanged, cardiac enzymes negative, and clear CXR.
Additional incidental finding of lymphocytosis was noted at the time.
From [**Date range (1) 106066**], she was initially admitted for febrile to 103 with associated diarrhea and cough.
Initially covered with pip/tazo and linezolid for a possible HAP, later held as not evidence of infection.
She had presistent Diarrhea with C. Diff negative, had 500 cc BRBPR with continued passing of clots.
(NOTE: [**5-7**] EGD and colonscopy showed internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis of the entire colon.)
She had active LGIB w/ diverticular disease of entire colon.
she had right colectomy ([**8-23**]) for lower GI bleed, had side-to-side functional end-to-end ileal colostomy.
She had a relative uneventful postoperative course except for some confusion probably related to elevated serum calcium (addressed by nephrology) and incisional cellulitis (discharged on Keflex).
[**9-1**] - [**9-7**], for altered MS s/p HD, relatively lethargic and confused.
[**Date range (1) 106072**] the patient was admitted with a similar picture of confusion in the setting of hypertension.
It was determined that her confusion was likely due to a combination of poor nutrition (improved with Thiamine), hypertension, hypoglycemia, and possibly hypothryoidism.

EEG [**2101-11-29**] IMPRESSION: This is a severely abnormal extended routine EEG which shows a resolving electrographic status epilepticus before and after the administration of I.V.
The excessive beta activity described in the second portion of the study is likely secondary to the benzodiazepine.
Tiny foci of decreased diffusion in the left hemisphere, involving the left insular cortex, left temporal lobe and left temporal/parietal lobe, concerning for tiny foci of acute infarct with the distrubtion concerning forembolic disease.
Otherwise, stable appearance of the brain, with FLAIR hyperintensities in a nonspecific distribution, but likely representing the sequela of chronic microangiopathy given the patient's age.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old woman with End-Stage Renal Disease, hypertension, seizure disorder, who presented with altered mental status and was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy in the context of HTN.
Delirium Patient presented with altered mental status in the context of HTN, which was similar to multiple prior presentations.
Head CT was negative for acute intracranial event.
After the floor, she was again noted to have worsening altered mental status with decreased responsiveness.
Neurology was consulted, and she was immediately given 4mg of intravenous ativan, after which EEG showed significantly decreased epileptiform activity.
Though she was oriented, she was slow in speech and slow to respond verbally to questions and had an almost child-like affect with responses; her mental status continued to improve further over the next couple of days.
There was concern that a meningitis may have triggered the nonconvulsive status epilepticus, particularly because the patient had been complaining of a headache at home prior to presentation to the ED.
Per Neurology recommendations, she was started empirically on acyclovir for possible HSV meningitis in addition to ceftriaxone and ampicillin for possible bacterial meningitis; of note, the patient has a listed allergy to vancomycin.
MRI showed tiny foci of decreased diffusion in the left hemisphere, which could signify acute infarct, but the Neurology team believed the effect on imaging was secondary to the patient having spent over 24 hours in status epilepticus and not necessarily representing an infarct.
The patient did have multiple episodes of agitation during hospitalization.
Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient was intubated on presentation due to altered mental status and concern for inability to protect airway.
CXR was suggestive of PNA, and she had spiked a fever to 101.1F, so she was started on Vanc/Cefepime/Acyclovir/Ampicillin to cover HAP and meningitis.
After her sputum culture grew Moraxella Catarrhalis and pan-sensitive Staph Aureus, the patient was switched to Levofloxacin.
The patient was afebrile for the remainder of her hospitalization with no shortness of breath or cough.
After improvement of her mental status, her diet was not restricted for the remainder of this hospitalization in order to ensure that she received enough nutrition; this diet was approved by her primary nephologist in the setting of stable electrolytes.
Hypothyroidism: TSH was elevated at 9.0 but was trending down from much higher level of 31 at previous check, so levothyroxine dose was left unchanged at 50mcg daily.
The patient was noted to have sloughing skin around her anus, which could be worsened if diarrhea becomes worse or incontinent.
Hyperparathyroidism/Hypercalcemia: Patient has history of primary hyperparathyroidism s/p surgical resection of parathyroid glands.
She additionally has secondary hyperparathyroidism, secondary to her renal failure.
On the day of discharge, she appeared to have an increased calcium, which was likely secondary to hemoconcentration.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to the hospital because you had very high blood pressure and had become confused at home.
After you were transferred to the general medical floor, you were found to have a nonconvulsive seizure and were started on new seizure medications.
A spinal tap was done twice, and the results showed that you did not have a bacterial infection in your spinal fluid, but you may have had a viral infection in your spinal fluid.
You were also having diarrhea which became worse from a Clostridium Difficile infection in your colon, which improved before you were discharged.
The following changes have been made to your medications: - Please STOP the Trileptal for your seizure disorder - Please START Levetiracetam (Keppra) for your seizure disorder:   - You should take 1000mg (2 tablets of 500mg each) each night before bed   - You should take an additional 250mg (0.5 tablet) after dialysis on Dialysis days (Tues, Thurs, Saturday) - You may START using Lidoderm patches to your back for pain - Please START taking Metronidazole (Flagyl) 500mg every 12 hours for 3.5 more days (7 more doses) for the C. difficile infection that was making your diarrhea worse  Please be sure to keep all of your followup appointments and continue your Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday dialysis schedule.
Please seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms concerning to you.
