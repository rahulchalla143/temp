He then stated he felt dizzy and unwell, prompting the salesperson to fetch a chair.
His significant other, a psychologist, became concerned he was suffering an acute vascular event.
An NIHSS score of 15 (loc questions 2, right facial palsy 2, right hemiplegia 8, severe aphasia 2, dysarthria 1) was given.
A repeat NIHSS survey following the imaging revealed improvement with a score of 11 (loc questions 2, right facial palsy 2, right arm  plegia 4, severe aphasia - anomia, fluent with neologisms, paraphasic errors, inappropriate to context 2, dysarthria 1; he could move the right lower extremity and sustain versus gravity without problem).
A stat non-contrast CT of the head showed no clear evidence of hemorrhage.

Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Focal hypodensity in the left thalamic region extending to the left internal capsule, compatible with the previously documented left thalamic/basal ganglia infarct.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
[**7-12**] MRI brain (DWI): Acute infarct involving the left posterior limb of the left internal capsule and adjacent thalamus as well as adjacent putamen.

Patient made dramatic improvement after TPA, with only limb-kinetic apraxia on following day, along with some difficulty with Luria task and confusion.
Confusion appeared to be related more to hypotension that stroke.
Bradycardia Unclear etiology, but patient appears to have slow sinus rate.
The patient also had dilated atria and produces atrial ectopy with P-waves of aberant morphology.
He was started on oxybutynin, but this was stopped given some confusion and concern for exacerbation of hypotension.
************* Floor course:  MRI revealed a left thalamic and posterior capsular (plus pallidal) infarct, which is consistent with his combined symptoms of numbness and weakness in the arm, leg, and face as well as aphasia (thalamic aphasia).
Subsequent NCHCT did not reveal any hemorrhagic conversion; the area of restricted diffusion on MRI appears hypodense now on CT. On arrival to the floor [**2193-7-17**], his hemiparesis and apraxia had resolved and his primary findings on neurological exam were cognitive.
He still suffers from substantial lexical impairments, with frequent word replacements and word-finding difficulties.
He also exhibits a substantial short-term memory deficit.
Given the acute onset, small infarct size, and fairly rapid recovery, an embolic/thromboembolic process in the anterior (less likely a branch of the posterior) choroidal artery is most likely.
[**Name2 (NI) **] revealed a PFO, and no DVTs were identified on LED imaging.
Urinary retention symptoms seem to have abated.
He is urinating more frequently per his recollection, but without pain or apparent retention.
His sinus bradycardia largely resolved, in the setting of a fall in his cyclosporine blood concentration to a subtherapeutic level (153 on [**7-14**] --> 59 on [**7-17**], on a stable dose).
It is unclear what caused the atrial ectopy / sinus bradycardia.
Cardiology did not think this heart rhythm or your symptoms require a pacemaker at this time, but this should be taken up by his PCP and followed with an ECG and possibly Holter monitoring as an outpatient.
As his bradycardia improved 8/25-26/10, he was able to sit/stand/walk without recurrence of his symptoms.
He still became confused at night, in the setting of HR 40s-50s (daytime 50s-60s).
He denies any h/o diabetes mellitus.
We provided him with a new patient clinic visit at the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Stroke (involving the Left thalamus, posterior-capsule and globus pallidus)  Secondary Diagnosis - Bradycardia (symptomatic) patient gets confused - you were seen by cardiology in house, who did not feel that you needed any intervention at this point.
- Right forearm cellulitis in an intravenous access site (this was discussed with infection diseases, you need to continue on Bactrim for 10 days, and if this does not work you need to try doxycycline, and if this does not work, you may need intravenous vancomycin - you will need this followed up by your PCP.
Difficulty with Luria sequencing.
No cranial nerve signs or symptoms (Left eye prosthesis).
HDS, with only mild bradycardia to 50s, no orthostatic symptoms, and no recurrence of confusion/aphasia.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with stroke symptoms: Right arm and leg and facial numbness/weakness, aphasia (difficulty with normal/fluent speech), and mild confusion.
This treatment improved your symptoms, and within a day after admission, you had no more right-sided numbness and no weakness detectable on Neurologic examination and your speech pattern normalized.
However, you have continued to experience difficulties with word-finding and with memory, which are probably related to damage from the initial stroke you suffered.
The cause of your stroke is unknown.
You were started on a medication called Plavix, which will reduce your future risk for stroke -- you need to fill the prescription for Plavix and begin taking it immediately, once every day, to reduce your risk for future strokes.
A patent foramen ovale (PFO) was identified in your heart, but no venous clots were found in your legs.
Also, you had initial difficulties with urinary retention, which are likely related to a condition called BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia).
You also had a very low heart rate (bradycardia to the 30-40bpm range), which caused you difficulty maintaining your blood pressure when sitting or standing up.
The cause of your sinus bradycardia was not determined with certainty and it resolved; possibilities include cyclosporine (Sandimmune) effects and side-effects of the stroke.
You were evaluated by our Cardiology consult service, which did not identify a definitive cause, and recommended additional tests, which were all within normal limits.
They do not think this heart rhythm or your symptoms require a pacemaker.
If you find that your short term memory is an issue after your stroke, please request Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] to refer you for neurocognitive testing.
