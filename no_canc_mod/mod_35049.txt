CXR showed no evidence of PNA, and Abdominal U/S showed cirrhosis with a patent portal vein and normal kidneys.
He also complained of new rash and pain in L antecubital region; ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT or fluid collection.
When transferred to the medical floor, he reported chronic back pain but denied dizziness and headache.
He confirms that this was an accidental overdose and denies suicidal ideation.

Brief Hospital Course: 51 y/o man with Hep C/EtOH cirrhosis, IVDA with history of epidural abscess, and chronic back pain, who presented after suspected calcium channel blocker overdose with bradycardia, hypotension and acute renal failure, transferred from the MICU with improved blood pressure and resolving [**Last Name (un) **].
Calcium channel blocker overdose: In the MICU the patient was treated for presumptive amlodipine overdose since OSH pharmacist identified the pills as such.
As previously pointed out, it would be odd for amlodipine to cause bradycardia since it is more selective for L-type calcium channels in the vasculature (as opposed to the nondihydropyridines, verapamil and diltiazem, which can cause bradycardia by acting on cardiac Ca channels).
Bradycardia might be expected with amlodipine in high doses, however.
In the MICU the patient was treated with levophed for hypotension, and IVF to keep CVP 8-10.
He was monitored on telemetry and did not show any signs of PR prolongation or ST changes.
Renal evaluated patient and felt that he was pre-renal in setting of hypotension.
He likely has some mild impaired synthetic function given INR 1.3 and platelets 67.
Metabolic acidosis: Initially in the MICU he presented with AG 23 and appropriate respiratory compenstation, likely secondary to lactic acidosis.
Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: During his MICU stay the patient's hct dropped from 38 -> 29 and platelets dropped from 155 -> 72 on day two of admission.
No signs of bleeding.
Anemia likely dilutional effect of receiving 6L fluids in the MICU, coupled with dehydration on admission.
Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to chronic liver disease with portal hypertension.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Amlodipine toxicity, acute renal failure Secondary diagnoses: Cirrhosis, Hepatitis C, chronic back pain, history of IVDU   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with low blood pressure and slow heart rate after accidentally taking a large dose of amlodipine, a blood pressure medication.
