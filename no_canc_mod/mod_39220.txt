No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to apical anteroseptal akinesis/hypokinesis and anterior and anterolateral wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened with trace aortic regurgitation.
There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve gradient low due to reduced stroke volume).
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate mitral annular calcification with a mild left ventricular inflow gradient.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: Moderate regional systolic LV dysfunction c/w CAD Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild to moderate aortic stenosis.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension  Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2105-9-21**], a slightly higher aortic valve gradient is now measured (likely related to slightly better technical quality of Doppler spectral measurement in the current study).
Left ventricular systolic function and mitral valve appear similar.
Tricuspid systolic gradient is now slightly lower.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2105-10-3**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Sensitive to Gent; Resistant to levo/flagyl   Brief Hospital Course: This is an 84 y/o F w/ h/o HOCM, CRI, CAD s/p CABG in '[**81**] (SVG to LAD) and PTCA x 6 who presented to OSH with accelerating chest pain.
On cardiac cath [**9-18**] she was found to have an ulcerated 80% lesion in the proximal SV to LAD graft.
Limited resting hemodynamics showed elevated central aortic pressures (200/65mmHg).
LV gram was not performed due to renal insufficiency.
In the holding area post-cath she became hypoxic requiring non-rebreather with O2 sats still in the low 90's.
She was felt to be fluid overloaded and a CXR was consistent with florid CHF.
Her cardiac enzymes were also elevated overnight post-cath and this was felt to be possibly related to showering of microemboli from her SVG into her microvasculature.
She subsequently had resolution of her CK's and chest pain resolved.
However, on return to the floor she had persistent chest pains despite nitro drip, prompting re-look catheritization.
Re-look cath on [**9-23**] showed the LCX to have serial 70% lesions at the mid-segment.
The SVG-->LAD was patent (mild residual stenosis at the proximal stent).
On return to the floor she was found to be mildly SOB, without chest pressure or palpitations.
JVP was up at 10cm's and she had crackles on exam to apices with decreased air movement at the bases.
Set-up was made for diialysis on [**9-28**] with permcath placement.
On her second day of dialysis, treatment was terminated early secondary to chest pain and SOB.
She had an increased O2 requirement to 4L O2, with increasing SOB overnight.
At this time, she was found to have elevated JVP, tachypnea and rales up to the apex.
EKG was performed and showed no evidence of acute MI (in the setting of baseline LBBB).
She was given 200mg IV lasix and 250mg IV diuril with minimal response.
ABG demonstrated 7.23/65/66 with bicarb of 21, c/w an acute respiratory acidosis.
Of note, she was found to have evidence as well of a new LLL pneumonia by CXR ,with a WBC of 15.6, and was started on Levaquin/Flagyl.
Hemodialysis after transfer to CCU removed 2.0kg, but was c/b hypotensive episodes w/ SBP decreased to the 70's.
Of note, she did have shoulder/chest pain  + throat itchiness on HD #4.
Chest pain was noted to be resolved by the end of treatment.
She has remained chest pain free for >3 days.
tenatative nitrates given HOCM - has tolerted ntg gtt to date; Remains chest pain free s/p stenting of SVG to LAD and LCX.
Developed MRSE/enterocccus UTI and completed 7 day course of Vancomycin.
She was subsequently started on Levo/Flagyl for infiltrate on CXR and elevated WBC.
However, given absence of infiltrate on subsequent CXR, Levo/Flagyl was D/C'd.
Early treatments c/b hypotensive episodes requiring fluid support.
5)Hypercalcemia: SPEP/UPEP negative.
8)Access: L PICC in place, L dialysis cath 9)RLQ abdominal pain: No guarding or rebound.
Known guaiac positive stools.
Continue percocet prn for pain control.
11)prophylaxis-PPI,Heparin SQ 12) anemia: likely [**1-26**] chronic dx, + GI bleed.
If becomes SOB and appears volume overloaded, she may need emergent HD.
Of note, she has previously has had poor response to medical diuresis: 200mg IV lasix and 250mg IV diuril were used prior to CCU stay w/ poor effect.
Trazodone HCl 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Chronic renal failure 3.
Urinary tract infection 4.
chest pain free.
Discharge Instructions: Please report fever,chills, chest pain or shortness of breath to your pcp.
Hemodialysis every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday  3.
