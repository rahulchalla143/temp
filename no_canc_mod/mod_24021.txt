FINDINGS: There is no significant interval change in the tracheostomy tube or left subclavian line.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There is ill definition of the left hemidiaphragm in the retrocardiac regions suggesting volume loss/infiltrate.
There is vascular redistribution and pulmonary vasculature ill definition suggesting fluid overload/CHF.
Compared to the film from the prior day, there is no significant interval change.
C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA [**1-6**] VIEWS PORT  [**2146-8-21**] 8:45 PM  C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA [**1-6**] VIEWS P  Reason: eval C spine alignment, soft tissue swelling  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 29 year old man with s/p trauma with repaired C5 burst fx - readmitted for sepsis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval C spine alignment, soft tissue swelling HISTORY: Trauma with repaired C5 burst fracture readmitted for sepsis, assess alignment and soft tissue swelling.
There is an anterior plate and screw transfixing the C4 through C5 levels, with intervening fusion plug.
No hardware loosening or definite lucency about the hardware is identified.
The [**2146-7-30**] CT scan showed a strut graft in this location, though this is not well demonstrated radiographically (likely due to technique and overlying structures).
No listhesis is detected through the level of C7.
On the AP view, some air projects to the right of the cervical spine, but this may also lie within the piriformis recess.
No listhesis or loosening detected.
Subtle lucency about the hardware would be difficult to exclude here.
Marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling, more than on the CT scan of [**2146-7-30**].
Differential diagnosis includes infection and/or hemorrhage.
The small locule of air to the right of the cervical spine most likely represents air within piriform recess; subcutaneous emphysema is considered less likely.
MODERATE GROWTH.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Rule out hematoma or abscess.
There is accumulation of fluid in the prevertebral soft tissues anterior to the vertebral body of C3 as well as C2.
Examination of the lung apices demonstrated bilateral large pleural effusions and septal thickening which is suggestive of CHF/fluid overload.
Fluid collection the prevertebral space anterior to the C2 and C3 is new when compared to CT of the c-spine from [**2146-7-30**].
Nevertheless, early infection in the fluid cannot be excluded.
Findings consistent with CHF/fluid overload.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 29 year old man quadrapelegic with new ARF and new spike of fever REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: consolidation?
INDICATION: Quadriplegic with new acute renal failure, fever.
Left internal jugular central venous line has been removed, and right-sided PICC line has tip in good position in the distal SVC.
There is some improvement to bilateral small pleural effusions and pulmonary edema, with persistent left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity.
No pneumothorax.
Improved appearance of pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions.
Persistent left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity, probably a collapse but underlying infection cannot entirely be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted to the Trauma Service with acute renal failure and sepsis.
His HCO3 was corrected; PICC line discontinued; tip was cultured which revealed no growth.
Sputum culture obtained; positive for Enterobacter.
Recommendations also made by ID for imaging of patient's spine to rule out paraspinous abscess.
Patient with fever spike 103 on HD#9; he was pan cultured; his urine and stool cultures were negative for growth; blood cultures pending at time of this dictation; chest radiograph revealed persistent left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity.
Plastic Surgery was consulted for his sacral decubitus, felt wound was healing quite nicely and to continue with current treatment.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute renal failure Sepsis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: *Continue with your antibiotic course as recommended (see D/C summary) *Follow up in Trauma and Plastic Surgery Clinics in one month.
