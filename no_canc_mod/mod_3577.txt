Admission Date:  [**2166-12-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-12-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-1-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: E-Mycin / Motrin / Oxycodone / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory Failure   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: This is a 43 year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who had an diagnostic paracentesis on [**2166-12-2**] who presented with cultures growing gram negative anaerobes from ascitic fluid and was admitted for treatment of SBP.
She developed some respiratory distress on [**12-12**], but sats remained stable.
Patient was taken to CTA to r/o PE given slightly alkalemic ABG.
After patient returned to the floor, she began to have respiratory distress, requiring intubation.
CT scan shows diffuse bilateral patchy opacities in all lobes, BP stable and afebrile.
EtOH cirrhosis with variceal bleed s/p banding [**8-29**], ascites  #.
Gastric ulcer in setting of motrin use #.
Hypothyroidism #.
Gestational DM #.
Her son (5) was diagnosed with DM in [**Month (only) 547**] [**2165**] which was a major stressor.
Mother - COPD, emphysema, depression, cervical cancer, mental health isssues, has not seen patient in 20 years.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 101 BP: 143/81 HR:94 RR:18 O2Sat:95% on A/C 400x26 Peep 10 FiO2 1.0 Gen: Intubated and sedated Eyes: PERRL, EOMi Neck: Obese Cor: RR, nl S1S2 Chest: Diffuse rales, poor air movement Abd: Markedly distended with guarding, no rebound, +BS, no HSM, no masses Ext: No C/C/E, no palpable cords Neurol: Prior to intubation: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
Skin: Dressing from paracentesis attempt, and marking from ulrasound.
No ecchymoses.
Imaging: [**12-12**]: CTA Chest: Diffuse ground glass opacities bilaterally, per radiology no pulmonary embolus.
The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.A very small secundum type atrial septal defect cannot be fully excluded (suggested on color Doppler, but could not be confirmed).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Diffusely increased liver echogenicity is compatible with known history of cirrhosis.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Ascites, with no significant change since the previous study.
Field of view: 25  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 43 year old woman with EtOH Cirrhosis, acute mental status changes.
INDICATION: 43-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with acute mental status changes.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or masses.
The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
REFERRING DOCTOR:	DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]   FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent and persistent bursts of mixed frequency theta and delta slowing in the left temporal region.
BACKGROUND: Included a reasonably well-formed 9 Hz alpha frequency in posterior areas bilaterally during wakefulness.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to drowsiness and early stage II of sleep with no additional findings.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and sleeping states due to the frequent bursts of mixed frequency left temporal slowing.
This suggests a focal subcortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere, but the tracing cannot specify the etiology.
The background rhythm remained normal elsewhere and at other times, and there were no epileptiform features.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU Course: Assessment: 43 year-old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with possible SBP, developed hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS from question of aspiration, now s/p extubation but with poor mental status.
# Mental status/Hypernatremia: Most likely from combination of hypernatremia, sedation from haldol.
Hepatic encephalopathy also possible, but has been stooling well with lactulose.
CTA significant for bilateral patchy opacities in all lung fields.
DDx includes aspiration event (appears most likely), TRALI (although very rare reports secondary to albumin), pulmonary edema, either cardiogenic or ARDS from sepsis (meets criteria).
A sputum Cx from [**12-17**] revealed no growth.
She was extubated on [**12-20**] without complications.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis/fevers: Positive cultures and peripheral leukocytosis on admission.
Tap showed milky fluid and patient experienced marked tenderness after the tap, concerning for infectious process.
Repeat tap negative for bacteria x2.
Patient then had elevated fever curve and lower blood pressures [**12-16**].
She underwent paracentesis [**12-16**] to relieve her increased abdominal pressure.
Antibiotics were d/c'ed again on [**12-18**] because of the thought that her tachycardia and hypotension was due to her abdominal pressure, relieved after the paracentesis.
Her fevers, leukocytosis, and hypotension returned and antibiotics were restarted [**12-19**].
# Cirrhosis - [**1-24**] continued alcohol abuse.
# Depression -  her  citalopram was continued.
# Hypothyroidism -Her  levothyroxine  was continued.
43yoF alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with possible SBP, s/p hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS, septic shock, with recovered mental status and hepatorenal syndrome.
# Mental status - Patient continued with paranoid delusions on transfer to the floor.
# Oliguria-Patient developed oliguria soon after transfer to the floor.
Oliguria was unresponsive to fluid challenge and her creatinine peaked at 1.8.
She was diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome and administered daily albumin, octreotide, and midodrine.
# Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis - The patient completed her 10 day course of vancomycin and meropenem.
The patient was discharged home with instructions to take Bactrim for SBP prophylaxis.
Bactrim was chosen instead of cipro because the patient developed a prolonged QT after haldol administration.
# Cirrhosis - [**1-24**] continued alcohol abuse.
# Anemia - Guaiac positive with Hct.
Patient had no clinical signs of bloody emesis, BRBPR, or melena.
# Depression - Her celexa was restarted before discharge.
# Hypothyroidism - her levothyroxine was continued  Medications on Admission: 1.
