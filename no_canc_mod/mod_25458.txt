He had multiple known injuries including right retroperitoneal hematoma, SAH, right rib fractures, later found to have right malleolal fracture and T-spine compression fracature.
PSH: none   Social History: Recently lost his job History of ETOH abuse Tobacco current  Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, slight distress when eyes open.
HEENT: small 1cm lac above left eye / right ear with abrasion vs lac on pinna/ blood on left supra auricular area but no obvious laceration noted.
No raccoons or battles sign.
Right TM without hemotympanum / left unable to visualize.
No herniation or significant mass effect.
Large right retroperitoneal bleed with no definite evidence of active contrast extravasation.
A focally distended loop of small bowel with no wall thickening in the left lower quadrant is nonspecific but can represent early ischemic bowel.
Hematoma surrounding the second and third portion of the duodenum with an apparent defect in the outer aspect of third portion of the duodenum.
While this can represent mass effect from the adjacent hematoma bowel injury can not be excluded.
Perfusion defect within the right kidney compatible with infarction, can be secondary to a thrombosed vessel.
Comminuted and displaced subtrochanteric left femur fracture with a fracture of the greater trochanter.
Bilateral rib fractures, third through sixth right and third through seventh left anterior ribs and 10th through 12th posterior ribs.
[**2128-10-22**] Left hip :  There is a comminuted intratrochanteric fracture with varus angulation and 60% shaft with medial displacement of the distal fragment.
Mild degenerative changes of the left hip are suggested.
Lateral view is difficult to accurately interpret, but confirms the presence of an intratrochanteric fracture.
The lateral view suggests some anterior offset of the distal fragment, but minimal angulation.
The femoral acetabular relationship is difficult to confirm on the lateral view, but this is best assessed on a CT scan from [**2128-10-22**] at 21:33 p.m., which showed anatomic femoroacetabular alignment.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.
[**2128-10-24**] Right ankle : Fracturs of the medial malleolus and --likely --lateral talus.
He received phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.
He showed transient signs of agitation c/w alcohol withdrawal and these were controlled with diazepam per CIWA scale.
MSK : He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2128-10-24**] for ORIF of his left subtrochanteric fracture.
His pain was well controlled.
He had some ecchymosis noted around his right ankle and subsequent Xrays revealed a right medial malleolus fracture which would simply be treated with an air cast boot.
He had BAL on [**10-25**] which showed 1+ PMNs and no orgs.
The failure to extubate was attributed to possible episode of aspiration prior to intubation.
GI/FEN: Patient was NPO and had serial abdominal exams due to his retroperitoneal hematoma.
There was no evidence of active bleeding and his abdomen was soft.
Once extubated, he passed speech and swallow evaluation and tolerated regular diet thereafter.
Heme: Patient sustained a R retroperitoneal hematoma which was monitored by serial HCT.
ID: Patient received one dose of vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed aspiration pneumonia which was then discounted in favor of alcohol withdrawal.
He had no deficits.
He was eating well and his pain was well controlled with MS Contin.
He was Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis and was able to administer it to himself without difficulty.
