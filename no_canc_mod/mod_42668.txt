Admission Date:  [**2130-10-30**]       Discharge Date:   Service:  Neurology  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with past history of hypertension, diabetes, heart block status post pacemaker in [**10/2129**], mild congestive heart failure, depression, with recent admission on [**2130-9-30**] to [**Hospital1 69**] status post fall.
At that time, she was found by a home aid on the floor in the bathroom and did not remember who she fell and did not recall any symptoms prior to falling.
She was seen by the stroke fellow and was taken CT/CTA as she could not have an MRI secondary to her pacemaker.
While at CT, she had a witnessed focal motor seizure with deviation of the eyes to the right and jerking of right arm and leg.
The CT/CT angiogram was normal without evidence of bleed or early infarct.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, heart block status post pacemaker in [**10/2129**], diabetes, depression, and left tibial fracture.
ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to penicillin.
General exam revealed lungs with rhonchi bilaterally, heart regular rate and rhythm, abdomen soft and nontender.
Pupils:  Right 3 mm, left 2 mm, minimally reactive bilaterally.
The anasecoria was noted in prior notes.
There was decreased gag reflex.
She had purposeful withdrawal of her right leg to pain.
Chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  After the witnessed seizure while at CT in the Emergency Department, the patient was loaded on Dilantin with 1500 mg intravenously.
She was placed on regular insulin sliding scale for diabetes, and she was started on Levaquin and clindamycin for possible infiltrate on chest x-ray.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, her right-sided weakness resolved, and she was moving all extremities equally including the right upper extremity.
She became agitated and required sedation with Ativan.
She was noted at one point to have some abdominal distension with possible tenderness on exam and had further two episodes of bilious vomiting.
She was seen by a general surgery consultant and found to have a reducible umbilical hernia.
There was no sign of obstruction on KUB.
Electroencephalogram was done on [**2130-10-31**] which showed slow background without epileptiform activity consistent with encephalopathy.
The electroencephalogram did show some focal slowing in the right anterior quadrant and the loss of cortical rhythms broadly on the left, both suggesting additional focal abnormalities beyond the encephalopathy.
The head CT showed a possible sign of left middle cerebral artery region infarct with subtle sulcal loss of definition.
She continued to be confused and agitated and was treated with Haldol for acute agitation.
Echocardiogram showed mildly dilated left atrium, borderline to mildly hypertrophied left ventricle, overall preserved left ventricular systolic function.
There was a mildly dilated ascending aorta, mildly thickened aortic leaflets, mild aortic regurgitation, mildly thickened mitral leaflets, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
There was no evidence of cardiac embolic source.
The patient remained on Dilantin as above, and there were no further seizure events.
On discharge, there does not appear to be any right-sided motor deficit.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Possible embolic stroke with subsequent seizure and subsequent encephalopathy likely postictal and medication induced.
