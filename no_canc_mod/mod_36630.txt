Acute pulmonary embolism involving the distal right main and segmental branches supplying the right lower and middle lobes.
No evidence for heart strain.
Copious secretions within the left main stem bronchus and left lower lobe bronchus with progression of left lower lobe collapse since the prior study.
No pleural fluid.
CXR ([**10-6**]):  IMPRESSION: Limited study with retrocardiac opacity suggesting segmental collapse of the left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 105209**] is a 62 year-old woman with [**Known lastname 39850**] (complication of past surgery), DVT, CAD s/p stent, and tracheostomy who presented [**2167-10-7**] with shortness of breath and transient hypoxia.
She was found to have right main pulmonary embolism and left lower lobe collapse.
Pulmonary Embolism:  The patient developed acutely worsening SOB and presented to the ED here.
On arrival a CTA was done which revealed a pulmonary embolism in the right pulmonary artery.
She had a subtherapeutic INR on admission.
This patient's spinal surgery is remote and no other procedures are planned at this time.
LLL Collapse: In addition to the PE described above, initial imaging also revealed left lower lung lobe collapse with debris.
Also tried positive pressure ventilation which too transiently expanded the lung.
At time of discharge, the LLL is still collapsed although the patient is reporting less secretions and denies any subjective respiratory compromise.
# UTI (Pansensitive Pseudomonas): Patient has history of recurrent UTI's, even following suprapubic catheter placement.
Here, positive UA and low grade documented fever 100.2 in the ED.
The patient completed her course and remained afebrile during her hospital stay.
Did have [**2-8**] nights with burning pain on left lateral leg although this resolved without itnervention.

You were admitted due to difficulty with breathing and were found to have a pulmonary embolism (clot in the lung) and a partial left lung collapse.
2) CONTINUE Lovenox injections for 2 more days or until INR >2.0 3) STOP Naproxen while using the Lovenox injections 4) START home oxygen as needed for shortness of breath or hypoxia  Please see below for follow-up instructions:  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with the [**Hospital 2786**] clinic at [**Hospital **] as instructed.
