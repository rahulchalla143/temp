Pulmonary vascular engorgement.
Differential diagnosis includes portal colopathy or colitis (infectious, inflammatory or ischemic etiologies).
Findings are non-specific and may be secondary to portal hypertension or inflammation of any of the upper abdominal organs as described above.
Bibasilar consolidations and small effusions, left greater than right.
Likely atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.
Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly suggesting portal hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo cantonese speaking female with history cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C admitted to the ICU for presumed septic shock and abdominal pain found to have GNR sepsis.
#  GNR bacteremia/septic shock:  Presumed secondary to intra-abdominal infection.
CT revealed fat stranding in the upper abdomen around the ascending colon, duodenum.
Transplant surgery was consulted and felt patient poor operative candidate with very high risk of mortality if taken to OR.
Patient had elevated lactate ranging from 9 - 11, which did not improve with antibiotics.
Patient's did not have respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis and required intubation.
She was hypotensive and required pressor support with levophed and vasopressin.
# Respiratory Distress: The patient complaining of some shortness of breath likely secondary to fluid overload.
?s ABG did not show that she was hypoxic or hypercarbic.
Differential also included pneumonia which could be possible given the patient?????
?s complaint of chest pain and LLL consolidation seen on CT scan and CXR.
No evidence of ARDS.
She had metabolic acidosis with lactate [**10-7**] without respiratory compensation and was intubated, after which her acidosis improved.
Unclear etiology, but likely secondary to sepsis.
She was started on empiric vanc/cefepime/flagyl and blood cultures returned with GNR sensitive to everything except ampicillin.
FeNa was 0.14% consistent with pre-renal etiology.
#  Cirrhosis:  Unknown baseline LFTs, unclear if related to Hep b or C or both.
At 3:35pm she did not show any respiratory or cardiac activity and was pronounced at bedside.
