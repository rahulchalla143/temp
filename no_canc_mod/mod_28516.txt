Admission Date:  [**2198-9-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-9-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-3-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: chest pain and shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with 1 stent placed   History of Present Illness: 81 yo with a history of CAD who presented to an OSH today with chest pain.
The patient reports that he started to experience chest pain about three days ago associated with shortness of breath.
The pain came on after he worked on an iron stove for a couple of hours.
The chest pain was associated with ambulation.
However this morning at about 3am he started to have chest pain at rest associated with more severe shortness of breath.
He went to [**Hospital3 7569**] where he was found to be in pulmonary edema with a SBP of 80-90 and O2 Sats in the low 80s.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
He endorses a cough productive of thick sputum for several weeks.
He denies any abdominal pain or dysuria.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope prior to the current event.
He never had any pulmonary edema or [**Location (un) **].
However his BP was low on Nitro gtt and he was then given MOrphine and Nitro gtt was titrated off as he was chest pain free.
He currently is chest pain free and breathing comfortably.
He only complains of mild chest pain with inspiration which he has not noticed before.
Past Medical History: CAD with MI in [**2187**], pt underwent angiogram at [**Hospital1 498**] (no stent placed) s/P ICD placement in [**2193**] at [**Hospital1 **] Prostate Cancer, no intervention, "slow growing" per patient HTN h/o nephrolithiasis Gout h/o pancreatic duct obstruction Borderline Diabetes, diet controlled   Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Systolic murmur [**2-13**] over RUSB radiating into his carotids.
Different more holosystolic murmur [**1-16**] over apex.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No wheeze, rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
DIABETES MONITORING: %HbA1c-5.9 .
STUDIES: TTE [**2198-9-23**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Ischemic cardiomyopathy with severely depressed LVEF.
Aortic stenosis is present but the severity cannot be determined from this study.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system shows 1 vessel severe coronary artery disase.
The LMCA shows mild calcifications without critical lesions.
The rest of the vessel and its branches are without obstructive disease.
The LCx is a non-dominant vessel with 40% lesion in its mid-section.
The RCA is a dominant vessel with 40% lesion in its mid-section.
Resting hemodynamic measurement shows aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 30mmHg and calculated valve area of 0.8cm2.
The left sided filling pressure is elevated with a PCWP and LVEDP of 25mmHg.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 61mmHg.
The cardiac index is mildly depressed at 2.3  L/min/m2.
Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0 X 18 mm MiniVision baremetal stent postdilated to 3.25 with no residual stenosis (see PTCA comments for detail).
Moderate aortic stenosis with moderately elevated LVEDP.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Mildly depressed cardiac output.
Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a bare metal stent.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo with CAD who presents with NSTEMI and CHF.
# Valve disease: ECHO with possible significant AS, however poor study.
# CHF, acute: no history of chronic CHF, but EF is severely depressed at 15-20% with evidence of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Was mildly hypervolemic following cath and diuresed well to 20mg IV lasix.
Started metoprolol as above for anti-arrhythmia effects.
# HTN: well controlled (actually borderline hypotensive) throughout this stay with addition of beta blockade and diuretic  .
# Leukocytosis: Likely a stress response in the setting of acute MI, as it resolved spontaneously.
However to rule out infection a U/A was sent (negative), and urine culture was negative.
CXR was without convincing evidence of infiltrate (volume overload).
# Chronic Renal failure: stable at baseline 1.3, GFR of 40-50. .
# FEN: cardiac, low salt diet, diabetic .
# Prophylaxis: was on heparin gtt followed by sQ heparin tid, bowel regimen, PPI .
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: NSTEMI .
Secondary: Aortic Stenosis Borderline DM HTN Chronic Renal Failure Gout GERD   Discharge Condition: stable, improved, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath.
After the blockage was opened your symptoms dramatically improved.
You have a new medication called Zetia, which is for high triglycerides, you should take this in addition to the Atorvastatin.
If you experience any symptoms that are disturbing to you, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, please call your doctor or go to the nearest ER.
