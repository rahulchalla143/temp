Coli.
Pt with period of hypotension - tx with levophed - off pressors and now extubated 2 days ago - still with mild low grade temps am of tx to floor.
# Urosepsis/UTI - Patient admitted with fever and possible pulmonary infiltrate as well as hypotension, so she was treated for sepsis due to a pulmonary source (vanc/ zosyn/ levofloxacin for legionella coverge).
