1-2 weeks ago his dose of furosemide was increased to 40 mg daily due to new, progressive lower extremity edema.
On the night of [**5-25**], he was awakened from sleep with severe dyspnea in the setting of dietary indiscretion earlier that night.
It was associated with substernal chest discomfort that was not relieved by belching; he also had nausea without emesis.
He presented to an OSH where he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with ST segment depressions V4-V6 on his initial EKG; his second troponin returned at 7.68.
He also received furosemide IV for treatment of congestive heart failure with effective diuresis.

Family History: Brother died of sudden cardiac death from an MI.
Physical Exam: T-98.1 BP-131/67 HR-80 RR-16 Weight-199 pounds Gen: Pleasant, obese, non-toxic Neck: Soft, supple, no LAD, 2+ carotid pulses, very faint R carotid bruit CV: RRR, normal S1 and S2, II/VI flow murmur at the base, no r/g Pulm: Scant bibasilar crackles Abd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, active bowel sounds Back: No CVA or paraspinal tenderness Ext: 1+ BLE pitting edema to the knees, 2+ DP/femoral/radial pulses, no femoral bruits Neuro: Alert, appropriate  Pertinent Results: OSH Labs:  WBC-5.1 Hct-38.8 MCV-85.9 Plt-171 Na-138 K-4.7 Cl-103 Bicarb-29 BUN-17 Cr-1.0 Glu-295 Ca-9.1 Serial CK/MB: 250/26.7 Serial Troponin I: 0.20, 7.68, 5.43, 4.68 BNP: 582  U/A: trace protein, trace LE, o/w negative  EKG (initial): atrial fibrillation at roughly 150 beats per minute, normal axis, 1-2 mm ST segment depressions V4-V6  EKG ([**5-27**]): normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, 0.5-1 mm ST segment depressions V4-V6, T wave flattening I and aVL  OSH TTE (per report): EF 25-30%, multiple regional WMA  [**2130-5-29**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound Mild to moderate plaque in the bilateral internal carotid arteries, right worse than left.
This is associated with diameter reductions between 40 and 59% in diameter in the right internal carotid artery and less than 40% in diameter in the left internal carotid artery.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a left dominant system with three vessel coronary artery disease.
The dominant LCX had extensive calcification with a 90% lesion at the origin of the OM2 and LPDA with no angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions distally.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated right sided (mean RA 21 mmHg), pulmonary (mean PA 28 mm Hg) and left sided pressures (mean PCWP 21 mmHg) with no gradient upon movement of the catheter from the ventricle to the aorta.
Left ventriculography was deferred for high left sided pressures.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Inferior akinesis is present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

A cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed a 50% stenosed left main, a 90% stenosed left anterior descending artery, a 90% stenosed circumflex artery and an occluded right coronary artery.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which revealed a 40-59% stenosed right and less then a 40% stenosed left internal carotid artery.
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 30-35%, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, [**12-25**]+ tricuspid regurgitation and a mildly dilated left atrium.
Thus, an ace-inhibitor should be started as an outpatient given his low ejection fraction and preoperative myocardial infarction.
