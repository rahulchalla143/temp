[**2189-8-28**]: Interventional radiology drainage of left upper quadrant fluid collection  [**2189-8-31**] Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with repair of gastric perforation  [**2189-9-7**] I&D for R elbow wound dehiscence   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old male who presented via [**Location (un) **] on [**2189-8-17**] s/p 15 foot fall from roof of RV.
He was taken to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital where head CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage and was subsequently intubated at the outside hospital.
Past Medical History: PMH: hyperlipidemia, possible seizures  PSH: hip and knee replacement, open cholecystectomy   Social History:  Lives in [**State 15946**], in [**Location (un) 3844**] for summer, staying in RV at a camping area.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]:  Temp 97 BP: 119/60    HR: 99   RR  16     O2 Sats 99%  Constitutional: Intubated HEENT: Pupils equal, round and reactive to light C. collar in place Chest: Breath sounds bilaterally, crepitus right chest, right sided chest tube in place Cardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm Abdominal: Soft, distended Pelvic: Stable Rectal: Normal tone, no gross blood Skin: Large laceration over right elbow, compartments soft Neuro: Sedated   Pertinent Results: LABORATORIES:  IMAGING: [**8-17**] torso CT- chest: 1.
50% R anterior PTX w/ mediastinal shift and compressive effects on both lungs; R chest tube enters low and is oriented in posterior pleural space (away from PTX).
3. no aortic or injury.
4. extensive R chest wall emphysema.
R posterolateral rib fx [**3-24**]; L posterolateral rib fx [**8-24**]; R clavicle fx.
abdomen/pelvis: 1. worsening hepatic and splenic lacerations w/ growing perihepatic and perisplenic hematomas - active extrav around spleen; small amt blood tracking along B paracolic gutters.
2. prominent R adrenal gland - ?
Given consideration of persistent leukocytosis, findings suggest this to be the result of scattered ill-defined pulmonary infiltrates as described as well as bibasilar consolidation versus  collapse.
Hence, no findings within the abdomen or pelvis to explain leukocytosis.
No change in multiple right-sided rib fractures, decrease in subcutaneous air, only small residual right pneumothorax remaining with decrease in mediastinal shift, decrease in subcutaneous air, no change in hepatic contusions.
No change in the size of a 6 x 10 cm splenic bed fluid collection which is now better organized and has new rim enhancement concerning for abscess.
Multifocal ground-glass opacities could likely represent infection or inflammation, possibly related to aspiration.
Numerous right and left-sided rib fractures, right clavicular fracture are unchanged.

STAT trauma protocol was activated on arrival and patient was evaluated by acute care surgery service.
In the trauma bay there was concern for a tension pneumorthorax as patient was hypotensive with mediastinal shift on trauma bay chest xray despite right chest tube at outside hospital.
Patient was brought emergently to the OR for exploratory laparotomy, splenectomy and repair of small hepatic defect.
Pain/sedation was initially controlled with fentanyl/propofol while patient was intubated and subsequently transitioned to PCA on extubation with good effect and adequate pain control.
CV: The patient arrived to the ICU hemodynamically stable with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] vasopressor support, subsequently successfully weaned following abdominal closure HD 2 with intermittent use until HD 6 Pressors: Single-[**Doctor Last Name 360**] vasopressor support was utilized for blood pressure support during immediate post-operative period and subsequently weaned without issue.
Concern for pulmonary edema with prn lasix and adequate diuresis on follow-up CXR.
Serial CXR were obtained given presence of R chest tube without evidence of reaccumulation.
During work-up for persistent leukocytosis, CT was obtained which demonstrated fluid collection in LUQ which was subsequently drained by IR.
Subsequent fluoroscopic examination of this collection demonstrated a small gastric perforation communicating with aforementioned fluid collection which was subsequently repaired endoscopically.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound care:  Incisional wounds were regularly monitored for signs of infection of which there were none.
Antibiotics:  Patient was started on vancomycin for open fracture of R olecranon given penicillin allergy.
Pt was also treated for VAP per [**Hospital1 18**] protocol and fluconazole was empirically added given concern for gastric perforation with subsequent discontinuation following confirmation of the integrity of endoscopic repair.
At time of transfer to floor, pt remained on antibiotics for UTI infection, empiric treatment for H.pylori as well as R elbow ORIF per orthopedic surgery.
Hematology: The patient was found to be hypotensive on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and large amount free hemorrhage was found in abdomen on exploratory laparotomy [**8-17**].
Following operative intervention,  the patient's complete blood count was examined routinely with single transfusion requirement [**8-30**] for asymptomatic anemia.
No further transfusions were required at time of transfer to floor.
MSK: Patient was found to have open fracture of R olecranon on presentation and was taken to the OR with orthopedics [**8-18**] for ORIF.
Prophylaxis: Heparin was not utilized on initial presentation as there was significant concern for intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
Neuro: While on the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained of minimal pain which was well controlled with tylenol only.
A follow up head CT  in 6 weeks was initially recommended by neurosurgery, who had signed off after multiple stable head CT's and improvement in mental status.
He remained on room air with stable oxygen saturations and no respiratory compromise.
GI/GU: The patient had a formal speech and swallow evaluation as well as a video swallow study.
On [**9-5**] the patient failed his void trial after his foley catheter was removed and the catheter was replaced and kept in for the remainder of his hospital stay.
In addition to the cipro for UTI, he remains on keflex through [**9-10**] for RUE cellulitis and flagyl through [**9-11**] for h. pylori treatment.
Incisions were continually monitored for signs and symptoms of infection.
MSK: On [**9-7**] the patient's RUE incision was noted was noted to have dehisced, and the patient was taking to the operating room by orthopedics for an I&D and closure of the wound.

Right olecranon fracture   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You sustained multiple injuries including a head bleed, collapse of your right lung, liver and spleen injuries, multiple rib fractures, a right clavicle fracture and a right elbow fracture.
You sustained rib fractures which can cause sever pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
You should take your pain medicine as as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedation, take half the dose and notify your physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is a complication of rib fractures.
You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short periods may ease the pain.
Return to the ED right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your rips (crepitus).
If your doctor allows, non steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs are very effective in controlling pain (i.e.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a time while your incision is healing, and also because of the drain in place in hour abdomen.
