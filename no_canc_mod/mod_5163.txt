He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible stroke and management of hyperglycemia.
CT head was negative for bleed or mass.
After MRI/A showed no evidence of a stroke, the patient was transferred to the MICU for further management of DKA and rhabdomyolosis.
In the MICU, the patient was aggressively hydrated for treatment of DKA and rhabdomyolysis.
Etiology of R hemiparesis was thought to be related to hyperglycemia, with concern that metabolic derangements caused "reactivation" of old stroke.
MRI did not show evidence of an acute stroke.
Mental retardation.
Atrial fibrillation.
Venous stasis ulcers.
Congenital foot disease.
The patient does not have a guardian.

Following resolution of DKA, he was transitioned to his outpatient diabetes regimen.
MRI did not show evidence of stroke.
However, the patient became agitated and was unable to cooperate with the MRI.
3) Rhabdomyolysis: The patient was admitted with CKs elevated around 25,000.
Rhabdomyoloysis resolved with fluid administration.
4) Elevated LFTs: Elevated LFTs were noted early in the patient's hospitalization.
RUQ US disclosed evidence of a gallstone, but no evidence of obstruction.
8) R UE swelling: On [**7-3**], pt underwent R UE US to r/o DVT, since he was noted to have R upper arm swelling.
Pt's had a R IJ central line while in the ICU, and this line had been pulled on [**7-2**].
R upper extremity US disclosed evidence of an acute versus subacute R IJ thrombus.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Provident Skilled Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: R hemiparesis DKA Rhabdomyolysis Bilateral lower extremity ulcers CHF Mental retardation Bipolar disorder DM II   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: The Podiatry team recommends multipodus boots at all times to both lower extremities.
For R forearm wound, please apply Adaptic dressings, guaze, and ABD.
