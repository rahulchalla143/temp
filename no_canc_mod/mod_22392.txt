Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with stent placement   History of Present Illness: HPI: 85 yo F h/o unstable angina with multiple past admissions to [**Hospital3 3583**], moderate AS, hypercholesterolemia, past smoker, COPD, CRI, H/O TIA, Dementia, Anemia, AAA, GERD (?
h/o GIB) presents on Tx from [**Hospital3 **] where she presented for Chest Pain and SOB from NH - found to have NSTEMI.
Pt now s/p cath with stenting of 90% ostial L Main lesion with resolution of ST changes post-cath.
Past Medical History: HTN hypercholesterolemia CRI COPD Dementia H/O TIA ?SSS Anemia GERD with ?
Husband died of MI at age 59.
No axillary murmur appreciated.
N: grossly non-focal   Pertinent Results: Echo [**9-15**]: Aortic Valve Area: *1.0 cm2 /  EF 50% The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a LEFT dominant system with severe left main CAD.
The vessels all had moderate calcification.
It had an ostial 90% stenosis.
The LAD had a 50% proximal stenosis and appeared to have aneurysmal dilatation both before and after this stenosis.
The remainder of the LAD had mild luminal irregularities only.
The LCX had mild luminal irregularities only.
The RCA was non-dominat with no significant disease.
Hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left heart filling pressures and moderately elevated right heart filling pressures.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension.
Assessment of the aortic valve revealed a 15-18mm Hg peak aortic gradient with a a valve area of 1.2cm2, consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.
Of note, there appeared to be an aneurysm in the abdominal aorta which meant that it was difficult to pass the J-wire up.
The patient's sheaths were sewn in place and she was taken off the table pending consideration of possible cardiac surgery.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

The patient also underwent a TTE, which revealed moderated aortic stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD, 50% ejection fraction.
The patient did not exhibit any further EKG changes or chest pain following stent placement.
The patient was monitored on telemetry, noted to have some ectopy, electrolytes were monitored without any need for replacement.
The patient was noted to have a history of anemia upon admission, and required one unit of PRBCs to maintain a target hematocrit of >30.
In addition, the patient will need to have her creatinine monitored due to her history of chronic renal insufficiency, and a noted elevation in her creatinine thought to be secondary to insult from catheterization dye.
The patient was continued on Zyprexa for her history of dementia, and a sitter was provided when necessary to ensure patient safety.
The patient was also continued on her albuterol inhaler PRN for her history of COPD and was maintained on a PPI for GI protection, as well as subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
In addition, the patient was evaluated by physical therapy prior to discharge, it was recommended that patient would benefit from PT at nursing home, with no acute issues found.
Albuterol-Ipratropium 103-18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**11-20**] Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
