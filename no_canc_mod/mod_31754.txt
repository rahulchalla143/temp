The ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is an area of slightly decreased attenuation within the region of the left lentiform nucleus and anterior limb of the left internal capsule, without definite mass effect.
There is also subtle decreased attenuation in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic infarction.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or definite mass effect is identified.
There is a subtle area of decreased attenuation with the left lentiform nucleus and anterior limb of the left internal capsule, suspicious for a new infarct.
[**1-8**] [**Month/Year (2) 4338**]/A FINDINGS: There are areas of abnormal diffusion signal involving the left basal ganglia and left posterior temporal lobe, consistent with acute infarction.
There are no areas of susceptibility artifact to suggest the presence of hemorrhage.
These two regions of infarction do demonstrate slight increased FLAIR signal as well.
Some FLAIR signal hyperintensity is noted within the periventricular white matter areas of both cerebral hemispheres, consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
3D time-of-flight MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates diminished flow within the left middle cerebral artery compared to the flow on the right side.
Subacute left basal ganglia and posterior temporal lobe infarction, corresponding to the inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery.
Diminished flow within the left middle cerebral artery compared to the right on the MR angiogram images, suggestive of possible focal occlusions, embolic or thrombotic in nature.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Inferior hypokinesis is probably present.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Repeat Head CT [**1-10**]: There is no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
New hypodensity in the posterior left temporal lobe is seen corresponding to the region of abnormal diffusion on the recent prior brain [**Month/Year (2) 4338**].
Apart from these two areas, no other areas of new hypodensity are seen.
Chronic microvascular changes are seen in the periventricular white matter areas bilaterally, as before.
There is no sign of fracture or bone destruction.
No fracture is detected.
No gross degenerative changes are identified.
There is mild degenerative spurring about the inferior glenoid and about the AC joint.
There is borderline narrowing of the acromiohumeral distance, which can be associated with rotator cuff thinning or tearing.
No soft tissue  calcification is identified.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No cardiac source of embolus seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo man with vascular risk factors of DM, HTN, High Chol, who p/w right hemiplegia involving leg, arm, face, slurred speech (not apparent on exam), and right hemineglect of both sensation and vision on exam.
Exam the following morning was also notable for inattention.
CT scan showed no hemorrhage, and the patient was considered to be a good candidate for the [**Last Name (un) **]-2 study protocol, which tests a new thrombolytic within a 9 hour window.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4338**] with both DWI and PWI (as well as MRA) were obtained and positive diffusion abnormalities were seen in the left lenticulostriate and left temporo-parietal cortex (suggesting inferior division left MCA) stroke.
The MRA showed decreased flow signal in the distal M1 segment on the left MCA.
TTE was unremarkable and showed no source of clot.Carotid ultrasounds were checked and showed nonhemodynamically significant stenosis of less than 40% was demonstrated in the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Neurologically, on the floor the facial droop and right hemiparesis improved significantly after he was transferred out of the ICU to the floor.
FLP was checked, although he was on maximal statin therapy and showed an elevated LDL.
He was mildly hypertensive on the floor to SBP 160's and patient was started on captopril 6.25 mg tid with good response, in additiion to clonidine patch.
2)CV: -[**Month (only) 116**] increase captopril TID if needed for BP control, cont.
Outside PCP should be [**Name (NI) 653**] for addition or increase of oral hypoglycemics.
Aspiration precautions.
