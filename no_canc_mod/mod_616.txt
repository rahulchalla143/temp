FINDINGS:  There was aspiration with thin and nectar consistencies.
Bilateral patchy areas of opacification could represent pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Low position of endotracheal tube, which could be withdrawn a few centimeters for standard positioning.
Worsening asymmetrical perihilar and basilar opacities, which may be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema.
Given history of seizures, aspiration pneumonia is an additional consideration.
New small left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 36 y.o female with pmhx of CVA [**2158**], DM type 1, found to be unresponsive with hypoglycemia, hypoxemia, altered mental status/seizure like activity found to have infiltrate on CXR concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
#Seizure like activity: Likely related to hypoglycemia in the field in setting of infectious pulmonary process causing metabolic derangements.
CT head showed no acute changes at OSH.
Low pre-test probability for meningitis on admission to MICU, though she was intubated and thus lumbar puncture not done.
#Hypoxemia/PNA: Intubated for altered mental status and hypoxemia at OSH.
Could have aspirated during hypoglycemic/seizure like episode causing a aspiration pneumonitis.
CXR consistent with PNA and in lower lobes so could also be aspiration PNA.
Cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] showed no growth.
#Hypoglycemia/DM I: Likely due to underlying DM and insulin usage vs infectious trigger.
Pt very sensitive to standard sliding scale, becoming mildly hypoglycemic in unit while NPO.
She had a video swallow which showed risk for aspiration.
Family meeting was held on [**2171-7-10**] (with patient, brother, mother, father over the phone, and health care proxy) and decision was made to take the risk of aspiration and to continue on a regular diet.
Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain or fever 17.

Nystatin Oral Suspension 5 mL PO QID:PRN thrush   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] health care center  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: hypoglycemia, seizure secondary to hypoglycemia Secondary diagnosis: aspiration pneumonia, diabetes mellitus type 1   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: baseline, able to answer yes/no questions, follow commands, aphasia Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were unresponsive and your blood sugars were very low.
You also had a seizure, which was likely due to the low blood sugar.
During your hospitalization, you developed an infection in your lungs and we treated you with antibiotics.
While you were here, you were closely followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] team for management of your diabetes and adjusment of your insulin.
