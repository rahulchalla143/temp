Altered Mental Status:  Patient was found by nursing home to have altered mental status on [**2168-7-2**].
On admission to OSH, patient's U/A had large blood, moderate leukocytes, and moderate bacteria.
Patient also had a toxicology screen which was positive for opioids.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], patient received three doses of Ciprofloxacin, was restarted on her home dose of lactulose and rifaximin, and received IV hydration for treatment of acute renal failure as the team thought her mental status change could be related to dehydration, hepatic encephalopathy, or her UTI.
With above interventions the patient's mental status improved and she is currently back to her baseline, oriented x 2, often tangential in thought.
Acute Renal Failure:  Patient's Cr was elevated from baseline of 1.2 to 2.4 on admission.
The patient appeared hypovolemic and received two boluses of IV fluids, as the team believed her ARF was caused by dehydration in the setting of lactulose administration, diuresis and poor PO intake.
Would recommend daily weights with the reinitiation of Lasix 10 mg daily if the patient has a weight gain of [**2-14**] pounds or clinical evidence of fluid overload.
Urinary Tract Infection: Patient was found to have a positive urine analysis upon admission to the OSH.
Cirrhosis:  Patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis with history of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy.
She is s/p TIPS for GI bleeding and portal gastropathy.
Iron deficiency anemia: On review of her records, patient is known to have a history of iron deficiency anemia, most likely secondary to known portal hypertensive gastropathy and internal hemorrhoids on recent EGD/Colonoscopy.
Seizure disorder:  On review of her records, patient has a history of a seizure disorder, which has been well controlled on her outpatient medications.
Patient was continued on Levetiracetam and had no acute events while in the hospital.
