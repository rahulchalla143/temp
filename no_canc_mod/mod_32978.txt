She went to work and felt somewhat lightheaded.
She had an LP there where the opening preassure was reportedly 45 and closing preassure 25 (WBC 2 normal protein); a CTA head showed superior sagital sinus thrombosis.
ROS: The patient denied visual difficulty, hearing changes, difficulty speaking, language problems, memory difficulty, difficulty swallowing, vertigo, unsteady gait, paresthesias, sensory loss, weakness, or falls.
The patient denied fever, wt loss, appetite changes, cp, palpitations, DOE, sob, cough, wheeze, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abd pain, fecal incont, dysuria, nocturia, urinary incontinence, muscle or joint pain, hot/cold intolerance, polyuria, polydipsia, easy bruising, depression, anxiety, stress, or psychotic sx.
Past Medical History: -occasional headaches (throbbing, intense, nausea but no photophobia) every 2 months   Social History: She works as a consultant for [**University/College **] Pilgrim, no history of tobbaco use or alcohol.
She is married and she has one healthy child at the age of 2.5 yo   Family History: No history of thrombosis or coagulopathy in the family   Physical Exam: T-99.6 BP-180/98 HR-80 RR-16 97O2Sat Gen: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit Back: No point tenderness or erythema CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake and alert after stimuli, [**Name (NI) 18247**] otherwise; she follows commands after repeated stimuli.
No dysarthria.
No evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Palate elevation symmetrical.

ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial mass, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures.
Diffusion and susceptibility weighted images of the brain appear within normal limits.
There does not appear to be a "blooming" effect to suggest that there is acute clot within the superior sagittal sinus.
Moreover, as noted above, the sagittal T1 weighted scans disclose elevated T1 signal throughout the course of the superior sagittal sinus, suggesting that the thrombosis likely has components of the methemoglobin, which is seen in a subacute thrombosis.
The surrounding osseous and extracranial soft tissues do not appear to reveal additional abnormalities.
Multiple, superficially located vessels, presumably represent collateral venous flow.
CONCLUSION: Findings appear consistent with extensive venous sinus thrombosis as noted above.
CT Head ([**6-19**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process, specifically there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage given anticoagulation in the setting of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis.
EEG ([**6-22**]): IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal 24-hour EEG telemetry due to bursts of bifrontal rhythmic delta activity.
Such a finding can be seen with increased intracranial pressure, encephalopathy, hydrocephalus, or mid-brain dysfunction.
There were no epileptiform features noted.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 39 year old woman with a history of occasional headaches and oral contraceptive use who presented with a 2 day history of left occipital throbbing headache and nausea, and found to have superior sagittal and bilateral transverse sinus thrombosis.
She intially presented to an OSH, where she had an LP which showed opening preassure 45 and closing pressure 25 (no report on WBC or protein) and a CTA head showed superior sagital thrombosis.
MRI/MRA/MRV on admission showed absence of flow within the superior sagittal sinus, as well as both transverse sinuses.
She was started on Acetazolamide 250 mg q8 hours, given that it may help reduce surrounding edema from her venous thrombosis.
She was initially started on Lisinopril for hypertension during this admission, but this was discontinued at the time of discharge as her blood pressure improved as her pain was better controlled.
During the admission, the patient complained of episodes of vertical bobbing eye movements lasting 2 hours and usually occuring after Dilaudid IV administration.
A 24 hour EEG showed bursts of bifrontal rhythmic delta activity which indicates an abnormality of deeper midline structures.
There were no epileptiform features noted.
The patient reported symptoms of a UTI, and urine culture grew >100,000 E.coli.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Percocet 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for breakthrough pain.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, superior sagittal sinus and both transverse sinuses Urinary Tract Infection   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with headache and nausea, and were found to have cerebral venous thrombosis.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection, and were prescribed Macrobid to complete a 3 day course.
Your pain was controlled with Oxycontin 10 mg twice daily, and you should be weaned off of this as an outpatient.
You can take Percocet 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed for breakthrough pain.
You should take Senna and Colace to prevent constipation while taking narcotic pain medications.
If you develop weakness/numbness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, decreased vision or blurry vision, headache, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP or return to the ED.
