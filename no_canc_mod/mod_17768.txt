Admission Date:  [**2103-9-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-10-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2024-9-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory Failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical ventillation Bronchoscopy x 2 Tracheostomy upgrade to larger tube Removal of Y-stent in bronchus   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 79 year od female with chronic respiratory failure, h/o GBS in [**2101**], vented, s/p trach x 1 year.
Frequent hospitalization for trach exchanges and stent placements.
Admitted initially to thoracix surgery service with respiratory failure.
Last month, the patient was admitted for worsening respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding (diverticulosis and hemrrhoids).
During that admission, bronchoscopy was performed, she was found to have severe tracheobronchomalacia for which she underwent a Y silicone stent placement.
In addition, she had some component of tracheal stenosis, and her trach was changed to a Portex #7, which was telescoped through the Y-stent.
She was also diagnosed with pneumonia based on peak WBC 23, right perihilar and left retrocardiac infiltrates and positive sputum cultures.
She was started back on bactrim/unasyn She was planned for OR removal of stent in setting of stenosis but this was deferred due to pt's persistently high Fi02 requirement.
CTA was performed which showed no PE but multifocal PNA, unclear if this is resolving infection from recent PNA or new process.
S/p repeat bronch with BAL yesterday which showed the tracheostomy in place/y-stent in place, scant mucous in airways, no evidence of clear obstruction, moderate distal granulation tissue.
Upon transfer to MICU, patient was found to be hypertensive to 200/100 with decreasing 02 sats to mid to high 80s, she was visibly agitated with audible wheezing.
[**Name8 (MD) **] rn notes patient frequently becomes anxious and hypertensive, responds to ativan.
+ anasarca, elevated BNP, pt appeared total body volume overloaded with elevated BNP.
Treated for likely flash pulmonary edema with nitro gtt, lasix IV gtt.
Past Medical History: 1)Ventillator dependence since [**1-5**] s/p trach (perhaps due to GBS), successfully decanulated in [**10-7**], however readmitted [**Date range (1) 76415**] for evaluation of small tracheal mass and desaturated in the setting of bronchoscopy and trach was replaced.
tracheostomy in place Pulmonary: ascultated anteriorly with coarse, rhoncorous bs b/l, no crackles, expiratory wheezes centrally.
Cardiac: distant Abdomen: tympanitic, non-tender, no rebound or guarding.
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-2**], the right upper lobe pneumonia is slightly more prominent, possibly due to the relative [**Name (NI) 76419**] of the image.
Dilated proximal small bowel loops, with transition point in the mid ileum, after which small bowel loops are nearly completely decompressed.
The findings are concerning for early small-bowel obstruction, though the presence of some contrast material within the colon also raises the possibility of a partial obstruction.
Please correlate with history of prior oral contrast administration.
Grossly unchanged appearance of dense bilateral basal consolidations within both lungs, only partially imaged.
Mild ascites.
Diffuse anasarca.
Suboptimal image quality.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small inferior and inferolateral pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.
Patchy areas of ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes as well as more confluent areas of opacity in all the lobes containing air bronchograms, consistent with multi-lobar pneumonia.
Subcutaneous edema, small amount of ascites and perisplenic fluid.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.

Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 79 female with HTN, CHF, CAD, COPD, PAF, DM, Hyperlipidemia admitted to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to vent associated pneumonia.
On presentation, the patients respiratory distress was thought to be due to proximal airway obstruction with overgrowth of lumenal granulation tissue within the patient's y- stent.
However, this was delayed due to persistent hypoxemia on high levels of Fi02.
Her hypoxemia was evaluated with a CTA on [**2103-9-11**], which revealed no pulmonary emboli, but did show multi-focal pneumonia.
Her antibiotics were broadened to Zosyn as patient was no improving.
She completed a 14 day course of Zosyn, but due to rising WBC, low grade fevers, and increaseing secretions, she was started on Colistin on [**2103-10-3**].
In addition, she also developed gross volume overload with pulmonary edema in the setting of ATN/contrast nephropathy from her CTA on admission.
Patient developed anasarca in setting of ATN/contrast nephropathy.
Congestive heart failure.
Recent TTE showed moderate systolic artery hypertension.
Mild LVH with no focal wall motion abnormalities, normal to slightly depressed EF at 45%.
Patient had episodes of hypertensive urgency with SBP in 200s while on vent.
She was delirious & had periods of agitation, during which her BP would rise into 200s.
Her antihypertensive regimen was uptitrated with minimal effect.
Ipratropium-Albuterol 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol [**Last Name (STitle) **]: [**1-31**] Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

You were treated with antibiotics and your symptoms improved.
Please call your PCP or come to the emergency department if you have shortness of breath, increased respiratory secretions, cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
