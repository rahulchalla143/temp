In brief, he was at a bar and fell in the parking lot due to a combination of intoxication and ice.
In the ED here he was found to have a temporal bone fracture and a small ICH.
During his second day of admission he became increasingly hypoxic.
CTA showed no PE but ?aspiration pneumonitis.
Overnight he became increasingly hypertensive, tachycardic, and agitated consistent with etOH withdrawl.
Given his complex medical issues and ongoing alcohol withdrawl, he was transfered to the MICU for further management.

Bilateral inferior frontal and left frontal hyperdensities, which may be artifact or subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Partial opacification left mastoid air cells.
Hyperdensity overlying the right frontotemporal lobe (5:[**12-13**]) is consistent with acute blood, likely subdural hematoma, measuring 2 mm in greatest transverse dimension.
Hyperdensity along the anterior falx (2:13-14) is concerning for subdural hematoma.
A hyperdense 3 mm focus overlying the anterior left frontal lobe is consistent with acute blood, likely subdural.
Bifrontal hyperdensities of the inferior frontal lobes (5:10) may be due to artifact, or subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is no intraventricular hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect, shift of midline structures or edema.
There appears to be a nondisplaced left temporal bone fracture (3:16), although this is not well evaluated due to motion artifact.
Probable subdural hematoma along the anterior falx.
3mm left frontal hyperdensity most likely subdural hematoma.
Bilateral inferior frontal and left frontal hyperdensities, which may be artifact or subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-1-21**] 9:48 AM Again noted is  small acute subdural hematoma in the bilateral inferior frontal egions along the gyri recti or straight gyrus, extending superiorly up the anterior falx.
This is unchanged in size and appearance from prior as is the small associated subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No new areas of hemorrhage are present.
No areas of edema or large infarctions are noted either.
The prior noted left nondisplaced temporal bone fracture is also unchanged.
Partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells persists.
The remaining paranasal sinuses and right mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Unchanged frontal subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2129-1-21**] 2:29 PM There is no pulmonary embolism.
Thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and contour throughout, with mild atherosclerotic calcification seen in the arch, and descending aorta.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, and small nonhemorrhagic pericardial effusions.
Three-vessel coronary artery calcification is mild.
The main pulmonary artery is prominent, measuring up to 4.0 cm in diameter, suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
There is diffuse pneumonitis throughout dependent portions of both lungs, with relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15410**] consolidation at the lung bases.
Mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, measuring up to 28 x 11 mm in the prevascular space (2, 18).
Mildly enlarged subcarinal and right hilar nodes are also noted, measuring 11 and 13 mm in short axis respectively.
This study is not specifically tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a moderately large axial hiatal hernia.
Hepatic and left renal hypodense lesions are incompletely characterized as they are only visualized on non-contrast sequences, but statistically most likely represent simple cysts.
There is no osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Widespread consolidation predominantly in dependent portions of both lungs, most consistent with a multilobar pneumonia, possibly secondary to aspiration.
Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is likely reactive, but if clinically warranted, a followup chest CT could be performed in three to six months to determine resolution.
Prominent main pulmonary artery, suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Moderately large hiatal hernia.
EKG: First degree heart block (PR214), Q in 3, TWF laterally and inferiorlly.
Expected interval evolution of bifrontal subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No significant change in blood products in the bilateral occipital horns.
Interval development of hypodensity in the bilateral inferior frontal lobes may represent edema, but acute infarct is not excluded.
Unchanged nondisplaced left temporal bone fracture with opacification of some of the mastoid air cells.
Ethmoid and sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening.
Multiple mildly dilated loops of small and large bowel with areas of bowel wall thickening and mesenteric edema are concerning for mesenteric ischemia, especially given the patient's cardiac history.
If there is increased clinical suspicion for ischemic bowel disease, a CTA of the abdomen could be considered.
A transition point at the proximal portion of the descending colon is present, but the proximal bowel pattern does not suggest a high grade obstruction.
Small perisplenic fluid collection.
Small pericardial effusion.
Post-traumatic changes with a right frontotemporal contusion,  demonstrating expected evolution since the prior study.
Areas of subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage also demonstrate expected evolution.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
Normal MRA of the head, without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, dissection, or aneurysm.
Distension of the proximal loops of small bowel with relative collapse of distal loops of small bowel and no definite transition point identified.
Abnormal configuration of several loops of small bowel in the left mid abdomen suggest tethering, but no transition point is seen at these regions.
Proximal celiac and SMA axes are widely patent and unremarkable with no intraluminal filling defects.
EEG: This telemetry showed a slow encephalopathic background throughout.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no prominent focal findings, but encephalopathies may obscure focal slowing.
By routine sampling or by automated detection programs, there were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
A tachycardia was noted.
LENI bilateral: Non-occlusive thrombus in the right common femoral vein extending into the proximal superficial femoral vein.
The proximal extent of clot is not visualized on this study.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Very small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo [**Month/Year (2) 15410**], consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Admission c/b intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and altered mental status.
Patient was initially withdrawing from alcohol, then it was unclear if his intracranial hemorrhages and initial head trauma had caused residual damage.
- Please note that patient does have a tendency to wax and wane, and still has evidence of frontal brain contusion on imaging - Continue to work with Physical and Occupational therapy as much as posible - Maintain sleep/wake cycle, manage symptoms (pain), re-orient frequently and encourage family at bedside .
The pain localized to patient's left elbow/forearm and xrays were unrevealing but an elbow effusion was found.
# DVT: Was found in patient's right lower extremity, which was felt to be contributing to his low grade fevers.
Patient had previously been anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation, reversed in the setting of his intracranial hemorrhages.
Patient was restarted on Coumadin on day of discharge - Continue heparin gtt (currently 3000 units/hour) with lower goal PTT 60-80 in setting of his intracranial hemorrhages - Continue Coumadin at 4mg daily.
It is important that patient get close (daily) PTT/INR checks as his goal INR should be lower, close to 2.0, in the setting of his head bleeds.
Serial EKG's showed borderline first degree AV block, which per his outpatient cardiologist, is what he exhibits when not in atrial fibrillation.
Patient had been on coumadin for atrial fibrillation for 4-5 years with several ablations.
Given his admission for cerebral contusion and multiple intracranial hemorrhages, his coumadin was initially stopped and his INR reversed with FFP and vitamin K. Patient's most recent ablation had been at [**Hospital6 1708**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2129-1-15**] (ph: [**0-0-**]).
He continued to be in Atrial Fibrillation throughout his hospital stay.
Also per their recommendations, his home Sotalol was held in the setting of recent INR reversal and risk of thromboembolic events with cardioversion from Sotalol.
Repeat ECHOs showed unchanged cardiac function and minimal pericardial effusion.
He should discuss with him the possibility of restarting Sotalol, using Metoprolol for better rate control, as he is anti-coagulated again.
Eventually, as he was weaned and extubated, patient became hypertensive and was relatively difficult to control.
- Continue Labetalol 800mg PO TID - Given stability of creatinine, can add Lisinopril if blood pressures are not well controlled - Continue to control gout pain with tylenol as needed .
# Respiratory Failure: Patient was initially intubated for desaturation and tachypnea.
He was later started on Vancomycin and completed a two week course for health-care acquired pneumonia given persistent fevers.
He did have two sputum samples positive for Coagulase Positive Staph Aureus and he is MRSA colonized.
# Acute Renal Insufficiency: Patient's creatinine bumped up to 3.3, etiology likely multifactorial (drug induced, pre-renal, etc).
# Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/Subdural Hematoma: Patient was followed by neurosurgery and initially on their service.
He underwent serial CT scans for worsening intracranial bleeds or new fractures, which were both negative.
Ultimately, patient's mental status improved dramatically and final CT scan on [**2-8**] showed continued signs of frontal brain contusion from his fall but no acute processes.
# EtOH: Patient started withdrawing from alcohol on [**1-23**], becoming diaphoretic, hypertensive and tachycardic.
# Communication: [**Doctor First Name **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 20250**] (children) .
