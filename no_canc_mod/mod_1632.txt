No joint effusion or subcutaneous gas.
[**2109-8-24**] CXR No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Unchanged mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci most likely indicates mild cerebral atrophy.
No new areas of consolidation are evident to suggest a site of active pulmonary infection.
[**2109-8-24**] EKG EKG: RRR, normal axis, rate in 80s, PR interval ~ 200 (borderline 1st degree block), Jpoint elevations on inf-lat leads unchanged from prior.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo male with multiple medical problems including DM 1 (>50yrs), CAD s/p LAD BMS and s/p LCx and RCA DES [**7-10**], CHF (diastolic), OSA requiring bipap, HLD, HTN, atrial septal defect, mitral regurg, Tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheobronchoplasty, hypothyroid, GERD/gastroparesis s/p Nissen '[**07**], recent penile implant and RTK replacement who comes in for AMS, hyperglycemia and right knee erythema concerning for infection .
# Hyperglycemia/DKA: on admission, pt's gluc was >500 and he had an anion gap of 15, however his bicarb was WNL and he had trace ketones and neg acetone in blood.
# Acute encephalopathy, metabolic, post-operative delirium: Per his wife he has had baseline short term memory loss, for which he has recently undergone neurocognitive testing at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) **].
So, possible due to post-op delerium.
Other etiologies contributing to his delirium including medications (opiates were used periprocedurally, witholding of his home psychotropic medications, hyperglycemia, fever, pain related to his knee surgery, and low TSH of 0.02.
CT head was negative for any acute intracranial process.
However, enlarged ventricles which were seen on prior study.
This is turn could be leading to progressive dementia since wife states that pt was having hard time adjusting when changing enviroment and seems more forgetful.
The patient also initially reported neck stiffness, but this was not evident by [**2109-5-25**] despite persistent waxing/ [**Doctor Last Name 688**] delirium, worse at night; LP was not obtained given very low clinical suspicion for meningitis.
On the night of [**2109-8-24**], he experienced sundowning, became very agitated and disorientated.
#Fever: pt on POD #4 from TKR, he has fever up to 102 overnight and he is high risk for infection given long term DM and poorly glycemic control.
These findings were concerning for surgical site infection, although this is quite early in the post-op course.
He was seen by orthopedic surgery, who felt that his  knee did not appear septic and that his symptoms were normal post-op.
Other infectious sources could possibly include pneumonia since he [**Last Name (un) **] coughing and had recent intubation; and gastroenteritis, since  he was complaining of pain on palpation on R quadrants and his abdomen was slightly distended, although soft.
His lactate was normal and he did not have leukocytosis.
CXR and KUB were negative for any intrathoracic or intraabdominal pathology.
Although there was no evidence of a clear source, the most likely candidate is soft tissue infection associated with his knee operation.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: pt with hx of diastolic HF with EF >60% on last Echo done in [**2105**].
JVD not elevated, sl crackles at base of lungs which clear with cough.
# Chronic kidney disease: Creatine at admission at 1.6, his baseline has been around 1.3-1.7 prior to the surgery.
He denied having any urinary complains and UA was negative except for glucose and trace ketones.
Pt received a total of 5L of fluid in the ED.
# Hyponatremia: Likely due to hyperglycemia.
# Hypothyroidism - Patient has a history of hypothyroidism with recent low TSH at <0.22.
# Bipolar Disease: Patient has a history of bipolar disease and as per wife has been well controlled except for "tardive dyskinesia".
Lamotrigine was continued, but seroquel and clonazepam were held in the setting of altered mental status.

Discharge Instructions: You have been admitted with delirium and fever due to an infection, likely a soft tissue infection related to your knee operation.
Please return to the emergency department or notify your physician if you experience any of the following: severe pain not relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased sensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5, shaking chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision site, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns.
You have been given medications for pain control.
As your pain decreases, take fewer tablets and increase the time between doses.
This medication can cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily and take a stool softener (such as colace) as needed to prevent this side effect.
Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken out by the visiting nurse (VNA) or rehab facility two weeks after your surgery.
Check wound regularly for signs of infection such as redness or thick yellow drainage.
VNA (once at home): Home PT/OT, dressing changes as instructed, wound checks, and staple removal at two weeks after surgery.
No strenuous exercise or heavy lifting until follow up appointment.
