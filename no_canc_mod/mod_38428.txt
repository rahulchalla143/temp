Per family, she has complained of feeling tired and increased urination but was otherwise well until 2 days prior to admission.
2 days ago, she began to feel lethargic She complained of feeling nauseated and lightheaded for one to 2 days with 2-3 episodes of nonbloody emesis, but no fever, headache, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, cough.
She initially presented to OSH, where CT torso and C-spine was completed which was notable for L1 burst fracture, but no evidence for pulmonary or abdominal infection or hemorrhage.
Labs were notable for leukocytosis 17, HCT 30.5, HCO3 20, normal liver enzymes and synthetic function, and cortisol (pending).
On arrival to the MICU,  she is oriented, pleasant and complaining of pain on movement.
She was admitted [**Last Name (un) 26512**] of gait disturbance, weakness and a progressive inability to care for self.
A CT scan apparently revealed cirrhosis and varices that were also (apparently) seen on ultrasound.
A murmur was investigated by TTE with 60%EF and no valvular abnormalities detected.
Past Medical History: ETOH cirrhosis - possibly decompensated with encephalopathy during possibly etoh hepatitis.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, jet of mild to moderate ([**12-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o w/cirrhosis, presents with nausea, vomitting and syncope, and persistent bradycardia and hypotension .
ACTIVE ISSUES #) Hypotension and bradycardia:  While the patient had no signs of end organ failure, hypotension and bradycardia were concerning.
The etiology for hypotension and bradycardia is thought primarily medication induced, especially nadolol.
The patient also had signs and laboratory findings suggesting of sepsis, notably the bandemia.
However the patient remained afebrile while here, and was generally fluid responsive.
Pt had an TTE, which did not show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, or ongoing ischemia, nor were her laboratory results.
Her BP and bradycardia resolved after a short period of pressor support.
- Held patient's nadolol.
We think this is the major culprit of her hypotension and bradycardia.
# L1 burst fracture - no neurological compromise, evaluated by orthopedics, patient to be braced.
Patient's pain was controlled with a combination of long acting and short acting oxycodone.
# Cirrhosis: Cirrhosis was a relatively recent diagnosis.
Likely decompensated in [**2178**] with encephalopathy during a mild etoh hepatitis in the setting of profound hypokalemia related either to hypomagnesemia of etoh or HCTZ.
There is a mention of varices on CT/US, was on lactulose though briefly, on aldactone/furosemide though no mention of ascites.
# HTN - holding meds as above .
Anemia - around her baseline - trend per routine .
CHRONIC ISSUES # Thrombocytpoenia: At baseline, multifactorial, including alcohol abuse, cirrhosis and poHTN.
# Gastritis - started on PPI .
# Depression - continued celexa 10 mg. .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] House Nursing Home - [**Location 9583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: L1 burst fracture Hypotension Bradycardia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**],  You came to our hospital for weakness and a recent fall.
You were found to have a low blood pressure and low heart rate, the likely cause of most of your symptoms.
We initially started you on antibiotics, but later stopped these as we did not feel you had an infection.
Imaging studies also showed that you had a fracture in your spine.
We started you on medication for pain control.
