She nearly died as a result of hemodynamic instability during this procedure  She was extubated in the OR and transfered to the PACU in critical condition.
In the interim, her left foot has became severely ischemic and partially nonviable with demarcation of her temperature level at about the level of the knee joint.
Because of her very tenuous medical status, she was advised to have an above-the-knee amputation.
Because of previous operation, it was felt that she was not to be a candidate for further vascular reconstruction.
She was pre-op'd for the below procedure  [**5-23**] - Left above-the-knee amputation.
There were no intra-op complications.
