Admission Date:  [**2117-4-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-6-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-1-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in patient with recurrent falls secondary to primary progressive MS   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture G-tube Intubation/extubation   History of Present Illness: 59 yo man with MS initially admitted with left basal ganglia hemorrhage, then developed hemorrhage on the right side with persistent encephalopathy, now with elevated wbc count and bilateral obturator muscle abscess who is being transferred to the medicine service from the MICU for overnight monitoring for hypotension/tachycardia and concern for sepsis.
Hospital course: Initially admitted on [**2117-4-15**] with recurrent falls and found to have bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhages.
Prior to the admission he had been feeling unwell for 3-4 days with increase in baseline cough, increased urinary frequency, and dysuria, worsening lower extremity weakness, and falls while attempting transfer from wheelchair to bed.
He has had persistent encephalopathy (of multifactorial etiology, pna/uti/nite-day cycle reversal.
On [**5-17**] he was transferred to the MICU for hypotension and an elevated wbc count (21).
The fever workup was most notable for an abdominal CT which revealed a fluid collection in the bilateral obturator muscles, for which he underwent an IR guided biopsy on [**5-26**].
This was switched to linezolid and zosyn  but he developed a rash and eosinophilia and was switched back to levo/flagyl on [**5-21**].
He was continuing to remain stable with an unclear etiology for the obturator abscesses, when on [**6-2**] he became hypotensive to the 80's systolic and sinus tachycardia to the 130's-140's.
His labs that day were also notable for an increase in the WBC from 10 to 23.
He was given 2 L NS on the floor, with an improvement of his BP to 98 systolic and persistent tachycardia to 120's.
In the MICU, his abx were broadened to po Vanc (to cover for cdiff), Aztreonam, Linezolid (given h/o MRSA PNA), and levo/flagyl.
He continues to have asymptomatic sinus tachycardia into the 110's-120's.
Past Medical History: PMH: -primary progressive MS, dx 99 with oligoclonal bands, white matter changes, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (neuro) -hx of ?
Wheelchair-bound at baseline but able to transfer  Family History: Unremarkable for neurologic disease.
No masses or LAD.
No thyromegaly.
No carotid bruits.
No rebound or guarding.
Able to recite days of week forwards but only gets to Thursday when going backwards.
Speech fluent with fair comprehension and repetition.
Naming impaired for low frequency items.
No paraphasic errors.
No apraxia, no neglect.
Spastic tone in lower extremities.
Right pronator drift.
Bilateral foot drop.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is a small oval hyperdensity seen within the left putamen with surrounding lucency likely indicating intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of blood within the ventricles or elsewhere within the parenchyma.
IMPRESSION: Small ovoid hyperdensity in the left putamen with surrounding lucency, likely representing intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
No mass effect or other areas of hemorrhage.
No hydrocephalus.
Recent outside films with similar findings were reviewed with neurology team.
Allowing for slight differences in contrast phase from the prior CT, these appear unchanged in size and in overall appearance.
There is no gas within the collections and no destruction of the adjacent osseous structures to suggest osteomyelitis.
Mildly prominent prostate again noted.
The descending sigmoid colon and the rectum are again seen to be distended with air and stool.
No pathologic pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is identified.
There is no free fluid within the pelvis.
No foci of air are seen within these collections.
There is no evidence of adjacent bone destruction to suggest osteomyelitis.
2) Small hypodense lesion in the left lobe of the liver likely a simple cyst but too small to characterize.
3) Bibasilar atelectasis and small bullae at the right lung base.
4) Extensive stool throughout the rectum and colon.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59 y/o male with history of multiple sclerosis, initially admitted to the neurology service when found to have bilateral basal gangila hemorrhages, and then transferred to the medicine service when found to have persistent fevers and subsequently bilateral obturator abscesses of unknown etiology.
# ID - While in-house developed fever and leukocytosis; CT torso oddly demonstrated collection at L obturator internus muscle; attempt at US-guided aspiration of this area was unsuccessful on [**5-14**].
Empiric therapy with cipro/flagyl helped WBC and fevers somewhat; interval reimaging 5 days later demonstrated collection that was a few mm smaller.
Antibiotics were held in an attempt to obtain optimal cultures&#8212;at which time he developed hypotension and spent a few days in ICU though did not require pressors.
T remained 98-99s but he had persistent WBC 18-21, with eosinophilia as high as 20%, so was placed on levo/flagyl in case beta-lactam sensitivity was contributing.
He developed marked skin erythema of the lower extremities with skin peeling and large, tense blisters of the feet.
There are a few little chest lesions though not enough to explain leukocytosis.
On [**5-25**], pt underwent repeat CT scn of the Pelvis which revealed bilateral peripherally enhancing fluid collections tracking beneath the fascia of the obturator internus muscle bilaterally, tracking from its origin anteriorly along the surface of the obturator membrane to its insertion posteriorly along the medial surface of the greater trochanter of the femur.
On [**5-26**], he underwent CT guided drainage of the right abscess which yielded 10cc of blood and pus sent to the lab for cultures.
The abscess culture grew out Bacteroides fragilis.
The patient was continued on levo/flagyl with improvement in fevers and leukocytosis.
However, on [**6-3**], the patient suddenly developed hypotension and leukocytosis (10 to 24), requiring transfer to ICU for goal-directed therapy, including fluids and broad spectrum antibiotcs of levo/flagyl/linezolid/po vanc (tolerated well)/aztreonam.
Cx at that time demonstrated a dirty u/a, with pseudomonas in the urine only sensitive to Tobramycin.
He responded to the antibiotics with stable vital signs, defervescene, and resolution of the leukocytosis.
# Intracranial hemorrhage - Head CT performed at [**Hospital1 18**] was consistent with a left basal ganglia bleed.
On initial neurological exam, mental status exam was notable for inattention.
MRI was performed and although limited by motion artifact, revealed no evidence of underlying mass.
There, he initially did well, but had an episode of decreased responsiveness which prompted a repeat CT of the head.
This revealed a new right basal ganglia hemorrhage.
However, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed and ruled out cardiac valvular vegetations as a source of embolus.
In addition, a CT venogram of the head was performed and ruled out venous sinus thrombosis as a cause.
His blood pressures have remained stable off of antihypertensives, which were discontinued due to his hypotension during sepsis episodes.
If his pressures increase again, he should be restarted on an antihypertensive to keep SBP<140.
# Hypercalcemia - Patient was noted to have hypercalcemia while in-house with serum Ca in the high 10's-low 11's.
PTH, vitamin D levels, and 24-hour urine were all consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism - elevated PTH, elevated serum Ca, normal vitamin D levels, and urine Ca>300.
Endocrine was consulted in-house for recommendations for management.
They recommended IVF and increasing free H20 boluses in TF, which was done.
The patient, as he is asymptomatic and stable serum calcium for over a month, should follow with an outpatient endocrinologist by calling the number included in the paperwork in the next 1-2 weeks.
Encephalopathy/MRSA pneumonia - On the floor, he remained agitated and encephalopathic, with poor attention that worsened at night and improved substantially during the day.
The initial workup was negative for toxic-metabolic or infectious etiologies.
At admission, he had an elevated CPK as well as BUN/Creatinine - for this early rhabdomyolysis, he was treated with IVF and this improved.
The patient was transferred to MICU, however, after found to have hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia and possible mucus plugging.
He was intubated temporarily and a couple of days after intubation, he was extubated without difficulty.
However, due to papulomacular, blanching rash which developed after vancomycin, vancomycin was discontinued on [**4-28**] and started on linezolid, which was continued for a 10 day course.
For left basal ganglial hemorrhage and mental status changes, the patient underwent IR guided LP which was negative for HSV and negative CSF cx for meningitis.
The patient was intermittently hypotensive in the unit thought to be secondary to infection and responded well to IVF boluses.
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out with a negative cosyntropin stimulation test.
Abdominal CT demonstrated possible left obturator internus muscle abscess, but attempted drainage by IR could not aspirate fluid.
Anemia/Guaiac positive stool: The patient does have guaiac postive stools and Hct dropped to 19 at one point in the MICU thought to be secondary to fluids, requiring 2 units of PRBCs, however, no urgent scope was felt necessary and CT of abdomen did not reveal any hematoma.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Hypertension: As above, the pt was found to be hypertensive after his second intracranial hemorrhage.
If he becomes hypertensive again, these meds can be restarted for a goal of SBP<140.
# Sinus tachycardia - patient has been in sinus tachycardia into the 110's for the last few weeks of his course, of unclear etiology.
A CT was negative for PE, EKG negative for ischemic changes.
Patient was rehydrated with IVF and treated appropriately for his infections.
Unlikely this is secondary to infection as he is afebrile and on antibiotics.
Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itchiness.
