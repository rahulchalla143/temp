Admission Date:  [**2128-5-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-5-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-11-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old man with a complicated past medical history including congenital heart disease, chronic AF s/p AV ablation, on coumadin and worsening systolic and diastolic heart failure who presents with shortness of breath, fever and chills.
For the past week at home he has had cold symptoms including nasal congestion and cough.
Today he had worsening dyspnea, new fever and malaise, so he called his PCP who referred him to the ER for further evaluation.
A CXR was done that showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with a small RLL consolidation that was read as atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
He was given ceftriaxone, levofloxacin and 2L NS (given his elevated lactate) and admitted to the ICU for further management.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Chronic atrial fibrillation, AV ablation, failed amiodarone,  on warfarin.
Systolic and diastolic heart failure with LVEF of 45-50%.
Worsening right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
PEA/V-fib arrest in the past secondary to enterococcal bacteremia, endocarditis.
Chronic kidney disease.
He is a businessman who liquidates retail stores   Family History: His mother died of coronary artery disease.
His grandmother died of some cancer at the age of 98.
His father died of colon cancer at the age of 68.
Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, slight crackles at bases, no wheezing, egophony at right base ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
A left-sided AICD is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right ventricle and coronary sinus.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.
Subtle right base opacity is seen, which may relate to atelectasis, although early pneumonia is not entirely excluded.
ECHO The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) due primarily to right ventricular predominance and interventricular dependence resulting in dyssynergic interventricular septal displacement, rather than actual contractile dysfunction of the left ventricular myocardium.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
Labs at discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: 68 y/o M with a complicated cardiac past medical history who presents with dyspnea, rigors and chills after a week of cold symptoms, found to have a possible RLL PNA on CXR.
#) Hypoxia: CXR with possible RLL infiltrate, patient has clinical symptoms of pneumonia including cough and fever so was presumptively treated for CAP with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 5 day course (completed in hospital and patient did not have fevers for 4 days prior to discharge) However, CXR findings and elevated BNP also concerning for pulmonary vascular congestion, which could have been exacerbated by the 2L of IVF given in the ER and dietary indiscretions recently.
His weights showed a decrease from admission weight of 237 --> 235 on discharge (likely error due to different scales as patient was diuresed net 5L on this admission).
He was markedly less short of breath on discharge.
Appeared hypervolemic on exam with significant ascites and some lower extremity edema.
BNP elevated above any prior measurements in our system and CXR with mild pulmonary congestion are both consistent with heart failure.
Mildly elevated lactate that resolved during hospital admission; hyaline casts and BUN:Cr ratio were felt due to poor forward flow from acute HF, not volume depletion - this resolved with diuresis also.
On leaving the MICU, it was felt that the patient may benefit from right heart cath to evaluate atrial pressures.
Creatinine also improved during hospitalization with diuresis, suggestive of passive congestion component to his impaired renal function.
It was unclear on this admission whether he should be placed on an ACE-i for heart failure (given his increased creatinine) and whether he should be placed on an aspirin (given that he does not have previous CAD).
Pneumonia: Patient completed a 5-day course of levaquin (3 doses q48hrs given renal function) and was not discharged on antibiotics.
He had been afebrile for 4 days prior to discharge.
?5mg T,Th,Sun and 7.5mg M,W,F,Sat Ambien as needed for sleep calcium with vitamin D multivitamin daily.
