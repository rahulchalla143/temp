Admission Date:  [**2166-3-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-3-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2100-7-16**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease with chronic chest pain at home and a normal cardiac catheterization in [**2163**] was at her regularly scheduled [**Hospital 8183**] clinic appointment this morning when she reportedly became diaphoretic and collapsed.
Per anesthesia, the patient was blue without respirations or pulse.
The patient was intubated with spontaneous regeneration of pulse, sinus tachycardia with a rate in the 120s.
Electrocardiogram showed a new left bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray showed diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities.
Head CT:  No acute ICH, question of an old infarct.
Catheterization laboratory pressures were mildly elevated.
During the catheterization, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 70s, and she was started on dopamine and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further care.
Coronary artery disease, question of myocardial infarction in [**2163**], [**2164**] in [**Location (un) 4708**] per daughter.
Angina, status post catheterization [**2163**] with an ejection fraction of 40-45%, clean coronaries, anteroseptal hypokinesis, status post echocardiogram in [**2163**], 1+ mitral regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction 55%.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Urinalysis just showed large glucose and moderate blood.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.
Persistent pulmonary edema, progressive, left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation on the second chest x-ray.
Head CT:  No acute ICH.
Possible subacute or chronic infarct, 2 cm round partial lobe, chronic left cerebral periventricular infarction.
Jugular venous distention difficult to assess secondary to neck line.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
Pulmonary:  Breath sounds equal bilateral, crackles at base, no wheeze.
Abdomen:  Obese, soft, hypoactive bowel sounds.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 65-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension and a history of angina with essentially normal echocardiogram and catheterization in [**2163**] who collapsed this morning at an Ophthalmology appointment.
Echocardiogram in Emergency Department showed an ejection fraction of 25%, clean coronaries on catheterization and mildly elevated filling pressures and congestive heart failure on chest x-ray.
Unclear etiology of arrest/pulmonary edema versus arrhythmia versus primary respiratory versus neurological cause.
She did have an elevated sedimentation rate possibly indicative of this stunned myocardium after her arrest.
Initially febrile with increased white blood cell count.
Sputum cultures grew gram positive cocci.
Her metformin was discontinued secondary to a poor ejection fraction.
She will need follow-up with her primary care physician and endocrinologist for further management of her diabetes.
