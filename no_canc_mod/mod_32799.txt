Unchanged comminuted fracture through the body of the left mandible and right mandible with linear fracture extending along the right mandibular angle.
Persistent opacity of the left maxillary sinus, ethmoidal air cells and sphenoid sinus.
3D rendered reconstructions demonstrate the right mandibular angle comminuted and multiple bone fragments.
CTA head - IMPRESSION: 1) Oblique coronal trajectory to a gunshot wound entering through the body of the left mandible anterolaterally and impacting on the posterior body of the right mandible with linear fracture components extending to the angle.
There are extensive bone and metal fragments and a large bullet fragment noted in the floor of the mouth.
3) Though no injury of the right facial artery is seen, that is difficult to exclude given the extensive adjacent metal and bone fragments.
5) No intracranial or orbital injury.
Findings consistent with aspiration.
Right main stem bronchus intubation with left lower lobe collapse.
Simple free fluid in the right paracolic gutter, Morison's pouch, and lower pelvis without evidence of solid organ injury.
Probable benign bone lesion in the right scapula.
He was then taken to the Trauma ICU where he remained sedated and on the ventilator for several days.
Plastic surgery was urgently consulted for profuse bleeding noted from right gunshot wound site, by the time they arrived the active bleeding had stopped.
The wound was explored locally and then packed with Surgicel and covered with a dry sterile wrap.
On [**9-14**] he was evaluated by Speech and Swallow for Passy Muir valve, he was unable to tolerate this and further evaluation was deferred until his mental status improved.
On [**9-15**] he was taken to the operating room by OMFS for surgical debridement, exploration and open reduction, internal fixation of severely comminuted fracture of mandible with jaw wiring.
