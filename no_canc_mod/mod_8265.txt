Admission Date:  [**2106-11-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-11-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2037-6-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17813**] Chief Complaint: seizures  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation [**2106-11-5**] Extubation [**2106-11-7**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 69yo M with a history of seizure disorder recently controlled on lamictal and tegretol, multiple CVAs and history of SDH x 2, prostate CA, MDD, poor swallowing function and history of aspiration PNA, questionable history of HTN who presents as an ED to ED transfer following at least three witnessed seizures at home and in the outside ED without intervening returning to baseline.
This morning, at 3AM, he was found in bed following one of his usual generalized seizure spells with his head turning to the left, both arms and legs shaking as well as loss of consciousness.
The neurologist in the ED left a consultant note in his chart, the pertinents of which are as follows: - He was not "responsive" to 1g of IV keppra - He was noted on exam to have a right sided spastic posturing of the upper extremity, constant opsoclonus, no spontaneous movements or myoclonus, occasional roving eye movements, as well as an upgoing toe on the left.
He has not been suffering from fevers, chills, change in consciousness, new changes in strength, etc.
Past Medical History:  The patient's past history includes a first stroke occurring 7 years ago, presenting predominantly as leg weakness, but he apparently got back to baseline without difficulties.
Four  to five years ago, he had a second stroke with prominent right hemiparesis, which also resolved.
He went on to have two subdural hematoma evacuations with the most recent one      presenting with left upper extremity weakness.
Three years ago, he went on to have what sounds like a more prominent stroke consisting of right hemiparesis and aphasia.
Aside from the strokes and subdural hematomas as outlined above, he has periods of depression, gastroparesis, prostate cancer, being hard of hearing, as well as having some unclear abdominal surgery for a difficult to access colon polyp.
They do not give me a history of seizures in the setting of pneumonia, although he has weak swallow function and has had problems with aspiration PNA in the past.
At baseline, he is completely dependent on his wife for all ADLs.
He has an expressive aphasia and is not particularly verbal, but does understand simple commands and questions, and can show a thumbs up sign, respond to simple questions, etc.

10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or          Lactobacillus sp.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..          Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or          Lactobacillus sp.
Mild bibasilar opacities are seen, right greater than left, which could relate to aspiration though an early infectious process cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Mild bibasilar, right greater than left, subtle opacities may relate to aspiration or possible pulmonary vascular engorgement although underlying infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2106-11-5**] 7:58 PM FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, midline shift, acute mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
There are large areas of hypodensity/encephalomalacia in the bilateral MCA distribution, suggesting remote infarction/insult.
Prominence of the sulci and ventricles likely related to age-related parenchymal loss as well as secondary effect from remote infarcts.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Extensive hypodensities in the bilateral MCA distributions suggesting remote infarcts/insults.
Hypodensity in the left cerebellum also likely from prior infract.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2106-11-6**] 12:28 PM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute infarct identified.
There are chronic bilateral middle cerebral artery infarcts identified with extensive cystic encephalomalacia and T2 hyperintensities.
Following gadolinium, no abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen.
Chronic left cerebellar infarcts are also seen.
There is moderate ventriculomegaly likely ex vacuo due to chronic infarcts.
There is no evidence of chronic or acute blood products.
Postoperative changes are seen in the right parietal region.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct.
Bilateral middle cerebral artery chronic infarcts.
No enhancing brain lesions.
No mass effect or hydrocephalus.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2106-11-7**] 4:38 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-5**], there are bibasilar opacifications, more prominent on the right, that appear to be mildly increased.
Asymmetric pulmonary vascular congestion would also be a possible cause for this appearance.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2106-11-9**] 3:59 AM MPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-7**] and 28:  A largely dependent pulmonary edema is mild to moderate, but increased since [**11-8**].
Bilateral infrahilar consolidation is generally due to atelectasis, but pneumonia is not excluded.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
No pneumothorax.
Cardiology: ECG	Study Date of [**2106-11-5**]  7:43:04 PM  Normal sinus rhythm with ventricular bigeminy.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Slight ST segment elevation seen in lead V6 is likely a normal variant at this patient's age.
Non-ventricular beats appear similar on both tracings.
Neurophysiology: EEG	Study Date of [**2106-11-5**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to diffuse slowing of background consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
Potential causes include but are not limited to sedative medication effect and metabolic, hypoxic or infectious disturbances.
There were occasional sharp transients in the parietal regions but no definite epileptiform discharges.
No electrographic seizures were present in the record.
EEG	Study Date of [**2106-11-6**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of diffuse background slowing more apparent in the first few hours of recording indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
Potential causes include but are not limited to sedative medication effect, and metabolic, toxic or hypoxic disturbances.
However, multifocal subcortical structural lesions cannot be ruled out as they may mimic the pattern of encephalopathy.
In addition, background was asymmetric with more slowing and lower voltage on the right consistent with an underlying subcortical dysfunction.
After 17:00, frequent semi-periodic sharp waves appeared in the left central parietal region with no further evolution to electrographic seizures consistent with an underlying epileptogenic focus.
EEG	Study Date of [**2106-11-7**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of diffuse background slowing indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
Potential causes include but are not limited to sedative medication effect, and metabolic, toxic or hypoxic disturbances.
However, multifocal subcortical structural lesions cannot be ruled out as they may mimic the pattern of encephalopathy.
Also, multifocal subcortical structural lesions cannot be ruled out as they may mimic the pattern of encephalopathy.
In addition, background was asymmetric with more slowing and lower voltage on the right consistent with an underlying subcortical dysfunction.
Throughout the recording, frequent semi-rhythmic sharp waves appeared in the left central parietal region with no evolution into electrographic seizures.
This finding is indicative of a highly active underlying epileptogenic focus.

Brief Hospital Course: 69yo M with PMH of seizure disorder, multiple strokes with residual severe neurological deficit with bilateral hemiparesis right worse than left and severe aphasia and history of SDH x 2, prostate CA, MDD, poor swallowing and h/o aspiration PNA, HTN who was transferred from OSH after having at least three witnessed seizures at home and three seizures in OSH ED without intervening return regaining consciousness.
He was found to have a UTI on U/A which later grew enterococcus and was started on IV Ceftriaxone.
He was also found to have right greater than left bibasal opacities on CXR in keeping with  possible aspiration pneumonia.
CT head revealed extensive hypodensities in the bilateral MCA distributions in keeping with his old infarcts in addition to a hypodensity in the left cerebellum also likely from prior infract.
He went on to have an MRI which revealed no acute infarct.
He was monitored on EEG telemetry from [**Date range (1) 35176**] and although this showed slowing in keeping with previous sizeable bilateral MCA infarcts in addition to semi-rhythmic sharp waves in the left central parietal region in keeping with a seizure focus but there were no seizures present either clinically or electrographically.
He initially had an NG tube due to poor swallow and latterly passed S&S assessment and was started on pureed solids and thin liquids which he tolerated well although is at chronic risk for aspiration.
He was changed to oral augmentin for his UTI/aspiration pneumonia on [**11-11**] and will continue this to complete a 10 day course finishing on [**2106-11-14**].
He was assessed by PT who found his pivoting ability was poor and per the preference of his wife was discharged home on [**2106-11-12**] with a [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] lift and services of [**Name (NI) 269**], PT and home health aide.
