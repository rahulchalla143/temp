Recent admission in [**2196-1-27**], with maroon stool and found to have the incarcerated parastomal hernia and status post colectomy and ileostomy.
The patient also had a recent admit on [**2196-2-27**], with urinary tract infection and was sent to rehabilitation and then readmitted in [**2196-3-26**], with decreased p.o.
's, feculent emesis and also found to have prerenal failure and urinary tract infection of that improved significantly with hydration.
The patient also has a past medical history of severe depression and question of Parkinsonism.
A Chem 7 at rehabilitation revealed a hyperkalemia to 7.
She soon recovered respiration and pulse but remained unresponsive and arrived at the [**Hospital6 1760**] EW without a pulse.
The patient also became hypotensive to a blood pressure of 69 and she was given four to five liters of normal saline as a fluid rehydration.
During this CPR, the patient had various runs of brady and tachy cardias, all with wide complex QRS.
Ulcerative colitis.
Parastomal hernia, status post emergent colectomy for incarceration.
Type II diabetes mellitus 6.
Orthostatic hypotension.
Urinary tract infections.
Multiple cardiac catheterizations at outside hospitals reporting clean coronary arteries.
Avandia 8 q d.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE MICU:  Blood pressure, 116/39; pulse, 146; 87% with a poor wave form.
She was rehydrated aggressively with normal saline and her electrolytes abnormalities self-corrected as well as her renal failure.
Anicteric sclera.
Neck, no jugular venous distention.
S2, soft systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Old ostomy site was clean, dry and intact.
The new ostomy bag showed dark stool.
Abdomen was nontender, nondistended with no organomegaly.
Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There was a tremor of initiation greater on the right than left side.
Hematocrit, 25, down from 38 and stabilized at 25, status post large volume hydration.
Electrocardiogram, initially on admission, showed sinus rhythm with prolonged PR of 224; prolonged QRS of 142; large R wave in V1 and V2 with poor R wave progression and T wave depressions V1 through V5 that were new.
On [**2196-5-11**], the patient had an electrocardiogram with slow atrial flutter with ventricular rate that was irregular at 25 beats per minute with peak T waves.
Renal ultrasound done showed kidneys of 10 and 11 cm with no hydronephrosis.
A chest x-ray, initially on admission, showed perihilar haziness consistent with mild congestive heart failure and on the next day, [**2196-5-12**], showed improved congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 75 year old female with ileostomy and multiple abdominal surgeries, depression, who is admitted with acute renal failure leading to hyperkalemia and acidosis leading to cardiac arrest.
The patient improved dramatically with rehydration with correction of her renal failure and electrolyte abnormalities after less than 24 hours of rehydration.
and also had some large ostomy output and became gradually dehydrated, leading to prerenal failure and subsequent hyperkalemia/acidosis.
Renal - Prerenal/Acute renal failure in the setting of dehydration secondary to poor p.o.
's and large ostomy output likely.
The renal failure rapidly corrected with intravenous hydration and was stable throughout the remainder of the admission.
Cardiology - The patient was status post PEA arrest in the setting of acidosis and hyperkalemia of 8.9.
After correction of her potassium and acidosis and intravenous hydration, the patient was revived and remained stable for the remainder of the hospitalization.
Electrophysiologic - The patient had one episode of atrial fibrillation, status post her cardiac arrest that was electrically cardioverted.
Pump - The patient had some mild congestive heart failure after her PEA arrest that was likely due to pump dysfunction corrected status post resumed sinus rhythm.
She has no further episodes of congestive heart failure.
Regarding the Troponin, this is most likely secondary to cardiac arrest and electrocardioversion and resolved after these interventions.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition - The patient, on admission, had severe hyperkalemia secondary to acute renal failure that was corrected upon admission with calcium, Insulin, intravenous fluid hydration and resolution of her acute renal failure.
She also had an anion gap acidosis likely also secondary to her acute renal function and also resolve after intravenous fluid hydration and bicarbonate issued during the code.
The patient has a history of poor p.o.
intake that is likely secondary to her depression.
Gastrointestinal - The patient has had multiple gastrointestinal surgeries in the past for colon cancer and herniated parastomal hernia and has from 200 to 250 cm of small bowel left as per her latest Operative Note.
She likely has some increased ostomy output from short bowel syndrome.
However, her ins and outs during this hospitalization have not been consistent with large ostomy output.
Dermatologic - The patient had ecchymotic areas on her right forearm.
The largest had bullous bullae overlying.
The lesions have been stable throughout the hospitalization and currently do not show any signs of infection or worsening.
Question as to whether these lesions were due to hypotensive episodes during her code versus pressure on her arm during the code versus any type of embolic event.
Depression - The patient's mood was noted to be better during this admission by the Geriatrics Fellow who knows the patient from the last admission.
She had no signs of blood loss and has guaiac negative stool.
It is likely that she has some degree of anemia of chronic disease.
She has not had a high ostomy output here while an inpatient.
Acute renal failure.
