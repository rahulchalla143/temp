No pneumothorax is identified.
The lung volume is small with continued slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
[**12-23**] KUB: No evidence for small-bowel obstruction.
If of clinical concern, would repeat examination.
Distended gallbladder likely containing gallstones or sludge without evidence for cholecystitis.
No evidence for intra-abdominal or intrapelvic bowel abnormality including colitis or diverticulitis.
Diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.
Low-density lesions within the liver and bilateral kidneys likely representing cysts.
[**12-23**] EGK: Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular response, rate approximately 115.
Inferior myocardial infarction.
Non-diagnostic T wave flattening in the lateral leads.
[**12-25**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation Old inferior infarct Low QRS voltages in precordial leads Since last ECG, ventricular response slower .
Patchy atelectasis unchanged, no infiltrates.
Renal Ultrasound [**12-29**]: The left kidney measures 13.7 cm.
There is no evidence of perinephric fluid or abscess.
In the left kidney there are multiple subcentimeter simple cysts along with a large 3.5 x 3.7 x 4.2 cm simple cyst seen in the mid to lower pole.
The bladder is full and unremarkable   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo gentleman with CAD, CHF, ?COPD, A. Fib/flutter admitted with E.coli sepsis and rapid atrial fibrillation.
Initially the patient was doing very well on the floor, sitting in chair [**Location (un) 1131**], heart rate well controlled on digoxin only (sotalol held in setting of relative hypotension on admission).
Overnight, patient spiked temp to 101.6 and went into rapid A. fib with rates in 140s, BP 100/67, given IV diltiazem 10 mg x 2 then 30 mg PO with persistent elevation in HR ranging 120-130s.
The patient was transferred back to the MICU for management of his rapid A.fib and sepsis.
Patient remained his blood pressures, no evidence of septic shock.
He required IV diltiazem in ED for rapid rate.
Patient later went into rapid afib the same evening in setting of fever spike requiring IV diltiazem.
Patient is now afebrile x several days, WBC was generally trending down from admission 18->12 but later increased to >20 in setting of gouty flare and in setting of increases steroids.
Renal son[**Name (NI) **] was also performed to r/out any other potential source such as a perinephric abscess, this was negative.
Of note, patient developed one episode of diarrhea on [**12-30**] which resolved spontaneously.
His stool is negative for C.diff and he has not had any abdominal pain/discomfort to date.
Of note, the patient was also started on prednisone for presumed COPD and due to ongoing wheezing.
He is discharged on 20 mg of prednisone for COPD and concomitant gouty flare.
Patient also received a 5 day course of Azithromycin for presumed COPD exacerbation.
Likely prerenal secondary to volume depletion from vomiting/diarrhea, was fluid resuscitated in MICU and later diuresed on the floor.
Currently patient appears euvolemic with trace pedal edema.
CAD/CHF: Patient has a depressed EF on echo in [**2121**], %EF not reported.
Upon initial transfer to floor the patient appeared fluid overloaded s/p fluid resuscitation in MICU.
Patient had elevated JVP, 2+ pitting edema, wheezing with crackles.
Question of subendocardial ischemia in setting of hypotension based on subtle EKG changes in ST-T segments.
BNP elevated on admission as well.
He is currently not on an ACEI (defer to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] his PCP and cardiologist), likely because he does not have a depressed EF.
He developed a gouty attack in his right foot on [**12-29**] and then in his left elbow on [**12-31**].
He was not treated with Colchicine which he has taken in the past due to one episode of diarrhea and the potential to cause stomach upset with this medication.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
E. coli sepsis 2.
Rapid atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Good - breathing comfortably, afebrile, heart rate well controlled   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as directed  Please ensure that you follow up with your primary care doctor (see below) as indicated by his PCP.
