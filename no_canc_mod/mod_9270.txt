The patient episodes of chest pain.
There was no evidence that she might be having active myocardial ischemia.
congestive heart failure, as evidenced by x-ray and continuous crackles on examination.
Our approach to this condition was to initially try to replete intravascular volume with normal saline but then try to remove some of the total fluid overload by giving intravenous Bumex.
Our decision to pursue this approach was particularly afforded by her electrolytes which showed contraction alkalosis and hyponatremia which was pointing towards severe intravascular volume depletion.
The patient is believed to be in acute renal failure, as a result of aggressive diuresis and contracture alkalosis.
Once we had an improvement in her creatinine, from starting at 2.6 to about 1.9, we decided that she should be restarted on her Captopril as this medication is particularly beneficial for her congestive heart failure.
Mild increase in creatinine would be expected and would not be particularly worrisome.
The patient has been complaining of a significant amount of leg pain.
This can be a combination of significant edema from congestive heart failure, combined with osteo insufficiency from iliac thrombi and multiple procedures.
Her pain can be further exacerbated by extensive pedal immobility secondary to sick, complicated hospitalization.
Pain is well controlled with Percocet and Neurontin.
There is no evidence of current vascular compromise.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 25%.
