EKG:  SR @70, NL axis approx 0 degress, NL intervals, peaked T waves present previously but mildly increased in anterior leads .
CXR [**1-18**]: Since examination of [**2173-11-29**], there has been interval improvement in moderate pulmonary interstitial edema, though mild interstitial pulmonary edema persists, as manifested by prominence of the interstitial markings and redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature.
Trace left pleural effusion.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-8-14**], no major change is evident.

The LAD ahd diffuse disease, especially in teh mid segment up to 70%.
The LCX had mild diffuse disease.
The RCA had a 90% hazy lesion in the mid vessel which was diffusely diseased and calcified.

Successful placement of two overlapping Vision bare metal stents in proximal RCA with considerable difficulty and effort (3.0 x 12 mm distally and 3.0 x 8 mm proximally).
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
TTE [**2174-1-19**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-11-23**], mitral regurgitation is now more prominent, the right ventricle is now larger and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
CXR [**2174-1-18**] FINDINGS: Since examination of [**2173-11-29**], there has been interval improvement in moderate pulmonary interstitial edema, though mild interstitial pulmonary edema persists, as manifested by prominence of the interstitial markings and redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature.
Trace left pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Stable appearance of cardiomediastinal silhouette demonstrates moderate cardiomegaly, atherosclerotic calcification and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Multilevel degenerative change of the thoracolumbar spine is noted with marginal osteophytic formation.
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, improved since [**2173-11-29**].
There is no associated hydronephrosis.
On color Doppler, there is adequate perfusion of the renal transplant.
Views of the urinary bladder show a urinary catheter within the urinary bladder, which is empty.
There are no perinephric collections.
Further increase in resistive indices, possibly due to rejection.
There is no evidence of acute cellular or humoral rejection in this sample.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo woman with CAD s/p stent and restent in [**2163**] and [**2170**], IDDM, HTN, HLD, h/o renal transplant who presents with DOE.
# Dyspnea/acute on chronic diastolic CHF: With mild elevation in weight here, no associated symptoms, and elevated BNP, as well as CXR findings, concerning for acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation.
In the setting of worsened forward flow this would account for both dyspnea and acute on chronic renal failure.
With immunosuppression, and recent CT lung findings of ground glass, concerning for opportunistic infection or lymphoproliferative d/o causing a primary pulmonary process.
UA was significant for no infection.
PE also on the differential, however patient would not currently tolerate a CTA given her renal failure and have other more likely reasons for dyspnea.
Ischemia in the differential, however CEs not elevated and EKG unchanged and patient without CP.
A TTE showed worsened mitral regurgitation.
Patient eventually diuresed sufficiently with the lasix drip and metolazone with a 5 kg weight loss, although she maintained a ~2L oxygen requirement (up from baseline of 1-2L oxygen at home.
Patient also continued to have persistent bibasilar crackles, although gradually improved throughout her hospital course.
Although she became volume up as a result of her transfusions for the hemoperitoneum, she appeared to be autodiuresing during her MICU stay.
# Anemia: Possibly due to renal failure.
Iron, B12 and folate studies were significant for elevated ferritin, as likely acute phase reactant.
Patient developed hemoperitoneum during renal biopsy, associated with hypotension and Hct drop from 33.6 to 27.7.
# [**Last Name (un) **] sp renal transplant: Cr elevated to 4.4 from baseline 1.6, likely due to poor forward flow as FEurea inconclusive and no casts in urine sediment.
Transplant kidney ultrasound on [**1-20**] showed possible rejection so patient underwent a biopsy of her kidney graft on [**2173-1-24**] for evaluation of her acute on chronic renal failure that was complicated by hemoperitoneum, hypotension, and hct drop from 33.6 to 27.7.
Patient's renal biopsy pathology ultimately was negative for acute cellular or humoral rejection.
Patient did have some abdominal pain during the latter portion of her hospitalization, felt likely due to the hemoperitoneum.
AG metabolic acidosis:  Most likely due to ARF and resolved quickly after admission.
Held [**Last Name (un) **] during this admission and upon discharge given patient's hyperkalemia and acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
# Elevated CK: Ddx includes myositis versus mild rhabdo, ACS but unlikely as MB index normal and no increase in troponin.
She is followed at the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center.
# HLD: Continued Atorvastatin and Tricor as no sxs of rhabdomylysis.
Home Oxygen 1L/min continuous flow portable oxygen to maintain O2 sat greater than 92%   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - Acute on chronic renal failure .
Secondary: - Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus - Hyperlipidemia - Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: alert and oriented X3 Ambulating well without assistance   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of shortness of breath.
You had more fluid on your body than usual because of your heart failure.
Renal biopsy samples, however, showed NO acute rejection of your kidney transplant.
You received blood transfusions and the bleeding eventually stopped.
CHANGE this medication: INSTEAD OF Metolazone 2.5 mg daily, ONLY TAKE Metolazone 2.5mg daily AS NEEDED: When your daily weight, checked in the morning, is 2 pounds heavier than the day prior (weigh yourself only after you have urinated in the morning) .
