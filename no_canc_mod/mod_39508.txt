The patient reports no sx, he reports taht he has been eating normally (ground food and with a poor appetite at baseline) and has had no abdominal pain, n/v/d/c.
The patient has had a large decline in his baseline health over the past month, beginning with vascular surgery in which they did angioplasty on the posterior tibial artery and they initiated [**First Name3 (LF) 4532**] at that time, [**2172-3-3**].
Since then, he has been less mobile and more somnolent, with baseline fatigue and decreased appetite.
He reports that he had a fall in which he hit his left shoulder and buttock, it is unclear the situation surrounding this but he endorses pain in his left shoulder and lidocaine patch is in place, he reports that this has happened since his admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgery at the beginning of [**Month (only) 956**].
CTA done and revealed no source of bleeding and stool in the ascending bowel.
He had 100cc of bright red blood per rectum with clots, no stool.

oriented to self, date but not year and says "[**Hospital 882**] Hospital", no acute distress HEENT: dry mucous membranes, oropharynx clear, poor dentition.
Cloudy pupils Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: irregular rate, rapid rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: poor air movement bilaterally.
decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Baseline weakness on the left noted.
Hyperdense fluid within the sigmoid colon consistent with hemorrhage.
No clear source for active bleeding on this mesenteric CTA.
No bowel wall inflammation and diverticulosis.
Moderate nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusions with associated  compressive atelectasis.
Moderate simple ascitic fluid, diffuse mesenteric edema and subcutaneous edema consistent with anasarca.
CXR: IMPRESSION: Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion with bilateral pleural effusions and opacities at the lung bases likely due to associated atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old male with peripheral vascular disease on warfarin, [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] presenting with painless BRBPR, current hemodynamic stability.
# BRBPR: Patient presenting with about 500cc of bright red blood per rectum in the emergency room.
It is painless and no hemorrhoids have been visualized.
Given bright red blood while hemodynamically stable, it was suspected to be a lower GI source.
Despite all this, his hct and bp continued to drop.
Pt was maintained on morphine gtt per Comfort Care Guidelines with prn ativan for breakthrough pain or anxiety, with scopolamine patch if necessary for use when suctioning airway.
#Aflutter: patient had atrial fibrillation during his previous hospitalization and was started on metoprolol for rate control and warfarin.
The patient was not a considered a candidate for acute intervention but the patient is intolerant of high ventricular rates.
#Peripheral vascular disease: complicated by bilateral gangrene requiring admission at the beginning of [**2172-3-4**], s/p Balloon angioplasty of left posterior tibial artery with additional angioplasty and stenting of left posterior tibial artery occlusion along with amputation of left great toe.
Has working Lt UA AVF for access.
He did have a requirement for pressors in the setting of afib during his previous admission.
Current blood pressure is 102/60, which is baseline, but will monitor carefully, especially in the setting of hypovolemia with GIB.
# Baseline Macrocytic Anemia: concern for liver disease although hepatitis work up wsa negative.
