Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: No MVP.
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage A patent foramen ovale is present.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Intact interatrial septum post repair with no flows across with color doppler.
Thre is a bioprosthetic valve at the native aortic position with normal function and stability, with a residual peak and mean of 20 and 10mm of Hg.
Thoracic aortic contour is intact.
Provisional Findings Impression: CXWc [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**2103-1-5**] 10:20 PM Focal splenic defect consistent with infarct, although acuity unknown, this could be due to septic embolus.
No acute vascular abnormalities identified on this exam.
Post-surgical changes into  mediastinum, without fluid collection or pericardial effusion.
Atelectasis at the lung bases.
Evaluate for septic emboli.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post aortic valve replacement, and post-surgical changes are seen throughout the mediastinum, consisting of a small amount of pneumomediastinum, soft tissue stranding and edema, although without focal fluid collection.
The heart remains slightly enlarged, but there is no pericardial effusion.
There is no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
There is no consolidation or pneumothorax.
There are no masses or nodules in the lungs.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Within the posterior superior aspect of the spleen, there is a wedge-shaped hypoattenuating defect consistent with infarct.
Other intra-abdominal organs are within normal limits, without evidence of infarct.
There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
The urinary bladder and distal ureters are  unremarkable.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
While the scrotum is incompletely imaged, there is evidence of a small right hydrocele.
There is no mesenteric, retroperitoneal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Mild degenerative changes are present in the thoracic and lumbar spine.
There is no fracture, or worrisome lytic or sclerotic bony lesion.
Wedge-shaped defect in the posterior aspect of the spleen consistent with infarct, although the acuity is unknown.
No gross vascular abnormalities are detected.
Post-surgical changes in the mediastinum following aortic valve replacement.
No large fluid collection or pericardial effusion.
No other solid organ infarct or other evidence of embolic phenomena in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Mild dependent atelectasis at the lung bases.
Right scrotal hydrocele.
Provisional Findings Impression: CXWc [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**2103-1-5**] 9:56 PM Multiple small hypodense foci in the subcortical white matter and deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter on the left, without associated hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
These could represent septic emboli.
Final Report INDICATION: 56-year-old man with endocarditis and AVR.
Evaluate for septic emboli.
FINDINGS: There are subcentimeter hypodense foci at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter junction in the superior left frontal lobe (2:28), left parietal lobe (2:21), and left posterior temporal lobe (2:12).
There is a small hypodensity in the left lentiform nucleus (2:16).
There is no associated hemorrhage or mass effect.
There is no evidence of a major vascular territorial infarction.
There is a small mucus retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Few hypodense foci in the left cerebral hemisphere, mostly at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter junction, which are nonspecific but compatible with septic emboli.
They may also be related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No hemodynamically significant stenoses were found on CT evaluation.
Pre-op echo did reveal a secundum type atrial septal defect (ASD).
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Additionally, he received vancomycin for perioperative prophylaxis.
Pathology of the excised, native valve revealed gram positive cocci with acute and chronic inflammation.
However, final culture of the tissue revealed no growth.
Additionally, CT of the head, torso and pelvis revealed no abscess or collection.
