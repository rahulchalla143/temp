Renal:  The patient transferred from the MICU to the Medicine Floor for management of his renal failure after he was extubated.
At the time of this dictation, his blood pressure is still slightly elevated and he may require additional enalapril and amlodipine doses.
The patient did not complain of any shortness of breath or cough.
He had a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate for pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
This echocardiogram was done on [**2100-9-30**], and was remarkable just for borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There were some concern of crackles throughout his hospital course here heard on examination.
However, these crackles were inconsistent and would usually decrease after hemodialysis and thus were attributed to fluid overload.
Anemia:  The patient had iron studies in the MICU consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
However, here he has a low iron indicating that he might have iron deficiency anemia in addition.
They advised continuation of the ACE inhibitor with the hope for resolution of renal failure and possible discontinuation of dialysis at some point in the future.
For now, the sclerodermal renal crisis seemed to be the most possible diagnosis given the renal biopsy and the skin biopsy confirming scleroderma.
He was also thought to have polyneuropathy secondary to a vasculopathy related to his scleroderma.
Cardiac:  The patient initially had a troponin leak.
He had no further episodes of flash pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension while on the floor.
The repeat echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction and only mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The EMG was not consistent with a myopathy, but rather consistent with a sensory-motor polyneuropathy especially in the right lower extremity.
This was thought to be due or related to his vasculopathy.
Polyneuropathy and scleroderma is somewhat rare, but is thought to be the most plausible explanation for his neuropathy.
He also is treated with oxycodone 10 mg q4-6 hours for pain relief.
Thrombocytopenia:  This was due to exposure to Heparin and the patient was found to have positive Heparin platelet Factor IV antibodies.
Rash:  The patient has had multiple recurrences of a rash.
He initially presented with a rash that was felt to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction secondary to his herbal supplements he would be taking prior to admission.
A second rash was noted after taking captopril in the MICU and now a third rash has been noted after transfer to the floor.
Another skin biopsy has been done to evaluate whether this represents hypersensitivity reaction either to Neurontin which is the only new medication after changing from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor or enalapril via cross allergy reaction with the Captopril.
However, this preliminary diagnosis is only hypothesis and final results of a biopsy and determination of the offending [**Doctor Last Name 932**] will be determined and added on to this discharge summary.
The patient over the last three days prior to this dictation has had temperatures up to 101.8 without subjective cough or shortness of breath.
His urine culture grew out Enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin.
However, he continues to have temperatures and has multiple sets of blood cultures pending at the time of this dictation.
In addition, a chest x-ray has been negative for a pneumonia, however, a repeat chest x-ray is pending.
The possibilities include hemodialysis line infection versus other systemic infection versus fever attributable to collagen vascular disease.
The patient's white blood cell count has not been elevated and at the time of this dictation, his white blood cell count is 7.1 with a differential of 44 neutrophils, 14 lymphocytes, 7 basos, and 36% eosinophils.
Eosinophilia:  The patient had only a slight eosinophilia in the Intensive Care Unit the highest number being 10%.
Various possibilities were put forth such as adrenal insufficiency, collagen vascular disease, hypersensitivity to medication and finally, but least likely a helminthic infection.
This infectious cause is considered less likely because the patient has no travel history.
He believes that his motor weakness, neuropathy, and neuropathic pain is better off the prednisone.
He continues to make progress in rehabilitation, however, a low sodium and eosinophilia would point towards the possibility of an adrenal insufficiency.
An ACTH stim test make the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency has not been done yet at the time of this dictation.
In addition, as TSH is high at 8.2 and T4 thyroxine level is being checked to rule out hypothyroidism.
