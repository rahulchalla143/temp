Admission Date:  [**2152-8-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2152-8-30**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and rectal bleeding.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in [**2152-5-9**], which was medically managed.
The patient presented to an outside hospital with rectal bleeding and chest pain on [**8-25**].
Rectal bleeding was stopped.
Colonoscopy done previously on [**2152-8-21**] showed diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids.
Diagnostic catheterization done on [**8-25**] at outside hospital showed three vessel coronary artery disease.
In the catheterization laboratory the patient had an episode of chest pain, which was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin with evidence of ST depressions on her electrocardiogram.
Angiography showed diffuse disease of the right coronary artery and total occlusion of the mid right coronary artery and 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and discreet lesions in the obtuse marginal one.
Her distal left anterior descending coronary artery demonstrated TIMI three flow without significant obstructive disease.
Three overlapping stents were placed in the mid left anterior descending coronary artery with no residual stenosis.
Obtuse marginal one had one stent placed with no residual stenosis and the right coronary artery lesion had evidence of collaterals, therefore no stent was placed.
In the Coronary Care Unit the patient was somewhat somnolent, admitted to chest pain for the past three weeks prior to admission relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
On her recent admission to the outside hospital for bleeding she states she was washing dishes and noted a pool of bright red blood on the floor.
Currently post catheterization the patient is not describing any further chest pain.
Coronary artery disease as described above.
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic renal failure.
History of anemia secondary to internal hemorrhoids.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Generally, the patient was somnolent and oriented times three and in no acute distress.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft, distended, mild right lower quadrant tenderness to palpation, but no guarding or rebound tenderness.
No femoral hematoma post catheterization.
Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital showed sinus rhythm at a regular rate, 75 beats per minute, left axis T wave inversion present in the lateral leads.
However, electrocardiogram post catheterization showed sinus rhythm, regular rate at 60 beats per minute, left axis, T wave inversion in leads V2 to V6 without any ST changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen to have a drop in her hematocrit from 30 to 23, therefore she received 2 units of packed red blood cells with appropriate elevation in hematocrit.
Post catheterization the patient denied any further chest pain.
Hematocrit has stabilized, however, the patient was noted to have a large hematoma in her right arm.
There was no evidence of trauma or previous bruising.
The suspicion was that the patient's initial blood loss had collected in the hematoma in the right arm.
On [**2152-8-30**] the patient was noted to have a large ecchymoses of her left groin area and a bruit was evident on the right.
Additional note, the patient complained of nausea during hospitalization and received one dose of Phenergan and became extremely drowsy and confused, however, twelve to fifteen hours later mental status changes resolved and the patient was noted to be alert and oriented times three.
Overall this is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of anemia and rectal bleeding noted to have three vessel coronary artery disease who presents with unstable angina and now is status post stent from mid left anterior descending coronary artery and her obtuse marginal one.
In terms of her coronary artery disease the patient denies any further chest pain.
Her EF is 55%, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 51778**] 4.1, known to have mild left ventricular hypertrophy, mild pulmonary hypertension.
The patient is known to have anemia at baseline.
In terms of her right arm hematoma the hematoma is currently resolving, less firm and tender to palpation.
The patient now demonstrates a new femoral ecchymoses.
This is likely associated with her gastrointestinal bleeding, although the patient has not currently had any rectal bleeding on this admission.
The patient will likely receive a standing dose of Lasix 20 mg for duration of two weeks if nephropathy resolves.
The patient does have nephropathy at baseline.
