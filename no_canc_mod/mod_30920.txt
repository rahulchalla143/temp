Hypertensive urgency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis, hypertension, hepatitis C, and a history of small bowel obstruction who presented with multiple complaints.
She reported a one-week history of nausea and vomiting, fevers, chills, and abdominal pain as well as pain at her dialysis catheter site.
She states that the nausea and vomiting have been going on for one-and-a-half weeks where she brings up non-bloody bilious emesis.
She states that the fevers and chills started with low-grade temps approximately 100 F, but on the date of admission during dialysis, she spiked to 104 F.  Three sets of blood cultures were drawn at dialysis.
She describes abdominal pain as intermittent, diffuse, and rated it [**10-12**].
She says that the pain is worse with eating and is unchanged by position.
She also states that the pain over her dialysis catheter site has been progressing over the last few weeks.
Chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis.
Stroke in [**2152**] with a residual right-sided weakness.
Hepatitis C virus.
History of small bowel obstruction status post resection in 01/[**2158**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  The patient is afebrile with a temperature of 98.3, pulse 86, blood pressure 219/142 repeated to be 268/183 and then repeated to be 184/121, her respiratory rate is 18, and her oxygen saturation is 93% on room air.
She has no jugular venous distention.
There are multiple whitish pustules surrounding the site.
There is no erythema surrounding the site.
Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and her heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Her abdomen has bowel sounds and is soft and has generalized abdominal tenderness.
She has no rebound tenderness.
Her extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
A KUB was done upon admission which showed no evidence of obstruction.
A chest x-ray was done which showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
An EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy with poor R-wave progression.
There were T-wave inversions in V4 through V6.
Her hypertension was well controlled in the MICU and then was also improved upon transfer to the floor.
There was a question of whether her hypertensive urgency was due to cocaine withdrawal given that her urine toxicity came back as positive for cocaine use.
Abdominal pain:  The patient had a KUB upon admission that was reassuring for no signs of small bowel obstruction.
However, the CT did not show any abnormalities consistent with a small bowel obstruction.
It was unclear what the etiology of this patient's pain was.
There was also a concern that the patient might have a small bowel obstruction or mesenteric ischemia.
She was placed on Morphine for pain control.
The patient, however, refused to have any further workup.
This was thought since she complained of tenderness over the site, and there were pustules surrounding insertion site.
The pustules were cultured for bacteria from viruses which included HSC.
She continued to have her hemodialysis on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
It was unclear what the etiology of her temperatures were.
Polysubstance abuse:  The patient's urine toxicity had returned positive for cocaine.
It was unclear whether all her symptoms at presentation were from cocaine withdrawal.
She refused any further workup for her abdominal pain, which included CT scan, KUB, pelvic exam, or abdominal exam.
The patient was notified about risks of not having a further workup.
She was instructed to return to the Emergency Room or call her doctor if her pain persisted.
Hypertensive urgency.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
The patient was instructed to call her doctor or return to the Emergency Room if she experienced any worsening or persistent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or other worrisome symptoms.
