In ED, Neuro noted left weakness and facial droop, MRI with new corona radiata stroke without evidence of bleed.
Pt found to have MI - EKG with depression in v1 and v2, positive troponin and CK-MB.
TTE with intra-atrial masses (tumor w/ thrombosis vs. myxoma vs. atypical veg).
Patient heparinized for NSTEMI but developed GIB afterwards, heparin subsequently discontinued.

Pt had GI bleed after heparinization, which was stopped.
Neurology following for multiple small embolic strokes, thought to be secondary to emboli from the cardiac mass & recommending anticoagulation - EEG negative for seizure activity.
Cardiology following for MI & cardiac mass - thought to be calcified annular mass with overlying thrombus, needs anticoagulation for stabilization of clot to prevent further embolization.
GI consulted & EGD performed demonstrating diffuse esophagitis with contact bleeding & linear ulcerations in duodenal bulb.
After discussing risks/benefits with family, decision was made to attempt anticoagulation again - stopped after 2nd GI bleed requiring blood transfusion.
