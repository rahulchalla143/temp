History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old female with a PMH significant for chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, and CAD s/p CABG sent to the ED for symptomatic anemia now admitted tot he MICU for GIB.
The patient initially presented to her PCP yesterday after feeling orthostatic, dizzy, and increasing short of breath with climbing the 12 steps in her house over the past 3 days.
In addition, she states that she has had a dull chest pain going across her chest and radiating for the past 1-2 months, which has been worse in the past 3 days.
She denies any change to her bowel movements, including melena or hematochezia.
Of note, the patient has a long history of anemia requiring transfusions with multiple GI evaluations including upper and lower endoscopy, and capsule study without a clear localizing GI source.
Currently, the patient is resting comortably without complaints.
Atrial fibrillation - coumadin discontinued in the setting of GI bleed 2.
CAD s/p CABG, has stable angina 3.
Peripheral vascular disease 4.
Hypertension 5.
Anemia of chronic disease 6.
Bilateral renal artery stenosis status post right stent [**8-/2103**] 10. s/p left hip replacement 11. s/p appendectomy 12. s/p tonsillectomy 13. s/p cataract surgery [**14**].
Hypothyroidism 15.
Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure  Social History: Home: Lives alone.
CV: Irregular S1+S2, S4 Pulm: CTAB Abd: S/ND, non-specific TTP +bs Ext: Trace pitting edema bilaterally.
Post-CABG changes and sternotomy wires are redemonstrated.
The lungs are low in volume, with bibasilar atelectasis, particularly on the left.
There are mild central vascular congestion and a suggestion of Kerley B lines in the left base, raising question of evolving early edema.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Multilevel lumbar spondylosis is present.
IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly, mild central vascular congestion, and possible evolving early edema.
Bibasilar dependent atelectasis more pronounced on the left.
No definite consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation (off Coumadin), chronic anemia followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2539**] (history of bone marrow biopsy), renovascular resistant hypertension with renal artery stent (complicated with occlusion), and coronary and peripheral artery disease who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**2111-4-14**] with symptomatic anemia related to her third episode of major gastrointestinal bleeding.
She was taken off Coumadin after her second major bleeding and now she has a recurrent significant anemia while taking aspirin only.
On MICU presentation, she had mild elevation of troponin (0.04) with mild nonspecific lateral ECG changes.
The MICU team was concerned about demand ischemia but she had no evidence of acute myocardial infarction.
She was severely hypertensive without evidence of hypertensive emergency.
Her Endoscopy EGD) showed no source of bleeding despite guaiac positive stools.
During her hospitalization, she was noted to have worsening kidney function along with Labetalol and Digoxin chronic toxicity with classic saggy ST depression, atrial fibrillation with very slow ventricular response rate as low as 30 (range 30-40), and mildly elevated digoxin level of 2.3 (does not correlate with toxicity).
Her Labetalol and Digoxin were discontinued and her severe hypertension was treated with Imdur (new medication), Hydralazine, and Norvasc.
After her heart rate recovered, we restarted the Labetalol because of CAD and uncontrolled hypertension.
We did NOT restart Digoxin because of risk of toxicity in elderly with CKD.
She was not candidate for ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] because of risk of hyperkalemia and worsening CKD because of RAS and treatment with Aldactone.
These diuretics were held in the setting of acute worsening of her kidney function.
We restarted Aldactone and Torsemide but not the HCTZ because of decreased GFR (decreased efficacy) and risk of electrolyte abnormalities.
Several medication changes were made to address her uncontrolled hypertension, worsening kidney function and bradycardia (see below).
We also discussed findings with her daughter who is her HCP and explained all her medications in details.
Medications on Admission: Atorvastatin 10 mg daily Digoxin 125 mcg daily Amlodipine 10 mg daily Hydralazine 50 mg po tid Labetalol 100 mg po bid Aldactone-HCTZ 25-25 daily Torsemide 10 mg daily Levothyroxine 88 mcg daily NTG SL prn ASA 81 mg daily Omeprazole 20 mg daily Triamcinolone crm Flucinolone crm for scalp Hydrocortisone-pramoxine crm prn Folate  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Blood loss anemia Third major GI bleeding Atrial fibrillation with severe bradycardia.

We noted that you had worsening of your kidney function along with severe slowing of your heart rate.
