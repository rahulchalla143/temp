Admission Date:  [**2171-1-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2171-1-6**]   Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lethargy and inferior myocardial infarction with complete heart block.
The patient was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission at which time she was noted to be very lethargic and fatigued.
Patient at that time denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.
Family called EMS in the afternoon, who brought her to [**Hospital1 1474**] Emergency Department, where she was noted to be extremely lethargic with a heart rate in the 20s and also to be diaphoretic and with cool on the extremities.
The patient was given atropine and Epinephrine, and noted to be in respiratory distress for which she required intubation.
The patient was then noted to be ventricular tachycardia.
Also the right coronary artery was found to have a total occlusion, and was therefore, treated with PTCA which resulted in 40% residual occlusion.
Coronary artery disease.
Neck:  Jugular venous pressure approximately 10 cm of water, no bruits.
Heart:  Regular rate, S1, S2 normal, no murmurs.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman status post inferior-posterior myocardial infarction complicated by complete heart block and hypertension status post temporary pacer, [**Name (NI) 47348**], RCA PTCA, now admitted to CCU for further management.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was status inferior-posterior myocardial infarction intervened on cardiac catheterization with PTCA.
Eventually, [**Name (NI) 47348**] had to be removed because of ischemic toes.
For her extremities, after the [**Name (NI) 47348**] insertion, she had bilateral foot ischemia, which were addressed by starting Lovenox subQ for anticoagulation in an attempt to improve toe perfusion.
At around 4 pm on [**2171-1-5**], she was noted to develop sudden hypertension with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s and decreased urine output.
She was then started on Levophed and Dopamine also without any improvement.
This was found to be secondary to rhabdomyolysis.
Most likely diagnosis was found to be metabolic acidosis, not successfully compensating, most likely also complicated by septic shock from sepsis.
Ceftriaxone and Flagyl were also continued which had been started in order to treat potential pneumonia or infection of ischemic toes.
The patient, however, continued to remain unresponsive to the antibiotics or the pressors.
