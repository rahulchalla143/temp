The morning of admission, the patient stated that she had had brief loss of consciousness.
She denies seizure activity, change in bladder or bowel habit.
Her initial electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with first degree AV block.
She reported chest pain during the ablation.
There were no EKG changes when her sheath was pulled, but pressure decreased to the 40s.
After transfer her vital signs were pulse 80 to 90; blood pressure 125/63; and she reported an occasional five out of ten chest pain that was dull and achy and worse with deep inspiration.
ALLERGIES:   She has no known drug allergies.
Mitral valve prolapse.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Diverticular disease.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
ALLERGIES:   She has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:   She does not use tobacco or alcohol.
She is divorced and lives with her sons who are very supportive in her care.
LABORATORY:  Electrocardiogram number one, [**2168-5-11**], at 05:30 a.m. was 120 beats per minute, tachycardia, first degree arteriovenous block with PR prolongation.
Normal axis, poor R wave progression, QRS 0.96.
Qs in V3 through V6 and evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.
On [**2168-5-11**], at 3 p.m., the patient had paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia at 172 beats per minute with left ventricular hypertrophy in Qs and V3 through V6.
Jugular venous distention was approximately 10 centimeters but again the patient was lying flat.
Lungs were clear to auscultation; no wheezes, rales or rhonchi anteriorly this examination was done.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was regularly irregular and seemed to have ventricular premature contractions, distant heart sounds.
S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.
Groin with no bruit.
Clear, dry and intact, no hematoma.
No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Slight PR elevation in AVR, normal voltage, evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.
ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 79 year old woman with a past medical history of peptic ulcer disease status post Billroth II, diverticular disease, syncope and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia who presents from the Electrophysiology Laboratory status post ablation of AVR and AT, complicated by pericardial effusion, decreased blood pressure transiently requiring dopamine.
RHYTHM:  Sinus bradycardia with VPCs, VPB, status post ablation for AVRNAT.
Her left atrium was mildly dilated, right atrium was normal in size.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There was a small pericardial effusion that was circumferential and compared to the prior study on [**2168-5-11**], the pericardial effusion appeared slightly smaller than the prior study, and there was no atrial indentation.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  There was no evidence of congestive heart failure throughout the remainder of her stay.
We monitored for obstructive physiology by following pulsus which was approximately 8 and jugular venous pressure which was approximately 9.
For coronary artery disease, the patient has a known coronary artery disease history.
By the date of discharge, it was 36.6 without any further transfusions.
It should be noted that the patient had received intravenous fluids during her episodes of hypotension and the low hematocrit may have represented fluid shifts.
PULMONARY:  The patient has no history of pulmonary disease, however, given the pulmonary hypertension, this issue should be followed up as an outpatient.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Proton pump inhibitor for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
PAIN:  Chest pain likely secondary to procedure.
She was seen by Physical Therapy and was ambulating without assistance.
Status post syncopal episode.
............. resulting in anemia status post two units of packed red blood cells.
Peptic ulcer disease.
The patient is to call for this appointment in approximately one month following this admission for a possible permanent pacemaker placement.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient has known coronary artery disease history.
