Initiation of hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 33858**] is a 67-year-old woman with stage IV-V CKD preparing for renal replacement therapy, hypertension, insulin-dependent DM, anemia, hypertension, and gout, who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED yesterday for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea for one week, and a cough that had worsened after an episode of emesis.
On arrival in [**Location (un) 620**], she appeared pale and lethargic and had projectile vomiting.
She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure with O2 sats in 70-80s.
CXR showed a RML consolidation suggestive of pneumonia, and patient was given ceftriaxone and metronidazole out of concern for respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia.
She was also given duonebs, three doses of IV lopressor, and 250 cc IVF, followed by 60 mg IV furosemide due to CXR signs of pulmonary edema.
Labs revealed elevated leukocytosis with left shift, mild hyponatremia & hyperkalemia, acute on chronic kidney injury, normal lactate, and hypoxemia.
Overnight in the CCU, further review of ECG revealed sub-mm ST depressions in V3-V6.
The patient had a bedside TTE that showed mildly reduced LVEF 45% and mild-mod MR.
RIJ was placed in effort to preserve peripheral vessels for dialysis access.
Repeat labs revealed ongoing leukocytosis with bandemia and stabilization of creatinine.
She endorses nausea, diarrhea, and discomfort from the ETT.
She says she has had subjective fevers and acknowledges that she was not taking antibiotics at home, but cannot recall what they were prescribed for.

The left atrium is moderately dilated.
A regional wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded (poor images of the mid to distal LV).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2156-1-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of recent chest radiographs.
In addition to a widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality that could be pulmonary edema, there is more focal consolidation and a strong suggestion of cavitation in the juxtahilar right lung, pneumonia until proved otherwise.
Since the heart is normal size and pleural effusion is small, if any, this could be noncardiac edema.
No pneumothorax .
Cystic lesion in the left adnexa, similar in appearance to [**2147**], but larger.
Extending superiorly from the cystic structure, there is soft tissue prominence alone the course of the left gonadal vein.
Additional differential considerations for the soft tissue prominence include fluid tracking along the pelvic wall/gonadal vein, hemorrhage or a fibrous lesion.
Bilateral consolidations and nodular opacities compatible with multifocal pneumonia & ARDS, with aspiration being a consideration as well given the predominantly dependent distribution.
While no pulmonary mass is definitely identified, it could be obscured by the consolidation.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Fat-containing ventral hernias.
Extensive atherosclerosis, which has significantly increased since [**2147**].
Non-obstructive renal calculi within the upper pole of the right kidney.
No evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally.
Limited Doppler images show normal arterial and venous flow at the renal hilum.
Worsening mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 67-year-old woman  with a history of CKD stage IV-V, DM2, HTN, anemia, and gout, presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure [**2-5**] multifocal pneumonia/ARDS, with cardiac enzyme leak c/w NSTEMI, intubated, then extubated.
Hospital course c/b worsening of her CKD requiring initiation of hemodialysis.
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY STATUS/ARDS: Due to infectious process given bilateral multifocal infiltrates seen on CXR, leukocytosis with bandemia, and history of productive cough.
Finished 10 day course of vancomycin, zosyn, levaquin with resolution of her fevers and leukocytosis.
After extubation, the patient continued to have pulmonary edema due to her worsening renal failure and anuria.
Even after diuresis, the patient had a R sided effusion on CXR.
# CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: The patient had stage 4 CKD before admission, with the plan to initiate dialysis in the near future.
# NSTEMI: The patient had ST depressions and increased troponins.
Her EKG normalized and TTE did not show wall motion abnormlaities.
# NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA: Hgb just below baseline, no signs of acute bleeding.
Iron studies in past suggestive of anemia of chronic inflammation.
No schistocytes reported on CBC; has elevated LDH but normal total bili argues against hemolysis.
Cystic lesion in the left adnexa, similar in appearance to [**2147**], but larger.
Extending superiorly from the cystic structure, there is soft tissue prominence alone the course of the left gonadal vein.
Additional differential considerations for the soft tissue prominence include fluid tracking along the pelvic wall/gonadal vein, hemorrhage or a fibrous lesion.
We recommend chest xray in [**4-9**] weeks (by [**3-5**]) to ensure resolution of pleural effusion .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia End-Stage Renal Disease, on Dialysis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital for difficulty breathing due to pneumonia, which was made worse because of your renal failure.
During the first portion of your stay, you required a breathing tube to support you, but you were able to gradually come off of the breathing support.
Unfortunately, you experienced a further worsening of your renal failure, and had to be started on dialysis, which your body has been responding to well.
It is very important that you see cardiology as an ouptatient as you had a small heart attack while you were here.
