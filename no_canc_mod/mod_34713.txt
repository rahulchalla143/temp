Admission Date:  [**2146-11-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-1-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-2-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: Headache, LOC  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**11-24**]: Left Burr Hole and placement of External Ventricular Drain(EVD) [**12-1**]: Removal of EVD, Cyst Aspiration, [**Last Name (un) **] catheter placement.
[**12-14**]: scalp wound revision   History of Present Illness: 65M presented to OSH this am after complaining of headache on [**11-24**].
Upon presentation to OSH, he was found to be hypertensive to 230/150, started on Nipride.
His head was scanned and revealed a "Massive Head Bleed, without midline shift".

Dilatation of the ventricles and transependymal migration of CSF is consistent with obstructive hydrocephalus.
Note is made of prominent CSF space in the suprasellar cistern,which can be seen with marked obstructive hydrocephalus, but a suprasellar arachnoid cyst can have a similar appearance.
There is a nasogastric tube that courses below the diaphragm and lies within the stomach.
There is no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
There is no evidence of pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
Extensive intraventricular hemorrhage involving all the ventricles as described above, predominantly in the acute stage with a small subacute component.
Obstructive hydrocephalus, with dilatation of the left lateral ventricle and moderate on the right.
While there is no obvious abnormal enhancement noted within the area of hemorrhage, small neoplastic or vascular causes within the ventricles cannot be excluded.
Given the presence of intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage, patient needs further evaluation to exclude a vascular cause like an aneurysm by CT angiogram.
Displacement of the right internal carotid artery termination and the anterior cerebral arteries on both sides related to the enlarged ventricles is noted.
No evidence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation or other vascular abnormality as source of massive intraventricular hemorrhage.
There is also no focal contrast extravasation to suggest a bleeding source or risk of continued hemorrhage.
Only scant subarachnoid hemorrhage, unchanged, with no evidence of cerebral vasospasm.
Extensive intraventricular hemorrhage, with severe obstructive hydrocephalus, unchanged.
Persistent dilatation of the left lateral ventricle, despite the ventriculostomy catheter, whose tip may abut or even transgress the lateral ventricular wall.
CT Sinus [**11-27**]: IMPRESSION: Panmucosal thickening within the paranasal sinuses, increased compared to the CT of [**2146-11-24**].
Extensive nasal secretions.
Left frontal ventricular catheter appears to terminate in brain parenchyma as discussed on concurrent head CT.  Head CT [**11-27**]: FINDINGS: A ventricular catheter entering from a left frontal approach appears to terminate within the left frontal lobe (2:13).
The left lateral ventricle remains extremely dilated but not significantly changed compared to the examination two days prior.
Large amount of blood within the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle is essentially unchanged.
Scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage throughout both cerebral hemispheres are unchanged.
Thickening of the ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses of the mucosal surface is stable compared to the most recent exam.
MRI [**12-1**]: FINDINGS: There has been a reduction in the volume of hemorrhage present within the bodies of the lateral ventricles.
No pre-contrast imaging was performed.
It is unclear whether hyperintensity of the lateral ventricular margins represent enhancement or subacute hemorrhage.
Status post drain placement in the previously noted large suprasellar/prepontine cyst, change in the shape of the cyst, and possible mild or no significant change in the overall size.
Extensive intraventricular, some amount of subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage partially imaged and not significantly changed.
No change in position of left frontal approach catheter terminating within a large cyst centered in the suprasellar/pre-pontine cistern.
Similar extensive hemorrhage within the lateral ventricles, and smaller subarachnoid hemorrhage in bilateral sylvian fissures.
Slight decrease in degree of hemorrhage within the cyst or third ventricle.
His exam post drain did improve and MRI showed no obvious mass.
CTA of head was done showed no AVM, however bleeding was likely due to arachnoid cyst.
On his examination on [**12-6**], he was found to have gross visual field deficits and ophthalmology was consulted.
He was found to be blind with some light awareness bilaterally.
This was thought to be secondary to vitreous hemorrhage of unclear origin.
He was eating and drinking without difficulty.
He did have hyponatremia for several days for which he was placed on salt tablets and kept on a fluid restriction.
The patient continued to have daily PT while waiting for guardianship.
