No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The ascending aortic aneurysm has been resected but that portion of the aorta can not be seen very well.
However, the aortic regurgitation appears somewhat improved, now mild, and is eccentrically directed towards the anterior mitral valve leaflet.
She awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty.
