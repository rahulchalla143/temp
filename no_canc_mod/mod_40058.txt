Though this does not pose any risk for rupture at this point, given patient's young age this would have to be treated at some point.
She quit smoking after subarachnoid hemorrhage and takes about four glasses of wine a few times a week.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: AVSS, NAD, AxOx4 symmetric chest rise, breathimg comfortably incision on scalp, c/d/i symmetric smile CNII-XII intact EOMI, PERRL Strength/motor: LUE: 4+ D/B/Tr, 4-IO, LLE: 5 IS/Q/H/[**Last Name (un) 938**]/TA/GS, RUE: 5 D/B/Tr/WF/WE/IO, RLE: 5 IL/Q/H/TA/[**Last Name (un) 938**]/GS SITLT R U M Sa [**Doctor First Name **] SP DP Bilat BL wwp, 2+cr, 2+dp/pt BL, 2+ R  Pertinent Results: CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM ([**2188-6-30**]): -IMPRESSION: Previously coiled right posterior communicating artery aneurysm has recanalized and the left internal carotid artery posterior communicating segment aneurysm is unchanged.
Mostly air-filled extraaxial collection underlying the right craniotomy, with mild right frontal sulcal effacement, mild ventricular effacement, and 3 mm leftward shift of midline structres.
Apparent low density projecting over the right frontal lobe may be related to artifacts from the overlying scalp staples.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT ([**2188-7-26**]): Allowing for streak artifacts, there is no evidence of new hemorrhage or edema.
The extraaxial collection underlying the right craniotomy has slightly decreased in size.
CT Perfusion/CT Angiogram ([**2188-7-26**]): Status post coiling and clipping of the right PCOM aneurysm, it is difficult to assess for residual aneurysm at this location due to artifact.
New hemorrhage in the right basal ganglion.
No large territorial perfusional defects on the CTP.
No new area of hemorrhage.
Post-surgical changes from right frontoparietal craniotomy.
Intraoperatively there were no complications, but the right PComm did have to be partly sacrificed with expectectation that collateral circulation would provide perfusion.
Post-op head CT showed minimal blood in right sylvian fissues s/p aneurysm clipping as well as expected post-op changes; no hemorrhage or edema.
On HD #2 (POD #1) patient was noted to have decreased strength ([**2-10**]) in distal left lower extremity.
Repeat head CT showed no new hemorrhage or edema.
However, as there was concern for ischemia secondary to partial PComm sacrifice, but collaterals were seen on angio that which showed there was adequate flow.
Later that evening, patient was seen to have new LUE weakness and lethargy.
A stat head CT was performed which showed a new R basal ganglia hemorrhage.
The patient made steady progress with PT and was deemed safe to go home with physical therapy services.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
**Your wound was closed with sutures/staples.
**Your wound was closed with dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
**You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
