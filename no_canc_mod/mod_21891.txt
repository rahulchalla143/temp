No prior studies.
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Numerous areas of focal increased T2 and FLAIR signal intensity are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres as well as in the periventricular white matter surrounding both lateral ventricles.
Numerous focal rounded areas of susceptibility artifact are also seen within the cortex and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
There is no restricted diffusion.
No structural brain abnormality is seen on T1-weighted images.
There is a dominant left anteroinferior cerebellar artery.
No flow- limiting stenosis or area of aneurysmal dilation is seen.
MRI [**Location (un) 4059**] small vessel ischemic changes.
Areas of susceptibility on gradient echo images may represent early amyloid angiopathy or sequela from prior small emboli.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 20827**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] no flow-limiting stenosis or aneurysmal dilation.
PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval removal of the two right jugular central venous catheters seen on [**2185-6-8**].
Prosthetic cardiac valve is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of right jugular central venous catheters.
No pneumothorax.
Small persistent right pleural effusion.
Common femoral vein and artery appear unremarkable without evidence of fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
No fluid collections are identified.
Ultrasound over the patient's area of pain in the right thigh area [**Name (NI) 4059**] patent vessels without evidence of abnormal fluid collection.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right groin hematoma, fistula or pseudoaneurysm.

3) The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
4) there is a long anterior mitral leaflet with a probable myxomatous appearance.

Post-Bypass (1): A prosthetic ring is seen in mitral annulus stable in position.
There is a mitral regurgitant jet, eccentric seen well in MVLAX view c/w a moderate or atleast a mild to moderate regurgitation.
Trivial MR and no AI.
