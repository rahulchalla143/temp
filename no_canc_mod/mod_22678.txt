History of Present Illness: This man was brought to the emergency room with multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and wounds in the back as well.
He was again taken back to the operating room on [**2-2**] for repair of right diaphragmatic laceration, repair of duodenal injury with lateral duodenostomy and wide drainage, repair of right renal vein injury, decompressive fasciotomies x4.
On [**2-3**] he was noted with acute ischemia of his right lower extremity and was taken back to the operating room by Vascular surgery for ultrasound-guided puncture of left common femoral artery, contralateral second-order catheterization of right external iliac artery, abdominal aortogram, right lower extremity angiogram, iliofemoral thrombectomy on the right and vein patch angioplasty of right common femoral artery into the superficial femoral artery.
He underwent percutaneous tracheostomy on [**2-9**] with partial closure of abdomen and application of open abdominal dressing and again returned back to the operating room on [**2-15**] for exploratory laparotomy with drainage of his abdominal cavity.
He was eventually weaned from the ventilator and evaluated by Speech for a Passy Muir valve.
CT scan of his torso demonstrated only small RLL opacity and 2 small intraabdominal fluid collection consistent with his ongoing leak.
At that time his wound VAC was changed again and showing signs of improvement, although he still had persistent duodenal leak and drainage from the distal enterotomy.
On [**3-19**] he was taken back to OR and underwent skin grafting of his entire abdomen using STSG from his non-functional RLE.
He was evaluated by the wound/ostomy nurses who became creative in devising an appliance to help control the leakage and protect his skin.
