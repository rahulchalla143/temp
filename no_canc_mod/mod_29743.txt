However, there is increased opacification at the right base with an oblique configuration, consistent with volume loss in the right lower lung.
Retrocardiac opacification persists, consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3).
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45%).
Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.There is a PFO Visualized by 2D and CFD.
Post Bypass Patient is now s/p Ascending aortic replacement with a Dacron Graft The proximal end of the Dacron graft is visualized just distal to the Sinotubular junction with the distal end proximal to the innominate Currently on a Neosynephrine drip at 1.6 mcg/kg/min The LV function is preserved with an EF of >55% There is persistent [**12-20**]+ Central Aortic regurgitation.
There are no dissection flaps visualized in the ascending aorta .
All finding Pre and Post Bypass communicated to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]   Electronically signed by [**Name6 (MD) 15425**] [**Name8 (MD) 15426**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2167-11-19**] 11:18   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2167-11-18**] where the patient underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with a Vascutek Dacron 28mm tube graft using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
Chest tubes were discontinued on post-operative day number one without complication and the epicardial pacing wires were discontinued on post-operative day number 3 without complications.
By the time of discharge on POD five the patient was ambulating with [**Year (4 digits) **], the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
