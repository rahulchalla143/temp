Diffuse parenchymal opacification is in keeping with clinical diagnosis of ARDS.
Diffuse patchy opacities within the lung fields along with wedge-shaped infarctions along bilateral lung bases, raise the possibility of septic emboli.
No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
Numerous renal and liver cystic lesions of various size seen in polycystic kidney disease.
[**7-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**7-22**], there has been some decrease in the still prominent diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
Monitoring and support devices remain in good position  [**7-27**] CXR: Previously widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality improved substantially between [**7-25**] and [**7-27**] has not changed, raising concern for acute pulmonary embolism or other abnormality not detectable on conventional radiographs.
There is no consolidation or collapse.
No pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
[**7-28**] EEG: Abnormal EEG due to diffuse and prolonged slowing in the delta range with superimposed alpha rhythm, both anteriorly and posteriorly.
The record is consistent with a diffuse mild to moderate encephalopathy without evidence of focality or of increased irritability.
Lung volumes are low, however, there is no consolidation or collapse.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
[**7-30**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation.
The pre-existing atelectasis at the right lung base is unchanged in extent.
No interval appearance of new parenchymal opacities.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no pleural effusion.
No acute infarction.
No evidence of other intracranial abnormalities on non-contrast MRI.
Persistent partial bilateral mastoid air cell opacification.
Possible mucus retention cyst in the nasopharynx.
======================================== MICROBIOLOGY: OSH BCx Positive in [**3-9**] bottles for pan-sensitive E.Coli All BCx negative in house All UCx negative in house Sputum Cx negative Fungal culture preliminary negative   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 50yo F PMHx chronic HA on high dose narcotics who initially presented to OSH w cough, fevers/chills, found to have Ecoli bacteremia, with worsening respiratory distress [**1-7**] ARDS requiring intubation, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], now status post abx therapy with improvement in respiratory status and extubation.
# E.Coli sepsis: At OSH, patient with multiple blood cultures positive for pan-sensitive E.Coli.
Treated with azithromycin + levofloxacin at OSH, transitioned to CTX on transfer given persistant fevers; source of bacteremia thought to UTI with concern for seeding of newly identified PCKD.
Cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] remained negative and fever curve / leukocytosis resolved.
# ARDS - at OSH patient developed increasing hypoxia, with bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS, requiring intubation.
She was maintained on ARDSnet ventilation protocol with treatment of underlying bacteremia.
Sedation was complicated by high narcotic and benzo requirements, thought to be [**1-7**] chronic narcotic usage; patient's respiratory status improved and she was successfully extubated on [**7-30**].
# Tachycardia: Patient has been tachycardic while on the floor to ~120.
EKG shows NSR although patient denies any pain aside from her chronic HA.
The tachycardia does not appear related to dehydration, as the patient is tolerating adequate PO fluids.
Tachycardia believed to be related to deconditiong in the setting of severe illness and intubation, with likely underlying lung disease and bronchodilator medications.
Patient was initially started on metoprolol with good effect, but it was discontinued as she did not have indication for beta-blockade.
Her tachycardia has been asmptomatic; the patient denies any CP or palpitations.
Fentanyl patch was stopped in setting of intubation.
The patient reports her HA pain is under control and would like to be d/c on her current regimen.
# Polycystic Kidney Disease: Patient with newly identified PCKD on admission with CTAP showing multiple cysts in her liver.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] that source of E. Coli sepsis may be related to cyst seeeding from a UTI as discussed above.
# Hypertension: Held home lisinopril in setting of acute illness.
