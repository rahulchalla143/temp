Admission Date: [**2110-1-7**]        Discharge Date: [**2110-1-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-1-7**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NB   HISTORY:  [**Known lastname 58670**] is a 35 [**5-13**] week male infant admitted with prenatal polyhydramnios, possible congenital heart disease, and issues of prematurity.
Concern for cardiac disease.
There was also    concern of an echogenic bright spot in the left ventricle.
Subsequent echocardiogram done at [**Hospital3 1810**]    had concerns for coarctation due to narrowing and the left    superior vena cava draining into the coronary sinus.
There was normal function at that time with no effusion.
There was some liver congestion observed on the    recent ultrasound with a thickened gallbladder.
There was    anasarca or thickened skin noted.
No pleural effusions    with a small pericardial effusion noted on the examination    on the day of delivery.
Ultrasound on [**2110-1-7**] revealed more anasarca as well as    pericardial effusion prompting delivery.
He was also noted to have decreased activity and poor respiratory effort in the delivery room.
There was no maternal fever.
Rupture of membranes occurred at the time of delivery.
Mother had received no medications.
He has decreased activity with only slight response during examination and minimal spontaneous activity.
Nondysmorphic facial features.
Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 with no murmur appreciated.
Examination of the lungs revealed coarse breath sounds.
Liver was difficult to assess due to thickened skin but it is palpable slightly below right costal margin and not enlarged.
Initial chest x-ray had no concerns of lung disease.
On    day of life number 7 he developed respiratory    acidosis with an echocardiogram showing significant    pulmonary hypertension.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Due to concern over biventricular    function, the differential systolic blood pressures as    well as differential perfusion in the upper versus lower    extremities with a prenatal echocardiogram demonstrating    possible coarctation, prostaglandins were started shortly    after birth.
Therefore, the prostaglandins    were stopped and pre and postductal as well as four    extremity blood pressures were closely monitored.
Pre and    postductal saturations as well as four extremity blood    pressures have remained normal.
Serial echos have not    demonstrated evidence of coarctation of the aorta.
Due to hypotension dopamine was started on day of    life number one.
Dobutamine was added on day of life    number three due to persistent hypotension and follow    up echocardiogram showing continued but decreased    biventricular function.
Due to continued issues with hypotension and    pressor requirement, digoxin was added on day of life 11    (without digitalization).
The patient had an UAC and a UVC placed shortly after birth.
Fluids are currently at 140 cc per kilo    per day due to concerns of excessive weight gain and fluid    retention.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  [**Known lastname 58670**] did develop an indirect    hyperbilirubinemia with a maximum bilirubin on day of life    number four of 14.1.
HEME:  The patient was transfused on day of life number    two, day of life number eight, and on day number 21 with    packed red blood cells.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  [**Known lastname 58670**] was initially started on    ampicillin and gentamicin for a 48 hour rule out sepsis    course.
Vancomycin    and gentamicin were again begun on day of life number 13,    again for temperature instability.
The patient is currently on no antibiotics.
Infectious disease service was consulted secondary to the    hypotonia, cardiac dysfunction as well as petechiae.
The patient does have cerebrospinal fluid    on hold at the [**Hospital1 **] laboratory control if there is a need for    further infectious disease or metabolic testing.
NEUROLOGY:  Neurology was consulted on day of life number    one due to marked weakness/hypotonia.
On day of life    number one a head ultrasound was performed which showed    mild ventriculomegaly, but no significant hydrocephalus.
On    day of life number one an MRI was also performed which showed    a structurally normal brain with increased extraaxial fluid.
Ammonia was initially slightly elevated but normal on repeat    (105).
This elevated value prompted an EMG on    day of life 15 which was read as concern for motor neuropathy.
[**Known lastname 58670**] is currently on Fentanyl at 1 mcg per kilo per hour for    pain control (demonstrated by tachycardia and grimacing with    interventions).
Urine    organic acids showed nonspecific elevations.
Serum amino    acids as well as spinal muscular atrophy gene test and    myotonic dystrophy gene test are still pending.
Sepsis ruled out x 3.
Elevated direct bilirubin.
