HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of [**10-12**]% who was in her usual state of health until [**2135-3-29**] when she presented to an outside hospital with chest pain.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarct at that time; however, developed shortness of breath and bilateral pleural effusions, at which time she was transferred to another outside hospital where cardiac catheterization showed clean coronary arteries but increased right-sided pressures.
She was weaned from a dobutamine drip without any changes in her PA catheter numbers.
She was admitted to [**Hospital 6691**] Hospital on [**2135-5-24**] for fevers to 103-104, chills and rigors.
She had reported 5/10 chest pain since admission to [**Hospital 6691**] Hospital.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to evaluate for endocarditis due to her persistent fevers and revealed a very large pericardial effusion.
She describes her chest pain as "pressure" which was nonradiating and not associated with food or shortness of breath.
It started spontaneously when she was at the outside hospital and was worse with inspiration and unrelieved by sublingual nitrogens.
A CT of the chest was performed which showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bilateral small pleural effusions and a 1 by 3 cm infiltrate in the right middle lobe which did not have an appearance of pneumonia.
She had the transthoracic echocardiogram which is as described above which noted a 1.5 cm circumferential effusion with some RA collapse but no RV collapse.
Status post CVA times two, last one occurring approximately three years ago without any residual symptoms.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2135-4-11**] at [**Hospital1 18**] showed EF 10-15%, left ventricular hypokinesis, anterior septal akinesis, small pericardial effusion.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired secretary, lives with her husband who is very supportive and involved in her care.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of a myocardial infarct at age 57.
Maternal uncles all died of myocardial infarct.
She was anxious and mildly dishevelled.
Chest:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally except for decreased breath sounds at the bilateral bases.
Cardiovascular: Tachycardiac but regular with muffled heart sounds.
Abdomen:  Soft, diffuse mild tenderness to palpation.
Extremities:  No lower extremity edema.
There were no [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions or Osler's nodes appreciated.
EKG on admission showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 104, normal axis, normal intervals with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities in V4-V6.
IMPRESSION: This is a 59-year-old female with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of [**10-12**]%, hypertension, history of alcohol abuse who was transferred from an outside hospital after being admitted for a three day history of spiking temperatures, chills, and rigors, found to have a large  pericardial effusion.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of pericardial effusion and possible pericardiocentesis.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed while in the Cardiac Catheterization Holding Area which was found to show no echocardiographic evidence of tamponade with anterior portions of pericardial fluid loculated an echodense.
Her blood pressure was checked and she was found to have no evidence of pulsus paradoxus.
As she was stable at that point, the decision was made not to proceed with pericardiocentesis and monitor the patient with medical management.
She remained hemodynamically stable for the first three days of her hospitalization with heart rate ranging from 90s to low 110s with occasional tachycardia in the 130s to 140s.
On [**2135-5-30**], hospital day number three, she was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and had a right heart catheterization performed which showed cardiac output of 4.5, cardiac index 2.5, PA pressure of 44/27, and no evidence of equalization of pressures.
Therefore, it was felt that conservative management of the effusion was appropriate at that time.
The following day, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 60s and was started on dopamine on the floor.
While in the CCU, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed early unchanged pericardial effusion which was moderate in size, measuring less than 1 cm inferior to the left ventricle, 1-1.5 cm lateral to the left ventricle, less than 0.5 cm around the LV apex and anterior to the right ventricle and greater than 2 cm anterior to the right atrium.
The asymmetric nature of the effusion again suggested loculation.
The Swan-Ganz catheter measured her wedge pressure to be 20, RA pressure of 17, and SVR 730 with an elevated cardiac output of 7.4.
There were 0 red blood cells and 3,100 white blood cells which showed 90% neutrophilic predominance.
Cytology showed no evidence of malignant cells.
On [**2135-6-4**], twenty-four hours after pericardiocentesis, a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed resolution of the pericardial effusion with stable EF of less than 20%.
NONISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY:  As described in the history of the present illness, the patient was diagnosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy in [**2135-3-29**], approximately two months prior to current admission.
She had some chest discomfort during this hospitalization which was thought secondary to her large effusion rather than ischemia given her normal coronary arteries per cardiac catheterization two months prior.
For the three days prior to discharge, she was felt to be volume overloaded and was run negative with a decrease in her weight of approximately 2 kilograms.
At the time of discharge, she was felt to be mildly volume overloaded but back to her baseline.
She was asymptomatic and denied any palpitations, lightheadedness or shortness of breath during these episodes.
Her digoxin level, TSH and chemistry panel were checked following these episodes and were found to be within normal limits except for mildly elevated TSH given her hypothyroidism.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had spiking temperatures through the first three to four days of hospitalization to as high as 102.8.
As she was asymptomatic from a genitourinary point of view, it was not felt that her urine culture was the source of her spiking fevers.
The Infectious Disease team was consulted while she was in the Intensive Care Unit given her Swan numbers of increased cardiac output to 7.3 and a decreased SVR to around 700 for evaluation of infectious etiology of her pericardial effusion and hemodynamic instability.
She was not felt to be septic and the Infectious Disease Team recommended viral serologies for evaluation of the pericardial effusion.
She was found to have a negative IgG and IgM for Mycoplasma and a negative Lyme titer as well.
Therefore, the leading theory for the patient's pericardial effusion was from a viral infection that had not been identified at this time.
The patient remained afebrile for the remainder of the hospitalization.
PULMONARY: During evaluation for fever of unknown origin, she had a CT scan of her torso which showed enlarged right tracheal lymph node measuring 1.8 by 2.1 cm and multiple other prominent right paratracheal lymph nodes as well as multiple subcentimeter prominent lymph nodes in the perivascular space and the aorticopulmonary window.
The Pulmonary Team was consulted on possible mediastinoscopy and biopsy of the larger right tracheal lymph node to evaluate for lymphoma as an etiology of her pericardial effusion.
It was the feeling of the pulmonary team as well as the congestive heart failure team that the lymph nodes were secondary to congestive heart failure and a biopsy was not indicated at this time.
She was also noted to have bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left and given her spiking fevers and unclear etiology of pericardial effusion she was taken to the Interventional Pulmonary Laboratory for possible ultrasound-guided thoracentesis.
Under ultrasound evaluation, she was found to have less than 1 cm of pleural fluid and, therefore, it was not felt that a thoracentesis was indicated.
She did not have the procedure performed and it was felt that her effusions would regress with appropriate diuresis.
CRP was also checked and found to be significantly elevated at 10.88.
Through workup of systemic rheumatologic disease as a cause of her effusion, she had [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] and RF checked which were both found to be negative.
The Rheumatology Team was consulted and did not feel given her clinical history and supportive laboratory tests that she had any evidence of systemic rheumatologic disease.
RIGHT SHOULDER PAIN:  After pericardiocentesis, the patient complained of right shoulder pain which was evaluated by upper extremity ultrasound as this was the location of her central venous catheter while in the Intensive Care Unit.
This was found to be negative for deep venous thrombosis.
A chest x-ray was performed as well and she had no evidence of elevated hemidiaphragm, ruling out phrenic nerve injury as the etiology of the pain.
The pain resolved spontaneously and it was felt that it was most likely positional given her extended period of lying in a decubitus position while in Radiology to have the effusion drained.
HEMATOLOGY:  She was found to have anemia of chronic disease by iron studies.
Her crit remained stable throughout the hospitalization and she was given 2 units of FFP for an elevated INR.
The increased INR was likely secondary to her Coumadin which she was taking as an outpatient but was not continued during the hospitalization.
Pericardial effusion, status post CT-guided drainage, etiology unclear, however, suspect viral source.
Pleural effusions, likely secondary to congestive heart failure.
History of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction 10-14%.
She is being sent out on the [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts Monitor with instructions provided prior to discharge.
