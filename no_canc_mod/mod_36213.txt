Admission Date:  [**2123-11-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2123-11-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2073-8-19**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CARD [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 71222**] is a 50 year old female with a long history of valvular disease.
She recently began to notice a decrease in her activity tolerance as well as lower extremity swelling and also episodes of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The patient also complained of the recent onset of left sided stabbing type chest pain which would last several seconds as well as dyspnea on exertion.
The patient had an echocardiogram performed on [**2123-10-8**], which showed mitral valve to be rheumatically deformed with mild thickening, commissural fusion, mild chordal thickening and four plus mitral regurgitation.
In addition, the aortic valve was also noted to be mildly thickened with two plus regurgitation.
The left ventricle appeared slightly enlarged with end-diastolic dimension of 5.5 and ejection fraction of approximately 60%.
In addition, the patient had cardiac catheterization performed on [**2123-10-22**], which showed normal coronary arteries, but severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic regurgitation, as well as moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
In addition, the patient was noted to have new small bilateral pleural effusions on the chest x-ray as well as small patchy and linear basilar opacities which were confirmed by the CT scan.
Congestive heart failure.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
In general, a thin female in no apparent distress.
No jugular venous distention, no bruits.
III/VI systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   Given symptomatic rheumatic valve disease with severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, the decision was made to have the patient undergo a surgical procedure.
There were no complications.
The patient remained in sinus rhythm with stable blood pressure and slightly tachycardic.
Her sternum remained stable with no drainage or erythema.
A chest x-ray was obtained on [**2123-11-17**], which showed postoperative cardiomegaly, possibly due to a combination of cardiac dilatation and effusion.
Adequate anti-coagulation with Coumadin was difficult to obtain due to baseline mild coagulopathy.
She remained in sinus rhythm without any ectopy.
The patient remained afebrile with stable blood pressure and heart rate.
Severe mitral regurgitation and aortic insufficiency status post aortic valve replacement with mechanical valve (St. Jude's valve), and mitral valve replacement with a prosthetic valve (St. Jude's valve).
Congestive heart failure.
