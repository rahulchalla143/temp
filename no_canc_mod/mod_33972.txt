Admission Date:  [**2136-9-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-9-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-12-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins / Tramadol Hcl / Hydrocodone  Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 69321**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from OSH for obtundation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: lumbar puncture [**2136-9-3**]  History of Present Illness: 82 yo F with h/o dementia, HTN, AS s/p AVR ([**Hospital1 18**]), vasculitis on mycophenolate (Cellcept), admitted [**2136-8-20**] to [**Hospital3 2737**] with VZV encephalitis (1.8 million copies on PCR) with course c/b ARF and worsening obtundation.
Pt presented to OSH on [**8-20**] with increasing confusion and weakness over 48 hours.
Patient apparently improved initially, and MRI on [**8-27**] showed scattered lacunar infarcts but was otherwise unremarkable.
However, she developed increased confusion on [**8-28**].
Renal US showed no hydronephrosis, and acyclovir was DC'd on [**8-30**].
On the floor, patient is minimally responsive.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -Aortic stenosis s/p AVR (21mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Ultra Porcine Valve) [**2133-2-4**] -Osteoarthritis -Pending bilateral knee replacements -Colectomy with h/o colostomy for bowel obstruction/?diverticulitis   Social History: She is a widow with 5 grown children.
Minimally attentive to examiner HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Nonlabored, mildly decreased BS on right with expiratory wheeze, although patient intermittently vocalizing CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, 2/6 SEM c/w prior AVR Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, grimaces diffusely to palapation.
No HSM noted.
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skin: 2-3mm scab over right hip with a few surrounding erythematous macules distriubuted in a linear fashion  Exam on transfer [**2136-9-7**]: VS: afebrile, BP 110s/70s HR in 80-100s, RR 20-30s O2 96% on nonrebreather CV: tachycardic, normal S1/S2 and 2/6 systolic murmur PULM: tachypneic, poor air movements throughout, decreased breath sounds in LLL and bibasilar crackles NEURO: obtunded, opens eyes only to loud voice and noxious stimuli (such as sternal rub and nailbed pressure on extremities).
Does not follow midline or appendicular commands.
No definite acute intracranial abnormality; specifically, there is no evidence of edema, slow diffusion or abnormal enhancement to specifically support the apparently established diagnosis of varicella zoster encephalitis.
Global, particularly central atrophy and extensive sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease with right basal ganglionic chronic lacunes.
Unremarkable cranial MRA with no flow-limiting stenosis.
LENI [**2136-9-4**]: Deep vein thrombosis of both left posterior tibial veins.
Left lower lobe pulmonary embolus.
Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
Sequelae of aortic stenosis (now status post valve replacement), including 4.1 cm ascending aortic dilation and severe left ventricular hypertrophy.
Extensive arterial atherosclerotic calcifications, including the coronary arteries.
New subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage with associated enhancement in the subarachnoid space, in the interpeduncular cistern and right ambient cistern, as well as areas of scattered enhancement in the leptomeninges in the vermis and right frontal lobe.
Abnormal signal in the pons and left medulla with intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left medulla.
These findings could represent a combination of hemorrhage as well as meningitis and encephalitis.
Microbiology: +Varicella PCR on CSF at OSH (1.8 million copies -> <3000 copies) [**2136-9-4**]: VZV PCR <500 copies, negative for HSV, negative [**Male First Name (un) 2326**]  Brief Hospital Course: A/P:82 yo F with h/o dementia, HTN, AS s/p AVR ([**Hospital1 18**]), vasculitis on mycophenolate (Cellcept), admitted [**2136-8-20**] to [**Hospital3 2737**] with VZV encephalitis (1.8 million copies on PCR) with course c/b ARF and worsening obtundation.
Her repeat LP here showed increased WBC in CSF, so she was started on IV bactrim given concern for listeria meningitis by the ID team.
Patient also developed DVT/PE during this hospitalization likely due to her immobility.
Patient was also found to have new subarachnoid hemorrhage and decision was made to transition her to comfort care.
Her pain was managed with morphine and her secretion was managed with scopolamine patch and prn hyocyamine/glycopyrrolate.
Review of reports from OSH showed imaging without signficant acute new process and labs relatively unremarkable.
Patient was continued on acyclovir for treatment of VZV meningoencephalitis and EEG was obtained to evaluate for seizures, which showed slowing and PLEDs but no actual seizure activity.
She was started on Keppra and lacosamide was added to improve the EEG without clinical improvement.
Her initial MRI/MRA of head did not show any evidence of CVA or enhancing area and no evidence of vasculitis on MRI/MRA.
Her repeat MRI on [**2136-9-11**] showed new subarachnoid hemorrhage, and her anticoagulation for DVT/PE were reversed, but upon discussion with her family, decision was made to focus on comfort care given the poor prognosis.
# Pulmonary Embolus: patient developed worsening tachypnea on [**2136-9-4**], doppler of legs showed DVT in left calf.
Patient was started on heparin and CTA was obtained, which showed left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolus.
Her anticoagulation was reversed when she was found to have subarachnoid hemorrhage.
# VZV meningoencephalitis: Patient received at least 7 days acyclovir tx at OSH with reported initial improvement.
# History of PAN: Per her outpatient rheumatologist, patient had a history of muscle biopsy proven polyarteritis nodosa 5-6 years ago.
Mycophenolate Mofetil Dose is Unknown  PO Frequency is Unknown  Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: VZV encephalitis, deep vein thrombosis, hospital acquired pneumonia Secondary Diagnosis: dementia, aortic stenosis s/p tissue aortic valve replacement, hypertension, polyarteritis nodosum   Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] where she was found to have VZV encephalitis (infection of the brain) because she had worsening level of awakefulness.
Repeat lumbar puncture was done and showed that she still had a lot of white blood cells, suspicious for infection.
She were treated with acyclovir and Bactrim was also added to treat possible infection with listeria.
Her course was also complicated by a pulmonary embolism and then bleeding into the brain.
