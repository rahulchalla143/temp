He was c/o chest pain.
While being evaluated by plastics for multiple facial lacerations, he was noted to have ST elevations in III, V1-V3 with ST depressions in I and aVL and was urgently transferred to the cath lab.
Pt had 2 episodes of VF and was shocked twice at 200j.
He was found to have a dissected ostial lesion of the RCA, which was stented.
Noted on CT are multiple right-sided rib fractures, small right pleural effusion, communited nasal fracture.
A c-spine CT shows an acute small fracture "chip" at the anteroinferior corner of C5.
ABG was 7.29/47/119/24 and there was concern that he was developing respiratory acidosis secondary to splinting from his rib fractures.
Anesthesia was consulted in anticipation of possible intubation for airway protection in the setting of multiple facial fractures and bloody emesis.
Anesthesia succeeded in intubating patient using fiberoptic guidance; surgery was available in case of the need for an urgent trach.
On review of symptoms, his wife denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems could only be conducted with the wife at the time of admission; she denied that the pt had recently c/o chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

L eye swollen with ecchymosis.
No murmur noted, no S3 or S4.
Diffuse crackles, no wheeze or rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, non-distended, No HSM or tenderness.

Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with ST elevations in III and V1-V3 with reciprocal depressions in I and aVL.
No prior EKG available for comparison.
Post-cath EKG notable for continued ST elevations in V1-V2, III and depressions in I and aVL.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: sinus tach with frequent PVCs; episode of VFib on admission to CCU .
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2181-10-6**] demonstrated:  non-dominant RCA, no CAD in LMCA, LAD, or LCx; balloon dilation of proximal RCA, re-stenosed, finally re-inflated with placement of BMS.
CT C/A/P ([**2181-10-6**]): CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of traumatic injury to the heart or great vessels and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
There is a small axial hiatal hernia.
Lung windows reveal atelectasis at the right base.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally and there is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
Hypodense round lesion near the mid pole of the right kidney measures 26 mm and is likely a cyst.
Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable and there is no free air, free fluid or pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
There is no free fluid within the pelvis or pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.
CT C-Spine [**10-6**]: A linear lucency at the anteroinferior corner of C5 likely represents a small acute fracture.
No other fracture or alignment abnormality is observed.
No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Complex comminuted fractures involving the nasal bones and nasal septum with edema and hemorrhage as described.
CT Head [**10-8**]: Compared with the prior head CT scan, there is no indication of interval development of an intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or visible major vascular territorial infarction.
The present study suggests the possibility of a punctate chronic lacunar-type infarct within the right cerebellar hemisphere.
A commensurate scan was not obtained so on the previous study, making it difficult to determine whether this finding has actually developed in the two days between scans, or more likely was present previously, but obscured by partial volume artifact.
Certainly, there is considerably more soft tissue opacification of multiple paranasal sinuses, largely due to the presence of intrasinus hemorrhage.
There are no other new extracranial abnormalities discerned.
CONCLUSION:  No new intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Multiple right-sided rib fractures.
Right-sided lung effusion, which has slightly increased since the previous CT exam.
New bilateral lung lobe collapse.
Persistent bilateral renal enhancement on the non-contrast study suggesting an element of ATN.
No intra-abdominal or pelvic injury similar to the prior [**2181-10-6**] CT. .
CT sinus mandible [**10-8**]: There is a massively comminuted nasal bone fracture bilaterally, and as indicated in your history, comminuted fracture also involving the nasal septum, as well as the anterior nasal spine.
There is a 3 mm osseous fragment which appears within the soft tissues, likely involving the right upper lip region, and measuring 4 1/2 mm in length.
This could be a bone fragment or foreign body.
Also, the finding could represent a tooth fracture fragment.
There is a large air- fluid level within the frontal sinus as well as within both sphenoid sinus air cells.
There are bilateral air-fluid levels also within the maxillary sinuses.
There is enlargement of the incisive canal, which measures nearly 9 mm in diameter and probably represents a simple cyst in this locale.
MRI of Head on [**10-12**]: FINDINGS: There is a small focus of slow diffusion seen within the right cerebellar hemisphere with high signal on diffusion images and subtle low signal on ADC map consistent with a small acute infarct.
There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus seen.
There are no other foci of slow diffusion seen or abnormal signal seen within the brain.
Following gadolinium, there is no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen.
The visualized paranasal sinuses including both sphenoid sinus, ethmoid air cells, maxillary sinus as well as frontal sinuses demonstrate extensive soft tissue changes with sphenoid sinus to contain high T1 material indicative of blood or inspissated secretions.
Bilateral or soft tissue changes are also seen in the middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells.
CT of Chest [**10-16**]: FINDINGS: The previously noted hemothorax on the right has markedly decreased, with bilateral small pleural effusions, measuring less than 20 [**Doctor Last Name **], with dependent atelectasis.
There is small apical and anterior and basilar pneumothorax, as seen on the prior chest x-ray.
There is atelectasis on the right upper lobe.
There are patchy opacities at the lung bases, likely due to resolving atelectasis.
Small mediastinal nodes are again noted.
There is mucous secretion in the trachea.
Again note is made of multiple acute rib fractures on the right side, with comminution, as seen on the prior study.
There is pleural fluid and soft tissue swelling adjacent to the chest tube insertion site.
No evidence of a right-sided DVT.

Hospital course c/b L popliteal DVT and ?
# Ischemia: Patient admitted with STEMI, with severe single vessel CAD of the RCA with question of dissection versus ruptured plaque.
The patient had a BMS stent placed in the proximal RCA complicated by distal embolization.
# Rhythm: Patient had multiple episodes of VFib in setting of RCA MI both in the ED as well as during cardiac catheterization requiring defibrillation.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and was without further conduction abnormalities or ventricular arrhythmias.
# Pump: Patient with preserved biventricular systolic EF and no valvular abnormalities.
# Respiratory Distress requiring intubation for inability to protect airway with facial trauma:  Patient was sedated and intubated for multiple days of hospitalization.
Etiology includes rescriction secondary to rib fractures, aspiration pneumonia, or hemothorax.
Patient's ventilation support was weaned and patient self-extubated without complicaton.
# Facial Lacerations: Was seen by plastics s/p MVA with bedside repaired at bedside by plastics.
Patient additionally seen by opthalmology, who said no evidence of compartment syndrome.
# Leukocytosis w/ low grade Fevers: - possible etiologies include central line infection, stress reponse in setting of trauma, MI, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, or hemothorax.
All initial cultures were negative, but patient treated with Vanc/Zosyn + azithromycin to cover atypical infection of sinuses.
Continued to have low grade temps and, blood cultures from [**10-21**] grew 1/4 bottles coag negative staph.
# Acute Renal Failure (resolved): - Causes were either prerenal, renal, or postrenal.
Felt most likely to be prerenal given episodes of hypotension, decreased renal perfusion with VFib, low BP, dehydration following trauma.
