Admission Date:  [**2198-6-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-6-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2180-4-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4659**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2198-6-2**] Diagnostic laparoscopy with evacuation of hematoma.
History of Present Illness: 18 year old male restrained driver s/p MVC versus telephone pole requiring jaws of life for extracation.
Head-on collision; transfer from [**Hospital3 **] to [**Hospital1 18**] for aortic dissection on imaging as well as a tiny right PTX.
Neck: No masses, Trachea midline, Thyroid normal size, non-tender, no masses or nodules, No right carotid bruit, No left carotid bruit.
Nodes: No clavicular/cervical adenopathy, No inguinal adenopathy.
Skin: No atypical lesions.
Gastrointestinal: Non distended, No masses, No hepatosplenomegally.
Diffusely tender to palpation with +guarding, no rebound.
Extremities: No popiteal aneurysm, No femoral bruit/thrill, No RLE edema, No LLE Edema, No varicosities, No skin changes.
Focal aortic dissection with flap at the level of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] with surrounding hematoma.
Some more hyperdense material does suggest acute bleeding, but no definite active extravasation is present.
Fluid and blood within the pelvis.
Equivocal dissection flap at the level just above the diaphragmatic hiatus in the descending thoracic aorta is likely due to motion artifact from the heart as there is no surrounding hematoma.
Multifocal pulmonary contusions.
No pneumothorax.
Probable non-displaced manubrial fracture (discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9100**] on the evening of the same day).
No definite evidence for solid organ injury.
[**2198-6-2**] Left Tib/fib :  No definite fracture; however, possible incomplete ossification, or result of prior injury at the medial malleolus.
If patient has pain referable to this site, then dedicated ankle radiograph should be performed to better evaluate.
Stable abdominal aortic dissection at the level of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] with adjacent hematoma.
No active arterial extravasation from the aorta.
Some increased volume of fluid in the pelvis containing blood.
No thoracic aortic dissection.
Pulmonary contusions in the anterior lungs bilaterally which are little changed.
No pneumothorax.
Similar to the previous study, no solid organ injury.
Suspected non-displaced fracture of the manubrium.
Stable abdominal aortic dissection at the level of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
No evidence of active extravasation or progression of dissection.
Nonvisualization of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] origin, with filling distally that is likely retrograde; the only change is decreased opacification along the residual take-off of the inferior mesenteric artery.
Atypical configuration of the celiac artery, with focal stenosis seen 2 cm distal to the origin as the artery abruptly angles anteriorly.
This is stable from prior studies and is unlikely to be post-traumatic although there may be signficant celiac stenosis.
Redemonstration of pulmonary contusions.
New pneumoperitoneum and extensive subcutaneous emphysema reflects recent laparoscopy.
[**2198-6-3**] Left tib/fib : There is a nondisplaced, comminuted fracture predominantly transverse or slightly oblique, traversing [**Doctor Last Name **] medial malleolus extending into the mortise joint.
No talar dome OCD or distal fibular fracture is detected.
No fracture is seen along the posterior aspect of the distal tibia.
There is surrounding soft tissue swelling most pronounced medially.
No other fractures are detected.
[**2198-6-4**] Aortic US : There is a focal aortic dissection with a near circumferential luminal plaque in the aorta approximately 4 cm above the bifurcation, in a similar location to the CT examinations.
These measurements are all similar to the prior CTA examinations allowing for differences in technique.
No new areas concerning for aortic dissection are identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transferred from LGH to [**Hospital1 18**] with possible aortic injury after his MVA.
His CT torso showed a focal aortic dissection at the level of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] with surrounding hematoma.
no flow seen in the [**Female First Name (un) 899**], but SMA and celiac appear patent.
The images were extensively reviewed and after a repeat CTA was performed showing a stable abdominal aortic dissection with no active arterial extravasation but increased volume of fluid in the pelvis containing blood, a decision was made to take him to the OR for an exploratory laparoscopy.
In the OR a loop of proximal jejunum seemed bruised and edematous with a hematoma but viable.
On tertiary survey a left ankle XR showed a nondisplaced, comminuted fx for which Ortho recommended closed treatment with casting.
He will be followed by Aortic US for his aortic injury.
He had a short left leg cast placed for his ankle fracture and was using crutches to walk without difficulty.
4. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Left ankle fracture 4.
Non displaced manubrium fracture   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital after your car accident with multiple injuries.
You underwent diagnostic surgery as there was fluid in your abdomen probably from the impact of the accident causing bruising and swelling of the small bowel.
There was no active bleeding and it was not related to the aortic dissection.
Multiple scans were done to assess any interval changes in the aorta and they remain the same.
* Your left ankle is broken and will be managed in a short leg cast.
* You had a small portion of your right lung collapse due to extra air but that has resolved.
* Make sure that you have regular bowel movements and if needed take a stool softener or gentle laxative.
* If you develop any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, weakness or any other symptoms that concern you please call your doctor or return to the Emergency Room.
