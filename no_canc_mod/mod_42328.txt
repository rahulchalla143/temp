He also complained of polydipsia and polyuria as well as a chest burning sensation.
In the Emergency Room he was found to have a blood sugar of 990 as well as a metabolic acidosis (7.1-15-150).

No significant ST or T wave changes.
No Q waves noted.
Endocrine:  The patient was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis with metabolic acidosis, a significant anion gap.
[**Last Name (un) **] diabetes consulted and throughout the rest of his stay and NPH and regular insulin were titrated to control his blood sugar.
The patient also received diabetes education and is scheduled for a follow up appointment with the [**Hospital **] Clinic Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12746**] on [**8-24**] at 9:30 a.m.  2.

An echocardiogram was done on [**8-10**], which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 to 30% with global hypokinesis and akinesis in the inferior wall.
A follow up stress test was done, which again revealed hypokinetic motion in the inferior wall, however, the patient was not found to have any perfusion defects and was able to achieve 84% of his heart rate with exercise.
Gastrointestinal:  On admission the patient complained of mid epigastric burning.
He was found to have an elevated amylase and lipase, which trended downward during his stay.
