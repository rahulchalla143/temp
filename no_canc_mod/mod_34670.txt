Patient reports marked pain at lumbar area post-fall, but was able to ambulate.
Over the next week his pain progressed to the point he could no longer ambulate.
While there he was noted with hypoxic, and imaging there was consistent with an aspiration pneumonia, and he was started on vancomycin/Zosyn.
A CT of his back, along with MRI demonstrated a communuted fracture of L1 with cord-compression.
Of note, he suffered an NSTEMI in [**5-10**], which was medically managed.
At OSH, he did not have leukocytosis, but on arrival here it had progressed to 17 on arrival here.

He also had decreased light touch sensation in the lower extremities bilaterally.
He was placed on bedrest, and his pain was controlled with dilaudid.
OSH imaging showed material in the left mainstem bronchus and left lower lobe collapse, likely due to aspiration.
Pulmonary was consulted, and on HD2, he was transferred to the MICU for bronchoscopic removal of foreign material in the left mainstem bronchus.
Gram stain returned 2+ gram positive rods and 1+ yeast.
Culture returned positive for yeast.
