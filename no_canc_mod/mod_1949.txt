There is no shift of midline structures or evidence of central herniation.
Prominent ventricles and sulci are consistent with age-related atrophy, without evidence of hydrocephalus.
Periventricular white matter hypoattenuation is compatible with chronic small vessel infarciton.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION:  Large 4.8-cm left parieto-occipital acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema and intraventricular extension.
No evidence of central herniation.
The tip of the catheter projects over the middle parts of the stomach, the course of the catheter is unremarkable, there is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Mild areas of atelectasis at the left and right lung bases.
No evidence of other parenchymal opacities, notably no evidence of pneumonia.
There is mild fluid overload and a plate-like atelectasis at the left lung bases that has minimally increased in extent.
The pre-existing minimal left pleural effusion is unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
However, there is a loop in the distal nasogastric tube.
There is improvement of the atelectasis at the lung bases.
There remains low lung volumes.
There are no pneumothoraces.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo RHF with HTN, DM, moderate dementia, with acute onset R sided weakness and facial droop and found to have large IPH on NCHCT.
Other causes include underlying vascular abnormalities (eg.
Localization of IPH was not typical for hypertensive bleed.
ICU course [**Date range (3) 12449**]: Overnight patient was agitated with hypertension and tachycardia and received olanzepine.
She was given standing IV tylenol for presumed pain which made her drowsy and less agitated.
Patient underwent repeat NCHCT which showed stable L parieto-occipital hemorrhage and she was transfered to the floor for further monitoring and treatment.
She as kept on contact precautions for prior [**Name (NI) 12450**] Staphylococcus aureus infection with one negative MRSA isolate on screening on this admission.
She was noted to have intermittent nonsustained VT which lessened after repleting electrolytes.
ACS was consulted who recommended IR-guided placement due to a prior abdominal surgery.
This was placed on [**5-8**] without complication.
[ ] Please avoid long-term antithrombotic medications such as aspirin or warfarin.
