Admission Date:  [**2193-2-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2193-2-16**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year-old male admitted to the MICU with sepsis, hypertension, status post episode of ventricular tachycardia now on pressors.
He has an extensive history of peripheral vascular disease and status post left femoral popliteal bypass with a jump graft and a left second toe amputation and revision.
The patient was found to have a gangrenous wound with involvement of the left third toe with purulent discharge and breakdown of the incision site and underwent further debridement and revision.
He was evaluated by his vascular surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and thought to be stable for rehab and that the wound was viable and without need for further surgical intervention.
The patient was at rehab when he started complaining of difficulty swallowing and coughing up dried blood on [**2193-2-13**] and neck pain.
Rehab doctor was called to evaluate the patient for same complaints and blood pressure was noted to be 70/40 with a heart rate of 92, white count 33.6.
Blood cultures from [**2193-2-12**] had four out of four bottles growing gram positive cocci while on Vancomycin and Levaquin and the patient was febrile to 102.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**], but on route developed ventricular tachycardia while on Dopamine and was diverted to [**Hospital3 11531**].
Apparently ventricular tachycardia spontaneously resolved and the patient was stable in their Emergency Department and he was sent to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department while awaiting MICU bed.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2169**], status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2183**], status post catheterization in [**11-8**] with patent left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, patent supraventricular tachycardia to obtuse marginal two and occluded saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery.
Exercise MIBI on [**2192-11-22**] showed fixed apical defects, severe fixed distal anterior wall defect with minimal reversible defect in distal inferior wall, global left ventricular hypokinesis and apical akinesis, EF of 22%.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis since [**11-8**], hypercholesterolemia, renal cell carcinoma status post right nephrectomy in [**2182**] with metastasis to bone treated with radiation therapy in [**10/2192**] with metastasis to gallbladder status post cholecystectomy and status post abdominal wall dissection.
Hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease status post above surgeries.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.
In general the patient is in bed in no acute distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Neck mildly swollen and full, nontender, no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs with decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Cardiovascular irregular irregular rhythm.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities left lower extremity with TMA frankly necrotic, but no purulence.
Rhythm strip with sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Electrocardiogram subsequently showed atrial fibrillation rate of 97, Q waves in 3 and V1, poor R wave progression, no ST or T wave changes, unchanged from [**2193-1-30**].
Chest x-ray showed possible right lower lobe infiltrate with obscured right hemidiaphragm.
CT of the neck showed degenerative changes of the cervical spine, but no pharyngeal fluid collections.
The patient was also complaining of new onset right sided blindness.
There is no evidence of septic emboli.
The patient's blindness was consistent with AION.
The patient was also seen by the Infectious Disease Service for his staph aureus bacteremia, which is likely secondary to his gangrenous foot.
Other sources of infection could hve included his dialysis catheter.
Immediately after his intubation the patient became increasingly hypotensive and also had an episode of ventricular tachycardia and also had several episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.
The patient also had a metabolic acidosis, which was being poorly compensated.
CAUSE OF DEATH: Respiratory failure secondary to sepsis.
