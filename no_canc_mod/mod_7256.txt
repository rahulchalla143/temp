Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 28 year old brittle diabetic admitted in DKA and with dental abscess.
A central line was placed in the MICU due to poor peripheral access, and the central line was discontinued 4 days later after an IR-guided PICC line was placed.
The patient was unable to eat very much, and was also refusing to have an NG tube placed or parenteral nutrition.
Her diabetic control was also complicated by the patient's inability to sense episodes of hypoglycemia.
Mandibular Dental abscess: Her R mandibular dental abscess was debrided on [**2111-1-24**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2866**] from Oral Maxillofacial Surgery.
Micro data from bone and tooth granulation tissue cultures were suggestive of osteomyelitis, with multiple gram-positives and gram-negative rods, as well as MSSA and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
The patient continued to have significant jaw pain unrelieved by high doses of morphine and tramadol, and the pain clinic was also consulted for her management.
CT imaging of her jaw showed no evidence of osteomyelitis, and her bone pathology was also negative for signs of acute osteomyelitis.
A panoramic X-ray of her teeth indicated possible involvement of tooth #28, and this tooth was extracted on [**2111-2-5**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2866**].
The patient was discharged with a PICC line in place for IV clindamycin at home, as well as po levafloxacin and fluconazole, for 5 weeks for presumptive osteomyelitis.
Urinary Retention: During her admission, the patient also was complaining of very low urine output despite adequate fluid intake, and difficulty voiding.
Bedside bladder scans indicated bladder retention of volumes ranging from 500-900 cc of urine.
Her renal function was monitored closely, and she never showed signs of renal failure or urinary tract infection.
Asthma: The patient also demonstrated increased wheezing from her baseline asthma during her admission.
However, her symptoms did not resolve upon discontinuing the ampacillin.
Lower extremity edema: The patient began to complain of lower extremity swelling and tenderness 2 days prior to discharge.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was performed and showed no evidence of DVT.
On discharge, her edema had improved somewhat, but the etiology of her mild edema remained unclear.
Chronic sinusitis: The patient was concerned about her chronic problems with sinusitis.
No acute issues.
She was at times refusing interventions that were deemed to be necessary for preventing life-threatening complications.
Her medical team focused on being non confrontational, bargaining with the patient and trying to present options for her management.
Her nortryptiline was increased to 75mg qhs during admission, and benzodiazepines were used as needed for anxiety.
Anemia: The patient also developed a mild iron-deficiency anemia that was stable for most of her hospital stay, likely [**1-15**] poor nutrition.
She did have one episode of watery diarrhea, and her stool was negative for C. Diff.
Clonazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
