Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with an acute infection of your gall bladder call cholecystitis.
You will complete 2 weeks of antibiotics for your infection and then follow up with the surgeons to discuss possibly removing the tube in your gall bladder and removing your gall bladder all together with a cholecystectomy.
While you were here, we also became concerned about your heart as it seemed to be showing signs of stress from your infection.
