NG tube with sideport in the distal thoracic esophagus.
Incompletely imaged left humeral head fracture.
Left lower lobe ill-defined opacity, likely representing pneumonia.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Scattered ill-defined nodular opacities within the lungs, likely infectious in etiology.
CT HEAD [**2169-2-23**]: No acute intracranial process.
Sinus disease as noted above.
RADIOGRAPH OF L HUMERUS [**2169-2-23**]: IMPRESSION: Comminuted fracture of the right proximal humerus .
AP BL HIPS [**2169-2-23**]: IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation.
No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Nonspecific T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Differential includes pleomorphic adenoma.
ROUTINE EEG [**2169-2-24**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a mildly slow and disorganized background.
There were no focal, lateralized or epileptiform abnormalities noted.
The background is suggestive of a mild encephalopathy.
Delayed precordial R wave transition.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2169-2-24**] (PRELIM): There are no acute fractures.
There is multilevel degenerative disease of the cervical spine with loss of the normal cervical lordosis.
Anterior osteophytes and disc space narrowing are present at multiple levels, most pronounced at C5-C6 with moderate-severe neural foraminal narrowing on both sides.
ECHO ([**2169-2-28**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with mild [1+] mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 yo female with history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma with an upper respiratory tract infection who presented with acute mental status changes and left proximal humerus fracture s/p fall and was found to have pneumonia, intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress.
CT chest showed scattered nodular infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia.
It was unclear whether this was a bacterial superinfection from her viral URI, aytpical pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia secondary to her acute mental status changes.
Bronchoscopy with broncheoalveolar lavage showed no organisms.
She was empirically treated for severe community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, then transitioned to ceftriaxone and doxycycline given concern for QT prolongation on levofloxacin, for a 7-day total course of antibiotics.
Antibiotics and oseltamivir were stopped on day of discharge due to patient's resolved respiratory symptoms and completed course.
# Acute mental status changes:  Her presentation was initially concerning for meningitis/encephalitis, however CSF was negative for growth of any organisms.
Head CT and MRI did not show any acute pathology.
EEG showed mild encephalopathy without evidence of seizure.
She was kept on telemetry on the floor and had no recorded events.
In the end, her change in mental status was thought to be possibly due to a concussion from a mechanical fall as pt denied loss of sensation, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations or any prodrome to fall.
# Left proximal humeral fracture:   Patient suffered a fracture of her left proximal humerus s/p her fall at home.
Orthopedic consult recommended a sling for her arm, and she was given Percocet and Tylenol as needed for her pain.
# Congestive heart failure:  She was not noted to be volume-overloaded on exam throughout her hospitalization.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Two (2)  PO BID (2 times a day): Please take for constipation while on Percocet.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for pain for 3 days.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a day: Please take for constipation while on Percocet.

Secondary: Hypertension Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Asthma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with altered mental status after a fall at home.
You were found to have pneumonia and were admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress.
You were given antibiotics for your pneumonia and Tamiflu for possible influenza.
You were also found to have a fracture of your arm (left humerus).
You had several medical tests to determine if there was a cause to your falling, including a study of your heart (echocardiogram) and to screen for seizures (EEG) and these did not show any signficant abnormalities.
