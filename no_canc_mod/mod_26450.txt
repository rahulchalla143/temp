KUB [**1-17**] FINDINGS: Suboptimal positioning, please note diaphragms and inferior pelvis and part of the right abdomen not included in the radiograph.
There are markedly distended loops of bowel measuring up to 6.5 cm concerning for small-bowel obstruction.
Patent left-sided upper extremity vasculature.
Nonocclusive thrombus of the right internal jugular vein, and occlusive thrombus of the right axillary vein, right cephalic vein, one of the right brachial veins, and the right AV fistula.
KUB [**1-19**] Wet Read: SJBj [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2113-1-17**] 10:11 PM Dilated small bowel loop up to 5.5cm.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old man with a PMH notable for ESRD on HD (MWF), chronic aspiration, seizure disorder, history of CVA with residual left-sided weakness and dysarthria, who presented to the ED with AMS and dehydration.
ACTIVE ISSUES # Aspiration Pneumonia: Pt required transfer to the MICU from [**1-17**] - [**1-18**] for management of aspiration.
Pt was noted to be in respiratory distress and hypoxia but did not require intubation.
Pt has a documented history of chronic aspiration likely secondary to his CVA, and has been evaluated by speech and swallow multiple times in the past with increased risk for aspiration.
Family in the past had insisted on continued feeding, regardless of aspiration risk with preference for quality of life to be considered to be the number one priority by the family.
Also hx of mucus plugging responsive to chest PT and suction.
He was treated with vancomycin and zosyn initially for his febrile illness but this was switched to vancomycin and meropenem given concern for zosyn related rash on his abdomen.
The patient had no further aspiration events.
#) Chronic aspiration: Palliative care and ethics was consulted to assist in facilitating the discussion about code status and chronic aspiration.
# SBO: Pt developed vomiting and aspiration symptoms on [**1-17**] and a KUB showed small bowel obstruction, most likely [**2-23**] to an adhesion.
He denied persistent nausea, abd pain or distension.
Repeat KUB on [**1-21**] suggested resolution of the SBO and he tolerated his diet without any further obstructive symtptoms.
# Hypoglycemia: Patient presented with hypoglycemia of unknown etiology.
The hypoglyemia would appear only when he was NPO despite normal liver function and no administration of insulin.
The timing of the tests did not capture a moment of true hypoglyemia (BG <40 or <60 with symptoms) and therefore could not rule out an endocrinopathy.
Work up was interrupted by resolution of his hypoglyecmia after advancing his dysphagia diet.
Upper extremity ultrasound showed clots in multiple RUE deep veins and the R IJ.
Neuro evaluated patient and did not feel that AMS was [**2-23**] CVA or active seizing.
Not likely acute intracranial process as no changed on CT head w/o.
# Fistula thrombosis/Access: Following his stay in the ICU the patient had a thrombosed RUE AVG in [**11/2112**] (the LUE AVG was removed [**2-23**] infectin).
Access was a very challenging problem as his vasculature was either thrombosed on the right or being salvaged for a future fistula on the left for new fistula creation.
# ESRD on HD: MWF, received dialysis on schedule.
# thrombocytopenia: Pt with macroycytic anemia and thrombocytopenia prior.
# CAD/CVA history: ECG unchanged from prior.
Hx of recent RP bleed on [**11/2112**] hospitalization related to anticoagulation.
# Depression: Was formerly on fluoxetine as listed [**Year (4 digits) **] med but held on [**Year (4 digits) **] as it causes hypoglycemia and it can lower the seizure threshold.
After consultation with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and the tranplant surgeons, his tunneled line cannot be converted to a VIP port, and he has no other veins available for central access given his multiple clots and left arm reserved for fistulization.
Very challenging situation as he will likely return to the hospital for future aspiration events and the family is aware of this.

[**Hospital1 **] Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] LivingCenter - Heathwood - [**Location (un) 55**]  [**Location (un) **] Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia Chronic aspiration Encephalopathy Hypoglycemia Deep venous thrombosis   [**Location (un) **] Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
[**Location (un) **] Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for fever and vomiting thought to be related to an infection from aspiration.
You had an nasal tube placed for medication administration and drainage of your stomach fluids as you were found to have a small bowel obstruction as well.
This was treated with bowel rest until the obstruction resolved.
Your family was made aware of the risks of choking on food, respiratory failure, infection, and rehospitalization but still prefer you to be full code (meaning undergo CPR and use of breathing machine if your heart would stop).
With the help of the IV team and the transplant surgeons who have evaluated you before, it was decided to try to avoid placing IVs in the left arm for future fistula placements.
This will likely fluctuate so you should continue to have your INR monitored.
