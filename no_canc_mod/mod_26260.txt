Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 71942**] Admission Date: [**2159-3-22**] Discharge Date: [**2159-3-28**] Date of Birth:  [**2159-3-22**] Sex:  M Service:  NB   HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 4597**] was born at 33-1/7-weeks gestation and admitted to the NICU with prematurity and respiratory distress.
This pregnancy was notable for gestational diabetes treated with insulin requiring several earlier hospitalizations.
This pregnancy was also complicated recently by development of pregnancy induced hypertension and preterm labor prompting initial admission to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and then transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-3-17**].
Contractions initially abated; but due to the persistent hypertension, labor was subsequently augmented leading to a vaginal delivery.
There was no maternal fever during labor and rupture of membranes occurred 4 hours prior to delivery.
At delivery, the infant emerged with a good cry and tone requiring blow-by oxygen for duskiness with quick improvement.
Infant was placed on CPAP initially for intermittent apnea and moderate work of breathing.
This is an LGA premature infant, mildly reduced activity at rest, mild work of breathing on CPAP.
Skin: Warm and dry, no rash.
Neck: Supple, no lesions.
Chest: Moderate aeration, mild retractions and tachypnea on CPAP, symmetric breath sounds.
Abdomen: Soft, no hepatosplenomegaly, no mass, quiet bowel sounds.
Neuro: Mildly reduced tone and activity.
He     has presented with mild apnea of prematurity having     approximately [**2-5**] quick self-resolved spells per day and     has not been treated with any methylxanthine therapy thus     far.
He does remain comfortably tachypneic at times with     respiratory rates in the 60s-90s range, clear and equal     breath sounds, and very minor retractions.
Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition: He was made NPO on     admission to the NICU due to the respiratory distress and     a peripheral IV was placed.
His D-sticks have remained normal with no     hypoglycemia documented ever.
GI: He developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin     level of 13.5/0.3 which was on [**2159-3-25**], day of     life 3 at which time he started phototherapy and had     received 4 days of phototherapy which phototherapy lights     were discontinued on [**2159-3-28**], in the a.m.
He has had no other GI issues.
No further hematocrits or platelets have     been measured.
Infectious disease: The CBC and blood culture were     screened on admission to the NICU due to the premature     labor and premature delivery.
The CBC was within normal     limits with no bands and no left shift.
No     neurologic testing has been done on this infant.
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should     be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who     meet any of the following 4 criteria: 1) born at less     than 32-weeks gestation; 2) born between 32-35 weeks with     2 of the following: Daycare during RSV season, a smoker     in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway     abnormalities, or school-age siblings; 3) chronic lung     disease; or 4) hemodynamically significant congenital     heart defect.
Before this age and for the 1st 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Prematurity born at 33-1/7-weeks gestation, respiratory distress resolving, sepsis ruled out, infant of a diabetic mother, apnea of prematurity ongoing, hyperbilirubinemia ongoing, large for gestational age infant.
