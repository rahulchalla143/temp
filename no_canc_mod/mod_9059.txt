The mother developed preterm labor on [**2150-6-19**] and was treated with magnesium sulfate.
The infant was delivered by cesarean section under spinal anesthesia for footling breech presentation.
General:  Active, preterm, nondysmorphic infant.
Skin:  Smooth and pink, no rashes.
Mild retractions.
Abdomen:  Soft, no hepatosplenomegaly.
She had several episodes of spontaneous apnea and bradycardia.
She continues to have some mild feeding immaturity with drifting of oxygen saturations during feeds that resolve with frequent rests; these have been improving over the days prior to discharge.
A soft murmur has been noted during admission.
Murmur is thought to be consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis and/or flow.
Infectious disease:  Due to the unknown etiology of the preterm labor, [**Female First Name (un) **] was evaluated for sepsis shortly after admission.
A blood culture drawn prior to starting antibiotics was no growth.
Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname **] was treated for hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
Neurology:  [**Known lastname **] has maintained a normal neurologic examination during admission and there are no neurological concerns at the time of discharge.
There were significant social concerns which emerged during admission.
With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the Fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: We would recommend screening ultrasound for hip dysplasia, due to the history of breech presentation, within two months of discharge.
Suspicion for sepsis ruled out.
Apnea of prematurity resolved.
Increased risk for congenital hip dysplasia.
