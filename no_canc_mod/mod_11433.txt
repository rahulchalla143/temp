HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 65 year old gentleman with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times four vessels 22 years ago, status post a recent admission to [**Hospital1 1444**] and discharged on [**2149-2-25**], at which time he had chest pain and dyspnea on exertion.
At that time, he ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a troponin of 10 and a peak CK of 796.
He was ultimately discharged on Atenolol, Zestril, aspirin,  He did well until his day of admission on the 28th, when he noticed some urinary frequency in the late evening.
He was eating dinner and he felt nauseated and vomited several times.
He subsequently had one episode of loose brown stool which he notes no blood.
He then went on to have rigors and went to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital3 4298**].
There he was found to be hypotensive and was placed on Dopamine after being given 1.5 liters of normal saline.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] with the diagnosis of urosepsis and acute renal failure with a BUN and creatinine of 31/2.1, baseline creatinine 0.9.
normal saline bolus and was treated with Vancomycin and a dose of gentamicin due to a questionable infection of his right groin where his cardiac catheterization had been obtained.
Coronary artery disease status post four-vessel coronary artery bypass graft 22 years ago; status post recent myocardial infarction with catheterization which revealed two occluded SVG grafts, however, no intervention was performed.
High cholesterol.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Anicteric sclerae.
No jugular venous distention appreciated.
Back examination revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Right groin was erythematous with a hematoma but was not warm or tender.
Chest x-ray revealed mild heart failure.
Urosepsis:  The patient with a positive urinalysis, hypotensive, symptoms of urinary tract infection, presumed diagnosis of urosepsis.
After blood cultures were negative times 48 hours, Vancomycin was discontinued and the patient was continued on Levaquin for urinary tract infection on which the patient will be discharged to complete a 14 day course.
Renal:  The patient was admitted with acute renal failure secondary to prerenal and plus/minus ATN.
Genitourinary:  The patient with a history of urinary tract infection one month ago.
Given this is the second urinary tract infection with a known diagnosis of benign prostatic hypertrophy, the patient will need to follow-up with Urology for a possible transurethral resection of prostate for treatment of his benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Acute renal failure.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Coronary artery disease status post four-vessel coronary artery bypass graft 22 years ago; status post recent myocardial infarction with catheterization which revealed two occluded SVG grafts, however, no intervention was performed.
High cholesterol.
Peripheral vascular disease.
The patient will need to follow-up with Urology for a possible transurethral resection of prostate given his benign prostatic hypertrophy and history of urinary tract infections.
