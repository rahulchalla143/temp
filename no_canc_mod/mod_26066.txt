History of Present Illness: 74-year-old female with history of severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.75 cm2, peak/mean gradients 75/50 mmHg), who presented with substernal chest pain and EKG changes.
She presented again to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2163-4-21**] with abdominal pain and a CT abdomen showed gallbladder inflammation suggestive of acute cholecystitis.
The next day she developed mid-chest pain while lying in bed; not associated with activity, no exacerbating/alleviating factors.
Was considered to be having demand ischemia in the setting of acute cholecystitis.
On [**4-23**] a perc cholecystostomy tube was placed given her high risks for surgery and her WBC improved, has been afebrile and abdominal pain improving, although her troponins continued to rise up to 2.5 this am.
A cardiac cath was performed showing 90% stenosis of LCX and 60% stenosis of LAD.
- PE [**2-17**], incidentally on the CTAP, on coumadin.
- HTN - HLD - GERD - h/o LEFT humerus fx s/p fall - PVD, s/p LEFT CEA - OSA   Social History: Lives in [**Location **], MA.
Has had cognitive decline since her husband died 3 [**Name2 (NI) 1686**] ago.
Independent in ADLs, but no advance ADLs - Tobacco:  20pk [**Name2 (NI) 1686**], quit 20yrs ago - Alcohol:  denies - Illicits:  denies   Family History: Multiple family members w/ CAD and early MIs.
- Brother born with cyanotic heart disease.
- No family hx of liver or biliary disease.
Physical Exam: Admission physical exam: Vitals: 100.7F, 98/51 80s and 92% on 4LNC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP 10cm CV: Regular rate, 3/6 SEM, to R carotid.
[**2163-4-22**] Echocardiography Very poor image quality.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2163-4-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of right diaphragm elevation, combined to a right basal parenchymal opacity.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with signs of mild fluid overload.
No pleural effusions or other pathological findings.
No pneumothorax.
[**2163-4-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a further dramatic increase in severity of the pulmonary edema.
In addition, small left pleural effusion and areas of atelectatic changes at the right lung base have newly appeared.
There is no evidence of pneumonia.

Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
No thoracic aortic dissection.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
PERICARDIUM: Very small pericardial effusion.
Conclusions PRE-CPB: The left atrium is moderately enlarged.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %).
There is global hypokinesis with more notable regional wall motion abnormality in the basal-mid inferior segment.
There are complex (>5mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta with no apparent mobile component.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild to moderate TR.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
A paravalvular leak is seen in the area where the right coronary cusp was.
This results in mild paravalvular aortic insufficiency.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo W with AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7cm2), PE ([**12-18**]), s/p Left CEA (09) and recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for gall stone pancreatitis and GIB ([**4-14**]) who presented to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital with RUQ pain, diagnosed with cholecystitis, but also developed CP/CHF and a troponin bump, transferred [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for treatment of cholecystitis w/ drainage and management of NSTEMI.
# NSTEMI in setting of AS vs. inferolateral STEMI.
Initially felt to be due to demand in setting of infection and severe AS, though it was felt possible that posterior infarction was present.
After drainage of GB and resolution of SIRS, she did not improve hemodynamically.
She  underwent Cardiac Catheterization that showed two vessel coronary artery disease, Severe aortic stenosis, and preserved ventricular function.
Anticoagulation for history of PE was resumed.
Physical Therpay was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
