History of Present Illness: 53 year old male with HIV infection, HTN with history of symptomatic cholelithiasis presenting with acute onset of abdominal pain approximately 6 hours prior to presentation.
Pain is (R)UQ/epigastric, sharp, radiating to the back, moderate to severe intensity, associated with nausea/vomiting, no exacerbating or relieving factors.
No fevers/chills, no change in bowel habits, no change in urinary habits, no chest pain/shortness of breath.

Cholelithiasis, with distended gallbladder and tender right upper quadrant.
This could be a manifestation of early cholecystitis, in the appropriate clinical setting, although no evidence of gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
Right renal cyst.
[**2174-3-31**] ERCP : Stones at the galbladder Normal biliary tree without any evidence of biliary obstruction.
Peripancreatic inflammation and stranding of the mesenteric fat, consistent with acute pancreatitis.
Ill-defined enhancement of the pancreatic parenchyma at the neck is suggestive of necrosis in this area.
No other focal fluid collection is seen within the abdomen.
Extensive atelectasis and consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs may represent pneumonia  [**2174-4-10**] Abdominal CT : 1.
Significant worsening of acute pancreatitis with areas of pancreatic necrosis especially within the head, neck and proximal body of the pancreas.
A large amount of multiloculated fluid collections in the peripancreatic region extending to bilateral pericolic gutters, left more than right with peripheral enhancement are consistent with pancreatic pseudocysts.
Thickening of the stomach and duodenal wall as well as mild thickening of the wall of the ascending colon and transverse colon likely secondary to inflammatory process within the abdomen.
Splenomegaly, mildly increased since prior exam, likely reactive.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right with left lower lobe collapse.
Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
As discussed with the care team physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] lower lobe is still collapsed and there is small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion, overall unchanged.
No pneumothorax.

He continued to have temperature spikes almost daily.
His abdominal pain was gradually decreasing along with his WBC although he remained distended.
Once he resumed clear liquids, the pain recurred along with nausea.
Due to persistent temperature spikes, he had a repeat Abdominal/Pelvic CT done on [**2174-4-10**], which showed worsening of his pancreatitis with necrosis around the head and neck and pancreatic pseudocysts.
His pain remained well controlled on a Dilaudid PCA.
As his symptoms improved, he was started on sips of clears on [**2174-4-12**].
On [**2174-4-15**], the Dilaudid PCA was discontinued, and he was started on Dilaudid PO PRN for pain with continued good effect.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a low fat regular diet and cycled TPN, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
