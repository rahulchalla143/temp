Admission Date:  [**2179-4-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-5-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-3-28**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old man with multiple medical problems including cirrhosis secondary to Amiodarone, aortic valve replacement (St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**]), atrial fibrillation, and pleural effusions who presents with a general feeling of malaise, weakness and shortness of breath.
He has noted dyspnea on exertion for several weeks, worse over the past week.
His review of systems is also positive for cold and taros diarrhea.
He denies fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis.
He denies chest pain, jaw pain or anginal equivalent.
He denies abdominal pain with diarrhea which he describes as dark.
The diarrhea has been persistent over several months.
Review of systems is also positive for decreased p.o.
intake over the past week but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.
The patient came to the Emergency Department for further evaluation, found to be bradycardia in the 30s with INR of 6.2.
Of note, the patient was recently started on Digoxin in [**Month (only) 958**] for rapid atrial fibrillation.
Cryptogenic cirrhosis felt to be secondary to Amiodarone; 2.
Atrial fibrillation; 5.
Meningioma status post resection; 7.
Recurrent pleural effusions, transudative; 9.
History of ventricular tachycardiac arrest; 11.
In general he is a pleasant man in no acute distress.
Lungs, decreased breath sounds at the right base to [**1-8**] the way up, and normal left lung examination.
His heart was rhythm, bradycardiac and regular with mechanical S2 and II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.
He was mildly tender in the right upper quadrant, liver edge was at the costal margin and dull to percussion around one-third of the way up.
He had a chest film that showed a right pleural effusion that was associated with right lower lobe collapse.
The patient had neural agents on top of the Digoxin and it was likely due to toxicity that lead to his bradycardia.
Later in the hospital course he developed congestive heart failure.
Unfortunately he went back into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, so he was maintained on both Metoprolol and high levels of Diltiazem with success.
The [**Last Name **] problem was congestive heart failure, occurring after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.
Two days following TIPS, the patient developed severe dyspnea and tachypnea, yet did not have any clear evidence for hypoxia, requiring just 2 lpm O2; however, it was felt that he was likely in right heart failure with a potential of heart component.
He was initially diuresed with minimal success, and was then changed to a Nitroglycerin drip and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed both left and right heart failure.
At the time he developed acute renal failure, and so he was not diuresed for several days.
Hematology - The patient has a supratherapeutic INR that is likely considered poor absorption from decreased p.o.
Pleural effusions - The patient had a pleural effusion, likely hepatic hydrothorax.
He had 1.5 liters of transudative taken off.
There were no complications from this, and the patient felt better symptomatically.
Gastrointestinal - The patient over his admission developed a drop in hematocrit that was likely secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed.
The endoscopy showed Grade 3 varices which were worse compared to the previous as well as portal hypertensive gastropathy.
As mentioned above the patient developed complications from this procedure including acute renal failure and congestive heart failure that were managed initially in the Intensive Care Unit and then later on the floor.
More to the point, however, the patient also developed encephalopathy within two days of completing the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure.
While on balance, it was felt the potential benefit was to reduce the risk of having a lethal variceal bleed, the family understood that one consequence and complication of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure was encephalopathy.
He was treated with Lactulose around the clock as well as lactulose enemas with minimal effect.
Ultimately, the patient had an infection which was precipitating and worsening his encephalopathy.
The patient in the past has expressed a wish not to have diarrhea if at all possible (see below), but was treated with Lactulose prn.
Infectious disease - The patient had no evidence of infection for several weeks, however, towards the end of his admission, he spiked a fever to 101.8.
The cultures are negative at the time of this dictation, but presumptive infection from unknown source likely precipitated and worsened his encephalopathy.
At the time of this dictation the medications he is still on including the Diltiazem and the Metoprolol are primarily for his comfort and then he goes into rapid atrial fibrillation and has worsening congestive heart failure.
Congestive heart failure.
Hepatic hydrothorax.
Esophageal varices.
4 hours prn seizure.
