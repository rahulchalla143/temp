No adventitious movements.
IntraCranial Hemorrhage, likely secondary to hypertension or anticoagulation as INR =3.4 upon admission.
His neurologic exam was significant for left face/arm/leg weakness and sensory loss.
Approx 48 hour after admission he became solmnolent, responsive only to deep pain stimuli.
The hydrocephalus resolved over a period of a few days, CSF cultures grew nothing, and his drain stopped producing CSF.
CT showed resolved hydrocephalus and the drain was removed.
Found to have a LLL infiltrate.
He was started on levoflox, but the infiltrate worsened and he was febrile, intubated, so his antibiotics were switched to zosyn to cover for ventilator associated pneumonia (pseudomonas).
His temperature was more persistently elevated vs. spike like pattern, thus it was thought his fever was more central in origin given his ICH.
ALso, an EEG was checked given his altered mental status - no signs of epileptiform activity were seen.
He became anemic during this hospitalization Hct 42->29.
Etiology of this anemia was likely dilutional.
Hemolysis labs were normal except for a slight elevation in indirect bilirubin which resolved spontaneously.
Blood cultures were obtained to ensure no sepsis (and they were no growth with the exception of [**12-21**] bottles growing staph aureus coag neg, likely a contaminant) and DIC labs were normal with the exception of an elevated ddimers of unknown significance.
Slightly elevated LFTs, upon recheck fluctuated but not ever that elevated.
