Admission Date:  [**2167-9-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-10-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2126-4-23**]       Sex:  F  Service:Liver Transplant Service PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: End stage liver disease secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis and/or autoimmune hepatitis requiring orthotopic transplant during this admission.
Notable events while in the Intensive Care Unit from [**2167-9-21**] through [**2167-9-25**] include acute renal failure attributed to acute tubular necrosis manifested by gradually worsening creatinine, peaking at 3.6 on [**2167-9-24**] and then improving to baseline of 1.0 by the day of discharge.
She was noted to be anxious and emotionally labile at times.
The patient's incision was monitored for infection in collaboration with the Infectious Disease Service during the immediate postop period.
It went from purulent drainage as noted from the unction point of her [**Last Name (un) 8314**] incision.
Culture swabs from the incision were unremarkable and the drainage was minimal by the day of discharge.
The incision will need to be monitored for evidence of developing or worsening infection.
The patient's post surgical abdominal pain was managed with Percocet one to two tablets every four to six hours as needed for pain with good relief.
The patient had some residual ascites by the date of discharge.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was reported to have had an episode of pancreatitis in the immediate postoperative period, but this was resolved by the time of the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the floor on postop day number five.
Preference was given to a low potassium formula given the patient's hyperkalemia during that period.
Renal:  As mentioned above the patient's acute renal failure resolved steadily with serum creatinine falling from a peak of 3.6 on postoperative day number three to a baseline of about 1 by postoperative day number fifteen.
Infectious disease:  The patient's stool tested positive for C-difficile on her day of admission and [**2167-9-11**] and the patient was started on treatment for this infection.
By hospital day number two the day prior to surgery the patient's stool was negative for C-difficile.
The decision was made to keep the patient on prophylaxis against this infection following surgery to complete a fourteen day course.
The patient required transfusions for decreases in hematocrit on postop day number fourteen and seventeen.
The patient's diabetic teaching was deferred for fear of overwhelming the patient.
Fluid and electrolytes:  The patient was noted to be hypokalemic with serum potassium in the 5 to 7 range from postoperative day number eight through fifteen, requiring use of Kayexalate twice during that period, and administration of Lasix with the duel purpose of treating hyperkalemia and assisting in diuresis of the patient.
The etiology for the hyperkalemia was unclear, although it was believed that the patient's ongoing treatment with Fluconazole, Cyclosporin and Vancomycin were contributing factors.
Neurological:  The patient was at times noted to be anxious and emotionally labile by staff (intermittent crying episodes, expressions of frustration and difficulty coping).
Findings from evaluation included the fact that the patient had deficits in memory, visual planning and organization as well as flexibility of attention and naming and as such is prone to confusion.
The patient will need to follow up at the [**Hospital **] Clinic for diabetic teaching.
