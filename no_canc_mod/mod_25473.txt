Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy [**2186-10-25**] (bedside) Bronchoscopy [**2186-10-25**] (operating room) Intubation [**2186-10-24**] - [**2186-10-27**]   History of Present Illness: 42-year-old man with asthma transferred from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital for further management of respiratory failure.
Presented there with 3 days of progressive nonproductive cough and 1 day of headache.
Became dyspneic in the [**Last Name (un) 4199**] ED and did not improve with nebulized bronchodilators.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, CXR showed mild prominence of the central vasculature which may suggest fluid overload but no pulmonary edema, infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: middle-aged man in no distress, breathing and speaking comfortably HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA, NC/AT NECK: supple, no JVD CARDIAC: RRR, normal s1/s2 LUNGS: diffuse rhonchorous breath sounds and scattered respiratory wheezes in anterior fields.
ABDOMEN: soft, non-tender, normal bowel sounds EXT: warm and well-perfused, non-edematous NEURO: AAOx3, moving all extremities  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2186-10-24**] 01:30AM   WBC-16.2* RBC-4.95 HGB-13.6* HCT-40.0 MCV-81* MCH-27.5 MCHC-34.1 RDW-13.9 [**2186-10-24**] 01:30AM   NEUTS-91* BANDS-4 LYMPHS-3* MONOS-2 EOS-0 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0 [**2186-10-24**] 01:30AM   HYPOCHROM-NORMAL ANISOCYT-OCCASIONAL POIKILOCY-NORMAL MACROCYT-NORMAL MICROCYT-1+ POLYCHROM-NORMAL OVALOCYT-OCCASIONAL [**2186-10-24**] 01:30AM   PLT COUNT-196 [**2186-10-24**] 01:30AM   GLUCOSE-162* UREA N-20 CREAT-1.1 SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-4.4 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-16 [**2186-10-24**] 01:16PM   ANCA-NEGATIVE B [**2186-10-24**] 01:16PM   [**Doctor First Name **]-NEGATIVE  CT Chest [**2186-10-24**] - 1)Diffuse tracheobronchial wall thickening with calcification causing narrowing of the entire tracheobronchial tree with mucous plugging in the lower lobes bilaterally.
The appearance is highly suggestive of relapsing polychondritis 2)Centrilobular nodules in the left lower lobe suggest recent infection or inflammation.
3)No central pulmonary embolism.
ECHO [**2186-10-25**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Trachea Pathology [**10-25**] - Respiratory mucosa with focal squamous metaplasia and marked mixed inflammation with fibrino-inflammatory exudates.
Brief Hospital Course: 42-year-old man with history of asthma transferred for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure, believed secondary to relapsing polychondritis.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He was admitted to the ICU where he was treated initially with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and Tamiflu for community-acquired pneumonia and possible influenza.
Additionally, he received bronchodilator inhalers on standing dose schedules and high dose IV steroids for question of asthma flare.
He underwent CTA that did not show PE although the CTA findings were highly suggestive of relapsing polychondritis.
He underwent bronchoscopy x2 that showed diffuse airway inflammation; endobronchial biopsies showed focal squamous metaplasia and marked mixed inflammation with fibrino-inflammatory exudates, although no calcification (as one would expect in relapsing polychondritis).
On [**10-25**], he underwent echocardiogram that showed normal left ventricular systolic function with no valvular disease.
He was followed closely by the rheumatology service with the tentative diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis.
Exam was notable for persistent diffuse coarse breath sounds with faint expiratory wheezes, although there was no tachypnea, accessory muscle use, or respiratory distress.
He will follow-up with rheumatology, interventional pulmonology, and pulmonary clinics.
Combivent 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**1-6**] puff Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*1 bottle* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Relapsing polychondritis   Discharge Condition: Stable - Persistent rhonchorous lung sounds, O2 sats in mid-90s maintained with light activity such as climbing stairs, tolerating regular diet, cleared by physical therapy for independent mobility   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management of your symptoms of cough and shortness of breath that led to respiratory distress and the need for intubation.
A CTA scan of your chest and the appearance of your bronchial tree on bronchoscopy were highly suggestive of a diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis.
We have made the following changes to your medication regimen: - BEGIN TAKING Prednisone 30 mg by mouth twice daily (your rheumatologist may change this dose at your next appointment) - BEGIN TAKING Combivent inhaler (use this instead of albuterol inhaler) 1-2 puffs as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing - BEGIN TAKING Calcium carbonate 500 mg by mouth three times daily - BEGIN TAKING Vitamin D 800 units by mouth daily - BEGIN TAKING Dextromethorphan-Guaifenesin 5 mL every 6 hours as needed for cough  Followup Instructions: 1.
