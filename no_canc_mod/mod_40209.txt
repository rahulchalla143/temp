The pain was slightly worsened by movement.
He felt slightly lightheaded and short of breath.
He has a history of capsulitis to which he initially attributed the pain to, however pain did not improve with Tylenol, so he presented to the ED.
In the ED, pain slightly improved with SL NTG x3 and aspirin.
EKG was without acute changes and cardiac enzymes have been negative.
He was admitted to the observation unit where he had continued chest pain that again slightly improved with SL NTG and admitted to medicine.
Patient describes the pain as a constant, sharp pain.
On the medicine service, he continued to have chest pain.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended cardiac catheterization given atypical chest pain that has persisted for over 24 hours.
Pain was again slightly improved with SL NTG x3, IV morphine 2mg x3, and IV metoprolol 5 mg x1.
Nitro drip was unable to be started on the floor to help in controlling pain and so patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.

Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities are slightly less marked.
Otherwise, no diagnostic change.
The lungs are clear of masses or consolidations.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF 55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no significant CAD.
The LAD had a 30% stenosis in the proximal LAD.
The celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and renal arteries (bilaterally) were selectively engaged and found to have no significant disease.
Normal celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries.
[**2127-6-24**]   Radiology CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON 1) No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2)Mild linear atelectasis and dependent atelectasis in the lower lobes bilaterally.
3)Sub-2-mm nodules in the right upper lobe and right lower lobe do not require followup in the absence of smoking history.
4)Moderately severe coronary artery calcification and small hiatal hernia.
there is a large amount of air in the small and large bowel.
There is no evidence of free air.
Brief Hospital Course: 58M with [**Location (un) 47**] risk factors of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with new acute onset chest pain.
# CHEST PAIN:  The patient continued to have chest pain on the floor with an EKG showing new prominent T waves although cardiac biomarkers were negative.
There was concern for cardiac ischemia given his multiple cardiac risk factors.
He was taken for cardiac catheterization which was negative for coronary artery disease.
He then underwent CTA which was negative for PE or for any other cause of his chest pain.
Finally, he underwent EGD which revealed possible varices which was followed up by GI.
It also showed mild esophagitis for which he was started on a PPI.
He also had a small hiatal hernia.
The cause of his chest pain was unclear although it may have been due to esophagitis.
He was chest pain free upon discharge.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: His renal function was found to be slightly worse than baseline.
This was thought to be pre-renal in setting of dehydration.
# INCIDENTAL LUNG NODULE: Found on CTA, because of his smoking history he will need a repeat CT scan in 1 year ([**6-10**]), and this will be communicated to his PCP.
# HYPERTENSION: continued lisinopril and started low dose metoprolol .
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine .
# h/o tension headaches: continued nortriptyline .
# Tenosynovitis - takes methotrexate at home qFriday: held methotrexate in acute setting and this was restarted upon discharge.
# h/o TIA x5 - no neurological deficits noted.
)(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Atypical chest pain 2) Esophageal varices 3) Constipation 4) Possible esophageal spasm 5) Possible gastroesophageal reflux disease 6) Gastritis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for chest pain.
Fortunately, all our testing was negative for the most life-threatening causes of chest pain, including a heart attack, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or aortic dissection.
You also underwent a scope of your upper GI tract which showed mild inflammation and varices of your esophagus.
Although we don't have a definitive diagnosis on the cause of your chest pain, the two most likely possibilities include esophageal spasm, for which you are being treated with nifedipine (calcium channel blocker) as well as gastroesophageal reflux for which you are being treated with pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor).
We have set you up with cardiology and the GI team to follow up your chest pain as an outpatient.
Fortunately, most of your symptoms improved the last 2-3 days prior to admission, possibly due to starting these medications.
If you develop severe chest pain again, you should call your doctor or come to the emergency department.
And although your cardiac catheterization was negative for obstructive disease, you should still be on a life-long baby aspirin and a cholesterol lowering [**Doctor Last Name 360**] such as atorvastatin to keep your LDL cholesterol below 70.
