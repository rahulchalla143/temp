Admission Date:  [**2122-3-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-3-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2041-6-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Motrin / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 80yo female with multiple medical problems including hypertension, recent ICU admission with pulmonary edema and ARDS, and previous admission for septic hip treatment was admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain.
During that admission, she was found to have bilateral infiltrates consistent with multifocal pneumonia and superimposed pulmonary edema, as well as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
For the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, she was treated for a short time with steroids complicated by delirium and underwent an extensive autoimmune work-up which was negative.
While at Rehab, she has developed multiple complications, including delirium, acute renal failure, fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
Her delirium was thought likely related to medications (received a short course of baclofen), infection, and renal failure.
Regarding her acute renal failure, her creatinine increased to 2.6 from 1.5 within 2 days after discharge, her furosemide and anti-hypertensives were discontinued, and she was started on IVF.
Regarding her chest pain and shortness of breath, she was evaluated by a pulmonary consultant on the day of her transfer and she was thought to be in a CHF exacerbation.
She received SL NG x 3 and was then started on a nitro drip for chest pain.
She also received zosyn for pneumonia, was started on a heparin drip for treatment of a presumed pneumonia, and also given fentanyl 25mcg IV x 1 for treatment of chest pain.
Additional review of systems is notable for the following: shortness of breath, fatigue, back pain (chronic and unchanged), lower extremity swelling, and neck pain (chronic and unchanged).
Her delirium has markedly improved according to her daughters.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools, red stools.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Neck: Supple with elevated JVP to the earlobe.

No thrills, lifts.

Right hip without evidence of inflammation - no erythema, tenderness, pain, or swelling Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
[**2122-3-29**] CXR: There is fluctuating appearance of the parenchymal opacities consistent with recurrent pulmonary edema.
Compared to the most recent chest radiograph from [**2122-3-28**], there is interval progression of parenchymal opacities involving the entire lungs that is worrisome for interval worsening of pulmonary edema.
No appreciable pleural effusions have been seen, although small amount of pleural fluid cannot be excluded.
No changes in the sternotomy wires position as well as in the cardiomediastinal contour have been demonstrated.
The fluctuating character of the parenchymal opacities is more consistent with pulmonary edema than infection, although underlying foci of infection or ARDS cannot be completely excluded.
[**2122-3-29**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT seen in either lower extremity.
[**2122-3-29**] Renal US : IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis although the right kidney appears smaller than the left.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 80yo female with history of multiple medical problems including recent right hip infection, diastolic dysfunction, recent hospitalization with intubation, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was admitted with shortness of breath.
Shortness of Breath: Etiology of her shortness of breath is likely multifactorial.
Differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure exacerbation related to her recent medication changes and fluid administration, pneumonia in the setting of rehab stay / recent hospitalization / recent intubation, and splinting secondary to her chest pain.
An additional possibility includes pulmonary embolism given her recent hospitalization and immobilization.
Unfortunately she is not a candidate for a CTA at this time due to her renal failure, and VQ scan would likely not be helpful due to her diffuse and patchy infiltrates.
At the time of transfer, she continues to c/o inability to take a deep breath but EKG is without changes and pt has only slight crackles on exam.
Chest Pain: Etiology of her chest pain is unclear.
Differential includes pain related to pneumonia, GERD and esophageal irritation s/p intubation and NGT placement on prior admission.
Pt c/o odynophagia but has no evidence of aspiration.
Pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, or costochondritis were all considered unlikely.
Her description of her pain is also not consistent with acute coronary syndrome, and her ECG is also unremarkable for ACS.
She was treated for HAP as above and given dilaudid PRN with poor control of her pain at baseline.
Fever and Leukocytosis Most likely [**2-16**] pneumonia.
Acute Renal Failure Etiology of her acute renal failure likely secondary to dehydration and aggressive diuresis.
Coronary Artery Disease Continued aspirin and statin.
Elevated trops in setting of unremarkable CK and MB were thought [**2-16**] renal failure.
Beta blocker held in setting of CHF exacerbation and ACEI held in setting of ARF.
Anemia Patient's hematocrit has decreased from 33 at last discharge to 25 here this admission.
Iron studies d/w anemia of chronic disease.
Retic count elevated at 2.4 prior to discharge.
Would recommend continuing to trend Hct and guaiac of stools.
Hypothyroidism Stable, continued levothyroxine .
Ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H:PRN   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Hospital acquired Pneumonia diastolic CHF Acute on Chronic renal failure CAD Anemia   Discharge Condition: stable.
BP stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted here with CHF exacerbation.
You were briefly started on a heparin drip for possible pulmonary embolism but this was stopped when pulmonary consult thought this diagnosis was very unlikely.
You continue to complain of chest pain despite on EKG changed and we think this could be due to mechanical trauma from recent intubation and NG tube.
Please call your doctor or return to the ED if you have any chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, vomitting, blood in your stools or any other concerning symptoms.
