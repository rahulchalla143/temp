Shortly after that, she became stridorous and was electively intubated for airway protection at midnight.
Labs were significant for an elevated troponin of 0.21 with flat CK's and no EKG changes.
She was also noted to have a leukocytosis with a left shift, no bands.

Respiratory distress: Ms. [**Known lastname 69693**] developed stridor after receiving benadryl and ativan which was given for dystonia believed to be a result of phenergan and/or meclizine.
The etiology of the respiratory distress is believed to be secondary to these sedating anticholinergic medications.
A CXR was done which showed only mild pulmonary edema and it was felt that this was unlikely to be the cause of respiratory distress.
She complained of a cough following the extubation, however, satted well on 2L and quickly weaned to RA.
Vertigo: The patient has a history of vertigo (worked up in past and told she has a "problem with her ears") and developed acute onset of vertigo while bending over.
The vertigo worsened with head movements.
She went to an outside hospital for evaluation and according to outside hospital ED reports, the patient exhibited no other posterior circulation symptoms.
According to her son, her speech was normal, without facial droop or asymmetry.
She had no focal weakness.
Neurology was consulted and felt that her symptoms were most consistent with peripheral vestibulopathy given her history of similar symptoms in the past and a non focal exam.
MRI of the head showed no acute ischemic infarct, findings consistent with chronic microvascular infarcts in the supratentorial area and no definite occlusions or aneurysms were seen.
The patient's nausea and dizziness subsided and she denied dizziness on the day of discharge.
NSTEMI: On admission the patient had elevated troponins (0.21, 0.16, 0.12) which were felt to be secondary to demand ischemia peri-intubation from stress and possibly transient tachycardia.
She did not have any episodes of chest pain.
Leukocytosis: On admission the patient had an elevated WBC count of unclear etiology.
The patient has no clear source of infection and the WBC elevation is likely secondary to stress.
Hematuria: The patient had positive RBCs in UA which was felt to be secondary to foley placement.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Vertigo Anticholinergic reaction NSTEMI Respiratory distress --------- Secondary: HTN Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Stable.
You had a reaction to Meclizine and/or Phenergan.
In addition, you developed respiratory distress with benadryl.
If you begin to have increasing dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerning symptoms please [**Name6 (MD) 138**] your MD.
