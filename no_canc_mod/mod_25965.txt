Pt state that she was in her usual state of health aside from new onset migraines when yesterday am she noted the acute onset of severe abdominal pain.
The pain initially began in the lower and middle abdomen with radiation to the back [**11-1**].
She describes otherwise normal bowel habits, no fevers, chills, melena, hematochezia or BRBPR.
She was initially evaluated at [**Hospital 1562**] hospital where RUQ US showed 10 mm CBD with trace free fluid in the abdomen.
Ct head was performed because of new migraines.
Past Medical History: PMH: Hypothyroid, Recurrent UTIs, Insomnia, Hx of EtOH abuse  PSH: Vagotomy, pyloroplasty and hiatal hernia repair elective ([**2122**], elective )Breast lumpectomy for atypical hyperplasia, Right shoulder   Social History: 32 years sober from AA, No IVDA, former smoker quit in [**2142**]  Family History: Brother recently at [**Hospital1 18**] for perforated viscus, AZD, Lung ca in father   Physical Exam: 98.2 120 142/91 20 97% 4L Nasal Cannula Gen: NAD, A&Ox3, tan female without pallor.
CVS: Tachycardic , no m/r/g/ Pulm: Clear anteriorly Abd: tender in RUQ and epigastrium with fullness but no discrete masses, no pulsations noted.
Moderate ascites, with echogenicity which may represent blood.
Large left hepatic arterial pseudoaneurysm, resulting in compression of the left portal vein, with active extravasation at the left inferior aspect.
Moderate intrapelvic and intra-abdominal hemorrhagic ascites.
Diffusely dilated pancreatic duct warrants further evaluation with MRCP or ERCP following treatment of acute issues.
Increased distribution of ground-glass opacities, now diffuse in nature.
Differential includes pulmonary hemorrhage, infection or possibly fluid overload.
However, given lack of air bronchograms, pyogenic pneumonia is less likely though a viral pneumonia is still a consideration.
Fluid overload, is less likely given interval resolution of pleural effusions.
Thus the most likely diagnoses include pulmonary hemorrhage or viral pneumonia.
Distention with increased gallbladder wall edema and irregularity of the luminal surface of the gallbladder wall is concerning for potential gangrenous cholecystitis.
Recommend further evaluation with an ultrasound to further assess for any intraluminal membranes or other evidence of gangrenous cholecystitis.
Stable hypoperfusion of the entire left hepatic lobe and the hepatic dome.
Bilateral hepatic artery aneurysm coiling without evidence of residual flow noted within the aneurysm or in the left hepatic artery.
On return to ICU she was mildly hypertensive (SBP 160) and was started on a labetolol gtt and hydralazine.
She was transfused 2u prbc prior to embolization with increasing hematocrit after the procedure.
[**7-21**]: Showing signs of stability, further work-up was performed for question of auto-immune vasculitis.
She showed signs of fluid overload this day, desaturating to the low 80's with a CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.
ECHO showed normal ventricular function while CTA chest showed no PE but continued volume overload.
CT of the liver showed resolution of the aneurysms, functioning coils and patent hepatic vein with the expected hypoperfused left liver segments.
[**7-23**]: Liver duplex showed sucessful embolization of L hepatic artery and patent R hepatic arterial system.
We were aware of her issue with chronic UTI, but urine studies were not consistent with this being the source.
While in the ICU, she was seen by rheumatology consult, who recommended vasculitis labs, all of which were negative (ANCA, anti-Sm, [**Doctor First Name **] & dsDNA).
Her bilirubin continued to remain elevated while her LFTs trended downwards and there was concern for gallbladder pathology.
a RUQ U/S performed on [**7-28**] showed a heterogenous gallbladder that was concerning for necrosis.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] VNA [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left hepatic artery aneurysm with active extravasation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a work-up done at an outside hospital which showed bloody fluid in your abdomen and hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms and you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
You were initially admitted to the ICU for resuscitation and management and underwent IR embolization of your hepatic artery aneurysms.
There was concern for your gallbladder being infected, since your liver function studies were elevated, but an ultrasound performed did not show evidence of that.
You were tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and pain was well controlled.
You may take tramadol or ibuprofen for pain control.
