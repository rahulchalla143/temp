Up until last month, she had had no medical followup.
She has had at least a two year history of gradually worsening exertional angina and dyspnea on exertion but never sought medical attention.
She initially attributed her symptoms to stress and anxiety.
Over the last couple months, her exertional chest pain sometimes took hours before going away (initially responded quickly to rest).
Symptoms (CP and dyspnea) also occurring at rest with minor emotional stressors.
She had persantine MIBI on [**2108-10-18**] which showed possible mild lateral wall ischemia.
She also developed hypertension to 210/120 during stress and required presentation to OSH ED.
Found to have 99% LCx lesion that could not be stented.
Following cath started on heparin gtt (since continued mild CP and ST depressions/TWI in lateral leads).
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: -HTN -Anxiety with panic attacks -Depression -Discoid lupus (diagnosed by biopsy of nonhealing ulcers 15 yrs ago), no treatment or other known manifestations of SLE -TMJ -Cataracts -s/p ovarian cyst removal -s/p tonsillectomy .
Family History: There is significant family history of premature coronary artery disease.
Sister with MI at 32 and CABG at 34; other sister with MI at 48 and cardiac arrest; other sister with hypertension and died at 59 during stress test.
Father with fatal MI at 56.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No carotid bruits.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
R groin with moderate ecchymoses, slightly firm over pubis.
No active ooze or obvious hematoma.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: Initial EKG ([**11-12**] AM) demonstrated NSR at 97, normal axis/intervals, ST depressions V4-V6, I; TWI aVL.
ECG [**11-13**] AM (during CP) also with NSR at 76, lateral ST depressions and TWI (V5, V6, I, aVL).
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2108-11-13**] demonstrated: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is an abnormal systolic flow contour at rest (likely due to a hyperdynamic LV function).
ETT performed on [**2108-10-18**] demonstrated: + chest and jaw pain with hypertension to 210/120; imaging showing ?mild lateral wall ischemia vs. artifact.

She developed a small left apical pneumothorax after her chest tubes were pulled that remained stable on subsequent chest xray.
She also developed a pruritic generalized  rash for which her lasix was discontinued and she was treated with sarna lotion.
