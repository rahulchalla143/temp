He has had significant orthostasis with multiple admissions and ED visits for fractures, and notes that he has fallen perhaps 10 times over the past 2 weeks.
Here he had a HCT which showed a large subdural hematoma with midline shift (see below).
Review of systems is notable for falls, increased drowsiness x 1 week, and some difficulty concentrating.
He has also had a headache x 2 weeks.
He has no change in vision or diplopia, no nausea, vomiting, dysphagia.
Past Medical History: autonomic instability w/ HTN to 220s but orthostatic hypotension w/ tilt testing showing BP ddrop from 156/83 to 76/44 with tilt s/p pacemaker placement for bradycardia and syncope [**5-/2110**] atrial flutter s/p ablation spinal stenosis chronic renal insufficiency depression s/p cataract surgery   Social History: lives alone, son is an endocrinologist (see below).
h/o tobacco use, no EtOH   Family History: not elicited   Physical Exam: Admission exam: PE: VS: T99.6, HR 72, BP 220/104->181/94, then SBP 150s, RR 20, SaO2 96%/RA, pain [**4-3**] Genl: NAD, comfortable lying in bed HEENT: cervical collar in place, MMM, OP clear CV: RRR, nl S1, S2 Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriolaterally Abd: soft, NTND, BS+ Ext: cool, multiple small lacerations  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
Speech is fluent with normal comprehension and repetition; naming intact, no dysarthria.
No evidence of neglect.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
No pronator drift.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-10-21**] 11:56 AM IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous but relatively low-attenuation extraaxial collection, layering over the right cerebral convexity, likely representing a subacute subdural hematoma (or reflecting underlying profound anemia), with possible small foci of acute hemorrhage, anteriorly.
There is significant mass effect and associated shift of the midline structures, as described, with subfalcine and probable early uncal herniation.
No other hemorrhage is identified and there is no acute skull fracture.
A small right frontal chronic collection remains.
A very small amount of acute blood is seen just deep to the post-surgical site as well as layering along the tentorium, the subdural location.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-10-24**] 4:46 PM IMPRESSION: Stable post-surgical changes within the right cerebral hemisphere from evacuation of subdural hematoma.
No new foci of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
His procedure (right craniotomy for evacuation of subdural hematoma) had no intra-operative complications.
Postoperatively, the patient had difficulty with blood pressure control (history of severe orthostatic hypotension).
When he was transfered to the neuro stepdown unit, he remained mainly hypertensive despite having started his normal antihypertensive medications.
Despite his pressures, his neurological function began to improve post-op and he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating and had adequate pain control.
He had no new neurological issues.
On [**10-27**], he was doing well and had no further issues.
His dilantin level was therapeutic (around 10 corrected for a low albumin), and he was discharged to rehab.
