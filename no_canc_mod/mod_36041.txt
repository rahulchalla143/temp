**FINAL REPORT [**2195-6-10**]**     Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2195-6-10**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2195-6-8**]):       Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2195-6-13**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
ADMISSION CXR [**6-6**]  IMPRESSION: Large patchy opacification in the left mid to lower lung, concerning for pneumonia and/or aspiration.
If history of trauma, contusion/pulmonary hemorrhage would also [**Last Name (un) 10737**] the differential.
Recommend followup with chest radiograph after appropriate treatment.
[**6-6**] CT HEAD  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Chronic involutional changes.
[**6-8**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum, distal distal anterior wall, and apex.
No intraventricular thrombus is seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-5-18**], the wall motion abnormality is new and c/w interim ischemia.
[**6-11**] CT HEAD IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage.
No evidence of an acute infarction.
Small vessel ischemic change and an old small right cerebellar infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo F with complex medical history including Parkinson's, Castleman's disease, COPD, hypothyroidism, and recurrent aspiration pneumonias who was admitted to MICU with septic shock likely from MRSA and Pseudomonas pneumonia, course has been complicated by profound hypothyroidism (slowly improving), NSTEMI, abdominal cellulitis/maceration from draining entercutaneous fistula (now stopped draining), altered mental status and slow awakening from sedation.
Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recurrent pneumonias.
In the past, she has had infection with multiple resistent organisms, including MRSA, ESBL Klebsiella (sensitive only to carbapenems), and pseudomonas (sensitive to Zosyn and carbapenems, resistent to cipro and tobra).
Her sputum culture grew MRSA and Pseudomonas and she was treated with broad spectrum ABx and eventually narrowed to Vancomycin and Cefepime based on culture sensitivities as above (of note, the very resistant Ecoli was only sparse growth and pt was clinically improving, so not specifically treated).
Respiratory failure: Patient intubated in ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Of note, after extubation the pt was able to cough on command, but noted to have a lot of secretions and had a couple episodes of desaturations in which mucus plugs were suctioned.
Altered mental status: Pt was sedated during intubation but noted to have prolonged course of awakening.
She had two head CT without contrast wihtout acute process (chronic changes) and an MRI that showed no acute infarct and small vessel ischemic changes and old small R cerebellar infarct.
Of note, Endo consult did NOT feel hypothyroidism to be the etiology of this admission.
TTE showed new WMA of distal anterior septum, distal wall, apex, mild decrease of EF 45-50%.
Cardiology consult felt this consistent with demand ischemic process, pt was treated with 48 hrs of Heparin gtt, daily ASA 325, Plavix 75, and Atorvastatin 40 mg daily (not 80 mg given that this was demand ischemia).
She was started on beta blocker, but noted through admission to get bradycardic with sleep so this was eventually stopped.
She was started on ACEi (Captopril eventually uptitrated to  50 mg TID) for hypertension to the SBP 140-150's.
Cellulitis: Pt had complicated GJ tube history with an enterocutaneous fistula inferior to tube insertion site.
It was draining bilious fluid and wound care was consulted; the bilious fluid was felt to be causing maceration and cellulitis on her stomach.
Of note, there has been a question of pt's noncompliance with NPO at home leading to GJ malfunction and possibly aspiration.
A collection bag was placed over the fistula to prevent bilious fluid from irritating her skin, and the redness/maceration improved over time, and eventually was able to be removed.
Review of previous surgery notes indicates that this fistula was a very long standing issue, that she had refused surgery for it, she had had IR guided attempts to fix it; and the most recent recommendations were for wound care and nutrition.
Chronic pain: On fentanyl, dilaudid, gabapentin at home; she was continued on gabapentin and was sedated for her intubation.
Bipolar disorder: Spoke with her outpt psychiatrist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 105581**] who said the pt had bipolar type 2 -- prolonged depression with some hypomania but never fully manic.
The vast maojrity of time she's mildly depressed but it's mostly situation -- as outpt was on Lexapro 20, Lamicatal 200, and Seroquel 300 (Seroquel was good bc she tends to have trouble sleeping at night).
