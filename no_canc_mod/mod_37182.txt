Admission Date:  [**2133-10-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-10-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-9-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**] Chief Complaint: cardiac arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Cath ICD placement  History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 3704**] is a 51 y/o man with no known coronary disease who is transfered to the CCU [**2133-10-9**] after being admitted to [**Hospital3 3765**] on the evening of [**2133-10-8**] following a cardiac arrest.
He had felt well through all of this, without chest pain or dyspnea.
His wife subsequently heard him gurgling and he was found with agonal breaths and non-responsive.
He was intubated in the field post-recsussitation due to a poor respiratory effort and he was transfered to the [**Hospital3 3765**] ICU.
He didn't note any palpiutations, chest pain, or diaphoresis at the time.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: 1) Bilateral Inguinal Hernias s/p repair in [**2120**] and 200 2) Rectal Bleeding s/p sigmoidoscopy c/w internal hemhorroids.
No prior cardiac history, including caths, echos, stress tests, pacers/ICDs.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Unlabored breathing ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, ND, pos BS, no HSM or masses.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary artery disease.
The LMCA, LAD, LCX had no disease.
Manipulation of an AL1 guide cannulated the RCA and revealed a non-dominant vessel without coronary artery disease.
Limted resting hemodynamics showed mildly elevated left ventriuclar filling pressures measured at 18 mmHg.
The patient did not tolerate positioning of the reference device so measurement of the stroke volume could not be performed.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity without evidence of myocardial fatty infiltration.
There were no pericardial or pleural effusions.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
There was no focal thinning or fatty infiltration seen in the RV free wall.
There were no aneurysms seen in the RV free wall or right ventricular outflow tract.
Quantitative Flow  There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.
Aortic flow demonstrated no significant aortic regurgitation.
There was no mitral regurgitation.
There was mild pulmonic valve regurgitation.
The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated no significant tricuspid regurgitation.
Myocardial Perfusion and Fibrosis  There were no areas of focal hyperenhancement, consistent with the absence of myocardial scarring/infarction.
No CMR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
No CMR evidence of right ventricular fatty infiltration/dysplasia.
Mild pulmonic regurgitation.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 y/o man with no known history of any CAD and minimal CAD risk factors who presented after sudden cardiac arrest after being revived with CPR/AED en route to ED.
Admission cardiac cath showed no CAD and ECHO WNL with LVEF >55%.
Baseline EKG with LVH and ST-T wave configuration consistent with early repolarization pattern, otherwise benign.
On morning of [**10-12**], pt described mild chest tightness, attributed to anxiety based on description of pain, unchanged EKG and recent normal cath.
An EP study done on [**10-13**] showed no evidence of abnormal conduction or inducable arrythmias.
After discussion, aspirin was determined unnecessary given known clean coronaries.
Pt scheduled to follow up with electrophysiology to discuss need for formal EP study and ask about need for any further EKG screening of family members  2) Cognitive Impairment: Pt had short term memory deficits that have improved steadily during course of admission, most likely secondary to hypoxia in setting of recent arrest.
There was no evidence of seizure and no indication for a brain MRI.
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular Fibrillation s/p ICD placement   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Your heart stopped while you were home, an event called "sudden cardiac arrest" that was due to an abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation.
You have a normal EKG, heart function and no evidence of scarring on your cardiac MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 68714**] a defibrillator to treat the very rapid rhythm that you had before.
You need to take antibiotics for 3 days as a precaution against infection at the incision site.
You should not have any swelling, increasing pain, discharge or bruising at the site.
Please call the device clinic if you notice any of these changes or if the device shocks you.
Metoprolol Succinate: a beta blocker that slows your heart rate and may prevent a very rapid rhythm 3.
Oxycodone/acetaminophen: as a pain medicine to take as needed for the incision site.
Please call [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1258**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 69336**] NP or Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] if you develop palpitations, weakness or fainting, increasing chest discomfort, or any other concerning symptoms.
