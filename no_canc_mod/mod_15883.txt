Admission Date:  [**2134-3-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2134-3-11**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 9995**] is an 80 year old, white male, with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic insufficiency.
On careful history, it appears that the patient had been feeling mildly febrile and fatigued for approximately two to three days prior to falling.
Additionally, he noted dark urine and light colored stools during this time.
At the time, a right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed which showed a two cm common bile duct as well as multiple stones in the gallbladder.
They were unable to exclude an obstructing common bile duct stone.
The patient was watched clinically over the weekend but then was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for semi-urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography when he began to have symptoms of fever and respiratory distress.
Upon arrival to the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography suite, the patient was felt to be in mild respiratory distress.
The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was significant for the finding of approximately one liter of dark coffee ground as well as hemorrhagic gastritis in the superficial pyloric ulcer.
The patient has never been anticoagulated due to history of severe gastrointestinal bleed.
The patient most recently had an echocardiogram ten days prior to transfer which showed moderate to severe aortic insufficiency and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation with a normal ejection fraction of 55%.
Recent pneumonia.
The patient had recently bee4n admitted and treated at the [**Hospital6 2561**] for pneumonia with Levaquin in early [**Month (only) 956**].
History of a colectomy secondary to a severe gastrointestinal bleed.
History of degenerative joint disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
In general, the patient was sedated and largely unresponsive but wincing to noxious stimuli.
Neck: There was no noticeable jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy.
Heart was irregularly irregular with a [**2-11**] holosystolic murmur, best heard at the apex in the left lower sternal border.
Otherwise, there was also no splenomegaly.
Extremities showed no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
There were otherwise no stigmata of chronic liver disease.
However, the severity of the thrombocytopenia raised the possibility of a second process, such as medication.
The patient's electrocardiogram showed no evidence of any acute changes, as compared to his other hospital.
His troponin leak continued to trend downwards and was more suggestive of a distant event.
He continued to be in atrial fibrillation but was never heparinized given his recent gastrointestinal bleed and obvious coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.
His initial blood cultures which were drawn on admission subsequently grew Enterococcus which was then revealed as Vancomycin resistant.
The enterococcus also grew from the viral cultures as well.
The heart was investigated with echo which revealed an ejection fraction of 45%, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
He continued to be mildly tachycardiac but was started on his baseline betablocker on hospital day number three.
IN approximately three to four weeks, the patient is tentatively planned to return back to [**Hospital1 1444**] to have a second endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography attempted with the presence of IR for possible stone extraction as well as a sphincterotomy.
