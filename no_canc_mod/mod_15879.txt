She presented to the Emergency Department complaining of black diarrhea today.
For the five days prior to presentation she has had larger volumes of diarrhea and also reports decreased p.o.
In the Emergency Department the patient underwent nasogastric lavage with bilious return.
She received 4 liters of normal saline for hypotension (systolic blood pressure of 92).
She had no chest pain.
She also states that she is short of breath after climbing a flight of stairs at her house.
She denied lower extremity edema, nocturia or chest pain.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, she requires supplemental oxygenation at home.
Obstructive sleep apnea/obesity.
Of note, her husband also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires supplemental oxygenation.
Heart:  Point of maximal impulse not displaced, regular, normal S1 and S2, II/VI systolic murmur at base bilaterally, contraction of arms.
Axis was left with qR in leads 1 and AVL and a rS in 2, 3 and F. There were no peak T waves, there was no acute ST segment change.
This was consistent with left anterior fascicle block.
Hyperkalemia - On the night of admission, the patient required several additional gm of calcium gluconate, approximately 30 units of regular insulin and several injections of sodium bicarbonate to acutely decrease the potassium.
Upon arrival in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient's serial blood gases revealed hypercarbia and hypoxia.
Subsequent detection of Clostridium difficile A in her stool confirmed infection with the [**Doctor Last Name 360**] of this disease.
She had large volumes of diarrhea as well as increased nasogastric suctioning contents.
Hypotension - The patient had persistent hypotension during her hospital course.
She underwent Swan-Ganz catheterization which confirmed distributed and cardiogenic shock.
Of note, the patient was exquisitely sensitive to withdrawal of this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] and would have precipitous drop in her blood pressure as well as bradycardia upon its discontinuation.
Similarly the patient could not tolerate higher than 20 mcg/kg/min of this medication as she developed an inferior myocardial infarction when the medication was increased to 37.
Of note, the patient had a left lower lobe consolidation on chest x-ray.
Sputum cultures confirmed that she had pneumonia with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus although she was initially treated with Levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia, the intravenous Vancomycin administered as part of the regimen for Clostridium difficile covered for this organism.
Despite maximal medical therapy, the patient continued to have large volumes of diarrhea and was persistently hypotensive.
