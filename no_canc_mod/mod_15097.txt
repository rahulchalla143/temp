At the time of evaluation, baby was six hours old and was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery after pitocin induction for maternal anxiety, previous 38 week IUFD to a 39-year-old G3 P2 (1) -3 woman with prenatal screens O positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive.
No sepsis risk factors.
Posttraumatic stress disorder.
Abdomen is soft and nontender, active bowel sounds.
Spine straight without dimples.
REVIEW OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  Baby initially had oxygen saturations greater than 95 and then demonstrated some desaturations down to the 88 with feeds, required nasal cannula O2 maximum of 200 cc, 50%, and demonstrated some shallow breathing.
No further desaturations.
His respiratory distress was thought to be related to retained fetal lung fluid and probable transient tachypnea as a newborn.
Did not demonstrate any apnea, bradycardia, or desaturations.
He has no murmur.
Some of his jitteriness was thought perhaps to be related to maternal psychiatric medications.
Infectious Disease:  Initially had a blood culture and a complete blood count sent because of presentation.
Neurology:  Baby is appropriate for gestational age with perhaps a slight transient increase in his tone with some jitteriness as described above.
Baby did not have a head ultrasound based on gestational age of greater than 32 weeks and clinical course.
Maternal grandparents are caring for the 15 month old during this hospitalization and are supportive.
No medications.

Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
