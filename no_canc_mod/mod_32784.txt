He was transported to an area hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] becasue of his extensive injuries.
In the ED here he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive with an open book pelvic fracture with significant bleed.

Parafalcine subdural hematoma 2.
Punctate calcific densities in the scalp most likely represent sebaceous cysts versus foreign bodies.
No acute fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
Degenerative changes in the spine.
This predisposes the patient to spinal cord injury with minor trauma.
In the appropriate clinical context (for example myelopathy), consider MR for further evaluation.
There is an obliquely oriented fracture through the anterior column of the left acetabulum, minimally displaced.
There is a fracture of the left inferior pubic ramus, minimally displaced.
There is cortical thickening of the left proximal femur with a sclerotic irregularity running superiorly which may represent a healed fracture and 'ghost' track from an intramedullary rod.
Complex pelvic fractures including the anterior column of the left acetabulum, left inferior pubic ramus, right sacrum with extension into the S1 vertebral body and right transverse process of L5.
Pubic symphysis diastasis.
Right retroperitoneal, perivesicular and right inguinal hematoma without evidence for active extravasation.
PELVIS (AP ONLY); FEMUR (AP & LAT) BILAT; TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) BILAT There are multiple complex fractures of the pelvis, for details, please review the corresponding report of radiograph as well as CT torso.
There is no evidence of right femoral fracture.
There is old healed fracture of the left distal femur.
There is no evidence of fracture.
There is no evidence of dislocation or abnormal soft tissue swelling.
There is no evidence of trauma.
There is no evidence of soft tissue swelling.
Orthopedics and Neurosurgery were consulted because of his injures.
He was taken to the operating room on [**6-14**] by Orthopedics for open reduction, internal fixation of anterior ring with double plating; open reduction, internal fixation of posterior ring with right sacroiliac screw; examination under anesthesia with stress of pelvic fractures for pelvis stability; open reduction, internal fixation right distal humerus fracture; open reduction, internal fixation humeral shaft fracture extension; neuroplasty of radial nerve and radial nerve exploration (spin-off injury).
He did require transfusion with packed red cells for a hematocrit drop to 22; his hematocrit at discharge was 26.
Because he was a high risk for DVT given his orthopedic injuries and his non weigh bearing status for at least 12 weeks he was started on Lovenox injections [**Hospital1 **].
His pain was initially controlled with a PCA; he was later changed to IV narcotics and then transitioned to oral Dilaudid with adequate pain control.
Disp:*60 MG* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Motorcycle crash Subdural hematoma Right distal humerus fracture Pelvic fracture - open book Sacral fracture Right displaced proximal fracture head of 1st metatarsal Acute blood loss anemia  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, tolerating regular diet, pain adequately controlled.
Return to the Emergency room if you have fevers, chills, increased shortness of breath, chest pain, increased swelling in your legs, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
You will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
