Admission Date:  [**2182-4-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2182-5-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2118-2-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred from outside hospital, congestive heart failure exacerbation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 35080**] is a 64-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, mitral valve stenosis with recent admission to [**Hospital1 69**] for congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, requiring mitral valve replacement, however, was deemed not a surgical candidate who underwent an attempted valvuloplasty at [**Hospital6 1129**].
Her postoperative course is complicated by failure to extubate, hypotension requiring pressors, Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone.
Patient was recovering until [**4-9**] when she developed increased dyspnea.
Chest x-ray there demonstrated large left and small right effusion.
Had a limited echocardiogram which demonstrated preserved LV/RV function without effusion from which time per patient's family request, the patient was transferred.
Mitral valve stenosis, valve area of 0.7 cm with history of valvuloplasty x2.
2+ aortic stenosis, mild congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 51%.
Kyphoscoliosis with severe restrictive lung disease.
Breast cancer status post radical left mastectomy in [**2153**] with treatment with chemotherapy and radiation.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No early coronary disease.
Cardiovascular:  Distant holosystolic murmur at apex and intermittently audible diastolic murmur at upper sternal border.
Extremities:  No edema; thready dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis;  bilaterally warm.
Skin:  Positive erythema and scaling.
Urinalysis:  Large blood, 30 protein, trace ketones, and small bile, moderate leukocyte esterase.
Schitial intense evaluation.
Mrs [**Known lastname 35080**] was monitored in the admission evening in the Coronary Care Unit and underwent evaluation of her congestive heart failure and mitral stenosis.
Her mitral stenosis was evaluated by emergency echo was found to be severe, despite prior effort at percutaneous valvuloplasty at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Here, formal surgical consultation was obtained  and again she was determined to not be a candidate for surgery given her history of radiation treatment in the chest, her anatomic abnormalities with a kyphoscoliosis, and generalized deconditioning, and sepsis.
She underwent evaluation for any other improvement in cardiac hemodynamics including cardiac catheterization with shuntogram which demonstrated trivial left to right shunting from a perforated atrial septum.
She was maintained on Neo-Synephrine for hypotension with eventual switch to Levophed.
Infectious Disease:  Patient with persistent fevers and hypotension of unclear etiology.
She underwent tap of bilateral pleural effusions which demonstrated transudative fluid only.
She had no skin breakdown.
Liver function tests remained stable with modest elevations in her total bilirubin which were self limited.
She had no evidence of skin breakdown.
However, she developed severe contraction, alkalosis at this level of diuresis without significant improvement in her hemodynamics or pulmonary function.
Then gently allowed to equilibrate and further treatment of her congestive heart failure included therapeutic drainage of her bilateral pleural effusions.
Eventually, patient's metabolic alkalosis corrected sufficiently for extubation.
Her medications at this time with discontinuation of any further congestive heart failure management and antibiotics.
Congestive heart failure.
