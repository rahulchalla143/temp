Admission Date:  [**2193-4-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2193-4-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2135-7-11**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Company 191**]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from outside hospital for management of bleeding esophageal varices.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old male with hepatitis B and hepatitis C, cirrhosis with ascites, and esophageal varices (esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2193-1-7**] showed grade 2 varices in the lower/middle esophagus which were nonbleeding with congestion/friability in the stomach consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy), intravenous drug abuse, and bipolar disorder who was transferred from [**Hospital6 3426**] for management of bleeding esophageal varices.
He had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy there which revealed variceal rupture and underwent sclerosis.
The patient had increasing lethargy after Versed and had increased confusion.
The patient was treated with lactulose enemas and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for possible transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt evaluation.
Upon arrival, the patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli, had mild tachypnea, and a systolic blood pressure in the 70s to 80s.
The patient's initial laboratory results revealed significant metabolic acidosis, and the patient was intubated for airway protection, acidosis, and hypotension.
A chest x-ray was without pneumothorax or effusions.
The patient was given 3 units of packed red blood cells, a normal saline bolus of 500 cc, and started on a bicarbonate drip for severe acidemia with a blood gas showing a pH of 7.1, a PCO2 of 28, and PO2 of 383.
The oropharynx showed poor dentition, mucous membranes were moist.
The neck showed no jugular venous distention.
There was no lymphadenopathy.
The lungs had coarse rhonchi throughout.
There were no rales of wheezes.
There was a positive fluid wave, positive umbilical hernia.
There were multiple ecchymoses on the bilateral upper and lower extremities.
Gram stain revealed 1+ polys, no organisms.
There was no pneumothorax, no effusions, no consolidations.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, the patient is a 57-year-old male with hepatitis B and hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and ascites; status post recent esophageal variceal rupture with severe encephalopathy and metabolic acidosis (likely secondary to sepsis) who was hypotensive and intubated, on pressors, at the time of admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was felt to possibly be septic at the time of admission; possibly secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
His hypotension was felt to be multifactorial secondary to both hypovolemia secondary to blood loss as well as sepsis.
His encephalopathy was felt most likely to be secondary to his underlying liver disease as well as multiple sedating medications.
His coagulopathy was felt to be secondary to fulminant liver failure.
Initial management was aimed at treating possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as well as supportive care for the other problems described.
He developed thrombocytopenia of unknown cause.
He then became alcoholic secondary to the bicarbonate as well as ventilator settings; and ventilator adjustments were made as well as bicarbonate drip discontinued.
An abdominal ultrasound was obtained given his elevated amylase and lipase and elevated liver function tests.
This ultrasound showed liver cysts, normal portal flow, and gallstones but no evidence of obstruction.
There was evidence of cirrhosis and splenomegaly.
On hospital day three, the ascites cultures came back with 4/4 bottles positive for gram-negative rods.
His fractional secretion of sodium was greater than 25%; consistent with acute tubular necrosis from his hypotension.
His antibodies were sent given his decreasing platelets.
On hospital day six, the patient's urine culture came back positive for enterococcus.
On hospital day seven, a paracentesis was done with 6.8 liters of fluid removed.
At the time of transfer, the patient was without complaints.
He was still very encephalopathic but stable.
After arriving to the floor the patient was noted to have extremely poor output with less than 50 cc over four hours.
Foley irrigation was done, and approximately 50 cc of gross blood and clots were removed.
On hospital day nine, the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and banding of his esophageal varices by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**].
This procedure was without complaints, and the patient appeared stable that evening following the procedure.
His hematocrit was noted to be slowly trending down, but there was initially no evidence of rebleeding.
However, later that morning the patient developed hematemesis around 2 p.m.
He had no shortness of breath, chest pain, or abdominal pain at that time.
He did have some slight dizziness, however.
Then the patient developed a bloody bowel movement, maroon stool, which was approximately 300 cc.
He then had approximately 200 cc of bright red blood per rectum following.
Upon transfer back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient developed massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage; and despite pressors, fluid resuscitation, blood resuscitation, and octreotide, the patient was not able to be resuscitated.
Esophageal varices; status post banding.
Hepatitis B and hepatitis C cirrhosis.
Acute tubular necrosis.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Acute renal failure.
Urinary tract infection.
