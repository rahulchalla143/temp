HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 70 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis (aortic valve area 0.99, with a gradient of 68), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and left lobe lung cancer status post left pneumonectomy.
He presented to the outside hospital on [**2139-10-20**] with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion and productive cough.
The patient had been diagnosed with pneumonia on [**2139-10-9**], and started a steroid and Levaquin.
The patient had completed the course of steroid and the symptoms returned.
The patient went to the Emergency Department in [**Hospital 4415**] where a chest x-ray showed right lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient was treated as congestive heart failure with Nitroglycerin, lasix and Bi-PAP with chest PT.
The patient was diuresed two liters with symptomatic relief.
Left lung cancer status post pneumonectomy.
Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2129**].
Prostate cancer status post radiation.
Aortic stenosis.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient is a frail appearing elderly male, intubated, alert and oriented times three, in no apparent acute distress.
HEENT reveals no icterus, no pallor.
No focal neurological deficits.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, positive III/Vi holosystolic murmur which radiates to the neck bilaterally and to the left axilla.
There is positive jugular venous distention, positive peripheral pitting edema.
Pulmonary examination reveals no breath sounds on the left and scattered expiratory wheezes on the right with increased breath sounds anteriorly.
Abdominal examination shows a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen with normal bowel sounds.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at outside hospital.
Chest x-ray obtained here shows a decreased right sided effusion compared to chest x-ray obtained at outside hospital.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient's heart rate alternated between atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, atrial fibrillation with a controlled rate, normal sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia.
Because Diltiazem caused the patient to become excessively bradycardic (in the 30s), it was felt that the patient should be rate controlled, but that a pacemaker should be placed to prevent excessive bradycardia.
The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm most of the time but had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response at a rate of 140.
He would become symptomatic with shortness of breath when he would go into atrial fibrillation but these symptoms abated with rate control.
He tolerated this well and there were no complications.
Diltiazem dose was eventually increased to 240 mg q. day of sustained release and Dofetilide was started after pacemaker placement.
On the evening of the second day of Dofetilide, the patient developed a one asymptomatic 32-beat run of ventricular tachycardia.
This was felt not to be due to Dofetilide so much as to the patient's structural heart disease, but the dose of Dofetilide was decreased.
q. day with intravenous Hydralazine being used for acute blood pressure elevations.
q. day and Hydralazine was no longer necessary for blood pressure control.
The patient's aortic stenosis is not at [**Doctor Last Name **] level of severity which would necessitate aortic valve replacement.
DYSPNEA:  Because of the patient's elevated pulmonary artery pressure and significant lower extremity edema, he was felt to be volume overloaded with respect to total body volume.
Chest x-ray and auscultation revealed no signs of overt pulmonary failure.
The patient did diurese well with improvement in his shortness of breath and his creatinine remained stable with resolution of his BUN to creatinine ratio.
His dyspnea was also felt to be at least partly because of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient remained afebrile without a white blood cell count and there was no concern that his pneumonia had returned.
It should also be noted that the patient cannot tolerate beta blockers or ACE inhibitors.
His blood sugars should be closely monitored and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale, because although the patient is not diabetic, he has had significant hyperglycemia from the Prednisone.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post pacemaker placement, on Dofetilide and Diltiazem.
Non-critical aortic stenosis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Left lung cancer status post pneumectomy.
Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2129**].
Prostate cancer status post radiation.
