No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Conclusions Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=40%).
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Echo showed global hypokinesis.
He c/o LLQ pain on POD #12.
Left pleural effusion tapped on POD #12.
At 6:30 AM on POD #13, he acutely decompensated with acute respiratory failure on the floor.
Sternum found to be unstable on exam (no CPR had been performed).Bronchoscopy done to rule out aspiration.
New subclavian accesss established.He was taken directly to the OR and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] debrided his sternum and re-wired it.
The general surgery team then did an exploratory laparotomy to evaluate for acute mesenteric ischemia.
He had a right hemicolectomy, cholecystectomy, aortagram with right common iliac artery to SMA bypass graft ( vascular team), and then a small bowel resection by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
The family was consulted about his extremely grave prognosis and they agreed to continue the drips but no CPR or additional drug resuscitation.
Made CMO by family with increasing pressor requirements and acidosis.
