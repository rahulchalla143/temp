Admission Date:  [**2177-6-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-6-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2113-12-27**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old Kenyan man with a past medical history significant for insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and no known coronary artery disease, who presents complaining of substernal chest pain and chest pressure that was nonradiating, intermittent, occurred in brief episodes at rest, and was new, along with diaphoresis and shortness of breath, and general weakness, and fatigue for about two days, feeling somewhat worse today.
In the Emergency Department, the patient arrived pain free.
He was initially in mild apparent failure, but was having good urine output.
No known renal disease.
He has no known HIV risk factors, but had a negative HIV test in [**Month (only) 1096**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, decreased heart sounds, no murmurs appreciable.
No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.
Extremities:  1+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
Urinalysis revealed moderate blood and moderate protein.
Chest x-ray was consistent with cardiomegaly and diffuse bilateral pulmonary vasculature enlargement consistent with congestive heart failure.
Abdominal KUB revealed no free air, no obstruction, and positive stool.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 66 beats per minute, left axis deviation, P-R interval of 206, Q's in III and aVF, T-wave flattening in I and aVL, and no ST-T changes.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 63-year-old male with a history of insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and no known coronary artery disease who presents complaining of intermittent episodes of substernal chest pain x2 days associated with diaphoresis, shortness of breath, and fatigue concerning for unstable angina.
He was admitted continued symptoms to rule out myocardial infarction as well as workup for his increased creatinine of 1.7.
Procedures:  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2177-6-9**], which revealed a right dominant coronary vasculature, no significant obstructive disease with normal flow, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 30 mm Hg, and systolic hypertension.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram on [**6-10**], which revealed mild left atrial dilatation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, a resting basal to mid inferior akinesis and basal to mid inferolateral hypokinesis and akinesis, RVH, right ventricular cavity dilatation, mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular pressure and volume overload, mild aortic and mitral and tricuspid valve thickening, mild-to-moderate AR, mild MR, moderate TR, left ventricular inflow consistent with pseudonormal pattern with increased left sided filling pressures and impaired left ventricular relaxation, severe pulmonary artery hypertension, and an ejection fraction of 55%.
The patient underwent a VQ scan on [**6-12**] which was negative for embolic disease and was suggestive of central airway disease.
The patient underwent a chest CT scan on [**2177-6-12**] which was suggestive of congestive heart failure, although there was a mention of very mild enlargement of hilar lymph nodes to a nonpathologic degree as well as mention of a small nodule measuring several mm in the lung fields.
The patient underwent a cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**6-13**], which revealed mild global ventricular dysfunction with regional dysfunction of the distal anterolateral and septal walls as well as the apex.
There is no evidence of myocardial scarring.
There is no significant intercardiac shunt.
Preliminary studies on the right ventricular biopsy had been negative for any infiltrative disease.
Chest pain/rule out myocardial infarction:  The patient was started on aspirin, beta blocker, Heparin and Integrilin given the fact that he had active chest pain.
However, cardiac catheterization showed no coronary artery disease.
Pulmonary artery hypertension:  The workup mentioned above under the procedure section was performed to elicit a cause of the patient's pulmonary hypertension.
At the time of this dictation, the leading candidate for a cause is the patient's left heart disease and a restrictive cardiomyopathy secondary to diabetes, hypertension, and excessive salt intake.
Diabetes:  The patient was taken off Glucophage given his acute on chronic renal failure.
Acute renal failure versus chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's fractional excretion of sodium was greater than 3% suggesting that the patient had intrinsic renal disease.
He was started on lisinopril for renal protection.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient had a good ejection fraction by echocardiogram, but there was mention of several wall motion abnormalities.
They were asked to investigate the possibility that Infectious Disease may be causing the hilar lymphadenopathy and ground-glass opacities found on high resolution CT scan.
Iron studies were not significant for iron deficiency.
