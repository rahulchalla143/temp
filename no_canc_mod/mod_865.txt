Severe mitral regurgitation.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The valve is well seated with no peri or paravalvular regurgitation.
The cardiac index is 2.3 with a mean gradient of 3mm hg across the mitral valve.
The LVEF is now 35% with akinesis in the inferior/inferoseptal distribution likely from air down the RCA- weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.
[**11-6**] CXR:  Brief Hospital Course: MEDICINE COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 8520**] is a 74 year old male with known CAD s/p CABG ([**2152**]), HLD, rheumatic vavlular disease s/p MVR (porcine) at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2164**]), COPD, Afib s/p MAZE, AAA who presented to OSH one week before transfer with complaints of 3 weeks of worsening SOB and DOE and newly discovered 4+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7968**] LVEF (50%) and global hypokinesis.
# SEVERE MITRAL REGUGITATION: Mr. [**Known lastname 8520**] on [**Known lastname **] was noted to have 4+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
He presented with 5 months of SOB and DOE, worsening over the 3 weeks prior to admission with significant change in TTE and mitral valve function.
# HISTORY OF AFIB: AFib s/p MAZE procedure.
His home dose of Verapmil 240mg was split into 80mg Q8hrs due to the severe MR and concern for decompensation.
# CAD S/P CABG: Patient had a CABG in [**2152**] with repeat cath in [**2164**] showing 3 [**Year (4 digits) 8574**] vessels and 1 diffusely diseased graft.
# Leukocytosis to 14.
Patient asymptomatic, afebrile, admission WBC of 12 with neutrophilia (pt was on steroids previously).
# Hypertension: Patient had elevated blood pressure on transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
He was extubated, but quickly developed respiratory distress and was re-intubated.
He underwent bronchoscopy- which did not reveal mucous plugging.
He had brief bursts of AFib.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was ambulating, yet deconditioned, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
