Admission Date:  [**2186-12-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-1-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-12-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: chest pain and dyspnea on exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: AVR(#23 CE Magna pericardial)CABGx3(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM,SVG-RCA)[**12-28**]   History of Present Illness: 68 yo M with known CAD s/p PTCA in [**2173**], also with known AS.
Abnormal stress test led to cath which showed 3vd and AS.
Past Medical History: CAD(PTCA), HTN, ^chol, AS, Tonsillectomy, Gout, Asbestos exposure  Social History: works at golf course quit tobacco 40 years ago 2-6 beers/day  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: HR 68 RR 20 BP 157/72 NAD flat after cath Lungs CTAB ant/lat Heart RRR 3/6 SEM at LSB Abdomen benign Extrem warm, no edema 1 varicose vein on left calf.
Carotids with transmitted murmur v. bruit.
Minimal increase of the right-sided pleural effusion.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-2**], there is little change.
No definite pneumothorax with the right chest tube still in place.
Indeed, there is no change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Aortic valve replacement.
Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess given limited images but appears to be moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mildly dilated cavity and probably moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function.
Elevated LV filling pressure.
Bioprosthetic AVR with normal gradients and no visualized aortic regurgitation.
Small pericardial effusion.
There is a persistent anterior mediastinal hematoma, and a moderate sized pericardial effusion, with density measurements consistent with serosanguineous fluid.
The aorta opacifies thoroughly, and there is no evidence for dissection.
Main pulmonary arteries are well opacified, however, there are multiple bilateral filling defects within the segmental arteries, all compatible with small pulmonary emboli.
There are small bibasilar pleural effusions and associated atelectasis with near complete collapse of the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe.
Small amount of right-sided subcutaneous emphysema is seen.
There are healing posterior right rib fractures of the 9th and 10th ribs.
Stable bilateral extensive calcified pleural plaques.
Wedge-shaped foci of increased density in the left upper lobe may represent small focal infarcts.
Limited imaging below the diaphragm reveals no discrete abnormality on early arterial phase imaging.
There has been decrease in the size of the previously described phlegmonous tissue at the head of the right clavicle.
Multiple segmental and subsegmental bilateral pulmonary emboli with associated atelectasis and possible small left upper lobe pulmonary infarct.
No evidence for right heart strain currently.
Postoperative changes from recent sternotomy, with residual anterior mediastinal hematoma and partially sanguinous, moderat sized pericardial effusion.
Small bibasilar pleural effusions and extensive calcified pleural plaques, unchanged.
He was SOB and was transferred back to the ICU.
CTA showed bilateral PEs and he was started on heparin and coumadin.
He had atrial fibrillation but converted to NSR.
Discharge Instructions: Call with fever, redness or drainage from incision or weight gain more than 2 pounds in one day or five in one week.
Shower, no baths, no lotions, creams or powders to incisions.
