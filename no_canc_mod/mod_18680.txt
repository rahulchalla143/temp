Admission Date:  [**2164-7-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-8-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-4-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**CC Contact Info 62177**] Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**7-14**] Emergent craniectomy     External ventricular drain placement [**7-18**] Tracheostomy [**7-19**] PEG placement   History of Present Illness: HPI: 39 y/o female transferred from OSH s/p being struck by car.Report states that pt was walking off curb and hit by a car that was not decelerating.
CT of head showed large R SDH, IPH, and frontal skull fracture.
CT of c-spine and torso were also done with no abnormal findings.
Slight improvement in mass effect upon the lateral right ventricle and suprasellar cistern.
MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2164-7-14**] 9:49 PM FINDINGS: There is no disc or vertebral abnormality.
No pathology is seen in the area of the foramen magnum, except for the question of possible small area of hemorrhage along the left posterolateral aspect, suspected on prior head CT scan.
CONCLUSION: Negative cervical spine scan except for questionable finding at the level of the foramen magnum.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2164-7-15**] 4:57 AM Essentially unchanged picture of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with the minimal leftward-shift of midline structure.
Suggestion of interval slight decrease of pneumocephalus.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2164-7-17**] 7:55 AM Lateral ventricles less prominent than on study from two days prior may represent increasing ICP or cerebral edema.
Unchanged near complete obliteration of a quadrigeminal cistern.
No new areas of hemorrhage.
Intraventricular hemorrhage seen on prior study is less apparent on this current study  CT Head w/o contrast [**2164-7-20**] Parafalcine, small left subdural, and residual right subdural hematomas display no significant interval change with stable appearance to hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic bifrontal contusions with stable post-surgical changes from prior right frontal and temporal lobectomies.
Slight difference in the appearance of the tip location likely also reflects ventricular reexpansion rather than repositioning.
There is improved visualization of the basilar cisterns.
A small amount of hemorrhage is again noted within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Increasing low-density left-sided subdural effusion is noted which is likley more apparent related to decreased edema within the brain parenchyma.
Approximately 4 mm of rightward subfalcine herniation is noted.
Improvement to ventricular size and basilar cisterns which most likely reflects decreased intraparenchymal cerebral edema.
Slightly increased size to left subdural effusion may just be more apparent related to improvement in parenchymal edema.
There is no CT evidence of an acute pulmonary embolus.
There is a small amount of free air seen in the perihepatic region anteriorly within the abdomen.
I note that the patient has had a recent insertion of a PEG tube; however, at this stage, there should be no free air.
Has the patient had further abdominal surgery?
There are small epidural and subdural collections in the craniectomy bed, as seen on [**7-23**].
Small amounts of subdural blood products are again seen posteriorly along both cerebral hemispheres, falx and tentorium.
There is dural enhancement at the level of the craniectomy and at the level of the blood products, which is expected in the immediate postoperative and trauma setting.
There is a small fluid-intensity left subdural collection along the anterior left convexity as seen on [**7-23**], without associated dural enhancement, which most likely represents a hygroma.
There is high signal on FLAIR images in the right parasagittal occipital sulci (series 7, images [**11-25**]), likely related to subarachnoid blood.
A small focus of extra-axial, probably subarachnoid blood products is also seen along the floor of the left anterior cranial fossa (series 3, image 16, and series 9, image 64).
There is no evidence of parenchymal contrast enhancement outside of the blood products to suggest cerebritis or cerebral abscess.
There is a new 1 cm focus of high signal on FLAIR images in the right thalamus compared to [**2164-7-14**].
This may represent evolution of a subacute infarction.
Small lacunar infarctions in the left pons and midbrain are unchanged.
There is mild rightward shift of the anterior falx and septum pellucidum, which is either stable or minimally decreased compared to [**7-23**], allowing for differences in modalities and the patient positioning.
There is increased opacification of mastoid air cells compared to the previous study.
Unchanged small epidural and subdural collections at the right craniectomy site.
Unchanged small amount of subdural blood bilaterally.
Unchanged small amount of subdural fluid along the left convexity, most likely a hygroma related to recent surgery.
Dural enhancement at the craniectomy site and in the region of the blood products is expected given the recent surgery and trauma.
However, superimposed infection of fluid collections cannot be definitively excluded by imaging.
Small amount of right occipital parasagittal subarachnoid blood, with a small focus of associated contrast enhancement which is likely reactive.
If there is a clinical suspicion for a leptomeningeal infection, correlation with a lumbar puncture is suggested.
No evidence of cerebritis or cerebral abscess.
Evolving signal abnormality in the right thalamus, likely a small subacute infarction.
Unchanged chronic lacunar infarctions in the left thalamus and left midbrain.
Bilateral basal consolidations greater on the right base are unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
If any there is a small right pleural effusion.
No dilated small bowel loops are noted.
No free air is noted.
No radiographic evidence of obstruction or free air.
KUB [**7-27**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-26**], there is a large amount of fecal material throughout the colon as on the prior study.
No evidence of small-bowel obstruction or free intraperitoneal gas.
In the OR, patient underwent a R hemicrainectomy with a left frontal lobectomy and partial temporal lobectomy and and external ventricular drain was placed to reduce intracranial pressure.
Patient was tachycardiac and has a history of benzo and opiate substance abuse, she was given labetalol to control heart rate.
It was flushed and there was still no CSF draining that morning.
Infectious disease was consulted concerning her WBC or 30 and her antibiotic regimen.
Cultures ultimately grew out ACINETOBACTER and STENOTROPHOMONAS.
She was noted to have significant abdominal distention as well.
KUB was performed and negative for any intraabdominal air, but noted to have a significant amount of fecal material present.
She was started on a much more aggressive bowel regimin and had several bowel movements resulting in impovement in abdominal distention.
Patient shows improvement with free water restriction and occupational therapy consult was called because of contracted arms bilaterally.
