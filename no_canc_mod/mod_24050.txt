Admits to increased thirst, shortness of breath in past 24 hours.
Of note: Her recent pulmonary history showed persistent hypoxia, she had a VATS procedure and biopsy that showed respiratory bronchiolitis with underlying interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD).

Married and lives at home generally with her husband, no children.
She has no known exposure to tuberculosis.
She has one dog at home and reports no allergies to animals.
She otherwise lives at home generally with her husband, no children.
HEENT - [**Last Name (un) **], MMM, no icteric sclera Neck - non elevated JVP CV - +s1+s2 Tachycardic Hyperdynamic.
Abdomen - mildly tender to deep palpation along RLQ, mildly distended, no dullness to percussin.
R AKA with dressing, non tense, tender to palpation, no erythema above bandaged site.
2) No evidence of vascular graft/stent infection, and no other site of infection.
There continues to be right lower lobe atelectasis.
There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions which accounting for differences in technique are not significantly changed.
Re-distribution of effusion along the left lateral chest is likely positional in nature.
IMPRESSION: Accounting for differences in technique, the bilateral pulmonary opacities and moderate pleural effusions are not significantly changed.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: No 2D echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or abscess.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Depressed LV function.
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-12-13**], trace aortic regurgitation and low normal left venticular systolic function are seen on the current study (c/w diffuse process - toxin, metabolic, etc.).
Brief Hospital Course: 54 yo F with multiple medical problems including COPD, EtOH cirrhosis, pancreatitis, PVD s/p AKA in [**11-10**] who initially presented with MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia, started improving on antibiotics then returned [**1-31**] with worsening oxygen requirement in the setting fo superimposed influenza B.
MI was ruled out due to no ECG changes, no ST changes, no TWI, and Trops at 0.04. .
In addition, given her MSSA bacteremia and worsened respiratory status, patient was investigated for possibility of endocarditis, TTE and TEE were negative although she did have [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions and [**Doctor Last Name **] spots identified.
Pt also had a thigh CT to investigate possibility of R thigh graft infection, which was negative.
A WBC scan showed a left upper lung pneumonia that we know about, and no evidence of vascular graft/stent infection, and no other site of infection .
# Hypoxemia: Patient has persistent hypoxemia, most likely from necrotizing pneumonia, s/p Influenza B infection, also combination of CHF, COPD, persistent bilateral pleural effusion.
A CT Chest questioned new infiltrates vs. worsening of ILD or PNA, and oxygen requirement increased to 4L.
Pt had to be transfered to the medical ICU for intubation, for hypoxic respiratory failure.
She responded well to duonebs, chest PT, and incentive spirometry.
# Necrotizing pneumonia: CXR on [**2199-1-31**] showed dense left upper lobe consolidation  consistent with known prior necrotizing pneumonia, loculated left pleural effusions due to the likely superimposed viral infection, and a left basilar atelectasis.
Pt completed a 10 days course of clindamycin for any anaerobic causes of her PNA while in the hospital.
#Supratherapteutic INR: Patient was bridged from heparin back to coumadin for her history of venous and arterial clots, prior R illeo-fem graft clot.
Pulmonary consultants were unconvinced that she had a copd exacerbation.
#RB-ILD: Disease monitored in house.
Pulmonary consultants did not believe to be having worsening of this condition.
Nursing skin/wound care was consulted for a minor coccyx skin infection and patient was placed in a buffy bed to prevent further wound care.
Picc tip no growth.
# Anemia: No active bleeding.
# Pancreatitis: Chronic, thought to be [**1-5**] alcohol use in past, continues pancrease supplementation with diet.
# Hx of venous and arterial thrombi: Patient was on heparin gtt during her stay with an INR goal [**1-6**], and she was therapeutic [**Date range (1) 63763**].
# Depression: Continued Duloxetine .
# FEN: Low Na/DM diet.
# Access: PICC .
# Dispo: Acute Rehab, pending clinical improvement.
Morphine 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Injection Q4-6H () as needed for pain: hold for sedation or RR below 12.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Six (6) Puff Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for wheezing.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for question of worsening anemia, severe dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia.
You were found to have a worsening of respiratory status.
You received several types of echocardiograms which failed to show any type of infection on any of your valves.
You also received a WBC scan which did not show any other area of infection outside the area of your lung.
You had a CT study of your leg which showed no abnormalities with your graft.
Please return to the emergency department or call your primary care provider if you experience mental status changes, difficulty breathing, fevers greater than 101.5 degrees F, somnolence, worsening pain, or any other symptoms that concern you.
