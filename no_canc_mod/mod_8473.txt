Admission Date:  [**2193-1-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-1-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-2-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**] Chief Complaint: hypoxia and hypercarbia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 49 year old male with a PMH of HTN, DMII, OSA, COPD, CAD s/p IMI and stenting who presents with increasing shortness of breath, dizzyness, and bilateral lower extremity swelling over the past 2 weeks.
His symptoms improved, but then he developed a runny nose and post nasal drainage and began coughing grey-[**Known lastname **] sputum from his lungs.
Over this time period he has also developed worsening bilateral lower extremity edema that has been painful at times at the ankles.
He denies any prior history of lower extremity edema.
Respiratory therapy was called to arrange for patient's BiPap.
In addition he also endorses diarrhea yesterday only that has since resolved.
He has had no fevers, chills, vertigo, headache, chest pain, melena, BRBPR, myalgias, arthralgias, or dysuria.
Past Medical History: # CAD: 2VD s/p inferior STEMI & BMS->LCX [**2183**] - cath [**5-15**]: 30% prox LAD, 60% mid-LCx before patent OM1 stent, 100% RCA occlusion with good L->R collaterals # PVD s/p stenting of the right common iliac artery, [**2183**] # CHF, preserved EF on MIBI [**4-14**], ECHO [**1-12**] # COPD, FEV1 1.7 [**3-16**] # OSA on CPAP # Diabetes mellitus, type 2, HbA1c 6.2 in [**3-16**] # Hypercholesterolemia # Hypertension # Obesity  Social History: He works in shipping & receiving, was formerly a machinist.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.1, BP 106/80, HR 100, RR 22, 93% on 4L NC Gen: Obese caucasian male sitting up in bed in NAD HEENT: Clear OP, MMM NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RRR.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes, crackles, or rhronchi ABD: normo-active BS, soft, NT, ND.
EXT: 3+ edema in the feet bilaterally, 2+ to mid shins bilaterally.
SKIN: Multiple non-blanching, petechiae-like red dots on the anterior lower legs bilaterally.
Right inferior axis.
Borderline intraventricular conduction delay.
Low precordial voltage.
Early precordial ST segment elevations are no longer present.
CXR ([**2193-1-8**]): Limited study with increased left basilar density, which may reflect atelectasis and effusion though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Again, there is asymmetry of the density of the lungs with the left being somewhat darker.
Mild prominence of interstitial markings persists that could represent some asymmetric pulmonary edema.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
The right ventricleappears mildly dilated and hypokinetic.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic pressure hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 year old male with COPD (FEV1 1.7 [**3-16**]), CAD, HTN, DMII, OSA on CPAP who presents with SOB and LE swelling transferred to the unit for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Respiratory failure: Transferred from floor to ICU for combined hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Etiology unclear but likely a combination of chronic lung disease and mild CHF.
Chronically elevated Hct suggested chronic hypoxia, likely due to a combination of COPD and OSA.
pH of 7.3 with pCO2 of 82 suggests chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.
No obvious infection on CXR to suggest pna.
Increased LE edema and elevated BNP raised possibility of CHF.
He ruled out for acute MI and TTE was limited but LV function was thought to be normal with mild RV dilation and hypokinesis.
He was treated for COPD exacerbation with IV solumedrol which was transitioned to oral prednisone on hospital day # 3.
He received levofloxacin for possible atypical pneumonia for a 5 day course.
He was counselled to weigh himself daily, call his PCP for any weight increase >3lbs and to adhere to a low salt diet.
Potentially due to significant hypoxia as was in 70s on RA at outpt appointment on admission.
He had no further symptoms throughout his hospitalization.
No arrhythmias on telemetry.
The patient was found to have profound erythrocytosis to Hct of 60.
He was evaluated by the heme-onc consult service who felt this most likely represented secondary polycythemia due to chronic hypoxia.
Due to the marked elevation in Hct, the patient was felt to be at risk for symptoms associated with his condition.
It is possible though unlikely that the patient will experience hypoxia associated with this loss in oxygen carrying capacity.
Large reversible defect in inferior wall in [**3-16**] but no intervenable CAD on cath in [**5-15**].
No chest pain on history and he ruled out for MI with serial enzymes.
Diastolic heart failure.
As described above, the patient was confirmed on TTE to have diastolic heart failure.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual once a day as needed for chest pain: Take one pill every 3-5 minutes for chest pain.
Outpatient pulmonary rehab Attend outpatient pulmonary rehab for ongoing care.
COPD exacerbation 2.
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure 3.
Obstructive sleep apnea 4.
Secondary polycythemia .
Coronary artery disease 2.
Peripheral vascular disease 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
Hypertension 6.
Obesity   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and you were found to have low oxygen levels.
You were also found to have extremely high blood counts.
This is likely due to chronic low oxygen levels in the blood.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital for any new or worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling in the ankles or weight gain >3lbs.
This appointment was scheduled to discuss your symptoms of peripheral vascular disease.
