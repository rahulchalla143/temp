was in his USOH until Monday, 6 days PTA, when he developed a bifrontal and retroorbital headache.
It was a stabbing [**2110-6-19**] pain that was relieved with Ibuprofen but recurred over the next several days.

There is evidence of disc degenerative changes with disc desiccation involving the L2/3 through L5/S1 disc interspaces.
Post-surgical changes from previous laminectomy at L5/S1 are identified.
However, no significant central canal stenosis is identified.
At L2/3, there is a mild central disc bulge without evidence of central canal stenosis or foraminal narrowing.
At L3/4, there is a small central disc herniation associated with a central bulge without evidence of significant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
At L4/5, there is a small left paramedian disc bulge without evidence of central canal stenosis or significant neural foraminal narrowing.
At L5/S1, there is a small central disc bulge with an associated annular tear.
There is no central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
IMPRESSION: Congenitally small central canal with multilevel disc degenerative changes and a small disc herniation at L3/4.
No evidence of significant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 24 y/o with a history of lumbar spinal stenosis who presents with HA, nausea and dizziness, LE weakness and numbness, and urinary retention.
His exam is significant for loss of sensation with a T7 sensory level and bilateral IP weakness.
It is difficult to localize all of his symptoms with one lesion.
It is possible that dizziness and vertigo are [**1-14**] labrynthitis as suggested and are unrelated to his LE symptoms.
If vertigo is related to LE weakness there would have to be a multifocal process affecting the cerebellar vermis and thoracic spine.
Given his T7 level there is concern for a thoracic lesion, either from spinal stenosis, disc herniation, ADEM or infectious myelitis.
MRI Head, C, and T spine with contrast that showed increased T2 signal at multiple C and T levels and cerebellar peduncle, medulla.
EMG was consistent with spinal process and did not show demyelination peripherally.
Differential diagnosis included infectious, postinfectious and inflammatory.
There were no oligo-clonal bands in CSF.
He was switched to prednisone [**9-21**] then resumed solumedrol [**9-22**] when repeat MRI brain showed increased inflammation (restricted diffusion in enlarging lesion in L internal capsule measuring ~1 cm.
New lesion in L middle cerebellar peduncle.
Repeat MRI of head, C and T spine were improved on [**9-27**]; although T2 hyperintense lesions remain within the left internal capsule, left middle cerebellar peduncle, and at the pontomedullary junction, all of the lesions are considerably improved and show no mass effect or enhancement.
Marked interval improvement in the appearance of T2-signal abnormalities in the cervical and thoracic cords, including reduced expansile mass effect among the cervical lesions.
He will need to have his Lyme titer repeated which will be done in [**Hospital **] clinic as an outpatient after completion of this antibiotic course.
Ampicillin/gentamicin was added for Listeria coverage.
GI: Patient developed severe constipation requiring daily disempaction x3 days.
Patient had nausea and vomitting requiring him to be NPO and NGT was placed to intermittent suction.
KUB was negative for obstruction and suggested gas filled loops of colon.
Patient received Golytely and Milk of molasses enema with moderate results.
GI was consulted and recommended gastrogaffin enema [**2106-9-23**] which did not show an obstruction and suggested paresis of the colon.
Patient had small amount of vomit that was gastrocult postive however his Hct remained stable and HD stable.
Per GI, felt likely d/t irritation of stomach lining from NGT and suggested increasing to Protonix [**Hospital1 **].
His stools continue to be loose and bowel regimen was gradually decreased.
Consider alternative method for prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis.
Careful medication review for medication induced thrombocytopenia needs to be performed and patient should be switched to alternative medications as indicated.
PULM: On HD #2, patient had increasing tachypnea and work of breathing on the afternoon so was in admitted to the Neuro intensive care unit for monitoring between [**9-13**] to [**9-16**].
Chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia.
Chest CT noncontrast to r/o parenchymal disease was negative and just showed left-sided atelectasis.
PSYCH: Patient developed steroid psychosis.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5-1 Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety, hiccups.
Med alert No Heparin or Heparin Flushes secondary to Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia Antibody Positive.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Rhomboencephalomyelitis Constipation High dose steroid induced delirium HIT antibody positive   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable.
