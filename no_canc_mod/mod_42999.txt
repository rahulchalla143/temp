No acute ST-T wave changes.
Patchy increased lung markings remain at both bases, particularly on the right side, which may be due to the degree of underinflation.
No frank dilatation is identified.

There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of hemorrhage.
