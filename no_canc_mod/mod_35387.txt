He underwent a cardiac cath which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Then referred for bypass surgery.
Past Medical History: Coronary Artery Disease and Myocardial Infarction s/p PTCA to RCA [**2157**], Hypertension, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity, Diabetes Mellitus PSH: Left eye surgery, Parotid Cyst surgery  Social History: Quit smoking [**2156**] after 1ppd x 45 yrs.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no major change.
Unchanged cardiomegaly with no obvious signs of hyperhydration or cardiac failure.
The minimal pleural effusion left has slightly increased in extent and causes moderate retrocardiac atelectasis.
Otherwise, no focal parenchymal opacities.
