Admission Date:  [**2186-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-10-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization with two bare metal stents to Right Coronary Artery   History of Present Illness: 87 yo female with history of dementia presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2186-10-8**] with chest pain and diaphoresis, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for immediate cath as thought to have an inferior STEMI, with ST elevations and CKs ranging from 150-155.
She was found to have a chronic total occlusion of the RCA which was stented.
She was hypoxic and hypotensive with a PCWP of 20-25 in the catheterization lab and was admitted to the CCU post-operatively for additional management.
Soon thereafter the patient stabilized and was transferred to a general medical floor on [**2186-10-11**] for ongoing management while she recovered from her recent MI and additional care of her multiple co-morbidities, including COPD, Anemia, Alzheimer's type dementia, rheumatoid arthritis.
Of note, she had a leukocytosis to 33 with 92% neutrophils, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and an elevated LDH in addition to her cardiac issues.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 80177**] hyponatremia and transaminitis resolved but her leukocytosis and elevated LDH remained active issues.
Infectious work up revealed negative blood and urine cultures, and a CT torso significant for multi-focal ground glass opacities consistent with edema vs. a multi-lobar infectious process, and one enlarged 17x17mm subcarinal lymph node was found as well.
Soon after the patient was transferred to the general medical floors, she began to have persistent bouts of NSVT noted on telemetry.
Fortunately, she remained asymptomatic during these episodes but the NSVT runs became increasingly more prolonged with telemetry tracings demonstrating 60-70 beat runs of ventricular tachycardia.
The patient had no chest pain, dizziness or shortness of breath compliants at that time and her blood pressures were stable.
While on the inpatient cardiology service the patient continued to have multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia lasting as long as 50-60 minutes.
She converted back to normal sinus, sinus bradycardia and occasional AV-block (I and II) on her own on multiple occasions but generally required additional Amiodarone and Lidocaine boluses to resolve her VT episodes.
The patient continued to be completely asympomatic and hemodynamically stable during these episodes of VT.
She was initially evaluated for a defibrillator but it was decided that she would have poor quality of life with a device given the frequency of her VT and she was also a poor surgical candidate given her multiple co-morbidites.
A more detailed EP study with possible ablation was also explored but the patient continued to have bradycardia, hemodynamic instability and an acute PNA infection.
Due to her bradycardia with Amiodarone she was switched to Quinidine for control of her VT episodes.
Unfortunately, she did not tolerate Quinidine well and was admitted to the CCU for monitoring of hemodynamically unstable bradycardia and the alarming onset QT prolongation after initiating therapy with quinidine.
Past Medical History: CHF with a "dilated ventricle" Rheumatoid arthritis on prednisone and methotrexate history of falls, including pelvic fracture after a fall in [**Month (only) 956**] Anemia COPD/bronchiectasis Pneumonia status post intubation in [**7-25**] urinary incontinence Alzheimer's type dementia   Social History: Lives in [**Hospital3 **], independent with ADLs, but meals are supplied and daughter helps the patient with her daily medications by setting up her pill box for dispensing her daily medications appropriately.
Family History: No family history of sudden cardiac death or early CAD.

SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pertinent Results: CXR [**2186-10-18**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
Patchy poorly marginated opacities in the upper lung zones are unchanged.
Note is again made of diffuse aortic calcification.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 1 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had mild disease.
The LCx was calcified with a proximal 40% stenosis in OM1.
The RCA was calcified with total occlusion at the mid segment.
There were faint collaterals filling the distal portion of the RCA from the left coronary artery.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 14mm Hg.
There was mild to moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 45/19 mm Hg.
Systemic arterial pressure was elevated at 210/80 mm Hg prior to administration of NTG drip IV.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
Predominant central and dependent pulmonary ground-glass opacities with underlying fissural thickening which is more consistent with edema.
Perihepatic ascites and periportal edema, could be due to underlying CHF.
Old renal infarcts and narrowing of bilateral renal artery at origin, concern for renal artery stenosis.
Multiple bilateral renal hypodense lesions, most likely renal cysts 5.
Unhealed old fractures of the left superior and inferior pubic ramus.

During the procedure she was hypoxic and hypotensive with a PCWP of 20-25 so she was transferred to the CCU for post-operative monitoring.
She was noted to have a leukocytosis to 33 with 92% neutrophils, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and an elevated LDH in addition to her cardiac problems.
Of note, the patient also has several additional active co-morbidities which include COPD, chronic anemia, Alzheimer's type dementia, hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis.
The patient's hyponatremia and transaminitis resolved but her leukocytosis and elevated LDH persisted.
A CT of her torso was significant for multi-focal ground glass opacities consistent with edema vs. a multi-lobar infectious process and one enlarged 17x17mm subcarinal lymph node was described as well.
The patient's arrhythmia was initially managed solely with metoprolol and then an amiodarone drip was started on [**2186-10-13**] at 4AM by nightfloat after the patient had a 60 minute episode of  ventricular tachycardia and EP was consulted.
They did not want to perform VT ablation in the setting of the patient's possible pneumonia and leukocytosis and recommended stopping the Amiodarone load and continuing the metoprolol.
The lidocaine had limited success and it was felt that Amiodarone may have been contributing to the patient's bradycardia.
The patient was transferred back to the CCU on [**2186-10-17**] for monitoring of hemodynamically unstable bradycardia and new onset QT prolongation soon after initiating therapy with Quinidine.
She triggered for bradycardia to the 30-40 range and appeared diaphoretic and pale with systolic blood pressures ranging from 70-90 range which was a marked dip from her baseline 120-130 systolic ranges.
An EKG revealed a prolonged QTc to 580 with sinus bradycardia.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 80178**] hyponatremia resolved and her earlier bouts of hyponatremic were considered to be secondary to dehydration.
The patient has severe joint deformities secondary to her rheumatoid arthritis.
During her CCU stay she was continued on her maintenance steroids with Prednisone  daily and her methotrexate medications were held secondary to her acute illness.
The patient's low Hct levels were felt to be due to her chronic anemia.
An anemia workup was consistent with anemia of chronic disease with mixed Fe-deficiency.
In terms of her Alzheimer's type dementia the patient was alert and oriented to person, place and time for the majority of her hospital stay with only minimal prompting on occasion.
Initially the patient's Aricept and Namenda were continued but were eventually held as they are shown to cause QTc prolongation and were felt to be dangerous given the patients recent bradycardia and heart block history.
The patient's leukocytosis showed only mild improvement while on the CCU service despite continued antibiotics for her PNA.
Repeat CXRs showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with possible aspiration and a small consolidation was noted at the patitn's left upper lung lobe.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebs were continued PRN for ongoing COPD management as well as additional therapy to help patient with shortness of breath associated with her suspected pneumonia.
Ground glass opacities seen at bases on Chest CT seem more likely due to volume overload than infectious infiltrate.
WBC was followed closely and there was a small concern for occult malignancy.
A speech and swallow evaluation was done and it was felt that the patient was not a major aspiration risk.
On [**2186-10-17**] her PNA coverage was broadened to Vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed HAP as she had persistent WBC elevations while on Levofloxacin coverage.
On [**2186-10-19**] the patient began to display worsening shortness of breath and a new development of fluid overload alongside declining oxygen saturation levels.
This was felt to be secondary to an acute CHF exacerbation and she was given morphine, nitroglycerin drip and diuresed with Lasix to help manage her CHF.
CXRs showed bilateral effusions and physical exam revealed bilateral crackles at the mid-lower lung fields.
She was switched to Tylenol for control of her painful arthritis symptoms.
At time of discharge home with hospice services on [**2186-10-24**] the patient was switched to Morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution 5-15 mg PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: 5-15 mg PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
