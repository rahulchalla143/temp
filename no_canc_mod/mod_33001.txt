Family History: Brother with CAD/stents in 60's.
Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed three-vessel disease: --the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD had a 90% mid-LAD lesion extending into the origin of D1.
--the LCx had an 80% stenosis in OM1.
--the RCA had a 90% distal stenosis.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension, with SBP 171 mmHg.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from LV to ascending aorta.
[**3-18**] CNIS: There is less than 30% stenosis within bilateral internal carotid arteries.
The left greater saphenous vein had diameters of 0.45, 0.35, 0.33 and 0.27 at the level of the groin, mid thigh, knee and mid calf respectively.
[**3-21**] Echo: PRE CPB Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
This is likely due to a slight retraction of the posterior leaflet.
Therev is mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No other changes from pre bypass study.
On [**3-18**] she underwent cath which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Early on post-op day one he was slightly confused and anxious but responded well to Haldol.
