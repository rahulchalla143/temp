OP not assessed due to intubation.
JVD not able to be assessed due to body habitus.
Cellulitic changes on flanks bilaterally.
Ext: Gross pitting edema to thighs bilaterally.
Has necrotic heel ulcers bilaterally (dry) and necrotic ulcer on base of R great toe (dry).
Chronic venous stasis color changes to both calves.
Has large sacral decub, but not able to be visualized currently.
Not able to illicit patellar or ankle reflexes bilaterally.
CXR [**10-22**] - (my read) clear lung field, enlarged heart, can not follow NGT into stomach, ETT in place   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 61yo M w/ an extensive PMH notable for morbid obesity, paraplegia due to an extensive epidural abscess, CAD, here for hypotension in setting of wound debridement for sacral decubitus ulcer.
Continued to be tachycardic with an elevated lactate and leukocytosis.
Concern now for septic shock given the lack of improvement with large volumes of fluids.
Infectious source is likely his sacral decub -> may have become transiently bacteremic intraop.
Will send urine for UA and cx, blood cx and stool cx (given marked leukocytosis and long term use of abx, should r/o Cdiff).
- fluid boluses and levophed for MAP > 60, SBP > 90 - blood to maintain hct > 30 - serial lactates - check UA, urine cx, blood cx, stool cx for Cdiff - cont zosyn, linezolid, flagyl for empiric antibiotic coverage - hold on [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim for now given that we would not give steroids given poor wound healing - no evidence of cardiac ischemia, EKG unchanged from prior, cardiac enzymes negative x 2 sets .
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Unclear etiology, but raises concern for infectious source.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Had issues with hypoventilation intraoperatively.
CXR with worsening pulmonary edema likely secondary to IVF fluid resuscitation.
# SACRAL DECUBITUS: Debrided in OR.
No cultures taken.
Last culture on [**10-2**] showed Pseudomonas (MDR) but [**Last Name (un) 36**] to zosyn.
- f/u plastic surgery recs - dressing changes as able - transfuse to keep Hct >30 - cont abx - cont zinc, ascorbic acid .
# ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:  Likely due to his lactic acidosis.
Cr is 1.1, from baseline of 0.7-0.8 with decrease urine output.
Likely prerenal azotemia vs. component of ATN.
If component of ATN may not be able to assess volume status via urine output so will bolus for blood pressure.
# CAD: Has a h/o CAD and is s/p CABG: EKG with right heart strain but no change from prior.
# Increased size of left pupil: Both pupils reactive but left greater than right.
[**Month (only) 116**]  need to consider decreasing sedation and checking more formal neurologic exam.
Unable to obtain brain imaging secondary to body habitus.
# DIABETES MELLITUS: On HISS with FS QID.
# HYPOALBUMINEMIA: Albumin of 1.4, likely due to poor nutritional state.
- nutrition consult for low albumin - hold on RUQ U/S for now .
Overall, patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate in spite of aggressive fluid recussitation, broad spectrum antibiotics, pressors, and respiratory support.
This was likely due to sepsis from his chronic wound.
Pt expired as a result of cardiopulmonary arrest on [**2179-11-2**] and his family was made aware.
