Admission Date:  [**2153-10-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-10-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-11-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Cefaclor / Erythromycin  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**] Chief Complaint: fevers, rigors, and abd pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 27 year old male with history of polysubstance abuse who presented to the ED with fevers, chills, abdominal pain.
He felt weak, then was nauseous and had 4 episodes of vomiting, unsure if it was bloody or not.
At this time, developed chills and [**8-4**] abdominal pain radiating from the epigastrium to the back.
He was noted to have a 1cm raised nonerythematous or fluctuant area in his right antecubital fossa with diffuse erythema.
On the floor, patient still complains of [**6-4**] abdominal pain, but no fevers or chills.
He does admit to increased sleepiness and malaise prior to Saturday.

[**2153-10-15**] 4:10 am URINE      N.                              **FINAL REPORT [**2153-10-15**]**     Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2153-10-15**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
[**2153-10-14**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
FINDINGS: There is increased opacity in the region of the right middle/lower lobe.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild right ventricular dilation.
No vegetation seen.
[**2153-10-15**] CXR (Portable): There is minimal interval progression of the interstitial prominence, findings that might be consistent with volume overload, especially given the distention of the azygos vein.
The right lower lung opacity adjacent to the right cardiac border may be a part of the volume overload but it may represent focus of developing infection as well, and should be reevaluated after diuresis.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is small amount of right pleural effusion present, better appreciated on the current study.
IMPRESSION: Volume overload/mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Those findings may potentially mask underlying infection and reevaluation of the patient after diuresis is highly recommended.
[**2153-10-15**] CT Abd/Pelvis W/Contrast: CT ABDOMEN: There are bilateral small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, with associated compressive atelectasis, right greater than left.
Interlobular septal thickening is also present, suggestive of volume overload.
The liver demonstrates no focal lesion.
The gallbladder, spleen, a tiny splenule, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
Bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
There is no free air or free fluid.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
There is no free fluid within the pelvis.
No suspicious focal, lytic, or blastic lesions.
Pulmonary interlobular septal thickening and small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, right greater than left.
These findings are suggestive of volume overload.
No evidence of acute process within the abdomen or pelvis.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU [**Location (un) **] Course 27 y/o male with history of polysubstance abuse and MSM who presents with fevers, chills, abdominal pain after shooting oxycontin with toilet water followed by a large amount of alcohol intake.
# Fevers, rigors, chest pain - The most concerning etiology was from infection after injection with toilet water, most likely bacteria include GNR and GPC, however, the timing of supposed injection of contaminated water and presentation of fever and chills was not consistent with ~24-36 hours in between events.
His serum tox screen negative but urine tox screen positive for Methadone.
A TTE was ordered to evaluate for any evidence of endocarditis, with a TEE planned if the patient had positive blood cultures or was persistently febrile.
The patient left AMA with a rising white count.
# Shortness of breath - This was thought to be secondary to bronchospasm from multiple possible etiologies including aspiration, asthma, septic emboli, pulmonary edema.
A CXR showed evidence of pulmonary edema or early pneumonia.
He also auto-diuresed well and lasix was held for only if the patient became hypoxic or short of breath again.
# Leukopenia - The patient presented with a WBC of 1, which increased to 11 on repeat labs.
The low WBC was concerning for HIV infection or sepsis.
HIV serologies and viral load testing was sent (serologies negative and viral load pending).
Patient left with leukocytosis AMA.
# Abdominal pain - Amylase and lipase were negative on admission.
A CT A/P with PO/IV contrast was obtained which did not show concerns for acute intraabdominal process.
The patient's pain had resolved when he left AMA.
# Renal failure - Unknown if this is acute or chronic as a baseline is unknown.
# Coagulopathy - Patient has elevated INR.
Differential includes chronic liver disease, vitamin K deficiency.
His LFTs were trended and a hepatitis panel for A, B, and C was sent and returned without evidence of infection.
# Alcohol abuse - Patient reports intake of ~1 pint alchol daily, but denies history of withdrawal symptoms, including DTs.
# Electrolytes - Patient was hypophosphatemic and hypomagnesemic.
Differential included alcohol intake, poor PO, chronic liver disease, legionella.
# The patient left AMA despite being warned about rising white count while on broad-spectrum antibiotics raising concern for serious infection that may cause severe illness or death.
Medications on Admission: Abilify 5mg Trazodone 100mg Clonidine 0.1 mg   Discharge Medications: N/A  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: EtOH and Oxycontin Abuse/Withdrawal, Right Arm Soft Tissue Infection,  Discharge Condition: The patient left AMA with a rising leukocytosis on broad spectrum antibiotics.
He was instructed that by leaving AMA he was placing himself at risk for severe illness and death.
