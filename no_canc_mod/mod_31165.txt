Admission Date:  [**2190-11-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2190-12-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2128-8-24**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma who is on two liters of home oxygen, not on chronic steroids, spontaneous right pneumothorax, status post suction with video-assisted thoracic surgery, and talc pleurodesis who now presents with a history of two to three days of increasing shortness of breath, chest tightness, and a cough productive of yellow sputum.
The patient denied any chest pain, fever, or cough; but the patient did report upper respiratory tract symptoms beginning two days prior to admission.
She has a chronic with white sputum with oxygen saturations of 96% on room air with 90% on ambulation.
Initially, she was given albuterol nebulizers but became increasing dyspneic with a respiratory rate to 30.
A chest x-ray revealed hyperinflated lungs, bilateral apical bola, no infiltrate.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a FEV1 of 32% of predicted; on two liters of oxygen at home.
Status post spontaneous pneumothorax in [**2190-1-29**] with resection and right pleurodesis via video-assisted thoracic surgery.
Multiple chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admissions; no prior intubations.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed mucous membranes were moist.
Neck examination revealed no jugular venous distention.
Lungs revealed diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes with decreased breath sounds at the bases.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragm.
Bilateral pleural thickening versus pleural effusion, congestive heart failure, a sixth rib fracture.
No congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 140, normal axis and normal intervals.
1-mm ST depressions in leads V5 and V6.
Left atrial hypertrophy.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Her hospital course was notable for the development of metabolic acidosis which the Renal Service attributed to ethanol-induced nontubular acidosis.
She was felt to have ventilator associated pneumonia and was started on ceftazidime for a question of left lower lobe infiltrate on [**2190-12-3**]; although, all chest x-rays had been negative.
Evaluation revealed evidence of granulation tissue; probably secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease prompting continuation of Protonix.
A bedside evaluation revealed evidence of aspiration.
She had no complaints, and review of systems was only positive for a sore throat and weakness.
She was seen again by Otorhinolaryngology who did a flexible bronchoscopy which revealed slight edema of the vocal cords, normal mobility, less than 3-mm granuloma of the right vocal process, completely normal post intubation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma exacerbation; status post intubation.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Laryngeal muscle damage; status post intubation.
