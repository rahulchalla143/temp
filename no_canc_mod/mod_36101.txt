Admission Date:  [**2123-2-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-3-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-6-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: Bradycardic arrest, found hypotensive.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation Right radial arterial Line Temporary pacing wire (transvenous)   History of Present Illness:   Dr. [**Known lastname 102918**] is a 62-year-old psychiatrist (former anesthesiologist) at [**Hospital1 **], with history of coronary disease (on cath.
no stents), poorly controlled diabetes, gout, hypertension, dyslipidemia, who is admitted for treatment of bradycardic arrest.
EMS was called; patient was found to have bradycardia with rate of 30.
Patient was intubated; he was given atropine and started on transthoracic pacing with peripheral dopamine.
No Kayelexate given.
Per ED note: Patient had chest pain.
Hypertension 3.
Chronic renal insufficiency (likely diabetic) 5.
Coronary artery disease s/p catheterization (at [**Hospital 2586**]).
He had had a positive stress test and elective cath.
in [**2117**]: Anatomy: LAD 50-60% stenosis distally.
LCx and LM without lesions.
No stents placed.
No evidence of CABG (although in ED note - no evidence of incision and no sternotomy wires).
Obstructive sleep apnea 9.
Gridiron incision c/w past appendectomy.
No recreational drugs.
He has no children.
Family History: Mother died of pancreatic ca in her mid 80s, she also had type 2 DM.
Father died of stomach cancer aged 47.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: Overweight man with good self-care and of generally heathy constitution.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Cardiovascular: R, normal S1 S2, no M/R/G Respiratory: Clear to auscultation throughout, no wheeze, rhonchi.
Gastrointestinal: Benign - soft, non-tender, non-distended, no organomegaly.
Painful, without sensory changes, capillary refil rapid, impression of pain-limited strength - not in neurologic distribution (would need to be radial, ulnar and median all at wrist, but paradoxically including extrinsic hand muscles).
Greatest pain over dorsum of wrist.
Gross motor intact with pain limited extension and flexion of wrist and movement of intrinsic AND extrinsic hand muscles on right.
Neurology Consultation [**2123-3-2**] Impression: With moderate edema and tenderness, the exam is quite limited, but as his sensation is nearly normal, I expect his motor power is also probably fairly normal.
Hopefully edema will resolve soon, and he should follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 12332**] in 2 weeks if he continues to have any motor or sensory concerns with his hand.
UENI US IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus within the right basilic vein.
Late in the hospitalization, right hand swelling and pain was noted.
Symptoms, signs and examination were not consistent with a neurologic cause and it was attributed to superficial venous thrombosis, confirmed on ultrasound.
This state was responsible for hyperkalemia and bradycardia, hypotension and presentation.
Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II.
Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor control and chronicity more than this acute event and is 11, suggesting average glucose of 280 mg/dl.
DM management will be critical to prevent further bradycardic arrest and other complications.
Hypertension   Hypotensive on arrival.
But became hypertensive (likely baseline) with pacing.
Aimed for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral hypoperfusion in this patient, while intubated and sedated.
Acute Renal Failure   Likely secondary to diabetes.
Would recommend tight glucose control and following of urinary protein.
Hand Pain   Likely due to venous insufficiency, particularly given swelling, pain, erythema.
Non-occlusive thrombus in basilic vein.
Coronary Artery Disease   Two vessel disease, likely without stents.
Ischemic etiology possible, particularly if sinus node infarcted.
No intervention - inactive while here.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Male First Name (un) **] nursing and rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemic state Hyponatremia Complete Heart Block Aspiration Pneumonia Thrombocytopenia Acute Renal Failure, Stage 3   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You had a bradycardic arrest from high potassium levels and high glucose levels.
You had a fever which we think was from aspiration, you received 7 days of antibiotics to treat this and had no fever or leukocytosis today.
You have a painful right arm that we think is from the right basilic clot and muscle soreness because of restraints and agitation.
Start Colace and Senna as needed to prevent constipation 2.
Start Tramadol to treat the pain in your right wrist 5.
Start Pantoprazole to prevent irritation from the aspirin.
Start Tylenol every 8 hours to treat the pain in your wrist 9.
Start Ferrous sulfate to treat your iron deficiency 10.
Start Taking Lorazepam as needed for Anxiety   Followup Instructions: Primary Care: [**Doctor Last Name **],ZINAIDA Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7751**] Date/Time: Please make an appt to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] when you get out of rehabilitation.
