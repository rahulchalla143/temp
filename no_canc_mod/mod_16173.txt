Admission Date:  [**2135-3-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2135-4-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-1-29**]     Sex:  M  Service:  ORTHOPEDICS  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37-year-old male, pedestrian struck by auto, who presented with a pelvic fracture and questionable right femur fracture with open wound, also likely closed head injury, intubated on the scene.
Right lower extremity with an approximately 2 cm shortness from left lower extremities.
Femur negative for fractures at that time.
X-ray showed right superior and inferior pubic ramus fracture with widening of pelvis, likely fracture of right sacrum versus S1.
IMPRESSION:  The impression at that time was a 37-year-old male with pelvic fractures, unstable, with superior-inferior right pubic ramus fractures and vertical sacral fracture.
He will need this fixed but not at that time secondary to the patient's intubated status and other issues.
No other bladder injury noted at that time.
The plan was to keep current Foley in place as cannot rule out coincidental urethral injury.
Outside films were unavailable at that time, but right hematoma, no pulsatile or expanding.
The case went without incident.
The patient also had noted bilateral shoulder dislocations which were reduced and put in a sling for several days until the patient was able to weightbear.
No other events while in-house.
Trauma continued to follow the patient secondary to his bladder rupture.
There were issues regarding placement secondary to lack of insurance.
The patient continued to have an uneventful stay.
On [**2135-3-25**], the patient had a left knee CT done to rule out any ligamentous damage or dislocation secondary to some swelling and effusion in the left knee when working with physical therapy.
The CT results showed no fracture or dislocations.
No ligamentous injury at that time.
MRI would be more effective but secondary to the patient having an EX fix in place, was not able to receive an MRI.
No other events.
He will be touchdown weightbearing of the right lower extremity, weightbearing as tolerated of the left lower extremity.
There were no ruptures noted during cystogram.
12 hours for a six week duration.
