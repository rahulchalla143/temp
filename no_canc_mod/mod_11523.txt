During the ERCP he had an episode of desaturation to 70s.
He received flumazenil and naloxone after he became hypoxic.
At 3:30am he developed acute onset sbp in 70s and ST to 140s that responded to a few hundred cc of IVFs.
Concern was for upper gi bleed and airway protection so he was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

# COPD: Has been on inhalers for a few years, never been intubated for or treated for COPD flare.
# "neurogenic bladder" by records but symptoms seem more consistent with BPH- dribbling and difficulty initiating urination # [**Month/Day (1) **] cancer: s/o resection 10 years ago, no adjunctive treatment # osteomyelitis of left hip as child- left with difficulty walking for life but did not need cane .

Hypotension/GI bleed - Hypotension was secondary to significant GI bleed.
Pt received 10 units pRBCs, 3 units FFP, and IVF for a total of 13L fluid resuscitation.
GI performed EGD which showed old blood but no active bleeding site.
He had been started on stress dose steroids on floor given chronic steroid use and probable baseline adrenal insufficiency.
His Hct remained stable, and he did not require any further transfusions - the source of his GI bleed remained unclear.
Tachycardia/afib - Pt with episode of atrial fibrillation on telemetry on [**2-6**].
Initially unclear if it was tachycardia causing hypotension or vice versa.
Continued treatment for underlying infection as below.
Ventilatory support - Pt was intubated given hypotension and respiratory distress.
Unclear cause of hypoxia although hypervolemia due to fluid resuscitation was on the differential.
PNA - Pt with likely pneumonia given RUL opacity on exam.
He was given empiric treatment with vanco and zosyn for 7 days, with subsequent decrease in sputum production and resolution of leukocytosis.
COPD - On inhalers while intubated and changed over to nebs after extubation.
He was also given steroids for MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] adrenal insufficiency.
thrombocytopenia - DIC labs wnl, concern for HIT so avoided all heparin products.
MS - Pt is bedbound given acute illness.
PPx - He was given PPI, bowel regimen, and pneumoboots for prophylaxis.
