Admission Date:  [**2139-2-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-2-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-6-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: Fever/chills, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Swan Catheter placement R IJ placement R thoracentesis PICC placement   History of Present Illness: 40 M with PMH of [**Doctor Last Name 11332**] mal seizures was in his USOH until Thursday afternoon when he had shaking chills at work.
He awoke later in the evening with back and abdominal pain and some mild SOB.
CT abdomen was done that showed periaortic lymphadenopathy?
?, Given that his d dimmer was elevated a CTA was ordered, CT with contrast to further evaluated lymph nodes and started on therapeutic dosage of Lovenox.
Repeated CT showed bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, no evidence of PE, lung findings ?
septic emboli.
Bedside Echo was performed (not recorded) and reportedly showed a vegatation on the posterior leaflet of the Mitral valve, along with MR. .
Family History: NO Family history of heart disease or premature death.
Lungs: Decrease breath sounds bibasilar, dullness to percussion.
RRR, tachycardic, s1-s2 normal, no murmurs appreciated.
No additional heart sounds.
Abdomen: BS+, distended, diffuse tenderness to palpation, worse on left lower quadrant Guiac negative Extremities: cold, grey color, no evidence of splinter hemorrhages, janeaway lesions on palms or soles,no osler nodes on skin.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, larger on the right than the left.
Underlying infiltrates at both bases cannot be excluded .
[**2139-2-14**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Within the liver, there is a small cyst in the right lobe, measuring up to 9 mm in diameter, as well as two small echogenic structures in the right lobe, the larger measuring 1.3 cm in diameter.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
There is no hydronephrosis.
A small amount of perinephric fluid is seen around the right kidney.
There is a trace amount of ascites fluid seen in the right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant.
A pleural effusion, as well as suggestion of collapse versus consolidation in the right lower lobe is seen.
Small echogenic foci in the liver.
Given the history, although these are likely hemangiomas, small abscesses could have a similar appearance and close follow up is recommended.
Right-sided pleural effusion and likely right lower lobe collapse or consolidation .
Bilateral pleural effusion and adjacent bibasilar atelectasis.
Focal opacity within the lingula, which is concerning for pneumonia.
Hypodensity within the right lobe of the liver, likely representing a cyst as seen on ultrasound from [**2139-2-14**].
Numerous low-density lesions within the liver, in the setting of endocarditis and low attenuating [**Last Name (LF) 71770**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent microabscesses, most commonly fungal, however tuberculosis cannot be entirely excluded.
Low-density retroperitoneal lymph node as described above, which may be seen in the setting of tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infections,seminoma, metastatic squamous cell, Whipple's disease.
Small pericardial effusion .
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The posterior leaflet (P2) has a focal thickening at a primary chordal insertion (0.7 cm) which may repesent chordal involvment in myxomatous disease or a cessile vegetation.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No significant mitral regurgitation.
No intra-cardiac abcess.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions unchanged.
Diffuse bilateral nodular opacities are seen within the lungs; given history of endocarditis this finding is concerning for septic emboli.
The cecum demonstrates mild bowel wall thickening concerning for an infectious or inflammatory process.
Low-density retroperitoneal lymph node as described above is unchanged from [**2139-2-15**].
Brief Hospital Course: - Mr. [**Known lastname 71771**] was admitted with a presumed diagnosis of endocarditis and on transfer had already grown Gp A Strep from ascitic fluid drawn at the OSH.
- He was tachycardic and hypotensive on arrival so he was given > 6 L of IVF in boluses to maintain his pressure and was transiently on phenylephrine.
- He had a TEE which did not show endocarditis and his syndrome was most consistent with Group A Strep Toxic Shock Syndrome as he had hypotension, acute renal failure (resolved with fluids), elevated LFTs, acute lung injury and DIC.
Also, a RIJ was placed w/ Swan for venous access and hemodynamic monitoring.
- He was tachypneic on arrival but initially maintained his sats on a non-rebreather but was intubated on HOD2 for increased work of breathing.
He did have a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis of his R Lung at which time we took off 1.2 L.  The fluid was consistent with exudate but did not grow any bacteria.
- He was delirious after extubation, which was thought to be from overwhelming infection and sedating medications received during intubation.
- There was concern for ischemia to his R great toe.
As his hypotension resolved, he developed an erythematous rash on bilateral feet which developed into an ecchymotic looking R great toe.
Sepsis with Group A strep/ Toxic shock syndrome 2.
Hypotension 2.
Ambulatory independently   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with sepsis (infection in your blood causing low blood pressure and inflammation).
There was also concern that you may have some infection in one of the valves in your heart (although this was not clearly seen by echocardiogram).
Call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have fever greater than 101 degrees, severe back or abdominal pain, worsening shortness of breath, dizziness, or any other symptom that concerns you.
