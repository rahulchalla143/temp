She was discharged on [**2169-1-13**] from the thoracics service after presenting from an OSH with tracheal laceration in the setting of traumatic intubation and sub-cutaneous emphysema post-intubation.
Her recent history prior to that includes a fall on [**10-31**] with a C2 odontoid fracture and diagnosis of PEs in the setting of dyspnea on [**2168-12-10**] requiring intubation (complicated by trach injury) for hypercapnea.
On the thoracics service, she [**Date Range 1834**] multiple bronchoscopies and trach placement ((#7 [**Last Name (un) 295**]) and revisions with clot demonstrated in posterior trachea and trach dislodgement.
At rehab, she had AMS/unresponsiveness which is different from her baseline, and low tidal volumes on pressure support and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
CXR showed  pleural effusions but no acute findings and IP was consulted and felt trach was in good position and she did not need urgent intervention.

No definite acute intracranial pathology.
No bleed or evidence for acute vascular territorial infarction.
Chronic small vessel microvascular infarction and global parenchymal atrophy.
Secretions within bilateral sphenoid and right mastoid apical air cells, some of which may relate to the (reported) presence of tracheostomy.
No change in bibasal left more than right atelectasis is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: # Acute on Chronic respiratory failure:  The patient was admitted due to altered mental status and low tidal volumes.
The patient with known traumatic intubation at OSH c/b tracheal injury, and trached here requiring multiple revisions.
Patient went into respiratory distress with hypoxia and hypotension.
The bronch showed granulation tissue obstructing 95% of her tube.
The tube was passed farther down past the site of obstruction and the patient's respiratory status improved and was weaned off levophed.
The patient then [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] repeat bronch the following day on [**1-15**] that showed the tube to be patent and the tracheal laceration to be healing well.
Her sputum subsequently grew out GNR and she will continue vancomycin and meropenem for a planned 8 day course (last day:[**1-24**]).
The patient did have a low grade temp of 100.5 at the time of discharge.
VAP: See above for respiratory course.
#UTI: The patient was intially treated with ciprofloxacin on admission for a positive UA.
# Altered mental status:  The patient came in minimally reactive which was a change from her baseline per the family.
Her change in mental status was attributed to her infection and after treatment for her VAP and UTI her mental status returned to baseline.
Her metoprolol and lisinopril was held given her infection and normal blood pressure.
The patient was restarted on her metoprolol at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], but several doses were held secondary to hypotension and bradycardia.
Her hemolysis labs were negative and there were no signs of active bleeding.
# PEs:  Patient with recent diagnosis in [**11-30**].
# C2 fracture:  Patient with C2 fracture after a fall on [**10-31**].
# AFib:  Patient's metoprolol was initially held due to ongoing infection.
