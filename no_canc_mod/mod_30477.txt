She was asymptomatic at presentation and continued to deny palpitations.
She was also started on methimazole as the thought was that her persistent atrial fibrillation was likely due to her being clinically hyperthyroid due to her history of Grave's disease.
She was started on warfarin for chronic anticoagulation.
After 1 month of anticoagulation, may be beneficial to consider cardioversion in this patient if she remains in atrial fibrillation.
# Hyperthyroidism - She has a history of [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease, s/p treatment for hyperthyroidism multiple times.
Patient with low TSH level, but normal levels of T4, free T4, and T3.
She was started on methimazole 10 mg daily for low [**Last Name (un) **] of clinical hyperthyroidism, as it was felt this was likely contributing to her atrial fibrillation.
# Respiratory Failure - Patient presented to the CCU on BiPap with acute pulmonary edema after being given intravenous fluids in the ED while in Afib with RVR.
# Pump - No signs of CHF.
Patient had TTE to rule out structural heart disease as the cause of Afib.
Echo showed normal wall motion, moderate MR, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
# CAD - She has no known CAD and no evidence that her atrial fibrillation is related to ischemia.
# Leukocytosis - Patient with an increased in white blood cell count to 20.7 (from 11.5 on admission).
It was felt that her leukocytosis was most likely due to the administration of IV solumedrol in the ED.
# Hypertension - Patient without hypertension during her treatment with metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control of Afib.
# Dyslipidemia - Continued home-dose statin.

Disp:*30 Capsule, Sustained Release(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Diabetes Mellitus Tobacco Abuse   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were found to have atrial fibrillation, a very common heart arrhythmia.
If you have any fevers you should call your doctor and have blood drawn for a CBC with differential because the methimazole can cause you to lose your white blood cells which protect you from infection.
Because you have atrial fibrillation, you will need to be on coumadin to prevent blood clots and strokes.
Warfarin (coumadin): a blood thinner that will help to prevent a stroke.
Please call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] if you notice palpitations, dizziness, dark or bloody stools, bleeding that wont stop, vomiting of blood.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for fatigue, dizziness, skin or appetite changes, fevers or other signs of infection.
