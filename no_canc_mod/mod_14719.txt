LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2177-7-17**] IMPRESSION: Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and velocities ranging from 85 to 112 cm/sec.
Unchanged right pleural effusion and a small amount of ascites.
ECHO [**2177-7-17**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is a small vegetation on the aortic valve.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to increased stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Left ventricular size and aortic regurgitation severity is similar.
TIPS venogram demonstrates no open large varices, and a tight stenosis on the hepatic venous side of the TIPS stent.
Successful dilation of that stenosis with a 10-mm balloon and with good angiographic results.
Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and velocities increased now ranging from 116 to 157 cm/sec.
Small amount of ascites and large right-sided pleural effusion.
[**2177-8-1**] Abd US complete: IMPRESSION: Patent TIPS catheter with wall-to-wall flow.
Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with associated vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness accompanied by an asymmetrical perihilar alveolar process, worse on the right than the left.
As compared to the recent study, this has minimally worsened in the interval and likely represents asymmetric pulmonary edema from either fluid overload or CHF.
Layering right pleural effusion is also slightly increased.
EGD/ PATHOLOGY: [**7-21**] EGD: FINDINGS: Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions 2 cords of grade III varices and 1 grade II varix were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.

# TIPS stenosis - The patient has a history of recent GI bleed at an OSH and was evaluated in the Liver Clinic for patency of TIPS.
Doppler US upon admission showed a patent TIPS with good velocity, but TIPS venogram confirmed stenosis.
TIPS ballooning was done without complication and resulted in reduction in portocaval pressure gradient from 20 to 7 mmHg.
# UGIB - From admission the patient had a decline in HCT from 26 to 21 by [**7-21**] with dark black stool concerning for recurrent UGIB.
He remained asymptomatic at that time with good urine output.
The patient underwent EGD on [**7-21**] which showed 2 cords of grade III varices and 1 grade II varix in the lower third of the esophagus with no evidence of bleeding.
Biopsies were taken of the duodenal mucosa, which showed no diagnostic abnormalities.
Repeat EGD [**2177-7-22**] on demonstrated stigmata of recent bleeding from varices and 6 bands were placed.
He had a scheduled repeat EGD to evaluate his varices on [**2177-7-29**] and was found to have 4 cords of grade III varices and 2 additional bands were placed on varices without bands.
The patient continued to improve and was nearing discharge until [**7-31**], when he began to have worsening mental status and his hematocrit dropped from 26.4 to 22.7 over the course of the day.
He became increasingly confused despite increasing doses of lactulose.
He had 2 large melenotic BM to the lactulose and no improvement in mental status.
He became relatively tachycardic with HR in 90s from a baseline in the 60s-70s, with BP ranging 81-107/33-48.
Repeat EGD in the MICU showed no evidence of active bleeding, and the team felt that bleeding was thought to be most likely from peri-ligation ulcers.
# Cirrhosis - secondary to NASH, s/p TIPS in [**2174**] and had balloon angioplasty [**2177-7-18**].
# Altered mental status: The patient developed symptoms of encephalopathy during admisison, likely related to decompensated hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of UGIB.
These symptoms slowly resolved with the above measures (lactulose and rifaxamin) and he was discharged with mental status at baseline.
# DM - DM appears to be well-controlled, with last Hgb A1c = 6.3%.
The patient was continued on lantus with a ISS with dosing altered based on PO intake.
There were  no acute issues while inhouse, and the patient was discharged on a decreased dose of Lantus with PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] for further glycemic management.
# Aortic Regurgitation - The patient has known AR from aortic valve endocarditis earlier this year.
The patient has large pulse pressures and is preload dependent, so care was taken so as not to overdiurese.
# Thrombocytopenia - The patient had thrombocytopenia with platelet levels in the 30s-50s.
Thrombocytopenia is chronic, likely secondary to hepatic failure.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check HCT weekly and communicate results to Primary Care Doctor and/or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in the Liver Center - Fax: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 48518**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Cirrhosis with portal HTN TIPS stenosis Esophageal Varices Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of your TIPS.
You also had some bleeding from the GI tract which was evaluated by endoscopy and bands were placed around several varices in your esophagus.
You should contact your PCP or present to an [**Name (NI) **] if you have any worsening light headedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain that is unusual for you, worsening confusion, blood in the stool or vomit or any other concerning symptom.
