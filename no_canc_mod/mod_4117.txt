The pre-existing extensive bilateral multifocal areas of opacities, presumably reflecting multifocal pneumonia show a rapid tendency to consolidations.
As a consequence, the lung bases have decreased in transparency and the number of visible air bronchograms has increased.
No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
Presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Pneumonia:  Patient reported two week history of fevers, cough, brief hemoptysis, and shortness of breath.
Presented with leukocytosis on admission and worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray.
Given history of multiple pneumonias in the past, she was started empirically on vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxacin.
Sputum culture was obtained along with blood and urine culture.
In the ED she was hypoxic to 84% on room air and admitted to the ICU for observation.
She was started on hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6hrs with SBP's in the 90's given concern for adrenal insufficeincy due to history of chronic prednisone use.
In the ICU, oxygen requirements were weaned to room air, and leukocytosis improved.
Patient was afebrile for the remaining hospital stay.
Based on history of recurrent pneumonias, she was dischaged on levofloxacin to complete a total of 10 day course of antibiotc therapy.
Post discharge, patient's sputum samples came back positive for two different strains of Pseudomonas Aeuriginosa.
Should follow up patient's symptomatology in clinc, and consider Xray to assure no advancement of radiographic consolidation.
Hemoptysis: has a history of hemoptysis.
Had trace hemoptysis prior to presentation, thought to be secondary to her bronchiectasis.
Hematocrit stayed stable and no further episodes of hemoptysis occurred in house.
Should check hematocrit at follow up and assess for any further episodes of hemoptysis post discharge.
Rheumatologic Disorders (Hypocomplementemia/Necrobiosis Lipoidica/Cyclic Neutropenia):  Has a very complicated detailed history of rheumatologic disorders comprising complement deficiency, skin disorder, and "cyclic neutropenia".
Counseled on neutropenic precautions, avoiding [**Month/Day/Year **] contacts, live animals, fresh flowers, consumption of fresh fruits/vegetables, or raw/undercooked food.
Pain control: on narcotics contract with PCP.
Received MS contin 30 mg TID while in house, and patient reported being severely underdosed accompanied with chronic lower extremity/ankle pain.
Patient should be reevaluated for appropriate pain management, as outpatient regimen appears to be on extremely high doses of morphine, taking MS Contin 60 mg TID and Morphine Immediate Release 30 mg 1-2 tablets TID, approaching daily values of morphine as high as 360mg per day.
Alternatives to pain management should be sought, including pain specialist consultation for possible spinal injection.
Additionally, would benefit from phyiscal therapy and other pain relieving alternative such as gabapentin given patient's neuropathic nature of her lower extremity pain.
Asthma: given nebulizers as needed for shortness of breath.
Initial presentation of lethargy and hypoxia may have been directly related to overuse of prescribed medications.
Eating Disorder NOS-- evidence of severe malnutrtion, including lanugo on physical exam as well as albumin less than 2.5.
Additionally, became very defensive and agitated when not receiving her furosemide for her "lower extremity swelling".
Does have minor swelling on physical exam, but given poor PO intake and nutritional deficits, may benefit from decreased dosing of 20 mg instead of 40 mg, or PRN dosing instead of daily.
It is obvious the patient has an eating disorder and is in denial about this disease.

You were admitted to the hospital with fevers, cough, and worsening shortness of breath that was concerning for a pneumonia.
Additionally, you had an episode of decreased oxygenation while in the emergency department.
Additionally, while in the hospital you started developing a low white blood cell count, known as "Leukopenia" or "Neutropenia".
While you are neutropenic, it is important you avoid contact with people who have a cold.
Avoid handling pets or live animals, or cleaning up after pets if you have any.
Do not eat fresh fruits or vegetables, and make sure all food all food is THOROUGHLY cooked before eating.
