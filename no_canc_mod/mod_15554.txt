HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension who is admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2136-3-26**] for chest and abdominal pain after ruling out for myocardial infarction.
She underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound that revealed cholelithiasis and a thickened gallbladder wall.
She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on [**2136-3-27**] with intraoperative cholangiogram that showed dilatation of the common bile duct consistent with stone.
Coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general the patient is in no acute distress.
There was no jugulovenous distention.
No bruits were noted.
Distant heart sounds, normal S1 and S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the apex.
Abdomen was mildly obese with mild right upper quadrant tenderness, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities no clubbing or edema.
Mild cyanosis.
Thereafter during the procedure her sats were noted to fall in the low 70s and she became cyanotic and dusky appearance.
She was given Narcan full mask without improvement.
This returned with a met hemoglobin elevated at 22.
She had no repeat desaturations or respiratory distress while in the Intensive Care Unit.
At that time her biliary tree was noted to have severe diffuse dilatation of the common bile duct and intrahepatic ducts with the common bile duct measuring 17 mm.
Two piston like stones ranging from 4 mm to 7 mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the distal common bile duct.
She had minimal right upper quadrant pain that was well controlled with one tablet of percocet prn.
Her liver function tests were mildly elevated at the time back to transfer to [**Hospital3 9683**] with an ALT of 70, AST 62, alkaline phosphatase 493, amylase 15, lipase 9 and total bilirubin 0.6.
These elevations were secondary to a recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Of note, however, the patient has been persistent hypoxic throughout her hospitalization.
Given this hypoxia on room air arterial blood gas was checked with the results as follows:  7.44/51/52.
Given her clear persistent hypoxia and persistent hypercarbia as evidenced by her elevating and increasing serum bicarb that was 35 on the day of transfer the patient was not self to be safe for discharge home.
Given that she has received the majority of her medical care at [**Hospital3 **] she preferred to return to [**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation of her hypoxia.
Specifically, it is recommended that she have a transthoracic echocardiogram chest CT to evaluate for interstitial lung disease and pulmonary function tests to further evaluate the presence of any chronic disease.
