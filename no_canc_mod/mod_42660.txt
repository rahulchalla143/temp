Echocardiogram in [**2134-12-6**] showed a moderately dilated left atria, mildly dilated left ventricle, ejection fraction of 60 to 70%, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets, mild mitral valve prolapse, partial mitral leaflet flail with 3+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2135-3-7**], which showed an ejection fraction of 60% with 2+ mitral regurgitation and no coronary disease.
Mitral valve prolapse.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2135-4-13**] with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for a minimally invasive mitral valve repair.
On the evening of postoperative day number one the patient was noted to have a moderate amount of chest tube drainage and a drop in hematocrit.
Chest x-ray showed a right sided pleural effusion.
A chest tube was inserted into the right pleural space with immediate drainage of about 500 cc of bloody fluid with fair resolution by chest x-ray.
The patient continued to have a drop in hematocrit and a thoracic surgery consult was obtained.
Repeat chest x-ray showed elevated right hemidiaphragm with little change between inspiratory and expiratory films, right middle and right lower lobe atelectasis.
Coughing and deep breathing was encouraged as well as incentive spirometry.
Chest x-ray after this was done showed a small right apical pneumothorax unchanged from the previous films.
On postoperative day number four the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular part of the hospital where he began working with physical therapy.
On postoperative day number five the patient's last remaining right pleural chest tube was removed and post removal chest x-ray showed unchanged from previous chest x-rays, which was small bilateral effusions right greater then left, elevated right hemidiaphragm, right middle and right lower lobe atelectasis and a small right apical pneumothorax.
The patient ambulated with physical therapy and was able to climb one flight of stairs and walk 500 feet while remaining hemodynamically stable and without requiring oxygen and the patient was cleared for discharge to home.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
There is no rhonchi or rales.
There is no erythema.
Status post minimally invasive mitral valve repair.
Postoperative elevated right hemidiaphragm.
