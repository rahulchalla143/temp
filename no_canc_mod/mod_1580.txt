## hypotension- Initially with SBP in 70's-80's, asymptomatic, mentating well and with good urine output.
Admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring.
Low blood pressure suspected secondary to volume depletion in setting of decreased PO's and UTI.
Blood cultures were sent and revealed no growth.
ECHO demonstrated no new WMA, low EF or valvular dx, and her troponins subsequently trended down (see below).
## s/p fall- Patient with baseline low blood pressure.
Patient most likely had pre-syncopal episode from orthostatic hypotension secondary to medications she takes such as klonopin, imipramine, propranolol in setting of UTI.
The urinary tract infection was treated with bactrim as outlined above, and she was evaluated by physical therapy prior to discharge.
## NSTEMI- Suspected demand ischemia in setting of UTI/hypotension.
No associated chest pain.
Repeat EKG demonstrated normalization of ST changes.
ECHO performed and demonstrated no wall motion abnormalities and normal EF.
