No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse multifocal bilateral airspace disease.
Given the presence of interlobular septal thickening, small bilateral pleural effusions and cardiomegaly, CHF is the top consideration.
Differential does include ARDS and multifocal pneumonia.
Resolution of portal venous gas and pneumatosis with enhancement of the small bowel wall.
Findings are consistent with improvement of the small bowel ischemia.
The persistent diffuse small bowel dilation and additional focal areas of small bowel and colonic wall thickening are likely related to the recent ischemic event to the bowel.
Hypoperfusion of the pancreatic tail and spleen likely due to complete occlusion of the celiac axis.
Multiple bilateral acute renal infarctions noting severe attenuation of the bilateral renal arteries.
Large left-sided thyroid mass which can be evaluated in the future with ultrasound as the clinical condition warrants.
[**2125-6-7**]: CARDIAC ECHO: IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
TR severity has slightly increased.
Repeat TTE [**6-8**]: Platelet drop leveling off.
No signs of active bleeding.
[**6-10**]: Nurses noted stool from vagina, flexiseal placed, had transient episode of tachypnea which responded with suctioning (happened after pt was turned).
On Lasix gtt for CHF on CXR.
Bronch negative, U/S of lungs showed no pleural effusions, extubated without problem [**6-12**]: d/c NGT  CV: Given that she is not likely to be taking PO medications in the near future and was previously rhythm-controlled on sotalol, would favor short term use of amiodarone to control heart rate and rhythm.
Pulmonary: Patient was extubated on [**6-11**] without problem, daily CXR showed resolution of her pneumania.
Volume overload was treated with Lasix IV.
No fecal material visualized.
Small amount of bleeding noted from trauma from speculum.
Scolpette placed without fecal material visualized.
Vaginal cul-de-sacs visualized and no fecal material visualized.
Assessment: No macroscopic evidence of recto-vaginal fistula on speculum exam at this time.
Hematology: Admission labs were further significant for a macrocytic anemia (received 1 unit PRBCs on [**6-4**]) and an elevated INR which continued to rise despite her Coumadin being on hold.
On [**6-7**] she had a rather acute platelt drop from 220 to 88, it is now in the 20's.
She has now worsening thrombocytopenia and an elevated INR despite holding her Coumadin.
(1) coagulopathy: Her elevated INR is likely secondary to previous use of Coumadin and current Vitamin K deficiency(intubated, NPO).
(2) thrombocytopenia: no schistocytes seen on the peripheral blood smear, she does not have splenomegaly, HIT was ruled out by negative [**Doctor First Name **].
(3) macrocytic anemia: chronic but below baseline, possibly secondary to recent TKR, no RBC abnormailties in peripheral smear DDX: B12/Folate deficiency, hypothyroidism, MDS check B12/Folate and TSH  At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
