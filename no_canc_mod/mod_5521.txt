# Cough/N/V: As the hospital course continued, we felt it most likely that he had a viral syndrome that led to nausea, vomiting, decreased PO intake, and cough.
His productive cough with a leukocytosis was initially concerning for pneumonia; however, his chest x-rays were unrevealing.
Vancomycin was started as well for this, but was discontinued given that patient lives at home and has not had a lot of exposure to the healthcare system.
Vancomycin was re-introduced for concern for septic joint (see below).
His white count rose while on the medicine floor; given that his respiratory status remained stable, this was judged unlikely to be secondary to the respiratory infection, and ultimately, more likely to be the result of a florid gout flare.
# Atrial fibrillation: In the MICU he was continued on sotalol, dosed 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] in light of ARF; he is on 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] at baseline.
As his renal function improved he had an episode of afib with RVR to the 150s, with hypotension (70s over palp), for which he was triggered, given IV metoprolol and IV fluids; this eventually resolved, and he was then continued on 80 mg sotalol [**Hospital1 **] thereafter, and had no further episodes of RVR.
His anticoagulation was held, first because of supratherapeutic INR, and then because of concern for hemorrhagic joint.
Ultimately we felt that it was more likely that his hypotension was due to low baseline BP and severe dehydration in setting of poor PO intake and diarrhea/vomiting.
He had one other episode of hypotension, which was clearly secondary to afib with RVR, described above.
# Knee swelling, likely gout: Patient has right knee that appeared bruised on admission, with possible joint effusion appreciated.
Rheumatology was consulted, given history of gout as well as history of septic joint in setting of gout infection.
Joint aspiration of the R knee revealed hemarthrosis with joint fluid Hct of 42, which was confirmed by MRI.
Because of our initial concern for septic joint we treated first with Ancef, and then when his white cell count continued to rise and his joints appeared to be more inflamed, we switched to vancomycin with concern for MRSA.
However, he remained afebrile and joint cultures were negative, as were joint fluid gram stains; we thus discontinued antibiotics for the joint.
We treated pain with colchicine, celebrex, lidocaine patches, tylenol, ultram, and ultimately steroids to reduce inflammation.
We avoided opioids because his family had given us the history of delirium with mild opiates (likely codeine), and we judged him to be at significant risk for delirium as well as for falls should he become delirious.
We had been holding colchicine in the setting of ARF but restarted it.
# Diarrhea: He has had several days of diarrhea, with no recent exposure ot antibiotics or health care institutions.
This could be part of a viral syndrome.
# Acute renal failure: His creatinine was 3.9 at admission.
His urine lytes and clinical picture was consistent with a mainly pre-renal picture, worse on admission secondary to poor PO and diarrhea.
He will need to have his lasix dose titrated back up as his gout flare and renal function improve again, as he has consistently had lower extremity edema that has responded well to lasix in the past.
# Coronary artery disease: Per records, he had a cath at NEBH with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that showed non-obstructive coronary disease.
# Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: He appears to be well compensated at this point, with no clinical evidence of failure.
We monitored i/o, had him on a low Na diet, and checked several chest x-rays during the course of his admission to look for signs of worsening failure.
We held lasix as above but he did not have clinical indications of heart failure with us.
Given poor PO intake and his renal failure, his PO [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was held in the MICU, replaced by insulin sliding scale; and given changing circumstances of high white blood count, changing intake, and changing renal function, we continued his insulin scale while on the medicine floor.
# Parkinson's disease: We continued home medications of carbidopa.
He did not have significant manifestations of parkinsonism while on the medicine floor, though as above he apparently did have manifestations on arrival to the hospital.
# Coagulopathy: He received some vitamin K in the ED.
Was felt to be likely due to acute renal failure.
Also, he was hypochloremic from vomiting.
# COPD: He had wheezes on exam fairly frequently which improved with nebulizers and beta-agonist inhalers (levalbuterol to minimize cardiac effect).
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he has had no clear diagnosis of COPD or history of wheezing.
He had PFT's at NEBH in [**2120**] which showed a restrictive pattern with a mildly decreased TLC and diffusion capacity.
Given that he did not have signs of progression of heart failure the wheezing was more likely secondary to bronchitic infection, likely viral.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution Sig: One (1) inhalation Inhalation q6-8h prn () as needed for wheezing/SOB.
Guaifenesin 100 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: [**2-1**] 5 mL doses PO four times a day as needed for cough.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2732**] & Retirement Home - [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Diarrhea Gout Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate Leukocytosis .
Secondary Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Good Patient stable, with no fevers   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with diarrhea and a cough.
This was most likely due to a viral infection, although we gave you antibiotics to treat a possible bacterial infection in your lungs, which you have finished.
You also developed swelling of your knees, which is likely due to gout.
Once you are discharged, please call your doctor or return to the ER if you have chest pain, feelings that your heart is racing fast, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, shortness of breath, increasing pain in your knees, or other concerning symptoms.
His blood sugar levels have been in flux due to prednisone.
Please feel free to contact [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4427**], MD, via the [**Hospital1 18**] operator at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**] if you have further questions about the inpatient course for this complicated and treasured patient; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4427**] is the medical intern who followed Mr [**Known lastname **] for this admission.
