Admission Date:  [**2116-5-21**]       Discharge Date: [**2116-6-8**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 38-year-old woman with end-stage renal failure on dialysis with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus Type I, peripheral vascular disease, status post left below the knee amputation and multiple digit and toe amputation.
She reportedly had a left sided headache which started on the morning of admission and her blood sugar was low earlier in the day but that corrected with food although her confusion did not improve.
Subsequently she came into the emergency department for the headache and had a head CT which showed a right thalamic basal ganglia bleed with extension into the lateral and third ventricles.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, end-stage renal disease on dialysis.
Diabetes mellitus Type I, peripheral vascular disease, status post below the knee amputation and question stroke and seizures in the past.
Also a history of Naphthalene induced coma from inhaling moth balls.
Status post right transmetatarsal amputation, status post parathyroidectomy, status post renal transplant in [**2104**], now failed.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of smoking or alcohol.
In general the patient is lying in bed, at times agitated, In no acute distress.
No lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits.
Non-fluent aphasia with one to two word answers, frequently becomes frustrated an turns away.
No neglecter signs.
Has subtle left facial droop which now is not present.
Sternocleidomastoids and trapezius normal bilaterally which has not been able to be fully tested because of intubation.
Motor: Normal bulk and tone with adventitious movements.
Mild left drift and left hemiparesis in the 4+ to 5 range, worse in the arm.
She did have rising liver function tests which started to decrease however, amylase and lipase as of [**6-8**] were still rising.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes.
[**6-2**] growing staph aureus coag positive sensitive to Gentamicin, Tetracycline and Vancomycin only.
On [**5-29**] sputum also growing staph aureus coag positive.
On [**5-23**] also growing staph aureus coag positive with the same sensitivities.
On [**5-22**] also growing staph aureus coag positive.
There was small interval increase in the small amount of ascites present, no new abscess or inter-abdominal or inter-pelvic pathology identified.
There remained a stable appearance of a large retroperitoneal and periportal lymph node.
Original head CT revealed hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia area and right thalamus with extension to the right lateral ventricle with mild dilatation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle which remained unchanged for sometime.
The patient also received bilateral upper and lower extremity Dopplers for the question of thrombus.
There was found to be a chronic, non-occlusive thrombus in the proximal right internal jugular vein but otherwise there were no deep vein thrombosis in any extremities.
EEG on [**2116-5-22**] showed background slowing and indicating wide spread encephalopathic condition.
There were no focal abnormalities and no epileptiform features.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  To [**2116-6-8**]  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] presented on [**2116-5-21**] with a right thalamic, right basal ganglia bleed extending into the right ventricle.
This was felt to be due to hypertension as she came in with systolic blood pressures above 200 and her family stated she had been non-complication with her anti-hypertensives at home.
Renal was also consulted to follow for her end-stage renal failure.
Neurologically did not have any seizures witnessed by any residents or attendings and per description by the nurses had some rhythmic eye movements however, EEG showed no epileptiform activity and the Dilantin was very difficult to keep at therapeutic doses given the renal failure and the frequent dialysis.
So the Dilantin was discontinued eventually and the patient has not had any witnessed seizure activity.
It was felt that her bacteremia was due to infection of the Quinton catheter.
Additionally the patient has been growing staph coag positive in her sputum and again she is on Vancomycin for this.
She did develop some loose stools and C. diff was sent which was positive and the patient was started on Flagyl for treatment of this.
However, since the Vancomycin and Flagyl have started, the patient has continued to have daily fever spikes and Infectious Disease was consulted.
Infectious Disease recommended repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis which was not revealing for any new pathology.
They also recommended empiric treatment for gram negative rods which was started on [**2116-6-7**] in the form of Ceftazidime.
No precise cause of the fevers as of [**2116-6-8**] has yet been identified.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient has had severe gastroparesis.
It was felt that Erythromycin may be contributing to worsening of the C. Diff so this was stopped and it was unclear as to whether the Reglan was increasing her LFTs and this was stopped.
The patient did have transient elevation of ALT and AST which now seem to be decreasing.
The alk phos is still remaining high however as well as elevated amylase and lipase.
It is also not 100% clear what may be causing this elevation of enzymes.
Per abdominal CT there are no abscesses to explain this and the total bilirubin has not been elevated at all.
The patient has had guaiac negative stool but does suffer from chronic anemia and has had intermittent transfusions to attempt to keep her hematocrit at 30.
She tends to be hypertensive on days when she is not having dialysis however, in dialysis she does tend to become hypotensive.
