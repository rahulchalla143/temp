History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 9700**] is a 74 yo female with no known history of CAD and no risk factors for CAD, who presented to the outside hospital with approximately 24-hour history of persistent, constant back pain.
She described her pain as diffuse over her upper back, non-radiating, not related to position change, [**4-26**] in intensity.
Her pain got progressively worse and later that day became [**9-26**].
She developed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and orthopnea, no dizziness.
Work up included chest CT that was negative for aortic dissection.
EKG showed ST elevations in anterior precordial leads.

Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system  revealed two-vessel disease.
The LMCA had mild proximal irregularities.
Post-angiographic hemodynamic evaluation revealed moderately  elevated right-sided pressures (mean RA was 11 and RVEDP was 14 mmHg), severely elevated left-sided pressures (mean PCW was 26 mmHg), and moderately elevated pulmonary pressures (PA was 48/24 mmHg).
Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent with rescue of a jailed diagonal branch with a 1.5 mm ACE balloon.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 2+ flow (See PTCA  Comments).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (EF 35-40%).
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include septal and distal anterior and apical akinesis.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 2 vessel disease (LAD totally occluded proximally and mid RCA 70% stenosis).
LAD was stented with 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher stent, and a jailed diagonal branch was rescued with a 1.5 mm ACE balloon.
CAD - The patient was started on Aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, Metoprolol, Captopril.
She had no new EKG changes and no significant events on telemetry.
Her right groin site checks revealed no complications.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed): Take one under tongue every 5 minutes for chest or anginal pain for a total of 3.
If continue to have pain after 3 pills, go to the emergency room immediately.
Outpatient Lab Work Please have PT-INR and K level drawn prior to patient's appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6359**] on [**2173-8-6**] at 10:45.
ST elevation myocardial infarction 2.
Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Please take all your medications as prescribed.
Please call your primary care physician or go to the emergency room if you develop persistent chest pain or back pain similar to the pain you had prior to this hospital admission, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms.
