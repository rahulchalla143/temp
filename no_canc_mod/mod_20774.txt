Prior to the angiogram, the patient reportedly had chest pain relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin.
She also reported shortness of breath after one block and climbing any stairs.
Cardiac catheterization showed three-vessel disease.
The patient also had a history of transient ischemic attack with no residual and was placed on Coumadin prior to her admission.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
History of transient ischemic attack.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 85, saturation of 99 percent on three liters nasal cannula, blood pressure 130/70 with a respiratory rate of 16.
Dorsalis pedis on the left was palpable and on the right was biphasic.
LABORATORY DATA:  Cardiac catheterization showed a left main 75 percent lesion, a mid left anterior descending coronary artery lesion of 90 percent and totally occluded right coronary artery and a ramus lesion of 50 percent.
The first issue that had to be addressed was the patient became febrile and white blood cell count rose slightly.
The patient did not have any chest pain or shortness of breath at the time.
She continued in atrial fibrillation and remained on an intravenous heparin drip as well as receiving her beta blocker.
She did remain afebrile on [**2111-11-1**] with a normal white count.
Additionally, the patient had some postoperative bleeding from her right groin site and required additional compression to avoid hematoma.
The patient had a new bruit over the femoral artery with decreasing blood pressures.
Given her fever and her groin bleed, the decision was made to postpone her surgery.
The following day, surgery was rescheduled but the patient that night spiked a temperature to 101.2 and surgery was again postponed.
The patient was also seen by the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery service preoperatively to rule out a dental infection.
At that time, we renewed our request that cardiac surgery not be performed on the patient until she remained afebrile for 24 hours with a normal white count.
Carotid ultrasounds were performed on [**2111-10-31**], which showed a 60-69 percent right internal carotid artery stenosis and a 40-60 percent left internal carotid artery stenosis.
The patient was also tested for tuberculosis.
On [**2111-11-4**], the patient's right groin hematoma was approximately walnut sized with occasional droplets of bright red blood oozing.
Mini pressure dressing continued to be applied with no further bleeding later in the day.
The patient was maintained on bedrest at the time and did have pedal pulses.
Abdominal scans did not reveal anything other than an incidental infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Chest CT showed some pulmonary nodules as read by Radiology.
Their impression was that the patient needed a new pacemaker generator before discharge.
The patient was in atrial flutter with the pacer responding appropriately and periods of normal sinus rhythm.
She had decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
She had a trace of pedal edema.
She continued in atrial flutter with underlying occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia.
The patient had no complaints of pain at that time.
On postoperative day six, the patient continued to have a little bit of confusion and restlessness the evening prior after her pacemaker change.
She had decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
Her Foley was removed and she continued on her Coumadin dosing for atrial fibrillation.
On [**2111-11-12**], the patient had a five-beat run of ventricular tachycardia which resolved spontaneously.
She had no confusion noted and was responding appropriately.
She had some scattered rhonchi bilaterally and her plan for discharge was again delayed as her INR only rose to 1.9, well below therapeutic range.
She was moving out of bed and getting out of bed to bathroom by herself, also without any difficulty.
In addition, an appointment had been scheduled at the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Center Cardiac Services for pacemaker device check at the clinic on [**2111-11-17**] and to come to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 for her wound check on [**2111-11-23**].
Atrial fibrillation.
History of transient ischemic attack.
