Admission Date:  [**2184-9-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2184-9-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-6-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL IC  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73-year-old gentleman with a history of multi-infarct dementia and recurrent aspiration pneumonias, requiring admission to [**Hospital1 1444**].
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was in his usual state of health until the evening prior to admission, when he was noted to be diaphoretic, tachypneic, and tachycardia in his nursing home.
He also had an increase in sputum production and he was coughing copious-green sections at that time.
In the emergency room, the patient was found to have a fever of 103.4, sinus tachycardia of 144 beats per minute.
Blood cultures, urine cultures, and wound cultures of the decubitus ulcers were obtained.
He was then admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation and further treatment of the infection and the oxygen requirement.
He had no jugulovenous distention.
Heart rate was regular and he had no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
He had course breath sounds bilaterally with decreased breath sounds in dependent areas, but no crackles.
Abdomen was soft, nondistended and nontender with diminished bowel sounds; no masses and the PEJ site was clean, dry, and intact.
He had an erythematous patch around the left elbow, but without edema or induration.
He had no cyanosis or clubbing.
The patient was diaphoretic and he had stage III to IV decubitus ulcer in his right buttock, which was 3 cm x 3 cm x 4 cm deep, but with good granulation tissue and on exudate or drainage and a left hip sacral decubitus ulcer also without drainage or erythema.
Other laboratory included urinalysis, which showed small blood, nitrite negative, 30 protein, glucose of greater than 1000, no ketones or bilirubin, trace leukocyte esterase, 3 to 5 red blood cells, greater than 50 white cells and a few bacteria.
Chest x-ray, compared to an AP of [**2184-6-21**], showed no cardiomegaly or effusions, lungs fields grossly clear, no cephalization, and a feeding tube in her abdomen.
EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia only.
The oxygen requirement decreased and by discharge the patient was requiring only two liters by nasal cavity and saturating well.
Chest x-ray remained clear throughout the hospitalization with no evidence of aspiration pneumonia.
In the patient's recurrent history of aspiration pneumonia, it was recommended that the patient received tracheostomy to allow suction of secretions and to prevent repeated admissions for aspiration pneumonia.
Although the patient had Gram-negative rods on sputum Gram stain the cultures were negative at the time of discharge.
The patient does have a history of MRSA and multiple aspiration pneumonias, however, it was deemed at the time of discharge that Levofloxacin would be adequate coverage for these potential infections.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted with high fevers and elevated white count.
These antibiotics were given for empiric coverage of his previous resistant organisms.
During this admission, Gram stain of his decubitus ulcer showed 3+ polys, 3+ Gram-positive cocci and 1+ Gram-negative rods of multiple species.
In addition, 1 out 4 bottles of blood cultures grew Gram-positive cocci, which was not yet speciated.
Urine cultures grew multiple Gram-negative rods consistent with fecal contamination.
These organisms were all deemed to be likely colonization given his repeated episodes of aspiration and UTIs and his nursing home residency.
The 1 out of 4 bottles of Gram-positive cocci were treated with Vancomycin.
At the time of discharge, speciation of this organism was pending.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was to follow up on the speciation results and restart Vancomycin as necessary, if the organism was deemed to be real infection and not contamination of those blood cultures.
Plastic Surgery determined that these wounds both looked good and they were not infected at this time.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Upon admission, the patient was noted to be severely hypovolemic and hyponatremic with a free-water deficit of greater than four liters and an overall volume deficit likely approaching six liters.
The hypovolemia and hyponatremia was deemed likely to osmotic diuresis relating to his poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus and glucosuria.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted with a PEJ tube and on admission, he was restarted on his tube feeds, which he tolerated well without residuals and he was quickly brought to full goals of tube feeds, tolerating these well.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient is demented at baseline secondary to multi-infarct dementia.
HEMATOLOGIC:  On the day of discharge, the patient was noted to have right upper extremity edema.
This edema was worrisome for deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound of the right upper extremity was ordered.
Colonization of sputum and urine with multiple Gram-negative organisms.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Issue #1: Possible infection of his blood with Gram-positive cocci.
Issue #2:  Possible right upper quadrant deep venous thrombosis.
