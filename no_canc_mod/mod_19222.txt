F with Crohn's disease on Imuran and Pentasa, who started having fever, headache, myalgias, rhinorrhea, and sore throat on [**2194-9-1**].
She came to the [**Hospital1 **] ER 1 week prior to her admission in early [**Month (only) **] for feeling unwell.
She was not put on Tamiflu given her symptoms were > 48 hours.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-N ICU and was found to be influenzae and mycoplasma positive.
Pt also found to have Mycoplasma IgM positive on [**2194-9-17**], which was thought to be cause of her hepatitis as well.
CTA chest was completed also which revealed bilateral lobe consolidation concerning for pna, small bilateral pleural effusions, small pericardial effusion, and splenomegaly.
She was treated for secondary bacterial pneumonia as [**Doctor Last Name **].
Continued to be tachypneic with shallow breathing.
Initially, thought to be obstructive process.
HIDA revealed severe liver dysfunction.
MRCP showed hepatosplenomegaly with concerns of early portal hypertension.
Thought that hepatitis was due to mycoplasma.
She was also noted to be pancytopenic --> heme was consulted and no evidence of hemolysis.
Thought to be BM suppression secondary to infection with thrombocytopenia for splenomegaly.
She has worsened diffuse abdominal pain different from a Crohn's falre.
If she moves or hiccups, the abdominal pain is worse.
ROS: Endorses weakness, mild fevers, nasal congestion, nonproductive cough, chest pain, increased SOB that has worsened at [**Location (un) **].

CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2194-9-19**]):       POSITIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
INTERPRETATION: SUGGESTIVE OF RECENT/ACTIVE INFECTION.
A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may reactivate       when immunity is compromised.
Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2185**] mg/dl may cause       interference with CMV IgM results.
Thickening and irregularity of the entire terminal ileum with fistula formation consistent with Crohn's disease.
Interval resolution of abdominal phlegmon with minimal scarring and no definite mesenteritis.
Abdominal ascites.
Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
Moderate pericardial effusion.
Thickening of the right colon likely secondary to hepatitis and third spacing.
Hepatosteatosis and hepatomegaly.
Moderate diffuse lobular mixed inflammation composed of lymphocytes and neutrophils.
Cellular changes consistent with cytomegalovirus effect.
Severe mixed steatosis without associated intracytoplasmic hyalin.
Focal balloon cell degeneration is seen.
Scattered cell show immunoreactivity for cytomegalovirus.
No immunoreactivity is seen for HSV [**1-3**].
Trichrome and iron stains are pending, and will be reported in an addendum.
Note: The findings of severe steatosis, balloon cell degeneration, and lobular mixed inflammation raises the possibility of a pre-existing with toxic metabolic injury with superimposed CMV infection.
RUQ ultrasound ([**9-26**]): IMPRESSION: Small amount of ascites localized to inferior aspect of right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant.
Echogenic liver may be related to diffuse fatty infiltration or other forms of liver disease.
Appropriate directional flow of hepatic arteries, hepatic veins, and portal veins.
The gallbladder is only moderately distended, and may be secondary to hepatitis.
Sigmoid colon biopsy ([**10-1**]): DIAGNOSIS: Colon, sigmoid, mucosal biopsy: No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Terminal Ileum with nodular lymphoid hyperplasia.
Nonobstructive mid-ileal stricture.
Brief Hospital Course: Summary: 34 YO F w/ longstanding Crohn's disease on Imuran, w/ fevers and respiratory distress x 2weeks, fulminant liver failure, influenza A and mycoplasma IgM +.
Cytomegalovirus hepatitis:  While in the MICU, the patient developed fulminant hepatic failure and was subsequently transferred to the surgical ICU and placed on the transplant list.
Tests for hepatitis A/B/E, [**Doctor First Name **], HSV, ferritin, ceruloplasmin, adenovirus, varicella were within normal limits.
There was concern that the gancyclovir was possibly hepatotoxic and she was therefore changed to valgancyclovir for an induction period of one week post-discharge followed by a maintenence period.
Since she had liver damage, her home wellbutrin and testosterone will be held on dischare until her followup GI appointment.
Crohn's disease: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease and had known fistulas in the terminal ileum.
The patient continued to have abdominal pain with diarrhea.
The abdominal pain was controlled with dilaudid.
There was concern that her diarrhea was related to CMV colitis, however a simoidoscopy with biopsy showed no concerning infection.
A small bowel followthrough was done to see if her Crohn's was flaring.
The followthrough was normal and showed known fistulas.
She was found to have bilateral pleural effusions and infiltrates.
She was also found to have Mycoplasma IgM, however, infectious disease thought it might have been a false positive.
She needed to be intubated for her respiratory distress and had an uncomplicated extubation.
Normocytic anemia: The patient developed a normocytic anemia and was found to have guiaic positive stool.
There was concern for a transfusion related reaction (fever), so the patient was given leuko-reduced transfusions.
A pathology consult thought a transfusion reaction was unlikely saying "although the patient experienced oxygen desaturation, had a low arterial PO2, and developed crackles at the time of the transfusion, it is difficult to separate these from the findings from the symptoms she is experiencing due to her underlying condition.
The lack of diffuse infiltrates on CXR and the lack of hypotension temporally associated with the transfusion make transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) unlikely.
In addition, an anaphylactic reaction is unlikely because she did not experience other systemic manifestations of such a reaction, such as erythema, urticaria, hypotension, flushing, or GI symptoms.
It was unclear whether bronchospasm was directly associated with the transfusion.
However, it is known that bronchospasm was suspected many hours after the transfusion, making it more likely that it was due to her underlying lung infection than the transfusion.
Finally, as the patient has been experiencing fevers throughout her hospitalization, and given that leukoreduction significantly decreases the incidence of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, the patient's fever is most likely due to her underlying illness and not the transfusion."
Upon transfer to the medical floors, the patient had a stable hematocrit without signs of bleeding.
Papilledema: The patient developed papilledema in the setting of fulminant liver failure and intubation.
Neurology evaluated the patient and thought "The patient is at risk for cerebral edema due to liver failure, poor synthetic function, and difficulty holding fluid in the vascular space.
She is hypocoagulable and at risk for bleeeding due to her poor synthetic function; however, she is simultaneously hypercoagulable and at increased risk for thrombosis due to her history of Crohn's disease and prior spontaneous abortion.
She is also at risk for meningitis and encephalitis due to her prior infection and unknown cause of her liver failure."
An MRV of the head ruled out sinus thrombosis and a head CT was normal.
Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia, most likely due to SIADH.
Nutrition: The patient was placed on TPN while in the SICU because she was intubated and had poor PO intake greater than 7 days.
Her alkaline phosphatase was likely high secondary to TPN use.
Respiratory distress .
Mycoplasma pneumonia  Discharge Condition: Stable.
Patient ambulating, on room air   Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital after being transferred for shortness of breath.
You developed liver failure which made you confused.
You also developed diarrhea and abdominal pain.
You should come back to the hospital if you have fevers or chills, shortness of breath, become confused, or have worsening diarrhea or abdominal pain.
