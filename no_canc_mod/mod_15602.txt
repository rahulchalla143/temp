Patient does report diaphoresis, no nausea, or vomiting.
No orthopnea, no dyspnea on exertion.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Catheterization Laboratory, where it was revealed that he had a lesion 100% occluded most likely old in the RCA, and a new 100% LCX lesion plus 80% LAD lesion.
Patient had an episode of hypotension in the Catheterization Laboratory requiring dopamine and Neo-Synephrine.
There is concern about allergic reaction to the dye, and the patient was given Solu-Medrol and Pepcid in the laboratory.
He has no children.
He has a tobacco history, although no longer smokes.
In general, patient is comfortable in no acute distress.
No thyroid nodules are palpated.
Cardiovascular examination:  Rate is regular, normal S1, S2, no S3, S4, no murmurs.
Extremities: No edema, 2+ posterior tibial pulses and no edema on extremities.
Skin: Patient has a rash over the chest.
Cardiac catheterization showed LAD with 80% mid lesion of the diag bifurcation.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 63-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for emergent catheterization that revealed 100% stenosis and occlusion of the RCA and left circumflex lesions successfully stented.
The patient experienced hypotensive reaction to dye during catheterization procedure.
Patient had an 80% stenosis of the LAD which was left untreated during this admission.
Patient initially had elevated blood glucoses that returned to [**Location 213**] levels prior to his discharge.
Pump:  Patient had an echocardiogram in [**2191-2-21**], which demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%, left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed with inferior hypokinesis to akinesis.
C. Rhythm:  Patient experienced some nonsustained V-tach on telemetry, which resolved post MI.
Patient was scheduled for an outpatient exercise stress test [**2191-3-23**] for further evaluation of his LAD lesion as well as followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further plans to treat this LAD lesion.
FEN and GI:  Patient had a normal hemoglobin A1C, mildly elevated blood glucoses that returned to [**Location 213**] prior to his discharge.
Heme:  Patient had a large hematoma, but maintained stable hematocrit throughout the admission.
Allergy:  Patient has a new documented allergy to contract dye.
Acute myocardial infarction status post catheterization and stent placement x2.
Hypotensive reaction to contact dye.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45.
Coronary artery disease.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13248**], [**2191-3-3**] at 11 a.m. for referral for a stress test.
Exercise stress [**2191-3-23**] [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] [**Location (un) **].
