Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2114-3-22**] OBJECT: ALTERED MENTAL STATUS; RULE OUT SEIZURES.
ABNORMALITY #2: Intermittent brief bursts of moderate amplitude mixed theta and delta frequency slowing were noted in a generalized distribution.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized and slow background, which was admixed with bursts of moderate amplitude mixed frequency slowing noted in a generalized distribution.
This constellation of findings is consistent with a mild encephalopathy, which suggests dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline dysfunction.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.

Recovering ICU polyneuropathy and ICU delerium.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please evaluate swallow function and risk of aspiration.
HISTORY: 52-year-old female with a complicated course following ORIF for ankle/fibular fracture.
ORAL PHASE: There is moderate-to-severe impairment of bolus formation and control.
A mild amount of premature spillage is noted in the pharynx.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: Swallow initiation was mildly delayed.
No valleculae or piriform residue remaining.
One abrupt episode of aspiration was identified with thin liquid sipped from a straw.
Mild amount of premature spillover into the pharynx.
Brief Hospital Course: 52F h/o hyperfibrinolysis syndrome admitted for R ankle ORIF, post op course c/b ARDS [**1-13**] influenza requiring intubation and trach/PEG.
Hospital course by problem:  # ARDS: Pt s/p ORIF on [**2-2**], triggered for hypoxia on [**2-4**] requiring intubation.
Pt developed recurrent fevers with acute desats and e/o worsening hypoxia, CXR revealed new bilateral infiltrates, antibiotics restarted [**2-21**].
Decision made to switch from fent/midaz to propofol [**1-13**] large dosing requirements and unsatisfactory levels of sedation.
Ventilation was further optimized by increasing diuresis, and weaning was facilitated by decreasing sedation.
Pt was extubated without incident, and received a tracheostomy as well as PEG.
# ID: During her ICU course she had an period of hypotension requiring pressors and findings of dilated colon.
C difficile workup was negative, she was thought to have ileus and patient responded to empiric broad spectrum antibiotics.
On [**3-13**] she was restarted on Vancomycin and Cefepime in the setting of mild GB wall edema on U/S,  CT of the sinuses was positive for extensive sinus disease, and sputum culture with GPC (eventually reported to be OP flora).
A HIDA scan was negative for cholecystitis.
ENT FOE which revealed a small amount of purulent fluid at the middle meatus, swab was performed which revealed rare OP flora on culture.
Although her fever curve improved she developed increase in her WBC to > 20 and she received several doses of Flagyl on [**3-15**].
Her C dif remained negative and given her persistently elevated WBC she was underwent lumbar puncture on [**3-17**] for 6 cc of bloody fluid (multiple attempts required).
The patient completed an empiric course of cefepime and vancomycin for meningitis in setting of instrumentation (had VP shunt).
Her fever curve and WBC gradually trended down during her ICU stay.
# Transaminitits:  The patient had 2 periods of transient LFT elevation during her stay which resolved spontaneously.
She had multiple RUQ u/s and a HIDA scan which did not show any evidence of gall stones or biliary obstruction.
She also had a transient elevation in her pancreatic enzymes without clinical evidence for pancreatitis.
These lab abnormalities were believed to be related to medications, notably her caspofungin and propofol.
All were trending down or back to normal at time of discharge  # SVT with aberrancy: Pt had recurrent SVT with aberrancy, and was loaded with amiodarone and metoprolol.
# Hyperfibrinolysis syndrome:  Heme onc was consulted prior to pt's ORIF, recommended perioperative Amicar.
She was maintained on pneumoboots instead of heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and was also given amicar for the LP and VP shunt taps.
She had multiple LE u/s for pain/swelling in her leg which showed no DVT.
She had a VQ scan during her period of hypoxia which was low probability for PE.
# RLE ankle ORIF: Pt s/p right ankle fracture on [**1-28**] after a fall on the beach.
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 6112**] team she is to remain non-weight bearing on her right leg while awaiting this revision.
#CNS: Following the patient's extubation she had persistent altered mental status and flaccid paralysis with hyperreflexia.
She had evidence of encephalopathy without seizures on EEG.
MRI brain was without evidence for meningitis or encephalitis.
MRI spine was without cord compression or abscess.
Her symptoms were attributed to a combination of meningoencephalitis and ICU polyneuropathy in setting of prolonged severe illness with intubation, prolonged period of sedation with use of paralytics.
She worked aggressively with PT her paralysis resolved with slow return of her distal muscle strenght.
She underwent a video swallow study which revealed intact swallow function without aspiration and she was tolerating PO intake at time of discharge.
On day of discharge she was oriented x 3, she continues to have waxing [**Doctor Last Name 2364**] mental status with some episodes of paranoia and anxiety attributed to ICU delerium which continue to resolve as pt recovers.
On day of discharge pt is afebrile with stable vital signs.
Pain controlled with oral pain medications.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid [**Last Name (STitle) 1649**]: One (1) Liquid PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) 1649**]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 41**] - [**Location (un) 42**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Ankle fracture Influenza Acute respiratory distress syndrome Hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, tracheotomy Meningitis ICU polyneuropathy   Discharge Condition: Fair.
Vital signs stable.
Pain free.
You will need to have a repeat operation to complete the repair of the fracture with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the near future.
You developed ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome from influenza infection requiring intubation and placement of a tracheotomy tube as well as a gastric tube.
You had an episode of rapid irregular heart rate for which the cardiology team was consuled and recommended starting some new medications for your heart rate.
You will need to follow up with cardiology/electrophysiology as an outpatient for ongoing management of these medications.
Your stay in the ICU was complicated by meningitis, treated with IV antibiotics and profound weakness which is known as ICU polyneuropathy.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience intractable pain, worsening confusion, fevers, difficulty breathing or for any other concerning symptoms.
