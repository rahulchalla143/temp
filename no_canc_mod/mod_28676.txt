He does not recall any incident of trauma or any falls, but does describe a routine daily Chinese exercise where he shakes his head to either side.
The headache has been constant, and last night, increased in intensity and the patient describes a feeling of loss of balance (ataxia).
He has has no visual field disturbances, LOC, or other neurological symptoms of note.
Past Medical History: - hypertension - recent gastric biopsy for abdominal discomfort   Social History: - pt is [**Name (NI) 54235**] with very little English - he is married - he has 4 children - he is currently retired - he does not smoke or drink alcohol   Family History:  noncontributory.

The subdural hematomas have areas of hyperdensity interspersed by lower density areas.
These findings likely represent acute on chronic hematomas.
There is minimal shift of the midline structures to the left by 4 mm.
There is mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
The suprasellar cistern is patent but has some minimal mass effect upon it.
There is atherosclerotic calcification.
Incidental note is made of a chronic left tripod fracture.
IMPRESSION: Acute on chronic bilateral subdural hematomas, right greater than left with mild mass effect.
MRI 10/706: There are bilateral mixed signal intensities with predominant hyperintense T1 signal subdural hematomas identified extending from frontal to the parietal region.
The hematoma on the right measures 2.5 cm in the maximum width and the hematoma on the left side measures 2 cm in the maximum width.
There is indentation on the adjacent brain with compression of both lateral ventricles.
There is no significant midline shift seen.
There is mild prominence of both temporal horns identified.
Following gadolinium, no abnormal parenchymal or vascular enhancement seen.
There is mild meningeal enhancement identified bilaterally.
Specifically, no evidence of tonsillar herniation is seen.
The left-sided subdural measures 2 cm and the right-sided subdural measures 2.5 cm in maximum width.
No evidence of herniation is seen.
Mass effect is seen on both cerebral hemispheres and the ventricles.
No evidence of acute infarct.
There is small amount of hemorrhage at the postoperative site, and small bilateral subdural fluid collections with layering hematocrit posteriorly.
There is a small amount of intracranial air.
There is no shift of midline structures, but there is compression of both lateral ventricles that appear relatively unchanged.
There is distortion of the suprasellar cistern, unchanged indicating some mild downward pressure, but the quadrigeminal plate and basal cisterns are relatively intact.
IMPRESSION: Status post bilateral craniectomies with smaller bilateral subdural collections and unchanged mass effect.
#2, RIGHT SUBDURAL MEMBRANE AND CLOT: Chronic, organizing hematoma with features of chronic subdural hematoma.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 83 170 92 358/397.71 76 60 54  CXR [**11-16**]: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66yo [**Known firstname **] who has had ataxia and multiple falls, as well as several weeks of headache, who was admitted to the hospital from the ED due to bilateral subdural hematomas found on CT.
The CT an MRI showed bilateral acute on chronic and subacute subdural hematomas with multiple membranes in between them and mass effect.
It was thought to be secondary to irritation from hemorrhage.
He was seen by speech and swallow on [**11-20**], who did not have any reccomendations as they felt his speech and swallowing was intact.
Hospital course was otherwise notable for chest pain, with a normal EKG and negative cardiac enzymes, and an asymptomatic positive blood culture (GPC, [**2-12**]) thought to be a contaminant.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
