Admission Date:  [**2119-5-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-5-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-9-4**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13534**] is a 73 year-old female with a past medical history remarkable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes who has been experiencing worsening exertional angina for the past several years.
The patient has noted that the pain is currently occurring once monthly with exertion typically located midsternal and radiating to the back.
A stress test that was done on [**2119-5-11**] showed the patient had [**Street Address(2) 48360**] depressions during stage 2 exercise while the patient developed chest pain consistent with prior anginal symptoms.
Imaging during this period revealed an inferolateral and apical ischemia with an EF of 78%.
At this time the patient underwent cardiac catheterization for further evaluation for coronary revascularization.
The patient's left anterior descending coronary artery showed 80% compromise, LCX showed 80% compromise and right coronary artery showed 80% compromise with an EF of 60%.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Cerebrovascular accident with decrease in left eye vision.
Bilateral hip replacement.
Left knee replacement.
Bilateral leg stripping.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient is a well developed, well nourished female in no acute distress at the time of discharge.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
No evidence of oral ulcers.
Sternotomy site without any evidence of erythema and no evidence of serosanguinous drainage.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds and no evidence of inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Lower extremity had no evidence of edema and graft site shows good healing without any evidence of ulceration, erythema or serosanguinous drainage.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 73 year-old female with a past medical history remarkable for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes and worsening anginal symptoms with cardiac catheterization to find three vessel disease of left anterior descending coronary artery, LCX, right coronary artery.
On [**2119-5-19**] the patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two with left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending coronary artery (lesser saphenous) without complications.
On postoperative day number two the patient developed acute agitation, which required 40 mg of Haldol to maintain the patient sedated.
By postoperative day number three the decision was made to transfer the patient to the floor since the patient's mental status had returned back to baseline and no additional Haldol was necessary.
Shortly thereafter the patient's cardiac rhythm became irregular and the patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Approximately three hours after the atrial fibrillation began rate was controlled and the rhythm spontaneously reverted back to normal sinus.
