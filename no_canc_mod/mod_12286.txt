A JP drain was placed at the time of the second procedure and this was removed after she tolerated advancement of her diet without evidence of a leak.
ON the day of her discharge, she developed loose stools.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   She will have visiting nurse assistance to assist her with home physical therapy, assess the progress of her wound healing, and initially supervise her gastroesophageal flushes.
