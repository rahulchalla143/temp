Admission Date:  [**2201-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2201-2-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 76423**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with hypertension who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath found to have likely NSTEMI with ED course complicated by A Fib with RVR and CHF.
The patient developed respiratory distress at 10PM the evening prior to admission while at home at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
She had expiratory wheezing and was described as anxious and restless.
She refused to take furosemide and her respiratory status worsened prompting transfer to [**Hospital6 4620**].
She was hypertensive with improved respiratory status, RR 20's with O2 sats 93% on RA improved to 99-100% on 2L.
EKG here revealed new anterolateral ST depressions and elevated cardiac enzymes (trending downward).
She was intiated on medical management for NSTEMI with aspirin, beta-blocker and heparin gtt.
The patient developed A Fib with RVR at 5pm.
Her heart rate was not controlled with metoprolol or diltiazem boluses.
She developed shortness of breath and CXR revealed likely pulmonary edema.
Of note, she had a recent fall and sustained a L tibial plateau fracture.
She was able to walk fine w/ minimal pain.
Exam was notable for swelling in her right hip/leg raising concern for a fracture.
XR at the time revealed no R hip fracture and she was sent back to rehab w/ tylenol prn for degenerative joint disease.
She was getting tylenol RTC for pain relief.
Has an aide w/ her who states that her current mental state, difficulty communicating, and difficulty swallowing all started with her fall.
She is currently on pureed diet, thickened liquids and aspiration precautions.
She has been repeatedly noted to have a low appetite and to be refusing medications, raising staff concern for dehydration and malnutrition.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Falls Hearing impaired in the left ear Glaucoma Cataract in the right eye Dementia RUL lung nodule - not pursuing further Left tibial plateau fracture [**1-13**] Incidental left frontal convexity meningioma   Social History: Lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
No masses or organomegaly.
Integumentary: No rashes or lesions.
Eccymosis at sites of previous IV in the right hand.
T wave inversions and a fib are new from previous dated [**2199-10-11**].
CXR ([**2201-2-10**]): Worsening CHF with upper lung zone redistribution and perihilar haze.
Persistent bilateral small effusions.
Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis as noted previously.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 76425**] was admitted with an NSTEMI with a course complicated by A Fib with RVR and CHF.
She was not thought to be a long-term anticoagulation candidate because of her recent history of recurrent mechanical falls.
She was noted to have pauses with hypotension when she converted from AFib to SR.  She was started on amlodipine 100 mg QD and taken off all nodal agents, including metoprolol.
On [**2201-2-13**] her blood pressures were fairly high and she was restarted on lisinopril 20 mg QD (half of her home dose of 40 mg QD) with hydralazine PRN for breakthrough SBP > 170.
On admission, she was noted to have a leukocytosis and relative hypothermia (with T ~95 degrees).
Chest x-ray showed a questionable opacity, and she was started on a seven day course of cefpodoxime for a possible pneumonia.
She likely had some degree of ARF from poor forward flow in the setting of AFib with RVR and CHF, and her creatinine improved to 1.0 with better rate control.
Patient however returned to AFib with RVR and became hypotensive and progressively lethargic.
She did not respond to rate controlling agents or fluid challenges.
Goals of care were re-addressed with family; patient was made CMO after acute decline in mental status.
