The patient has a history of hypertension and a family history of coronary artery disease.
No known history of personal coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes mellitus.
He was washing his bus today when he noted the onset of severe left-sided chest pain (like "knives"), diaphoresis, and nausea.
He was taken by Emergency Medical Service to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital in [**Location (un) **] where an acute anterolateral myocardial infarction was noted on the electrocardiogram.
In the Catheterization Laboratory, the patient had an Angio-Jet of a complete mid left anterior descending artery lesion and four stents placed.
Multiple sclerosis (Symptoms include dysarthria and left leg weakness worse with exertion.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history positive for coronary artery disease; his sister was deceased at the age of 58, status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.
He had no carotid bruits.
His heart was regular in rate and rhythm with soft heart sounds.
His right groin catheter site was soft and without hematomas or bruits.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram prior to catheterization demonstrated a sinus rhythm at the rate of 88, normal axis and normal intervals.
ST elevations in I, aVL, V2 through V5.
ST depressions in III and aVF.
The left circumflex with diffuse 30% ostial/proximal 40% mid, 70% left posterior descending artery.
The right coronary artery with mild luminal irregularities.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Coronaries:  As above, the patient had 2-vessel coronary artery disease and had four stents placed in his left anterior descending artery.
After his intervention, the patient did not have any evidence of ischemia by symptoms or by electrocardiogram.
The balloon pump was weaned without event.
He had an echocardiogram on day three status post myocardial infarction which revealed an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25% to 30%, with severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction; comprising septal, anterior, and apical akinesis.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient had multiple runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia after his myocardial infarction.
He had several shorter runs of 5 beats to 10 beats occurring more than two days status post myocardial infarction.
They elected to see the patient in one month when his course of Plavix was completed and he was at less of a risk of bleeding.
He was to have a T wave alternans study at this time and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] of the Electrophysiology Service.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient oxygenated well throughout his admission and did not have pulmonary problems.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a drop in his hematocrit from 37 to 31.4 after his catheterization.
He was to follow up with his primary care physician for further diagnosis and management of possible type 2 diabetes mellitus.
