The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with calcification of the aortic knob.
There continues to be minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases which may reflect atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present, but no pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION: Minimal atelectasis in the lung bases with possible small pleural effusions.
No evidence for pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 50M with h/o OSA, COPD, obesity hypoventilation, and chronic pain on narcotics, who was admitted with AMS and hypoventilation likely [**12-20**] polypharmacy.
# AMS: Likely [**12-20**] respiratory acidosis in setting of polypharmacy with accidental benzodiazepine overdose.
He was initially admitted to the MICU due to his h/o requiring intubation with episodes of respiratory failure.
He remained alert and oriented, although continued to request higher doses of his pain medications.
He is scheduled to follow up with his PCP and in the Pain Clinic as an outpatient for continued titration of his medications.
His respiratory acidosis resolved once his AMS cleared.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine on admission was 1.5, up from baseline 0.9  This resolved by HD#2 with IV fluids, suggesting likely pre-renal etiology.
# Fever: Pt had an isolated temperature to 100.8 overnight on HD#2.
He was asymptomatic, and had no evidence of infection on lab data or imaging.
If he develops focal s/sx and/or if fever recurs, would recommend pursuing infectious work-up.
Chronic Issues: .
# Chronic Pain on Narcotics: Pt has debilitating chronic pain [**12-20**] bilateral hip avascular necrosis.
# Schizophrenia: Stable.
He is scheduled to follow up with his PCP and may require continued tapering of his medications.
# Hypertension: His lisinopril was held due to high-normal potassium (K 5.2) with concurrent [**Last Name (un) **] therapy.
Likely from Hepatic steatosis as confirmed on CT 8/[**2202**].
- He is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP and in the Pain Clinic.
- He was febrile to 100.8 x1 overnight prior to discharge but was asymptomatic and his subsequent temps were normal.
If he develops symptoms would recommend infectious work-up.
