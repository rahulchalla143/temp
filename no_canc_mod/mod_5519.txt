Admission Date: [**2103-7-24**]        Discharge Date: [**2103-8-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2025-11-21**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. [**Known lastname 39868**] is a 77 year old male referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2912**] for MVR, TVR, coronary artery bypass graft.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion times seven months.
Told in [**Month (only) 404**] that he had a leaking valve that might require follow up.
However, the patient became increasingly dyspneic over the next several months culminating in admission to [**Hospital6 **] on [**Month (only) 116**] of this month with congestive heart failure.
He was diuresed at that time and an echocardiogram done during that admission showed dilated left ventricle, LA, and RA with aortic and mitral sclerosis with mild AS, trace aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization done on [**2103-7-18**] showed a normal left main, left anterior descending coronary artery with no disease, circumflex with total obstruction at the distal take of the posterior descending coronary artery.
Right coronary artery with no significant disease.
Severe mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension, an ejection fraction of 47 percent.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease status post right coronary artery stent in [**2095**], hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, bilateral knee arthroscopies, partial gastrectomy, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, right bundle branch block, asthma, hernia repair.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attacks.
No seizures, cancer, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Positive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, no cough.
No abdominal pain, melanoa, hematochezia.
History of peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy.
No claudication, peripheral vascular disease, or deep venous thrombosis.
Chest x-ray showed mild ventricular failure, moderate cardiomegaly with a right effusion.
Electrocardiogram was atrial fibrillation with a rate of 73, right bundle branch block, nonspecific ST changes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 98 in atrial fibrillation.
Cardiovascular - irregularly irregular, III/VI systolic ejection murmur.
HEENT - pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy and no bruits.
CT showed an enlarged nodule liver suspicious for cirrhosis.
Mitral valve replacement with a #31 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] porcine valve, and a tricuspid valve repair with a 36 mm ring.
In the immediate postoperative period the patient had postoperative bleeding and he returned to the Operating Room for exploration and ligation of bleeding vessels.
He was atrial fibrillation at 74 beats per minute with a CVP of 25 and PAD of 33.
He had no further bleeding from his chest tubes.
On postoperative day #1, the patient continued to be hemodynamically stable with no further drainage from his chest tubes.
He developed hypercarbia and therefore remained intubated.
Central venous lines were removed.
However, he remained in the intensive care unit for close hemodynamic monitoring as well as pulmonary support given his persistent oxygen requirement.
Postoperative day #4, this patient continued slow progression.
His chest tubes and temporary pacing wires were discontinued and again the patient remained in the intensive care unit because of a persistent oxygen requirement.
A chest x-ray done showed a moderate size right sided pleural effusion and a thoracentesis done that at the bedside drained 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid following which the patient's oxygen requirement was improved.
The patient was also restarted on Coumadin given his chronic atrial fibrillation and transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Over the next several days the patient had an uneventful postoperative course.
He was slowly anticoagulated for his chronic atrial fibrillation.
Respiratory - clear to auscultation on the left with diminished breath sounds on the right one third of the way up.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting times one with saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and a stent to the right coronary artery done in [**2095**].
Mitral regurgitation status post mitral valve replacement with a #31 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] porcine valve.
Tricuspid regurgitation status post tricuspid valve repair with a #36 ring.
Bilateral knee arthroscopies.
Partial gastrectomy.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
Hernia repair.
