When paramedics arrived on scene he was awake and noted to be incontinent of stool and aggressively restless with bruising to both knees.
Upon arrival to the OSH he was found to have a GCS of 10 and became increasingly combative.
Imaging at the OSH showed bilateral parietal SAH, basilar skull fracture, basilar and Left posterior parietal subgaleal hematoma, gross blood in left mastoid, pneumocephalus, and question of a Left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Past Medical History: DM, HTN per family   Social History: No ETOH or Tobacco use per family  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On Admission: O: T:97.9  BP: 127/56   HR:64    R: 20    O2Sats 100%  Neurologic exam: pt is intubated and not sedated, pupils are 3mm and nonreactive bilaterally, +corneals bilaterally, +cough to extreme deep suction, no response to deep sternal rub, no response in upper extremities to proximal or distal noxious.
+triple flexion to deep noxious bilateral lower extremities.
HEENT Exam: + blood in bilateral nares unable to assess for CSF rhinorrhea with nasal packing on right, Left ear canal grossly bloody unable to assess for hemotympanum or CSF otorrhea, no hemotympanum or CSF otorrhea on right.
Pertinent Results: [**5-13**] CT C-spine: 1.No acute fracture, traumatic malalignment, or prevertebral hematoma seen.
Moderately severe congenital narrowing of spinal canal from C3 through C7.
Severe canal narrowing at C5-C6 where posterior disc and osteophyte causes deformity of the spinal cord.
If there is concern for acute cord injury, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
Please refer to CT maxillofacial bones for description of skull base and facial bone fractures, as well as lytic and sclerotic lesions of the skull base.
Please refer to CT head for extent of intracranial hemorrhage.
Small amount of high-density subarachnoid blood tracks inferiorly from the head into the upper cervical canal.
10-mm left thyroid nodule.
Multiple facial bone fractures as described above, involving bilateral frontal sinuses, the left temporal bone and zygomatic arch, floor of the sphenoid sinus/clivus, and the hard palate.
There is pneumocephalus as well as blood layering in the paranasal sinuses, left mastoid air cells, and left middle and external ear.
Right intraorbital extraconal gas seen, with right proptosis but no retrobulbar hematoma.
Multiple sclerotic and mixed lytic and sclerotic foci involving the clivus, the occipital condyles, and the left sphenoid bone raise concern for metastatic disease.
Correlation with history of malignancy recommended and, if clinically indicated, bone scan may be helpful to evaluate extent of disease.
No acute traumatic injury seen within the torso other than mild soft tissue stranding adjacent to the left hip.
Bilateral dependent lung opacities, likely atelectasis.
Several scattered sclerotic foci within the spine and pelvis.
These could represent bone islands, but correlation with any history of prior malignancy is recommended including with PSA.
Small bilateral subdural hematomas with no significant mass effect.
Hemorrhagic contusion identified at the left temporal lobe and right frontoparietal lobe are noted.
CTA shows no aneurysm.
Large left occipitoparietal subgaleal hematoma and pneumocephalus on the right temporal fossa with associated facial bone fractures.
Diffuse bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage with foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the bilateral temporal lobes and right frontal lobe.
Subdural hematoma layering along the tentorium and the right cerebral convexity, similar in appearance.
Interval development of intraventricular hemorrhage with blood layering in the left posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
No significant shift of normally midline structures.
Multiple facial bone fractures with fluid and hemorrhage within the paranasal sinuses, better evaluated on recent dedicated CT of facial bones.
Large left parietal subcutaneous hematoma and soft tissue swelling.
Mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions of skull base.
Bibasilar atelectasis persists, left greater than right.
Mild cardiomegaly and interstitial edema are present.
[**2130-5-17**] CT head No evidence for new hemorrhage.
Multiple foci of hemorrhagic contusion, with associated subarachnoid, intraventricular, and subdural blood are again identified.
There is slightly increased edema associated with the hemorrhagic contusions.
There is no new hydrocephalus or evidence of acute infarction.
[**5-19**]: LENS No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
Bilateral soft tissue edema.
No new infiltrates are identified.
Relatively high-positioned diaphragms account for somewhat crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature on the bases and a linear plate atelectasis on the right side.
Again new acute infiltrates are not seen, and no pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.
In comparison with the next previous study of [**5-18**] no significant progressive abnormality has been identified.
Decrease in amount and density of the intraventricular hemorrhage and the hemorrhage associated with the temporal bone contusions bilaterally.
Unchanged vasogenic edema associated with the bitemporal contusions and unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Unchanged hemorrhage in the sphenoid sinus, multiple facial bones and left sphenoid bone fracture.
Complex fracture of the left temporal bone with a predominantly transverse orientation extending through the mastoid air cells at the level of the ossicular chain without evidence of ossicular disruption.
Subsequent near complete opacification of mastoid air cells and inner ear on the left.
Fracture of the posterior medial wall of the right sphenoid sinus extending adjacent to the posterior wall of the left carotid canal without definite involvement.
If there is clinical concern for a vascular injury, a CTA of the head is recommended for further evaluation.
Transversely oriented fracture of the left sphenoid bone extending into the left foramen ovale without involvement of the petrous portion of the carotid canal.
Partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells without evidence of right temporal bone fracture.
Redemonstration of bitemporal contusions and associated vasogenic edema, intraventricular hemorrhage, and a small amount of probable subarachnoid blood.
There was no evidence of extra cranial activity at that time.
Again, there was no evidence of extra cranial activity.
Gauze which had been placed over the ear had no evidence of activity using a survey meter.
Continued CSF leak was noted at left ear on [**2130-5-18**].
There was no leaking around the LD site.
They recommended CT temporal bones and a nuclear medicine study.
There was no sign of CSF leak on imaging.
the Neurosurgery/ENT and IR departments were hesitant to replace this in ,light of multiple facial fractures.
Neuro: He was on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
He needed several Dilantin boluses over the next few day s for subtherepeutic levels.
He has not had a seizure but due to the extensive damage to the left temporal lobe, a one month course was recommended.
CT head on [**5-24**] showed no SDH formation from CSF drainage.
He still appeared to have a mixed dysphasia.
He had guaiac positive stool x2 after the PEG.
Trauma adjusted the PEG and there were no further issues.
CXR showed vascular congestion.
LENS were negative for DVT.
Final cultures showed no growth.
He remained afebrile after UTI treatment.
**CT imaging at presentation revealed bone islands and sclerotic changes of the axial skeleton.
He has no history of malignancy.
They have no records of this condition or any malignancy.
