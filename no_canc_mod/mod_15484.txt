Past OB history was remarkable for fetal loss with a baby with encephalocele.
Mother had a history of HSV with the last outbreak being in [**2157-5-12**], no active lesions reported recently.
This morning on day of delivery, there was prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration to the 90s, and the decision was made to delivery by emergency C section.
He was treated with bulb suction and blow-by O2 and admitted to the NICU with respiratory distress.
Respiratory:  Breathing with mild retractions, air entry fair, coarse rales bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1, S2, 1/6 systolic murmur at left sternal border, pulse is normal including perfusion.
Abdomen is soft, no organomegaly.
He received a total of two doses of Surfactant and was extubated to CPAP by day of life one after starting caffeine for apnea of prematurity.
He remained on room air from day of life six to day of life 20 when he developed mild respiratory distress and oxygen requirement when challenged with po feeds.
He had mild apnea of prematurity and caffeine was discontinued on day of life 13 after he remained spell free for nine days.
Off caffeine, he has been having a few apneic spells with the last one being on day of life 19, mostly self resolved.
Cardiovascular:  [**Location (un) **] had transient hypertension initially required two boluses of normal saline.
His initial murmur continued to be intermittently observed, but no hemodynamic instability.
He remained NPO until resolution of his respiratory distress, and was started on enteral feeds on day of life six.
His blood culture remains negative, however, his respiratory distress persisted on day of life two prompting a workup for possible viral etiology given the mother's history of HSV in [**2157-5-12**].
A lumbar puncture obtained at that time was not consistent with meningitis.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Apnea of prematurity.
