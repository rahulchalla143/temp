No recent fevers, no abdominal pain.
He described diarrhea x 2 days and some chills prior to presentation.
He had occasional palpitations.
He described chest pain that started on the right side of his chest one day prior to admission.
K elevated to 6.9 and received 1 amp Ca gluconate, kayexelate and given 325 of ASA.
No ECG changes.
He was placed on CPAP given his respiratory distress.

Pertinent Results: [**1-17**] CXR: Opacity at the left base suggestive of pneumonia.
[**1-19**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

On the day of admission he endorsed headache and myalgia.
Overall, major contributors to his presenting condition were weight gain secondary to both increased ascites (cardiogenic and hepatic), pulmonary hypertension and renal failure.
BNP and signs of volume overload were not marked, and venous pressure was slightly up.
Therefore there was likely some increased interstitial fluid/intravascular fluid, with a possible large contribution from ascites.
This would have accounted for weight gain and some increased difficulty walking before the admission.
Pulmonary hypertension and resulting fixed cardiac output with slight fluid overload are likely contributors to dyspnea.
We need to also be mindful of HIV as a cause of pulmonary hypertension and also for atypical infections, though CD4 counts were reassuring.
Pneumonia seemed less likely given no constitutional signs of infection.
Pulmonary hypertension, slight fluid overload were most likely, while we were mindful of unlikely pulmonary embolism (given rapid recovery and likely little reserve given his underlying physiology).
Sildenafil was continued while patient was hospitalized and we also got in contact with patient's pulmonologist, who recommended continuing sildenafil at the current dose and regimen.
Repeat echo demonstrated moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient was continued on sildenafil and did not have any side effects.
On admission his potassium was elevated and reached a peak of 8.5 despite receiving calcium and Kayexelate in the ED with no ECG changes.
# dCHF: The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure based on echocardiogram and right heart cath.
We did not suspect that dCHF was causing large component of his dyspnea on exertion during this admission.
Despite low BNP likely small exacerbation given improved renal function with diuresis.
The patient was found to have a microcytic anemia and examination of iron studies releaved the patient to be iron deficient.
# Acute renal failure: Concern for poor renal perfusion given possible fluid overload (BNP did not support) versus over-diuresis with recent increase in Lasix at home.
As above, he did require dialysis for hyperkalemia.
The renal consult service followed the patient throughout his hospitalization and helped to maximize his renal function.
Trazodone 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insimia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
