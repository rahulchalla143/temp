She states this was not a suicide attempt and not associated with any particular stressors.
She was hypoxic and was therefore intubated for respiratory failure.
CK was elevated at over 2500.
There was concern for cerebral edema there and she received mannitol, Decadron, and possibly a diuretic.
She also received 2 amps of bicarb, Narcan (with no effect), and moxifloxacin and clindamycin for presumed aspiration after a chest x-ray showed a "diffuse bilateral perihilar process."
There, she was treated with Unasyn for 3 days for aspiration pneumonia.
ROS: She reports a mild sore throat.
She denies cough, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, and visual and auditory hallucinations.
She denies a depressed mood and suicidal ideations.
CV: Regular Rate and Rhythm, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Gait intact, ambulating independently without difficulty.
Studies:  - EKG: ?
Perihilar and right middle lobe opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema and/or infectious consolidation.
- Head CT: No evidence of hemorrhage.
No mass effect.
Sinus disease.
There is no evidence of edema.
- CXR [**12-22**]: Dense right middle and lower lobe opacification consistent with bulbar collapse or dense consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 70418**] is a 22-year-old woman with no significant medical history who presented unconscious with severe alcohol intoxication.
This was attributed to pneumonia seen on CXR; this in turn was felt to be the result of aspiration secondary to her alcohol intoxication.
She was afebrile for the final 24 hours of hospitalization, and her WBC count normalized from a peak of over 17,000.
This was likely the result of rhabdomyolysis after being down for an indeterminate amount of time.
She had no evidence of renal failure.
Elevated LFTs.
This was likely due to alcohol.
Aspiration pneumonia 3.
Rhabdomyolysis .
