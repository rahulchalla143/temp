Pt was reportedly dialyzed today; HD was almost completed but had to be stopped early secondary to clotting in the fistula.
At this time, he was having some bilateral shaking of his arms.
He also reports some pain in his right shoulder, above the site of his HD catheter.
He had 1 episode of loose stools 1 day PTA.
He denies any URI symptoms, no CP/SOB/abdominal pain.
After HD session on day of admission, he felt unwell/lethargic at home.
He was seen by renal who felt that this was likely septic shock, recommended vanco/gent.
Renal stated that HD catheter (right SC) should be used for fluids/pressors/abx (pt has history of difficult access, ?saving femoral sites for future HD catheters).
Bedside TTE showed no pericardial effusion or signs of tamponade.
Other ED events include treatment of hyperkalemia (7.1 to 4.6) with bicarb, D50.
He had no specific complaints but did state that he was having pain in right shoulder at site of HD catheter.

Evaluate for fluid collection surrounding the left upper extremity graft.
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: The patient's left upper extremity arteriovenous graft is again seen, without evidence of intraluminal flow, and multiple internal echos suggesting thrombosis.
No fluid collections are seen surrounding the graft.
No fluid collections surrounding the patient's left upper extremity AV graft.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 56 year old man with h/o discitis and increasing pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: epidural abscess?
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of discitis and increasing pain.
Rule out epidural abscess.
The examination is limited as patient was unable to continue.
No evidence of spinal stenosis seen at other levels.
Bilateral severe narrowing of the neural foramina is noted.
IMPRESSION: Limited study demonstrating chronic changes of discitis and osteomyelitis at L4-5 level.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened; there is focal thickening of the right cusp that could represent a vegetation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-11-19**], the aortic and tricuspid valve abnormalities are new, and are highly suggestive of endocarditis.
Sinus rhythm.
Non-diagnostic poor R wave progression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2189-5-21**] sinus rhythm has replaced atrial fibrillation.

IMPRESSION: A single frontal spot film of the chest centered over the right lower lobe was provided for documentation of a fluoroscopic guided procedure without a radiologist in attendance.
Brief Hospital Course: # MRSA Bacteremia and sepsis: Patient presented to the ED with fevers/chills after partial HD session on [**5-20**] (stopped early due to fistula clotting), he was admitted to the MICU in afib with RVR and subsequent hypotension, found to have sepsis, MRSA bacteremia.
TTE showed no pericardial effusion or evidence of tamponade, but was concerning for endocarditis given valve thickening.
A TEE was attempted but was unsuccessful due to inability to pass the U/S scope.
He remained hemodynamically stable, restarted hemodialysis without difficulty.
All surveillance blood cultures had no growth.
For further ID work up patient will need an outpatient MRI with gadolinium (to further assess chronic changes of discitis and osteomyelitis at L4-5) and TEE for more accurate assessment of endocarditis.
# Afib with RVR: Patient was loaded on IV amiodarone while in the MICU and then continued on PO amiodarone 400 po bid x 14 days.
# Chronic Pain: Patient was continued on methadone, oxycodone, and neurontin per home regimen .
# CAD: Pt's elevated troponins attributed to end stage renal disease.
# Diabetes - Continued diabetic diet, SSI with FS QID.
# Depression - Continued paxil, remeron, and seroquel.
