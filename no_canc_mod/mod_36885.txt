Shortness of breath.
TECHNIQUE: AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained without comparisons.
Mild diffuse prominence of interstitial markings suggest mild CHF.
There is no evidence of pleural effusion or focal consolidation.
There is diffuse osteopenia.
IMPRESSION: Likely mild CHF.
ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferolateral hypokinesis and inferior hypokinesis/akinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

1)Viral Bronchitis with evidence of PNA on CXR  Kept on droplet precautions and ruled out for influenza by negative nasal washings.
Treated bronchitis supportively with nebulizer bronchodilator therapy and inhaled steroids.
Will complete 7 day course of levaquin for presumed CAP, as she had a right hilar distribution opacity on CXR.
No new ischemic changes.
Enzymes trended down, and Echo demonstrated new inferior and infero-lateral wall motion abnormalities.
Echo continued to show LVH, LAE and preserved EF,but also new wall motion abnormalities compared to previous echo.
The patient developed a contraction alkolosis after gentle diuresis )4 liters over length of stay) therefore can decrease rate of diuresis with the goal being even - 500 cc negative over 24 hours.
4) Anemia:  Was guiaic negative on rectal exam, and anemia studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
5) Elevated LFTS - unclear etiology but possibly due to passive congestion from CHF.
6)CRI Remained at baseline creatinine.
Electrolytes and fluid  balance were monitored.
Medications were dosed for her reduced creatinine clearance.
Continued gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy.
9)h/o CVA -  Residual right sided weakness.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: pneumonia CHF NSTEMI DM HTN CRI transaminitis   Discharge Condition: fair, on 2 L NC  Discharge Instructions: Call your PCP if you have a fever, increased cough, have SOB, or chest pain.
