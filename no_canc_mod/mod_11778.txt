He describes the pain as constant and cramping.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Notable for significantly distended abdomen with tympany.
He was tender to percussion guarding in the left lower quadrant and his rectal examination was guaiac positive without any masses.
He underwent a KUB that represented multiple loops of distended small bowel, but no evidence of free air.
An abdominal CT scan demonstrated distended small bowel loops and fat streaking and inflammatory changes around the sigmoid colon consistent with sigmoid diverticulitis.
There was on evidence of extravasation of contrast but there was a small abscess present.
His abscess was percutaneously drained on HD2.
A bowel preparation was performed and he was taken to the OR for a sigmoid resection to definitely treat his sigmoid diverticulitis.
On [**2158-7-18**] the patient underwent an uncomplicated sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis.
One of the drains had perforated the small bowel in two separate portions of small bowel.
His postoperative course was notable for several episodes of hypotension requiring normal saline fluid boluses and a short stay in the Surgery Intensive Care Unit.
Physical therapy evaluated the patient and deemed him to be independent without any short term rehab needs.
