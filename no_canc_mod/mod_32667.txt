AP CHEST 7:13 P.M. ON [**3-4**] Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right, has increased slowly since [**2-21**].
Moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette includes a component of severe vascular distention, unchanged, and pulmonary vascular engorgement is mild and stable as well.
Tip of the tracheostomy tube abuts the left tracheal wall and should be evaluated to see if it is appropriately positioned.
Bibasilar atelectasis is presumed, particularly on the left, not changed appreciably.
No pneumothorax.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US  Study Date of [**2181-3-2**] 1:32 PM LEFT ARM VASCULAR ULTRASOUND:  Flow, waveform, and grayscale images of the left AV fistula were obtained, which demonstrate normal patency, expected waveforms, without any perifistular fluid collections or soft tissue edema.
No vascular filling defects appreciated.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2181-3-2**] 12:53 PM There are no priors for comparison.
There is opacification of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally as well as the ethmoid sinuses and sphenoid sinuses.
Opacification of the left ostiomeatal unit.
Asymmetric enlargement of the left psoas muscle extending up to the L1 level, with heterogeneous density.
This appearance could be consistent with a hematoma, though superimposed infection or early abscess cannot be excluded.
No discrete internal fluid collection is identified.
Atrophic kidneys and bilateral cysts corresponding to patient's known history of renal failure.
Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, greater on the left than right.
7-mm right upper lobe nodule as described on [**2181-1-28**] CT.
Alternatively, a comparison could be made to prior imaging (if available) to assess for stability, or PET-CT FDG imaging could also be performed.
Left atrial abnormality.
Possible prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2181-2-20**] there is no significant change.
There is thrombus identified within the left and right posterior tibial veins.
IMPRESSION: Deep venous thrombosis is seen within the left and right posterior tibial veins.
There is atherosclerotic disease with soft and calcified plaques bilaterally in the left common carotid artery.
The peak systolic velocity on either side is less than 110 cm per second on the right and less than 72 cm per second on the left.
Overall, there is less than 40% stenosis on either side.
CONCLUSION: Atherosclerotic changes in both common carotid and the internal carotid artery.
No significant stenoses identified.
Please note the examination was limited due to patient's body habitus and given that the patient is intubated.
[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT  Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2181-2-13**] at 11:39:31 AM Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There are complex (>4mm) non-mobile atheroma in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta to 37cm beyond the incisors.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2) by planimetry.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification with associated moderate calcific mitral stenosis (no evidence of rheumatic deformity).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The atrial septum and right atrium were not well visualized.
Agitated saline was injected at rest with no appearance of bubbles in the left atrium suggestive of the absence of a PFO or ASD.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus, PFO or ASD seen.
Diffuse, significant aortic atherosclerosis.
Severe aortic stenosis.
Moderate calcific mitral stenosis.
There is evidence of acute infarction in the distribution of the superior division of the left middle cerebral artery.
The MRA examination demonstrates an abrupt cutoff of the superior division of the left MCA with a faint tapering that suggests a meniscus and a likely intraluminal filling defect.
These findings are most suggestive of an embolic infarction in this location with a tiny trickle of flow passing distal to the occlusion.
No other intracranial vascular abnormalities are noted.
CONCLUSION:  Acute infarction in the superior division of the left middle cerebral artery with near occlusion of this branch just distal to the middle cerebral artery bifurcation.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
However, the non-contrast CT scan suggests low density and swelling in the left MCA territory, which would imply a completed infarct.
The CT angiogram demonstrates occlusion of the left vertebral artery in its cervical course.

M with h/o ESRD/HD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent LMCA stroke resulting in R hemiplegia, dysphagia, trach and PEG placement readmitted from rehab only 2 days after discharge [**3-3**] concern for increased lethargy.
1) Altered Mental Status - Poor baseline, difficult to assess since aphasic - On arrival he makes eye contact and tracks, which is apparently his new baseline since stroke, however over his stay he again lost this abaility and now will rarely open his eyes to command - This is most likely an overlying delerium rather than progression of the stroke  2) fever - Infectious work up included LP, blood cultures, urinalysis with culture, c.diff toxin, chest plain film, CT chest/abd/pelvis, Ct sinus, echocardiogram and U/S of AV fistula all without obvious source - He was treated with 10 days of IV vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed health care acquired pneumonia, however remained persitently febrile despite treatment and improvement in his CXR - He did have opacification of numerous sinus cavities on CT, however Zosyn should have treated this adequately - He had bilateral DVTs noted on BLE u/s in the posterial tibial veins, which may have contributed to his fevers - Given suspicion of drug fever in the setting of negative infectious workup, antibiotics were discontinued on [**2181-3-1**].
Although fever curve initially diminished, on the evening of [**2181-3-4**], he was again febrile., given a lack of source, he has remained off antibiotics, and a new mild leukocytosis is noted.
- On CXR this is a mild progression of his pleural effusions, which can be tapped possibly in an ICU setting, but is not safe in a floor setting - Tylenol was changed to standing, given persistant fevers  2) Diarrhea - c.diff hegative x 3 - Emperically treated with flagyl per tube while awaiting results, but discontinued with negative results - Banana flakes were added to tube feeds in hope to help with formed stools, but had to be stopped due to potassium content - Rectal tube was in place during hospitalization secondary to sacral breakdown  3) health care related pneumonia/COPD flare - He recently completed a course of vanco, cefepime, and flagyl while in house for RML PNA.
- For COPD flare, he was given steroids and has completed the taper prior to admission - He was continued on maintenance MDI treatment with albuterol, atrovent, beclomethasone - On hospital day 4, there was concern for possible interval development of a LLL PNA and he was placed back on vancomycin and zosyn for treatment of a HAP; however, the concerning infiltrate was no longer present on a CXR the following day.
Regardless, this was continued to treat possible PNA given his low BPs (see below) and continued low grade fevers.
- He has required frequent suctioning and his secretions have been worrisome, although have thinned in the last few days prior to transfer  4) bilateral DVTs - initiated on IV heparin gtt with bridging to coumadin with goal INR of [**3-4**], which was discussed with neurology - Anticoagulation discussed with neurology and the family given recent stroke and risk of hemmorhage, with recommendation to proceed given immobilization and risk for further venous thromboembolism.
5) s/p L MCA CVA - Head CT shows evolution of infarct without evidence of new infarcts - carotid duplex which did not show any significant stenosis of carotid or vertebral arteries - He was evaluated by neurology during this admission - He was continued on ASA 325mg daily until DVTs discovered, wherin ASA was discontinued and IV heparin/coumadin started - He is not on a statin [**3-3**] to CK elevation to 1000's after starting on last admission - Neurology was called for recommendations regarding anticoagulation in the setting of recent stroke, and they advised to go forward with anticoagulation.
7)ESRD on HD - He was continued on outpatient schedule for HD - The patient would intermittently have difficulty tolerating HD [**3-3**] low BPs, which was also the case during his prior ICU admission - cortsyntropin stim test post-steroid course for COPD exacerbation, which was within normal limits - A TTE/TEE performed recently during his prior hosptilization was signficant for severe AS and moderate MS, making the patient sensitive to any changes in preload.
However, he is not a surgical candidate for AVR and given his recent stroke would not be a good candidate for valvuloplasty either.
