In OSH ED found to have bp 90s/60s, inferior STEMI with first degree AV block, was started on Heparin and Integrilin, as was found to be asymptomatic at time.
As he also had an increased creatinine, he was admitted with plans to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] at later date for cardiac catheterization.
However, upon becoming symptomatic with AV dissociation he was immediately transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.
At [**Hospital1 18**] he was found to have disease of the RCA and PDA, received cypher stents at each site, was also found to be in third degree AV block and was transferred to the CCU.

(Y/N) Y Y  PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography revealed a total occlusion of the mid RCA at the origin of what was felt to be a bifurcaiton point of the mid RCA and an acute marginal branch.
A 2.0 x 20 mm Maverick balloon was uded to dotter through the occlusion and then dilate the stenotic area using 2 inflations of 8 ATM just distal to what was felt to be the acute marginal branch.
A 2.5 x 28 mm Cyoher DES was then deployed across the stenosis with good result.
After crossing into the vessel with the ChoICE PT xs wire, it became apparent that this acute marginal branch was really a sizeable PDA.
After dottering with the 2.0 x 20 mm balloon and then dilating a  significant proximal stenosis with inflaitons of 12, 12, 10, and 10 ATM.
A 2.5 x 28 mm Cy[her DES was deployed across the stenosis at 14 ATM.
Final angioraphy revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent dissection, and normal flow.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed one vessel disease.
The LMCA had mild luminal irregularities.
The LAD likewise had mild luminal irregularities and a 40% lesion in the mid vessel.
The LCX had mild diffuse disease with a more focal 30% stenosis in its mid-segment.
Limited resting hemodynamice revealed moderately elevated left-sided filling pressures (LVEDP 20 mmHg).
Systemic areterial pressures were normal and there was no gradient noted on catheter pull back across the aortic valve.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent dissection and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
ECHO: EF 40-45% The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation c/w papillary muscle dysfunction   Brief Hospital Course: After catheterization with stent placement to the RCA and PDA pt was stable, continued to be in third degree AV block for several days but asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable, without elevation in creatinine or QT prolongation.
On the third hospital day he began to show signs of return of AV function with periods of first degree AV block.
On the fourth hospital day he developed chest pain which was relieved with nitro drip.
By the fifth hospital day his rhythm wa predominantly first degree AV block, and he was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
Echo showed EF 40-45%, no akinesis or requirement for coumadin.
