Admission Date:  [**2137-2-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-2-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-6-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Central venous line placement Arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 78 year-old female with a history of ILD who presents with altered mental status.
Per the daughters report she was suffering from respiratory symptoms for the last 2 weeks with fever, mild cough and laryngitis.
Although her respiratory symptoms were improving on monday she noted her to be significantly fatigued in her nursing home and less conversational.
Today she was found slumped in her wheelchair, lethargic but opening her eyes to voice.
It was thought she was having a CHF exacerbation.
FOund to be hypoglyemic and given D50 with improvement of BG to 189.
CXR showed BL lower lob markings felt consistent with CHF or PNA.
In the ED she developed hypotension with SBP to the 70s but responded to 2L IVF bolus.
She was admitted to the ICU for AMS and recent hypotension.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
- Diabetes.
- Carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Depression and anxiety-apparently since [**2086**] with h/o auditory hallucinations.
- Interestitial lung disease diagnosed 7/[**2135**].
- SVT in the setting of hypoxia with admission [**5-28**] - [**5-28**] PNA treated with Vanc, Cefepime   Social History: Transfered from [**Hospital3 **].
NECK: JVD to angle of jaw (has TR), no bruits,  trachea midline  COR: regularly irregular no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +1 PULM: BL prominent crackles, no rhonchi.
ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: 3+ BL LE edema to thigh, no palpable cords NEURO: somulent, responsive to noxious stimulus and intermittantly to voice., CN II ??????
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
Severe aortic valve stenosis is not suggested.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-5-21**], right atrial and right ventricular cavity enlargement with now identified, with marked right ventricular free wall hypokinesis and new tricuspid regurgitation.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of an acute pulonary process (e.g, pulmonary embolism).
LE U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower limb.
Diffuse chronic bilateral interstitial lung disease (IPF).
Prominent hila from prominent pulmonary vessels suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
Progressive cardiomegaly.
It should be withdrawn by at least 3 cm so to avoid obstruction of the left main bronchus.
No pneumothorax has been generated.
Previously described extensive bilateral interstitial congestion and probably edema pattern remains.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old female with history of progressive interstitial lung disease, presents in respiratory distress, hypotension, and increased lethargy.
#Shock: Patient arrived hypotensive despite extensive IVF resuscitation and required dopamine via PIV.
Septic shock was the most likely etiology, given her respiratory symptoms prior to admission, but her skin was cool on exam and all cultures were negative.
With marked peripheral edema and cool extremities, we also considered cardiogenic shock, which was supported by an echocardiogram showing increased right-sided failure, confirmed on repeat echo.
She was covered broadly for infection with Cefepime and Vanco, with the addition of Azithromycin and Flagyl later in the hospitalization.
She was persistently tachycardic and started on metoprolol and diltiazem for control of her atrial fibrilliation/atrial flutter, without success.
The patient's blood pressure began to drop once again and she was placed on phenylephrine and eventually needed to be started on norepinephrine + vasopression with minimal effect.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure, in setting of ILD: At baseline, she is on 3L.
On admission, her respiratory status was close to baseline, but her progressive lung disease combined with the fluids she was given to support her blood pressures would intermittently put her into pulmonary edema.
Her oxygen requirement slowly climbed and her chest x-rays appeared to worsen, requiring intubation due to increased work of breathing, outstripping non-invasive ventilation.
# Altered mental status - She arrived quite lethargic, likely [**2-20**] to hypotension vs delirium.
# Thrombocytopenia / coagulopathy: She has a known history of thrombocytopenia, but was apparently not worked up before.
RUQ U/S showed an incidental finding of ?acalculous cholecystitis and IR was consulted.
They believed that the gallbladder wall was edematous, but not neccessarily indicative of acalculous cholecystitis and was likely secondary to her hypoalbuminemia and heart failure.
No intervention was performed.
# Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter: As described above in "Shock".
Tachycardia likely secondary to septic state.
