Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
Active intraluminal contrast extravasation within the distal descending colon.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Transcatheter Embolization [**2102-10-11**]  Successful coiling of area of active extravasation in a branch of the left colic artery.
Final arteriogram demonstrates no active extravasation.
Increased lung volumes, the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities have now completely resolved, except for small atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas.
No pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Echo [**2102-10-13**] e left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CTA Abd [**2102-10-13**] Active extravasation from the right femoral artery with extensive retroperitoneal hematoma.
Guide for Pseudoaneurysm Injection [**2102-10-13**] Extensive hematoma surrounding the right common femoral artery with a 1-cm pseudoaneurysm.
There were no immediate complications .
No findings of active bleeding within the bowel or adjacent to the previous pseudoaneurysm site with no residual filling of the pseudoaneurysm identified.
Significant interval decrease in size to the right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma with no new sites of bleeding.
Slightly increased size to small right pleural effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Unchanged infrarenal ectasia without aneurysmal dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with PMHx ?CAD, [**Age over 90 **] on aspirin and [**Age over 90 4532**], diverticulosis who presents from OSH with BRBPR.
# Acute blood loss anemia [**3-14**] lower GI bleeding: Patient received 2 units PRBC at [**Location (un) 620**], and HCT 41 to 40.
He went to IR where they were able to successfully coil a branch of his left colic artery and his repeat HCT was 32.
After discussion with his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4532**] was not restarted given [**Name10 (NameIs) **] greater than 10 years ago and GI bleed and frequent nose bleeds of greater concern.
# Femoral Artery pseudoaneurysm rupture: On ICU day 2, the patient became acutely hypotensive and complained of right hip pain.
His hematocrit was rechecked and found to be 23, he was given 2 units of PRBCS and sent for stat CT which showed a bleeding pseudoaneurysm which IR injected with thrombin.
On transfer to the floor on HD4, repeat HCT demonstrated significant drop to ~22.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1356**] was asymptomatic, vital signes were stable, femoral wound was tender but clean and dry without evidence of evolving hematoma.
Repeat CTA in the morning revealed no active bleeding and interval decrease in the size of the RP hematoma.
# Dyspnea: On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient required 4L02 (did not require any 02 at [**Location (un) 620**].
He received lasix 20mg IV with resolution of his symptoms.
He was weaned slowly from 02 and had an ECHO which showed EF 60-65%, severe MR (known from history), mild AS and mild/mod AR.
Elevation may have been in setting of acute volume depletion from blood loss.
Given 3 CTAs in several days, he was given Mucamyst [**Hospital1 **] and gentle IVF before his third CTA for renal protection.
Metamucil 0.52 g Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for treatment of a lower GI bleed.
You were subsequently found have developed bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm at the site where the interventional radiologists accessed your arteries.
