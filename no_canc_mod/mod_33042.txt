Right inferior axis.
Consider right ventricular hypertrophy or pulmonary disease.
Ventricular premature beats are new.
There is obscuration of the lateral left hemidiaphragm, unchanged since the prior study, which may be due to overlying soft tissue.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism in the first- to third-order pulmonary arteries, a segmental or distal pulmonary embolism cannot be confidently excluded due to suboptimal opacification and excessive image noise secondary to body habitus.
Right middle lobe 4-mm nodule stable since the CT of [**2133-8-11**], presumed benign , not requiring further CT surveillance.
CXR [**2136-4-25**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2136-4-23**] read in conjunction with yesterday's chest CTA:  Hazy opacification of the right lung has worsened; there is greater mediastinal vascular engorgement and probably new small left pleural effusion, all pointing toward cardiac decompensation.
Obscuration of the left heart border is probably a combination of pleural effusion and a large mediastinal fat collection seen on the chest CT. Heart is enlarged, probably progressively since [**4-23**].
The patient has an abnormal left first rib, probably originating from the cervical spine.
Blood cultures: 2/2 bottles of coag negative staph on [**2136-4-24**].
Brief Hospital Course: 52 yo M with dwarfism, hypertension and OSA with a past episode of respiratory failure requiring tach/PEG, presenting with acute respiratory failure due to a pneumonia with reactive airway disease with a course complicated by coag negative staph bacteremia.
The patient presented with cough, fever and respiratory distress.
He was weaned back to room air with overnight CPAP for known OSA at baseline.
The patient was found to have 2 bottles of positive blood cultures with a positive urine culture, all growing coag negative staph on [**2136-4-25**].
Given the growth of the bacteria in multiple sites and more than 1 blood culture bottle, this was treated as a probable real pathogen.
The patient continues on his home medications for hypertension and BPH.
