No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild global right ventricular hypokinesis.
LV apical hypokinesis is noted- the remaining left ventricular segments contract normally.The ascending thoracic aorta is normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Descending and ascending aorta without defect or flap dissection, aortic valve without AI.
[**2161-1-2**] CXR PA and lateral chest views obtained with patient in upright position demonstrate status post sternotomy and the presence of multiple surgical clips in the anterior mediastinum consistent with previous bypass surgery.
In addition 3 small ring-shaped metallic structures indicate the presence of a mitral valve prosthesis in appropriate position.
Comparison is made with the previous chest examination of [**2160-12-31**] at that time described persistent elevation of the right-sided hemidiaphragm and evidence of pleural thickening mostly on the right side remains rather unchanged.
He was started on heparin for his atrial fibrillation.
He was taken to the operating room  on [**2160-12-29**] where he underwent an MVR with a 27 mm [**Company **] mosaic tissue valve via a right thoracotomy.
He developed atrial fibrillation and flutter and coumadin was subsequently started.
