The pregnancy was complicated by vaginal bleeding and cervical diltation prompting admission to the [**Hospital6 256**] on [**2133-4-19**], for treatment with betamethasone and magnesium sulfate.
There was no evidence of infection.
The mother continued to have episodic vaginal bleeding and contractions which prompted delivery by cesarean section on [**2133-4-26**].
The infant emerged with spontaneous respirations, did require brief positive pressure ventilation, was intubated for respiratory distress in the delivery room.
On day of     life 34, she had a 3-day trial of continuous positive     airway pressure but was reintubated for work of breathing     and apnea.
She has required treatment for     apnea of prematurity with caffeine and this was     discontinued on [**7-16**].
Cardiovascular: [**Known lastname 12466**] presented with a murmur on day of     life 1.
An echocardiogram performed on [**2133-4-27**],     showed a moderate patent ductus arteriosus with left-to-     right flow.
Repeat echocardiogram on [**2133-4-29**],     showed a very small 1 mm patent ductus arteriosus.
On [**2045-7-25**] [**Known lastname 12466**] began to demonstrate elevated systolic     blood pressures from 98-110.
At this time UA was done and     was normal, BUN4, Cr 0.2 Na 138,K 5.4, Cl 108, bicarb 25     and renal ultrasound was normal, except for some minor     calcifications.
Serum electrolytes have been checked at     numerous junctures and have always been within normal     limits except for some early mild hyponatremia that was     treated with extra sodium supplementation.
Infectious disease: Due to her prematurity and the     unknown group B strep status of her mother, [**Name (NI) 12466**] was     evaluated for sepsis upon admission to the neonatal     intensive care unit.
Once again due to increased episodes of apnea,     she was evaluated for sepsis on day of life 35.
Gastrointestinal: [**Known lastname 12466**] required treatment for     unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
Ophthalmology: [**Known lastname 12466**]     has had numerous exams screening for retinopathy of     prematurity.
CARE RECOMMENDATIONS:       Iron and vitamin D supplementation: Iron supplementation     is recommended for preterm and low birth weight infants     until 12 months corrected age.
Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should     be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who     meet any of the following 4 criteria: 1) born at less     than 32 weeks, 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of     the following: Day care during RSV season, a smoker in     the household, neuromuscular disease, airway     abnormalities, or school-age siblings, 3) with chronic     lung disease, or 4) hemodynamically significant     congenital heart disease.
Respiratory distress syndrome status post treatment with     surfactant.
Anemia of prematurity.
Retinopathy of prematurity.
