Admission Date:  [**2180-11-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2180-11-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2110-1-30**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypercholesterolemia, family history of coronary artery disease, initially presented to outside cardiologist for intermittent substernal chest pain not related to exertion, no associated with dyspnea, who underwent left heart catheterization earlier on the day of admission at [**Hospital6 5016**] which revealed a complex 90% mid RCA occlusion.
The patient was sent to the CCU on an IV nitroglycerin drip for blood pressure control still with intermittent chest pain and nausea.
Partial hysterectomy.
No history of diabetes mellitus, type 2, or hypertension.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
Extremities:  Mild right lower extremity edema with varicosities.
Groin:  No bruits.
The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute, normal axis, intraventricular contractions present, 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in II, III, and aVF, downsloping ST depressions, and T wave inversions in I, aVL, and V2.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is a 70-year-old female status post mid RCA dissection with marginal left-to-right collateralization of the PDA territory with ongoing ischemia and nausea.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  PUMP:  The patient had cardiac enzymes cycled which revealed an elevated CK and troponin leak, peak CK was 867 consistent with an evolving inferior MI secondary to RCA occlusion.
This echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 45-55%, mild global left ventricular hypokinesis, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion.
The patient could not be started on a beta blocker secondary to hypotension.
RHYTHM:  The patient was kept on Telemetry to monitor for AV rupture and symptomatic bradycardia.
On the first day of the hospital course, the patient started to complain of positional fleeting chest pain under the left breast worsened with inspiration which was consistent with a picture of a pericarditis.
This pain was significantly relieved with Motrin.
We were reluctant to give Motrin secondary to the fear that the growing scar in the heart would be thinned and she would be more likely to have a ventricular rupture.
The patient eventually had to be disimpacted with successful stooling afterwards.
She was ready for discharge after PT evaluation said that she had no acute needs and needed regular cardiac rehab.
Status post inferior wall MI.
Acute pericarditis secondary to MI.
