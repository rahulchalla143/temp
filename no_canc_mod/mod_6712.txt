Admission Date:  [**2142-10-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-11-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2074-2-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiac Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68 year old gentleman who is status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2121**] with a five year history of exertional chest and throat discomfort.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization in [**2137**] which revealed patent bypass graft.
The patient underwent a follow up stress test in [**2142-5-22**] which showed ischemic ST changes.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization in [**2142-6-22**] which showed occluded vein grafts of the right coronary artery with native three vessel coronary artery disease and an ejection fraction of 33%.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for operative treatment.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus;  4.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease; 9.
Fish oil  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In the Intensive Care Unit the patient had several short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia for which he was started on Amiodarone infusion.
On the evening of postoperative day #1 into postoperative day #2 the patient became progressively hypoxic without improvement with diuretics, pain control or nebulizer treatment.
Prior to transfer the patient was found to be hypotensive and significantly hypoxic and was electively intubated prior to transfer.
Intubation was without complications.
Upon arrival to the Intensive Care Unit the patient underwent a bronchoscopy which showed normal mucosa, copious thin secretions and a small plug in the left lower lobe.
Chest x-ray after intubation showed diffuse interspace disease, right greater than left.
The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severely depressed left ventricular systolic function with ejection fraction of 20 to 25% with inferior akinesis, lateral hypokinesis, moderately depressed right ventricular systolic function, moderate mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation.
On postoperative day #4 pulmonary medicine consult was obtained due to the patient's continued respiratory failure, fevers of unknown origin and diffuse patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray, the Pulmonary Medicine Team's feelings were that the respiratory failure was either due to aspiration pneumonia or Amiodarone toxicity or atypical pneumonia.
Considering the present management, the patient was pancultured for his continued fever spikes of 102.
All of the cultures from that time were negative with the exception of a sputum sample done during bronchoscopy which was positive for Methicillin-sensitive Coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was minimal growth.
On postoperative day #4 the patient had a pulmonary artery catheter placed to rule out cardiogenic pulmonary edema that showed a cardiac output of 7.2 and a cardiac index of 3.17, SVR of 715.
The patient had no further atrial or ventricular ectopy.
The patient was weaning on the ventilator and had been weaned down to CPAP with pressure support, required Diamox for metabolic alkalosis.
A neurological consult was obtained which neurology felt that the majority of his problem was probably due to metabolic and infectious causes, however, felt that it could be due to a stroke and recommended an magnetic resonance imaging scan at a future date to further delineate this.
The patient continued to progress from a neurologic standpoint.
Duoderm was applied and subsequent skin care specialist evaluated the patient and felt that it was a Stage 2 ulcer and recommended continuing Duoderm.
Fever curve decreased by postoperative day #11, temperature maximum was 98.
The patient continued to have episodes of confusion and delirium, however, he was following commands and moving all extremities equally.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet without signs or symptoms of aspiration.
Heart regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
Extremities were warm and well perfused, no edema.
The pressure ulcer over the gluteal cleft is covered with Duoderm.
There is some mild erythema.
There is no fluctuance.
The sternal incision is clean and dry.
Coronary artery disease 2.
Postoperative respiratory failure due to Amiodarone toxicity versus aspiration pneumonia 4.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation 5.
Postoperative Stage 2 pressure ulcer on gluteal fold  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.
