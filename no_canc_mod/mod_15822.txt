Admission Date:  [**2147-10-2**]     Discharge Date: [**2147-10-6**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year-old Spanish speaking female with a history of hypertension, coronary angioplasty fifteen years ago who presented to an outside hospital with malaise, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and dizziness.
The patient reportedly had a V fibrillation arrest while in the waiting room of the Emergency Department.
The patient was defibrillated multiple times, intubated, with electrocardiogram showing anterior ST elevation.
Upon catheterization the patient was found to have a 100% occluded left anterior descending artery, which was stented, an 80% occluded obtuse marginal one, 80% occluded diagonal one, which was ballooned, a 30% ramus and a 90% right coronary artery, which was not intervened upon.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diverticulitis, catheterization fifteen years ago in [**Location 8398**]and esophageal stricture status post balloon dilatation, urinary retention status post surgery and poorly controlled hypertension.
Cardiovascular examination showed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, gallops or rubs were heard.
Lungs were diffusely rhonchi without wheezes.
Abdomen was soft and nondistended.
Extremities showed trace pretibial edema, 2+ femoral pulses bilaterally, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and no femoral bruits.
The electrocardiogram showed tachycardia at a rate of 142 with a normal axis and normal intervals.
ST elevations were 3 to 5 mm in V2 through V4 and there were Q waves in V1 through V3 with ST depressions of 1 mm in the inferior leads.
Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema in the bilateral upper lungs without effusions.
Her balloon pump was weaned off without complications.
Pulmonary wise the patient had a widened AA gradient and was therefore diuresed with Lasix.
In addition, the patient was felt to have an aspiration pneumonia and was started on Flagyl and Levofloxacin with the Flagyl being discontinued after one day and the Levofloxacin being continued for the course of the stay in the hospital.
Late during day one on admission the patient went into complete heart block with ventricular response in the 40s and a blood pressure drop from 130 systolic to 90 systolic.
This occurred without complications.
On day three of admission the patient was taken back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory originally for intervention on the right coronary artery, however, the right coronary artery had a 50% ostial and a 70% posterior descending artery lesion that was not treated.
However, the left circumflex showed an 80% lesion and was stented.
The patient was found to have a decreasing hematocrit on and off over the course of the hospital stay for which several units of packed red blood cells were given.
The patient was found to be guaiac positive without any gross bleeding.
In addition, there was concern of bleeding in the pericardium as well as a retroperitoneal bleed after the second catheterization on day three of hospitalization.
At the time of this dictation there was no obvious source of bleeding based on echocardiogram and overall clinical picture.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Large anterior myocardial infarction.
