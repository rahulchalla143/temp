Admission Date:  [**2102-2-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-3-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2025-1-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory Distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubated.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male with past medical history of lung cancer status post resection, hypertension, DVT on coumadin, and prostate disease who presented with respiratory distress.
Per the chart, around 4:00 PM he was noted to be pale and have increasing respiratory distress.
He was given rocoronim and intubated due to inability to protect his airway and hypoxia.
Due to his unresponsiveness, a head CT was completed, which was negative for an acute process on preliminary read.
A chest x-ray was also completed which demonstrated right middle and lower lobe collapse versus infiltrate.
They provided additional history that he had been living alone in an apartment until relatively recently when he sustained a fall and was not found until several days later.
He was then admitted, and was discovered to have a DVT, as well as a small fracture in his leg.
Possible slight cough recently, no fevers or chills.

Family History: Possible history of heart disease  Physical Exam: Gen: Unable to speak, on ventilator, awake follows simple commands, unable to communicate using letter board.
HEENT: Tracheostomy in place, no icterus, multiple erythematous scaling plaques on face.
Heart: RRR, distant heart sounds Lungs: Clear anteriorly Abd: Soft, NT, Obese, BS+ Ext: Trace pitting edema bilaterally  Pertinent Results: [**2102-2-16**] 04:44AM BLOOD CK-MB-20* MB Indx-15.3* cTropnT-0.82* [**2102-2-16**] 12:50PM BLOOD CK-MB-11* MB Indx-15.7* cTropnT-0.56* [**2102-2-16**] 09:55PM BLOOD CK-MB-5 cTropnT-0.54* [**2102-2-16**] 04:44AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-131 [**2102-2-16**] 12:50PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-70 [**2102-2-16**] 09:55PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-37* [**2102-2-27**] 03:50PM BLOOD Type-[**Last Name (un) **] Temp-37.0 Rates-/33 FiO2-50 pO2-43* pCO2-66* pH-7.34* calTCO2-37* Base XS-6 Intubat-NOT INTUBA .
No pneumothorax is noted.
Moderate atherosclerotic calcification and plaque of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
Focal parenchymal consolidation of the right lung, centered at the right hilus, adjacent to the surgical bed.
Scattered airspace nodules in the right middle lobe are also consistent with infection.
However, underlying lesion in the surgical bed cannot be ruled out, and followup to resolution is recommended following appropriate antibiotic therapy.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
No PE or dissection.
Choledocholithiasis with numerous calcified stones within the distal common bile duct.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Moderate left pleural effusion, trace right pleural effusion.
Rectus diastasis without ventral hernia.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm 3 cm.
Left UPJ obstruction versus multiple parapelvic cysts.
Soft tissue in the right hilar region in the post surgical bed for lung carcinoma may reflect standard post surgical change however recurrence cannot be excluded on this non-contrast enhanced study.
Right pleural thickening could also be properly evaluated if concern for recurrence exists.
Sinus rhythm.
Right axis deviation.
Right bundle-branch block.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No acute intracranial process.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Soft tissue density over the left (greater than right) occiput suggests trauma, clinically correlate.
Echo [**2102-2-22**]: Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-2-3**], no definite change.
No ascites is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 77 year old male with past medical history of lung cancer, DVT, and hypertension who presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness.
Respiratory distress: It is not entirely clear by history what precipitated respiratory decompensation.
A bronch was done which showed purulent secretions in RUL w/ plugging and scattered secretions entire R side.
A CTA was also done was negative for PE but showed a right hilar consildation, bilateral pleural effusion.
On [**2-15**] he developed a PNA by CXR and he was treated for a HAP.
His sputum grew Klebsiella ESBL and he was started on meropenem and treated for a total of 8 days.
He had a trial on trach collar on [**2-27**] which he tolerated for 1.5 hours and it was then discontinued given that he was tachypnic and tachycardic.
Patient was evaluated by the Neuromuscular team with EMG and it is thought that his failure to wean from the ventilator may be related to a critical care myopathy.
A c-spine MRI was done to look for a possible lesion and was negative for cord compression but did demonstrate mild degenerative changes.
He will need trach downsizing prior to use of a speaking valve.
Altered mental status: It is difficult to know if his altered mental status is simply related to hypoxia or if there was an event leading to his respiratory distress.
A head CT was negative for an acute process.
On [**2-28**] an EEG was done for concern of still having alterned mental status.
History of lung cancer (NSCLC): Per family, patient did not have regular follow up with his oncologist.
At one point he became bradycardic to the 50s with SBP in the 60s after his ET tube was adjusted.
Metoprolol was later discontinued as detailed below under bradycardia section.
# Renal insufficiency: His creatinine was elevated to 1.7 and his FeUrea was prerenal.
Later during his admission he developed hematuria in with clots and a triple lumen was placed and CBI was initiated.
He had been on heparin and coumadin for question of DVT at the OSH which was held.
# Choledocholithiasis:  Patient's CT abdomen on [**2-18**] was noted to have Choledocholithiasis with numerous calcified stones within the distal common bile duct without any intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
If patient becomes febrile again, will need to consider patient's biliary tract as a source for infection.
# Elevated LFTs: Unknown baseline, ALT elevated at admission, lipase just slightly above normal.
# Bradycardia: He was borderline bradycardic on admission.
Patient was noted on the AM of [**3-3**] to have two episodes of Second Degree Mobitz type II heart block.
Patient was evaluated by EP and deemed that further intervention would not be appropriate given his other co-morbidites and that this was an isolated event.
Originally it was thought the patient may be on a low dose BB given that he is post NSTEMI, however he had another episode of bradycardia to the 30s and after discussion with EP it was decided that he should not be on a b-blocker.
# A fib: The patient had new A fib but not with RVR.
Spoke with EP who recommended against anticoagulation given this recent bleed while on anticoagulation.
# s/p NSTEMI:  He had an NSTEMI which was confirmed by his enzymes the day after he failed his second extubation.
