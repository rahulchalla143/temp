History of Present Illness: 66yo left-handed man with recent R MCA stroke and multiple vascular risk factors presents with difficulty seeing, change in personality, and lethargy.
She asked him what was wrong and he complained of a headache on the right side of his head behind his ear.
He was having difficulty "seeing" - for example, he would have to feel around on the table for his fork.
He dropped a spoon and potato and had difficulty finding them.
He had difficulty telling time, difficulty with the big and little hand - thought 20 of 5 was 20 past 8.
He has had a recent stroke for which he presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with acute onset dysarthria and left facial droop, left hand weakness.
Past Medical History: R M1 segment MCA stroke [**7-/2111**] with residual left facial droop, left hand weakness/stiffness, mild dysarthria hyperlipidemia hypertension diabetes, diagnosed [**8-/2111**], initially diet controlled w/ FS 100s, last A1C 6.8, started on metformin h/o tobacco use, quit after stroke [**7-/2111**] s/p tonsillectomy   Social History: tob 2.5ppd x 50yrs, h/o heavy EtOH use, "in recovery" 21yrs, no drug use, married   Family History: mother died age 66, had HTN, stroke; father died age 87   Physical Exam: VS: T 97.8, HR 51, Bp 116/64, RR 16, SaO2 99%/RA Genl: NAD HEENT: NCAT, MMM, OP clear, left [**Doctor First Name 2281**] with brown in left upper quadrant, eyes otherwise blue Neck: supple, no bruits CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g Chest: CTAB Abd: soft, NTND, BS+ Ext: warm and dry  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
Mild dysarthria.
No right-left confusion.
No evidence of apraxia.
Left visual neglect.
Cannot copy complex picture (draws left side of leftmost shape, with extensive spiral coming from it as squiggle, but nothing else to the right.
Left inferior quadrantonopia.
Mild L facial droop.
Palate elevation symmetric.
Motor: Normal bulk and increased tone bilaterally.
Left pronator drift.
There is left ventricular hypertrophy.
Multiple chronic lacunes.
Findings consistent with embolus completely occluding the proximal right MCA.
Substantial focal narrowing of the basilar artery, presumably due to atheromatous disease.
Substantial calcification of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally in the cavernous sinus, and at the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries bilaterally.
60 percent stenosis of the right common carotid artery at the bifurcation.
No stenosis seen on the left.
MRI/A BRAIN [**2111-12-4**]: MRI Head: Right middle cerebral artery inferior division infarction similar to the appearance on the recent CT examinations.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
Small bilateral occipital lobe infarctions suggesting basilar artery disease, likely embolic to the top of the basilar.
MRA appears similar to the CTA with a severe stenosis of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery as well as severe narrowing and irregularity of the basilar artery.
Through the sheath, we now advanced [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2 catheter into the aortic arch from where the left vertebral artery, the right internal carotid artery and the right common carotid artery was catheterized and AP lateral filming done.
Following this, the patient was found to have a completely occluded right middle cerebral artery in the M1 region with very minimal stenosis of his right internal carotid artery.
The left common carotid artery was not catheterized as we felt that this was not necessary as the CT angiogram had supplied us with enough information.
FINDINGS The left vertebral artery arteriogram demonstrates filling of the left vertebral artery with minimal stenosis at the origin.
There is a very significant basilar stenosis which is about 80% just distal to the vert confluence.
The right common carotid artery arteriogram demonstrates 20% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery just distal to the bifurcation.
The right external carotid artery has about 80% stenosis at the origin.
Right internal carotid artery arteriogram demonstrates normal filling of the right internal carotid artery along the cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid portion.
There is no antegrade flow.
There is a large area of hypoperfusing area in the superior division of the middle cerebral artery.
There is significant pial collateralization through the divisions of the anterior cerebral artery.
There is also significant disease in the anterior cerebral artery with the proximal anterior cerebral arteries rather dilated, leading one to conclude that the MCA occlusion may be longstanding.
The common femoral artery arteriogram demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic disease with no significant stenosis seen.
IMPRESSION: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 23203**] underwent cerebral arteriography for possible right ICA and right middle cerebral artery stenting, however the right MCA was seen to be chronically occluded and the right ICA did not have significant stenosis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is diffuse thickening of the left atrial anterior wall, abutting the posterior aortic root, and extending to the basal portion of the interatrial septum (?
.. [**2111-12-7**]:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The lung bases show mild dependent hypoventilatory change.
There is an area of equivocal differential attenuation in the region of the origin of the right inferior pulomnary vein in the left atrium, for which adherent thrombus cannot be excluded.
The intra- abdominal loops of large and small bowel maintain a normal caliber without evidence of obstruction.
Scattered colonic diverticuli are present without evidence of diverticulitis.
No free fluid, free air or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
Atherosclerotic calcification is seen involving the abdominal aorta and branch vessels.
HIgh attenuation material is seen within the gallbladder likely representing vicarious excretion of contrast.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
No free fluid or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
There is a large right groin intramuscular hematoma extending down to the mid thigh and involving various compartments of the anterior thigh.
No evidence of retroperitoneal extension of the hematoma.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.
Massive intramuscular hematoma extending from the right groin into the mid thigh and involving various compartments of the anterior thigh.
An equivocal area of differential attenuation is seen in the region of the origin of the right inferior pulmonary vein in the left atrium for which adherent thrombus cannot be excluded.
Given history of CVA, does patient have recent echocardiography?
The common femoral artery is patent with a triphasic waveform.
Probable irregular supraventricular rhythm with fairly organized atrial activity, probably atrial fibrillation with a single ventricular premature beat.
There is borderline voltage for left ventricular hypertrophy in lead aVL.
Precordial voltage is also increased but probably does not meet criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: This 66 year old gentleman with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM2 and recent right MCA stroke, was readmitted for right MCA stroke on [**12-3**].
During this admission, he was found on MRI/MRA to have severe stenosis of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with recurrent MCA stroke.
He underwent angiography which showed total occlusion of right MCA with some collateral circulation and with stenosis of the basilar artery.
His hematoma has been progressively enlarging and heparin gtt was discontinued; he received 5mg PO vitamin K. Vascular surgery was consulted and right groin U/S revealed pseudoaneurysm.
He received only approximately 150cc prbcs on [**2111-12-9**] after which time transfusion was stopped due to fever (no rash, hives, etc).
He was given 3 units pRBC and the following morning underwent repair of R femoral pseudoaneurysm by vascular surgery.
He had no further signs of bleeding and his blood pressure and hypertension remained under good control.
# New atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: Etiology not entirely clear, but differential broad.
Despite continued hct drop/volume status, appears slightly hypovolemic->euvolemic; currently getting prbcs.
Does not appear to have infection to suggest as underlying cause.
Although less frequently ischemic arrhythmia, may be in his case given his anemia (last hct prior to tx 26.6).
In review of imaging there is some ?
undocumented h/o a.fib vs. etiology of current a. fib if has know atrial dilatation and now w/ ?
atrial thrombus.
Echo suggested that atrial clot was less likely than lipomatous hypertrophy.
EKG with rate related ST depressions which improved with decreased rate.
Transfusion reaction was explored and determined that he did have a mild reaction to the blood he received.
Echo [**12-10**] again showed "There is diffuse thickening of the left atrial anterior wall, abutting the posterior aortic root, and extending to the basal portion of the interatrial septum (?
He will need to be monitored for bleeding closely.
# Hct drop: No other clear source of bleed beyond known right groin pseudoaneurysm and marked hematoma extending from groin to distal anterior thigh.
# S/P recurrent Right MCA stroke: MRI/MRA to have severe stenosis of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery as well as severe narrowing and irregularity of the basilar artery, right middle cerebral artery inferior division without evidence of hemorrhage, small bilateral occipital lobe infarctions suggesting basilar artery disease, likely embolic to the top of the basilar.
# HTN: Home dose labetalol has been held in the setting of his significant hct drop.
Blood pressure was stabilized and he was discharged on alternate antihypertensives that were short-acting, and had some rate control properties.
# F/E/N: Receiving prbcs currently.
