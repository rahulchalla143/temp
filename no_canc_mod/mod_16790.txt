Admission Date:  [**2184-8-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2184-8-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2127-7-27**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU [**Location (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 57 year old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary atresia on home oxygen, found unresponsive by brother at home on [**2184-8-11**] in AM.
The patient had reported increased shortness of breath times several days prior to admission.
The night prior to admission the patient reported to brother that he had some shortness of breath but thought that he would be "okay."
In the Emergency Department the patient was unresponsive and so was intubated for airway protection.
Computerized tomography scan of his head at the outside hospital was negative for an acute bleed.
The patient had a CTA at the outside hospital which was read as positive for segmental pulmonary embolism.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for further care including evaluation for an inferior vena cava filter.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen, 1 to 2 liters per minute, history of multiple prior intubations; 2.
Cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 20% and history of congestive heart failure; 3.
Prior inferior myocardial infarction; 4.
Status post right lacunar cerebrovascular accident with residual left upper extremity weakness; 5.
Atrial fibrillation; 6.
Peptic ulcer disease, diagnosed in [**2181**]; 10.
Idiopathic polyneuropathy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pinpoint pupils, oral mucosa moist without lesions, elevated jugulovenous distension.
Cardiac:  Irregularly irregular, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary: Diffuse expiratory wheezes and squeaks with a prolonged inspiratory to expiratory ratio, no crackles or rhonchi appreciated.
Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally.
Skin:  No skin breakdown or rash noted.
Urinalysis, large blood, trace ketones, 12 to 50 red blood cells, no white blood cells or bacteria.
No ischemic changes.
Pulmonary - The patient was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation for inferior vena cava filter placement for suspected pulmonary embolism in the setting of Coumadin taken for atrial flutter.
Repeat CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
It also showed pulmonary atresia involving the left upper lobe and diffuse emphysematous changes.
The patient was also continued on intravenous Solu-Medrol for suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
As the congestive heart failure may be a component in the patient's respiratory failure, the patient's Lasix was restarted and gentle diuresis was performed.
However, there was a cardiogenic component.
In order to achieve increased inotrope a trial of Dobutamine was begun, however, the patient did not tolerate this with elevated heartrate in the 150s to 160s.
Cardiovascular - Given the patient's history of cardiomyopathy with prior inferior myocardial infarction, the patient had cardiac enzymes cycled.
Elevated creatinine kinase was felt secondary to muscle breakdown as the patient was found down.
The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2184-8-12**] which showed an ejection fraction of 10 to 15% with a dilated left atrium, right atrium and left ventricle.
There was mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis with 1+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter throughout the hospital stay.
The patient had several episodes of ventricular response.
for afterload reduction.
The patient had a small degree of hematuria likely secondary to Foley catheter trauma, there were no other clear sources of bleeding.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair, continuing blood loss is not occurring.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation 2.
Congestive heart failure 4.
Atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation 6.
Peptic ulcer disease 8.
