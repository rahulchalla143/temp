Admission Date:  [**2104-2-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-2-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2023-5-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Melena  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 80 y/o French/Creole-speaking female with a hx of GI bleed, fairly recent diagnosis of HepC cirrhosis c/b grade I esophageal varices and ascites, who within the 2-3 days prior to admission had been having SOB and melanotic stools.
Her presenting diagnosis was new ascites.
During that time, she had an EGD which showed grade I varices.
Colonoscopy was limited due to poor prep, but no obvious sites of bleeding were noted.
Hep C VL at that time was noted to be 428K.
Past Medical History: HTN CVA DM (on oral hypoglcemics) COPD urinary retention (recent indwelling foley) GI bleeding requiring transfusion  Social History: Lives with daughter.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: V: Tm 97.7 HR 55 BP 127/98 R12 O2sat 100%RA Gen: elderly female who appears lethargic in NAD HEENT: no conjunctival pallor, dried blood in nares, MM dry, OP clear CV: Normal S1, S2, RRR, II/VI HSM along LUSB Pulm: CTA-anteriorly Abd: +BS, no guarding, no rebound tenderness, no fluid wave Ext: 2+DP b/l, no cce   Pertinent Results: CXR [**2103-2-1**] CHEST AP: Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
Upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature is seen with hilar congestion and mild cardiomegaly representing persistent failure.
EKG Sinus bradycardia at 50bpm, TWF V4-V6 (unchanged from prior), poor R wave progression (unchanged from prior) .
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old female with MMP including Hep C, GIB, who presents with GIB.
GIB: Likely upper GI bleed given melena and probably from esophageal varices.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit where she was monitored with serial Hcts and vitals were checked for hemodynamic instability.
Additionally, Nadolol for the esophageal varices and Lasix for ascites were added on.
Careful attention was paid to not only the blood pressure but the patient's heart rate while on these medications as she was noted to have asymptomatic bradycardia while sleeping.
This was continued on discharge for a total of 14 days, since it was associated with a foley.
Hep C: Patient with known cirrhosis and grade 1 varices, viral of 428,000.
While patient was admitted previously for ascites, there was no evidence of ascites on exam during this hospitalization.
Otherwise, no active issues for Hepatitis C during this hospitalization.
DM2: The patient's diabetes was monitored and treated with QID fingersticks and an Insulin sliding scale.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1)  Inhalation q4-6 hours PRN as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Secondary Hepatitis C associated liver cirrhosis Renal insufficiency Urinary Tract Infection Ascites History of lower GI bleed Gastritis Grade I esophageal varices Type 2 diabetes mellitus Hypertension Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease CVA DM2   Discharge Condition: Stable with appropriate follow-up.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen and evaluated for concern of bleeding in your digestive tract.
An option of having endoscopy (placing a camera down into your stomach to look for a source of bleeding) was offered, but given your initial unstable state and a risk of having to be intubated (having a breathing tube placed into your throat and lungs) per the request of your daughter, the decision was made to hold off on endoscopy.
* Call your doctor or go to the ER for any of the following: vomiting   blood, blood in your stool or dark, black stools, lightheadedness,   palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers/chills,   nausea/vomiting or any other concerning symptoms.
