There is no new area of intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no edema, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct.
Assessment of bony structures demonstrates extensive left facial fractures, better delineated on the concurrently obtained facial bone CT. Mastoid air cells are well aerated.

A left brow laceration was thoroughly washed out and then sutured while in the ED by Trauma staff.
Patient was evaluated by Ophthalmology service who found no evidence of muscle entrapment or open globe or intraocular involvement.
Patient was evaluated by Plastic Surgery service who felt that facial fractures, specifically the left ZMC and orbital floor fractures, needed surgical repair.
Neurosurgery signed off and cleared patient for facial fracture repair.
