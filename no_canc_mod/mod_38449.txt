Heart had first heart sound and second heart sound.
There was no stepoff noted on his back examination.
A CAT scan of the head was significant for a right subdural hematoma, right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and left intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
A renal consultation at that time was called and deemed that the patient was in likely congestive heart failure and required aggressive diuresis.
Despite large doses of Lasix, the patient was unresponsive as far as urine output goes, and Nephrology decided then to put the patient on continuous venovenous hemofiltration so he could get some of his fluid off.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Severe intracranial hemorrhage which included a right subdural hematoma, right intraparenchymal hematoma, and a left intraparenchymal hematoma.
Also, on a repeat CAT scan, the patient was noted to have bilateral infiltrates consistent with bilateral pneumonia.
It was likely that the cause of the patient's demise was severe sepsis secondary to his pneumonia.
