He reports substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm associated with nauseas and dyspnea began last night at rest around 3AM.
EKG with HR 71, V-paced, left axis, no obvious ST segment changes.
Patient was given aspirin 325mg and sublingual nitroglycerin with resolution of pain initially.
Then patient developed chest pain again with telemetry showing wide complex tachycardia with rate in the 130s.
Carotid sinus massage was attempted w/o success.
So given concern for ventricular tachycardia patient is being taken to the EP lab for investigation.
In the cath lab, he was noted to have 3 foci for inducible VT, but the culprit focus for causing his current VT was ablated.
In ICU, he was noted to be in no acute distress, in good spirit, chest pain free.
Not reporting any dizziness or lightheadedness.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
man w/ PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG x2, ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p ICD (EF 20-25%), s/p ICD for inducible VT who presented w/ CP that initially resolved w/ SL NTG, had episode of CP while in the ED went into a wide-complex tachycardia and now presents to the CCU after EP ablation of VT focus  #Ventricular tachycardia - Pt came to the ED reporting chest pain and was found to have an episode of VT while in the emergency room.
In the CCU, he remained hemodynamically stable and did not have any recurrent episodes of VT on telemetry.
#Diabetes - Pt had history of "diet controlled" diabetes.
His blood sugars were severely elevated to the 400-500 range at presentation.
At discharge, he has been started on glipizide 5mg daily and he has been arranged follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] soon after discharge (we chose to avoid metformin as a first [**Doctor Last Name 360**] because of elevated creatinine).
#UTI - UA was very suggestive of UTI with WBC >182.
UCx showed coag-negative staph.
He has a few episodes of CP which were brief and reported to be similar to what he experiences at home.
He did not have any EKG changes and did not require ntg after arrival to the CCU.
#Chronic systolic CHF (EF=20-25%) - He appeared euvolumic at admission with only trace LE edema and no evidence of pulmonary edema on exam.
These were held at discharge because he appeared volume depleted after being NPO for the EP procedure and subsequently having poor PO intake.
#Hypertension - BP remained well controlled, continued on home metoprolol and isosorbide dinitrate.
#Chronic kidney disease - Cr remained at baseline during admission.
-Stopped amiodarone -Will follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **] regarding poorly controlled diabetes -Will continue cefpodoxime for UTI after discharge  Medications on Admission: 1. amiodarone 200 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) alternating with one tablet every 7 days.
