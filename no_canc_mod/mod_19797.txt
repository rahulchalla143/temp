Admission Date:  [**2168-1-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-1-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 23009**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization [**2168-1-16**]  History of Present Illness: 89yo female with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate, history of anemia, and history of low back pain who presents with arm and throat pain.
The patient was in her usual state of health until 6pm yesterday when she developed sudden onset of arm pain associated with a sore throat.
This was not associated with diaphoresis, chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath.
She received aspirin, heparin gtt and SL nitro with some relief of her symptoms and was taken to the cath lab.
Cath demonstrated an occlusion of a small OM branch of LCx so no intervention was performed.
The patient remains chest pain free but has persistent arm and throat pain that is much improved from prior to arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
On review of systems, she denies any deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Anemia - Pancreatic cyst - Bursitis of right shoulder - Left and right total hip replacement ([**2161**], [**2149**]) - Rheumatoid arthritis - Ovarian cyst - Monoclonal gammopathy - Osteoporosis - Lacunar stroke [**2159**] - Rosacea - Type II DM - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Migraines  Social History: Lives with son and daughter-in-law in [**Name (NI) 4628**].
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Crackles clear w deep breath.
CV: RRR no murmurs rubs or gallops ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended, BS normoactive.
EXT: wwp, no edema.
R groin with mild ecchymoses.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a mid 30-40% lesion involving D1.
The RCA was a large vessel that had a 40-50% lesion at the ostium, as well as a 50% lesion distally.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic systolic arterial pressures, with a central aortic pressure of 135/59, mean 66 mmHg.
One vessel coronary artery disease - lateral STEMI likely due to occluded small OM branch of LCx.
Systemic systolic arterial normotension.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal half of the anterolateral wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (LCX or Diagonal distribution).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 89yo female with multiple cardiac risk factors admitted with ST-elevation MI.
#.CAD: Patient with ST-elevation MI, found to have occlusion of small OM branch during cath.
No intervention was indicated at the time of the procedure.
After procedure she was chest pain free but initially reported mild left arm/shoulder pain which resolved.
Post-cath echo showed normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction (LVEF 55%) c/w CAD (LCX or Diagonal distribution) amd mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Most likely etiology is post-STEMI inflammation causing cytokine release resulting in fever, as can occur in the natural history of myocardial infarction when no intervention occurs.
# Pulmonary nodule: CXR showed incidental right upper lung opacity approximately 11 x 7 mm in diameter, slightly increased in size since previous study.
4. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check Chem-7 on Friday [**1-22**] with results to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2563**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2564**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2258**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: ST elevation Myocardial Infarction Hypertension Diabetes mellitus Dyslipidemia Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You experienced several hours of left arm pain and sore throat at home and your family brought you to the Emergency Department (ED) at [**Hospital1 18**].
In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG was completed and it indicated that you had a Myocardial Infacrtion (MI), also known as a heart attack.
You were then taken to the cardiac catherization lab and a blockage of a small OM branch of the left circumflex artery was seen.
