Admission Date:  [**2139-8-25**]     Discharge Date: [**2139-9-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-6-22**]     Sex:  M  Service:  INPATIENT MEDICINE/[**Hospital1 212**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old male with insulin dependent diabetes status post renal transplant in [**2133**] now failing, also status post right tib-fib fracture.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and his Renal doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**], and was complaining of increasing discharge from the right leg two wound sites on the knee and on the ankle.
A swab was taken at that time which grew gram-negative rods, which turned out to be Klebsiella that was sensitive to levofloxacin.
Patient, hence, did not report any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
Peripheral vascular disease diagnosed three years ago status post lower extremity bypass done by Vascular Surgery.
End-stage renal disease status post failing transplant since pyelonephritis one year ago.
Neuropathy status post right fifth toe amputation and partial left foot amputation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Status post right tib-fib fracture with an ORIF with removal of infected rod in 06/[**2138**].
In general, the patient is a thin male in no acute distress.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no rales or rhonchi.
Left foot has partial amputation.
Patient has an external fixator in place in the right lower extremity with foul smelling purulent discharge from the wound in the right ankle and the right knee.
LABORATORIES ON [**8-19**]:  Patient has a wound culture that grew Klebsiella sensitive to levofloxacin.
White count of 12.8 with no left shift.
Patient has an albumin of 3.7, calcium 9.1, and a phosphorus of 5.9.
On hospital day two, Vascular Surgery debrided the wound at the bedside and sent repeat cultures.
On [**8-28**], the Ortho attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] came to see the patient and presented the option of amputation versus debridement.
Tissue and bone cultures grew out gram-positive cocci, coag-negative gram-positive cocci, and gram-negative rods not Pseudomonas.
Renal:  The patient has a failing kidney transplant.
He was assessed by Transplant Surgery and will follow up with them as an outpatient for likely hemodialysis access.
and then further increased later due to continual increased phosphate to 1 mcg q.d.
Diabetes:  Patient's diabetes is very difficult to control and fluctuates widely between very hyperglycemic in the 300s to hypoglycemic down to the 50s with mental status changes and confusion.
On [**8-28**], patient had an episode of low blood sugar down to 40 with shaking and unresponsiveness.
This was treated with D50 and a decrease in his sliding scale.
Patient continued to have episodes of mild hypoglycemia until [**9-4**], at which point the adjustments in his NPH insulin, regular insulin-sliding scale were such that he no longer had episodes of severe hypoglycemia.
Vomiting:  Patient had occasional episodes of vomiting throughout the hospitalization with immediate relief after vomiting.
Patient's vomiting is likely due to mild degree of gastroparesis.
On [**9-4**], the patient had an episode of vomiting in the evening and was given Phenergan.
Patient then became agitated and aggressive.
The day following this episode, the patient was back to baseline mental status with no further episodes of aggression or agitation.
The agitation was likely secondary to Phenergan and Phenergan was avoided for the remainder of the hospitalization.
