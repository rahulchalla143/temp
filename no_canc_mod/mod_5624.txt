The abdominal distention got worse over the next few days and the patient went to an outside hospital.
She was found to have a large sigmoid filled with air and a sigmoidoscopy was performed with partial relief of obstruction.
However, on the day prior to transfer the patient had increasing distention and worsening of her abdominal pain, therefore she was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for management of her sigmoid volvulus.
The patient also noted a history of nausea and vomiting with no fevers or chills.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, history of upper GI bleed after non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Her blood pressure was elevated at 170/80.
Her abdomen was distended, tympanitic with no guarding no focal tenderness.
Her rectal examination she was guaiac negative with no masses.
KUBs were done, which showed significant sigmoid volvulus and was unimproved after the sigmoidoscopy, therefore it was decided that the patient would be taken emergently to the Operating Room for a sigmoid colectomy and end colostomy.
The patient required fluid boluses for low urine output, but her urine output slowly improved.
She continued to improve and her white count stayed elevated, therefore a chest x-ray was done to rule out pneumonia.
The patient was able to be weaned off of her oxygen and did well from a pulmonary standpoint.
The intrastromal nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] for management and changing of her stoma bag.
