Admission Date:  [**2137-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-6-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: Anterior ST segment myocardial infarction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary artery catheterization and angioplasty of left anterior descending artery to the right coronary artery Intraaortic Balloon Pump support Swan-Ganz catheterization  Catherization results: .
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease in this left dominant circulation.
The LCX had a distal tubular stenosis.
The RCA had a proximal 80% stenosis and was a non-dominant vessel.
Resting hemodynamics from right heart catheterization demonstrated severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP=17mmHg and mean PCWP=33mmHg).
Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension was present (64/31).
PCI of the LAD and diagonal complicated by distal embolization into the diagonal.
The LAD had a 20% residual stenosis with distal TIMI 2 flow and poor myocardial perfusion at the end of the procedure.
Anterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.
Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
Cardiogenic shock with placement of intra-aortic balloon assist device.
History of Present Illness: This is an 83 male with a history of  hypertension, atrial fibrillation, subdural hematoma ('[**30**] on coumadin), who presented to an outside hospital  20 hours after the onset of substernal chest pain.
An EKG performed at the time showed ST segment elevation in V4-V5, Q waves in leads II, III, avF, and atrial fibrillation.
The patient received sublingual nitroglycerin X3 with no alleviation of chest pain.
Cardiac enzymes at the time showed an elevated CK of 2519.
A stent was not placed due to low residual flow.
At the time the patient was found to have a low cardiac index of 1.3.
Past Medical History: - CAD (unclear history) - Atrial fibrillation - Hypertension - Subdural Hematoma (s/p trauma on coumadin '[**30**])   Social History: Lives with wife, quit tobacco  Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Admission VS: 93 144/71 (PA 58/26) 14 96% 2L Gen: NAD, lying in bed HEENT: neck supple, 7cm JVD Heart: nl rate, irreg rhythm (Atrial fibrillation), S1S2, no G/M/R Lungs: crackles at the bases Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, +BS; slight discomfort due to IABP R Groin: femoral pulse present, no bruits, no ecchymosis Extremities: feet cold, DP appreciated bilaterally with doppler; no c/c/e Neuro: II-XII grossly intact   Pertinent Results: Cardiac Enzymes .

* Pump: Given cardiac index of 1.3 in cath lab, IABP was placed for optimization of systolic and diastolic pressures.
Echocardiogram revealed EF<20%, 1+ MR, 1+ TR and global hypokinesis.
Lisinopril was initiated for afterload reduction, and at the time of discharge, was uptitrated to 7.5mg QD.
Despite poor ejection fraction, patient was considered extremely poor candidate for anticoagulation given history of subdural hematoma.
CK peaked at 4538, MB >500 on the evening of hospital day one consistent with transmural infarction.
Patient tolerated these medications without evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or other site of bleeding.
Patient remained chest pain free throughout hospitalization.
* Urinary Tract Infection: Patient had a low grade fever (100.5) on hospital day four, and urinalysis revealed sm leuk esterase w/ few bacteria.
* Dehydration: Patient was initially diuresed aggressively given cardiogenic shock, however, near the time of discharge, patient had mild bump in creatinine (chronic renal insufficiency Cr 1.1-1.2) to 1.5, and urine lytes revealed prerenal (UOsm [**Telephone/Fax (1) 63454**] mg/dL UCreat 86 mg/dL USodium 15 mEq/L).
Patient was given 250cc NS for hydration and encouraged to take more PO fluids.
At the time of discharge, patient continued to have mild ambulatory desaturations and exhaustion after minimal exertion, and was therefore referred to short term inpatient rehabilitation.

Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: You must call 911 first if you experience any chest pain or chest pressure, if you become short of breath, or if you experience any numbness, tingling or pain radiating to your jaw or arms/hands.
