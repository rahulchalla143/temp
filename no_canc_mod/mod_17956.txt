Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 70939**] Admission Date: [**2186-12-15**] Discharge Date: [**2186-12-25**] Date of Birth:  [**2186-12-15**] Sex:  F Service:  Neonatology   ID/CC:  [**Female First Name (un) **] was delivered at 28 5/7 weeks and was admitted to the newborn ICU for management of prematurity and respiratory distress syndrome of prematurity.
MATERNAL HISTORY:  The mother is a 35-year-old G1, para 0 to 1 woman with past medical history notable for hypertension, nephrolithiasis status post stent placement, and recent sinusitis treated with azithromycin.
Rupture of membranes occurred at delivery and yielded clear amniotic fluid.
There was no labor and no intrapartum fever or other clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis.
Facial CPAP administered for mild to moderate intercostal retractions.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Preterm infant on warmer with moderate respiratory distress.
Chest: Mild to moderate intercostal retractions, fair breath sounds bilaterally, no adventitious sounds.
She was started on caffeine citrate for     apnea of prematurity.
On day of life 3, she developed a spontaneous left sided     pneumothorax which was treated with a thoracentesis and     then chest tube drainage.
The air leak persisted and multiple     replacements and manipulations of the left thoracostomy     tube were necessary to maintain drainage of the air leak.
In spite of these maneuvers, the air leak persisted and     on day of life 9, a second chest tube was placed,     positioned subpulmonic to relieve reaccumulation of the     air leak on the left side.
On day of life 8, [**Female First Name (un) **] developed atelectasis versus     consolidation on the right side.
On day of life 9, a peripheral arterial line was placed     for increasing severity of illness and need for additional     monitoring.
There was no evidence of a patent ductus or other     cardiovascular compromise until day of life 9 when     [**Female First Name (un) **] started to become hypotensive requiring volume     and vasopressor resuscitation.
The baby alternated between periods of tachycardia and     sinus bradycardia over the last few days of life.
On the     morning of [**2186-12-25**] She had sinus bradycardia to     the 60s and required a short interval of chest     compressions and a single dose of epinephrine to improve     cardiac output.
[**Female First Name (un) **] was treated with phototherapy for physiologic     unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and light therapy was     discontinued on day of life 8.
A CBC and blood culture were initially obtained     upon admission with initial CBC notable for a white count     of 5.9 with 7 polys and 0 bands, 89 lymphs and an     absolute neutrophil count of 413.
[**Female First Name (un) **] received multiple packed red     blood cell transfusions.
On day of life 10, she was noted to be     extremely neutropenic with a white blood cell count of     1.6 with 0 neutrophils, 0 bands, 70 lymphs, and 23,000     platelets.
It was repeated on day of     life 10 and it remained without evidence for intracranial     hemorrhage.
Given the persistent hypoxemia and acidemia especially over the final 12 hours of [**Female First Name (un) 61633**] life, discussion with the family ensued regarding the likely neurodevelopmental compromise that may result given the prolonged nature and severity of her metabolic acidosis and hypoxemia.
With regard for the futility in continuing to provide [**Hospital 17073**] medical ervention, the decision was made to discontinue support.
Respiratory distress syndrome requiring Surfactant     replacement.
Right pulmonary atelectasis versus consolidation.
Severe metabolic acidosis.
