Admission Date:  [**2179-5-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-5-20**]   Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital for ST elevation MI.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old female transferred from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital after originally being admitted there on [**2179-5-13**] for treatment of right foot fracture and left ankle sprain which she sustained during a fall at home.
The patient was in the rehabilitation unit of the hospital today when she had a syncopal episode while using the commode after a brief loss of consciousness.
An EKG was done and the patient was found to be bradycardiac with 5 mm ST segment elevations in V3 through V6, II, III, and aVF.
The patient also complained of chest pressure and had an episode of emesis.
She also reported additional nausea but had no emesis since the morning.
The patient cites no history of bleeding disorders.
She had an EGD two years ago which revealed mild gastritis.
Multiple bilateral rotator cuff surgeries.
Total abdominal hysterectomy.
Right foot fracture on [**2179-5-13**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to iodine.
General: The patient was mildly uncomfortable, in no acute respiratory distress, lying flat in bed.
Neck:  No JVD, supple.
Chest:  Fine crackles at the bases bilaterally.
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur at the apex.
Extremities:  Bilateral feet and ankles wrapped in bandages.
The initial EKG at the outside hospital showed 5 mm ST segment elevations in V3 through V6, 2 mm ST segment elevation in II, III, and aVF.
Prior to lysis, EKG disclosed 2 mm ST segment elevation in V3 through V6, 1 mm ST segment elevation in II, III, and aVF.
Following the administration of thrombolytic agents, the patient had 1 mm ST segment elevation in II, III, aVF, V3 through V6.
IMPRESSION:  This is an 85-year-old female with ST elevation MI, status post lytic therapy with continued symptoms of chest pain.
Coronary angiography of the right dominant circulation revealed no significant residual coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was short and had no significant stenosis.
The LAD had no significant narrowing but flow down the arteries seemed to pause in the midvessel.
The LAD supplied a single bifurcating V1 that had no significant disease.
The left circumflex was free of significant disease and gave rise to a moderate sized OM1 and a large OM2 before terminating in the AV groove.
The RCA had mild luminal irregularities and supplied small PDA and PLV branches.
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated left ventricular filling pressure with an LVEDP of 22 mmHg in the setting of normal systemic arterial blood pressure.
There was evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 43/13/26 mmHg.
No significant gradient across the aortic valve was detected.
Left ventriculography demonstrated anterolateral, apical, and inferior apical akinesis with a calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 53% but a visually observed left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%, severe 3+ mitral regurgitation was seen.
Echocardiogram disclosed resting regional wall motion abnormalities including akinesis of the lower half of the LV with a dyskinetic apex.
There was a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient observed.
There was no LV apical thrombus.
There was moderate to moderately severe mitral regurgitation ([**3-15**]+).
D.  ANTICOAGULATION:  Due to the patient's poor ejection fraction and apical akinesis, it was decided that the patient should be started on Coumadin.
A CT scan of the abdomen did not disclose evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
A right groin ultrasound did not show evidence of hematoma.
There was, however, a small AV fistula observed.
VASCULAR:  As noted above, the right groin ultrasound disclosed a small AV fistula.
There was no evidence of hematoma or pseudoaneurysm.
The vascular surgeons noted that the patient had excellent distal flow with good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
There was no indication for operative intervention.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  As noted above, the patient had been admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital due to right third metatarsal fracture.
In addition, the patient was noted to have a left ankle sprain.
The patient is to undergo a right femoral groin ultrasound on [**2179-7-9**] at 10:30 a.m.  Ultrasound is required to confirm that right femoral AV fistula has resolved.
Nerve-limiting coronary artery disease.
Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Severe 3+ mitral regurgitation.
Acute myocardial infarction.
