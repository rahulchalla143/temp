Serial CT scans at that time showed stability of the bleed in her brain and she was discharged.
The patient presented on [**2141-1-6**] with failure to thrive, decreased activity and decreased intake.
She denied headache, she denied visual changes, she had no fevers or chills, she had no diarrhea or vomiting.
She developed diabetic ketoacidosis over the first 24 to 48 hours in the hospital.
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was started on a regular insulin drip with electrolyte repletion significant for marked hypophosphatemia.
Essential thrombocytosis, status post cerebrovascular accident, on aspirin at the time of presentation, stroke in [**2136**] presumably due to essential thrombocytosis.
Mastectomy in [**2127**] on right, patient did not undergo radiation or chemotherapy at that time, no recurrence; reconstruction in [**2136**].
While she remained neurologically stable with detailed serial examinations being unremarkable for any acute changes, she did develop diabetic ketoacidosis over the first 24 to 48 hours.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  She had a left occipital hematoma 6 x 8 cm, tender to palpation, she also had a left frontal hematoma approximately 3 x 2 cm, the calvaria were intact, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light from 4 mm to 2 mm, extraocular movements intact without nystagmus, fundi had sharp disks, V to A ratio less than 3:2, there were no hemorrhages, there was no exudate.
Neck:  Jugular veins were flat, there was no carotid bruit, thyroid was not palpable, full range of motion, left external jugular vein catheter in  place, not warm or tender.
Nodes: No cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, normal S1 and S2, no S3, no S4, no murmur, rub or gallop.
Abdomen: Thin, soft, normal bowel sounds, tender to palpation on right flank without rebound or guarding, liver edge not palpable.
Extremities:  Wearing compression stockings, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no calf tenderness.
Neurologic:  Patient had a constricted affect but was euthymic, she had slow clear speech, normal thought content and process, no suicidal or homicidal ideations, intact short and long term memory; cranial nerves I and VIII not tested formally, cranial nerves II, III, IV, VI, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact without nystagmus, as above, cranial nerves V, VII, normal facial sensation bilaterally, symmetric face, could elevate brow and puff cheeks, cranial nerves IX, X, XII, tongue midline, normal gag reflex, could phonate, cranial nerve [**Doctor First Name 81**], normal sternocleidomastoid (SCM) strength bilaterally, neck with full range of motion, normal shoulder shrug; motor [**6-19**] upper and lower extremities bilaterally, median, radial and ulnar nerves normal bilaterally; sensation, proprioception and light touch (microfilament) intact; deep tendon reflexes, biceps +2 bilaterally, brachial radialis +2 bilaterally, patella +1 bilaterally; cerebellum, rapid hand movements normal.
and lispro sliding scale with meals; of note, this scale will likely be adjusted by the patient's endocrinologist given that her head trauma resolved completely, the insulin demands will likely go down.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
