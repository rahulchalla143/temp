There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline/mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: focal apical dyskinesis; consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy vs apical infarct  [**12-10**] CXR:  roughly 3-cm wide opacity projecting over the intersection of the left fourth anterior and tenth posterior ribs could be superimposition of normal structures or early region of consolidation, particularly if patient has had aspiration episodes.
No pleural or mediastinal abnormalities.
No free subdiaphragmatic gas and no pneumothorax.
Dynamic blood pool images show intermittent brisk bleeding from the hepatic flexure of the colon.
Other findings: No blood or bleeding seen.
Impression: No blood or bleeding seen.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  COLONOSCOPY: Findings:  Contents: Extensive red blood and large clots were seen throughout the colon.
Per report, there were additional diverticula throughout the sigmoid on the last procedure, so we presume that these were obscured by the massive amount of blood.
Impression: Red blood and clots throughout the visualized portions of the colon.
Diverticulum in the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to splenic flexure  DISCHARGE LABS: [**2148-12-16**] 04:09AM BLOOD WBC-4.6 RBC-3.47* Hgb-10.8* Hct-31.2* MCV-90 MCH-31.2 MCHC-34.7 RDW-16.0* Plt Ct-219 [**2148-12-15**] 04:56AM BLOOD Glucose-130* UreaN-11 Creat-0.9 Na-141 K-3.9 Cl-109* HCO3-29 AnGap-7* [**2148-12-14**] 04:20AM BLOOD CK-MB-3 cTropnT-0.31* [**2148-12-13**] 04:32AM BLOOD Triglyc-102  Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 7842**] is a 70 year-old male with a history of gout and depression who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3765**] for further evaluation of GI bleed.
Large volume GI Bleed: Thorough OSH work-up without clear source identified.
Fibrinogen, coags wnl in setting of massive transfusion requirement.
GI bleed work-up in house: tagged RBC scan on [**12-12**] with dynamic blood pool images demonstrated intermittent brisk bleeding from the hepatic flexure of the colon.
Subsequent angio on [**12-12**] revealed blushing in area of hepatic flexure, no intervention performed.
Of note, due to large volume dye load patient received renal protective N-Ac and bicarbonate.
NSTEMI: Pt with NSTEMI in the setting of GI bleed and severe anemia at OSH.
Likely secondary to demand in setting of blood loss.
Patient with 2 episodes with chest pain in the ICU.
Cards consulted initially for question of pre-operative risk if GI bleed necessitated.
At time of transfer pt chest pain free with biomarkers downtrending.
Low dose metoprolol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **] discontinued on day of transfer due to asymptomatic hypotension in the 90s.
Of note has not been given ASA, plavix or heparin given his continued GI bleed.
Can re-consider after further GI/cardiology evaluation - Beta blocker held given HYPOTENSION with this medication in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with chest pain.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check a CBC and EKG on next follow up   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed Blood loss anemia NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction) Depression Gout   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a large lower GI bleed, as well as a heart attach.
The bleeding was caused by an area in your "hepatic flexure."
After many blood transfusions, the bleeding was stopped via angiogram and coiling.
You will need to see your cardiologist as soon as possible to further assess your recent heart attack and need for further testing and treatment.
This is because we are not definitively sure where or why you had your bleeding  Please call your doctor and/or return to the nearest emergency department immediately if your bleeding resumes, OR you experience chest pain or shortness of breath.
Your aspirin has been STOPPED for now given your severe bleeding, though you may have to go back on it after discussion with your PCP and cardiologist.
