Moderate-severe pulmonary hypertension.
Mild elevation of PCW 3.
Mild RV diastolic dysfunction .
[**2128-7-13**] CXR compared to [**2128-3-29**] IMPRESSION: Reexpanded left lower lobe with residual atelectasis in bilateral lung bases.
No acute pulmonary process.
Right lower lobe consolidation, new from [**2128-3-25**], likely representing aspiration pneumonia.
Right infrahilar mass lesion is not excluded on this non-contrast exam.
There is a rounded, bulging contour of the medial right major fissure, which raises the possibility of a hilar mass.
Secretions within the bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe bronchi.
Chronic left lower lobe consolidation, which may be related to aspiration.
Moderately severe cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 85 yo male with severe CAD s/p CABGx2, bioprosthetic MVR, ischemic CM with EF 25% who presents with worsening shortness of breath.
#) CAD: No symptoms or signs suggestive of an ischemic event at this time.
First set of CE is neg and there was no need to cycle.
#) Rhythm: Patient was in known afib at the time of admission.
The patient is not anticoagulated because of CHF and risk of hemoptysis, which has happend to him in the past.
#) Pump: Patient appeared to be in both left and right sided heart failure on initial exam.
Wedge pressure of 13 suggests no severe back pressure although he does have poor cardiac output.
#) Pneumonia:  An alternative explanation of the patient's pulmonary symptoms was pneumonia.
A sputum gram stain revealed gram positive cocci in chains, pairs and clusters.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Discharge Instructions: You came in with shortness of breath and nausea.
We did not believe that you had a heart attack.
We performed a right heart cath which suggested that you were in slight cardiac failure.
We diuresed you and your symptoms improved.
You also were noted to have a pneumonia so we treated you with antibiotics.
We performed a chest CT scan which demonstrated a possible mass in the right side of your lung.
This likely is secondary to your infection but we recommend a followup CT scan once your infection resolves to assess for interval change.
