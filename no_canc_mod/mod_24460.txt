Admission Date:  [**2170-11-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-12-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-4-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bilateral Placement of External Ventricular Drains  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 64 year-old male with a h/o HTN and hypercholesterolemia who stopped his medications secondary to financial difficulties who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for a ICH.
Per report, he was at a wedding this evening when he suddenly became confused and combative complaining of severe headache.
He was moving all extremities but was complaining of severe headache located in the back of his head.
He was intubated and a head CT there showed, per report, a large IVH with blood in the 3rd and 4th ventricles possibly coming from the right caudate head, temporal horns mildly enlarged with hydrocephalus and cerebral edema.
He has elevated blood pressures with SBPs in the 250s that was non-responsive to labetalol, but responded to propofol.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was hypertensive on arrival with BP 180s, intubated and sedated on propofol.
Past Medical History: HTN hypercholesterolemia  Social History: The patient lives alone and has no children.
There is not an official HCP however there is next of [**Doctor First Name **] in the greater [**Location (un) 86**] area  [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], sister [**Telephone/Fax (1) 83725**]  Family History: Per sister there is a significant family history of heart disease.
Also FH of difficult to control HTN and ICH.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right Left  Toes downgoing bilaterally  On discharge: General: Awake, alert, responsive and appropriate, A+Ox2 HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, obese Ext: Warm, well perfused, 1+ Lower extremity edema L > R  Pertinent Results: EKG [**2170-11-25**] Baseline artifact.
Sinus rhythm.
Delayed R wave progression.
Lateral ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Extensive intraventricular hemorrhage, likely with the right basal ganglia source making hypertensive hemorrhage most likely.
Underlying mass or vascular lesion are additional causes, and MRI is more sensitive for the detection.
Sulci are not well visualized, and this can be seen with diffusely elevated intracranial pressure.
Therefore, determination of elevated intracranial pressure is somewhat equivocal; correlate with patient's symptoms and consider followup and when clinically necessary indicated.
CT C-spine [**2170-11-25**]: No fracture or malalignment.
Satisfactory placement of lines and tubes.
Intraventricular hemorrhage extending from right caudate head.
Bilateral frontal approach ventricular drains as described above.
Except for tortuous vertebrobasilar system, no other abnormalities are seen on CT angiography of the head.
Significant intraventricular hemorrhage involving the entire ventricular system, unchanged in appearance from that noted on most recent prior.
Persistent sulcal effacement and decreased conspicuity of fissures consistent with cerebral edema.
The original hemorrhage appears to be centered within the head of the right caudate nucleus suggesting hypertension as the likely cause of the intraventricular hemorrhage.
Limited study due to the patient's body habitus and portable technique.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis as described above.
Echogenic liver, compatible with fatty infiltration.
Please note types of liver disease such as hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
No new hemorrhage is seen.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Extensive left lower extremity DVT.
Technically limited study without definite evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
EEG [**2170-12-6**]: Abnormal portable EEG due to the widespread uniform alpha to beta frequency patterns.
There were no focal abnormalities (although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings, as can medications), and there were no epileptiform features.
Echo [**2170-12-6**]: Normal right ventricular size and global systolic function.
At least mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Small pericardial effusion.
Chest CTA [**2170-12-6**]: Acute pulmonary emboli involving the right interlobar pulmonary artery extending into the right lower and middle lobar branches, without evidence of right cardiac strain.
RUQ u/s [**2170-12-6**]: No evidence of cholecystitis and no biliary dilatation seen.
Head CT [**2170-12-11**]: Unchanged intraventricular hemorrhage status post removal of ventriculostomy catheters with unchanged dilation of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle, comapred to the most recent CT study.
Renal u/s [**2169-12-20**]: No hydronephrosis in either kidney.
Renal MRI: Mild proximal luminal irregularity involving only the inferior accessory right renal artery is unlikely to represent significant stenosis given the lack of atherosclerosis and this appearance on only one series.
No definite renal artery stenosis.
No adrenal abnormality.
Intraventricular hemorrhage and hypertension: Mr. [**Known lastname 83726**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2170-11-25**].
In the surgical intensive care unit, he was noted to have some bilateral upper extremity tremor, which was not felt to be seizure activity by Neurosurgery nor Neurology.
A repeat head CT on [**2170-12-3**] showed improvement with less blood in the ventricles.
He underwent renal MRI which showed no renal artery stenosis.
He would likely benefit from a full outpatient workup for secondary causes of hypertension and from seeing a hypertension specialist (nephrology and cardiology).
Ventriculitis: He developed altered mental status on [**2170-12-5**].
CSF showed elevated WBC.
# DVT/PE: On [**2170-12-5**] patient was noted to be tachypneic and was found to have a LLE DVT as well as bilateral PE.
He was transitioned to Coumadin without complication and has a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5 due to his risk of repeat ICH.
It was felt that his renal failure may be related to AIN given peripheral eosinophilia and recent antibiotic administration.
His antibiotics were stopped and his renal failure remained stable.
His renal failure was not responsive to IV fluids and was felt to less likely be prerenal.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral Intraventricular Hemorrhage Entrapment of Lateral Ventricle Hydrocephalus Uncontrolled Hypertension Ventilator-associated pneumonia Ventriculitis/Meningitis DVT/PE   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after you had a bleed in your head.
You had drains placed in your brain because of the bleed, which have now been removed.
You had two serious infections while you were in the hospital: a pneumonia and an infection in the ventricles of your brain (where the drains were), for both you were treated with antibiotics through your IV.
?Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
?Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You also had an acute kidney injury that was thought to be due to the antibiotics you had been receiving.
You will also need a follow-up appointment with a hypertension specialist, either a nephrologist or a cardiologist after discharge.
