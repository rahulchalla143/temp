No pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
Cardiomegaly with trace pericardial effusion.
Two tiny hyperenhancing foci in the liver, may represent focal nodular hyperplasia, though incompletely characterized on this exam.

Lateral ST-T wave changes may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-5-11**] there are more T wave inversions in leads V5-V6 which may be due to lead placement.
Discharge Labs: WBC 12.6, Hematocrit 32.1, Plts 467, INR 2.6, Na 141, K 4.2, Cl 92, HCO2 27, BUN 28, Crt 6.0, Gluc 186, AST 49, ALT 58, AlkP 696, T Bili 0.4  Pending Labs: Insulin antibody  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 61289**] is a 25 year old man with ESRD on HD, Type 1 DM, recent PE who presented with hyperkalemia, chest pain, and hypertensive urgency.
Hypertensive urgency:  It was unclear what medication regimen he was taking as an outpatient prior to admission.
It was felt that his hypertension on admission was most likely related to medication nonadherence, anxiety, and volume overload.
He did have episodes of transient hypertension with SBP>200.
He also had one episode of hypotension with SBP's in the 80's during hemodialysis.
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: He had labile blood sugars throughout this admission with both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes.
Anxiety: He was very agitated on admission and did not always show insight and judgement about his medical conditions.
He was initially treated with lorazepam and haloperidol as needed for anxiety.
In the ICU, he was initially felt to not have capacity to leave against medical advice given his inconsistent ability to communicate his wishes and express understanding of the medical consequences of his decisions to refuse treatment.
Hyperkalemia: He had hyperkalemia on admission with peaked T waves on ECG.
He had one further episode of hyperkalemia during his stay prior to dialysis and was given calcium gluconate and kayexalate for peaked T waves on ECG.
Chest pain: He had chest pain on presentation to the ED but had no further CP on admission to the MICU.
He had no evidence of dissection or PE on CTA chest.
It was felt that his CP symptoms were likely anxiety- related.
History of PE: He had no evidence of recurrent PE on CTA.
He had a subtherapeutic INR on admission and was started on a heparin drip as a bridge to Couamdin therapy.
He had a few extra sessions of ultrafiltration while he was an inpatient.
Pruritis: He had generalized pruritis and skin lesions thought to be consistent with prurigo nodularis.
Elevated LFTs: He had persistently elevated LFTs (most notably Alk phos to the 600 range with mild elevation in AST/ALT).
Upon review of his records from [**Hospital1 112**], he was extensively worked up there with RUQ ultrasound, hepatitis serologies, ceruloplasmin, automimmune workup, hemochromatosis labs, as well as other viral serologies.
At that time, his elevated LFTs were thought to possible be due to right heart failure in the setting of PE.
Medication liver injury was considered a possibility and his statin was stopped due to this possibility in addition to some complaints of lower extremity muscle pain.
