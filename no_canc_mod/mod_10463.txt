Admission Date:  [**2131-2-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-2-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2088-1-5**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 43-year-old gentleman with no significant past medical history who presented to an outside hospital with a one to two day history of substernal chest pain that radiated to the upper back.
He also complained of increasing shortness of breath and diaphoresis.
At the outside hospital, an EKG showed anterolateral wall ST elevations and the patient was started on Retivase with no significant changes in his EKG.
At that time, a stat echocardiogram showed anterior wall hypokinesis and the patient was emergently transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for emergent PCI.
In the Cath Laboratory there was shown to be an LAD lesion that was totally occluded in the mid to distal segment with TIMI-0 flow.
An attempted PCI of the total occlusion in the mid LAD was unsuccessful.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Noncontributory  ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His father is with known coronary artery disease.
His EKG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 104.
He had diffuse ST elevations in leads I, II, and aVL along with leads V2 through V6 up to 5 mm in leads V2 and V3.
It showed Q waves in leads V1 through V4.
Lungs: Coarse bilateral breath sounds both anteriorly and laterally.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was in place along with a Cordis Swan in the right femoral.
There was no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  This is a 43-year-old gentleman with a noncontributory past medical history who presented from an outside hospital with an acute ST elevation MI secondary to total occlusion of the LAD which was not successfully lysed with thrombolytics and unsuccessful PCI who presented to the CCU for further management of his cardiogenic shock.
There was severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities including akinesis of the apex, mid and distal anterior and anterolateral walls along with a midinferior wall, right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal.
The aortic valve leaflets were structurally normal with good leaflet exertion and no aortic regurgitation.
There were no pericardial effusions.
The patient remained tachycardiac and his beta blocker was increased.
He remained in sinus tachycardia and an Esmolol drip was added to his regimen.
On a follow-up echocardiogram, the patient was found to have a small to moderate size pericardial effusion which did not compromise his hemodynamics.
The patient was seen by the Cardiac Surgery Team who reviewed the films and determined that there was no area for touchdown.
He appears to have developed a lower lobe pneumonia.
His sputum yielded H. influenzae and the patient completed a course of antibiotics.
He was also scheduled a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Heart Failure Clinic.
