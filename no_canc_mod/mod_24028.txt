Complains of neck pain with LE movement.
CATHETER TIP: no growth (final) C DIFF: negative BLOOD CULTURES ([**10-14**]): negative x 2  OF NOTE: MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE.
CLINICAL HISTORY: Fracture after trauma.
The C2 fracture shown on the CT of the same day is again visualized, primarily on the STIR images.
At the level of the base of C2, where the posterior inferior corner of C2 is displaced slightly into the spinal canal, there is T2 hyperintensity in the spinal cord dorsally, suggesting a contusion.
There appears to be some edema in C4, where there is an anterior fusion and metallic artifact from a cage.
No fracture was seen on the CT.
There is also metallic artifact from the cage at C5-6.
The study is limited by motion, but there appears to be edema in the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord at the level of the inferior aspect of C2, suggestive of a spinal cord contusion.
The known fracture through the C2 pedicles and the base of C2 is visualized.
There is minimal displacement of the fragment from the posterior inferior aspect of C2 into the canal, but the CSF around the spinal cord remains patent.
The postsurgical and degenerative disc disease changes at other levels are visualized to some extent.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL INDICATION: Elevated bilirubin.
There is no evidence of ascites.
There is no evidence of cholelithiasis or pericholecystic fluid.

No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Hazy opacity seen in the right lower lobe probably representing an area of atelectasis.

He underwent a STAT c-spine MRI which showed possible spinal cord contusion but no evidence of cord compression by fracture of epidural hematoma.
Given his pulmonary status, DTs, and concern for difficulty with reintubation because of the halo, he underwent a bedside percutaneous tracheostomy on [**10-11**] with no complications.
He did continue to have periods of agitation and confusion.
During the rest of his stay in the ICU and on the floor he had no major problems.
He remained afebrile during the last 5 days of his stay while still on Zosyn and Vancomycin, and his blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
