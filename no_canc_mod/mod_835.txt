Admission Date:  [**2163-12-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-2-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Gluten / Augmentin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1646**] Chief Complaint: Fever and diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Flexible sigmoidoscopy PICC line placement and removal Tunneled Line Placement ERCP [**2164-1-9**]   History of Present Illness: 85 year old man with history of refractory celiac disease, hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism, cystic pancreatic lesions, and osteoporosis who presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and lethargy.
He was last discharged on [**2163-11-30**] after an admission for gallstone pancreatitis, pan sensitive E. coli bacteremia, pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, and new onset afib.
An ERCP during this admission showed a small stone and sludge was extracted and a stent was placed.
The plan was for follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an elective outpatint cholecystectomy in [**2-4**] months and for repeat ERCP in [**5-8**] wks for stent removal, balloon sweep, and pancreatic duct evaluation.
He denies fever and is positive for abdominal pain in his left lower quadrant.
Per the pt's report he was started on flagyl at rehab which was discontinued due to increased liver enzymes.
In the ED he had tenderness in the left abdomen and was guaiac positive.
CT abd showed gallstones, air in lumen of gallbladder likely related to ERCP/stent placement, and no evidence of obstruction.
There was no evidence of  cholangitis.
CXR revealed no infiltrates.
+Recent weight loss (cannot quantify).
No shortness of breath or pain with inspiration.
No chest pain or discomfort.
No dizziness, lightheadedness, presyncope, syncope, or palpitations.
No dysuria or hematuria.
No joint or muscle pain.

Antral and fundic type mucosa with focal erosion, mild associated chronic active inflammation and epithelial regeneration.
B.  Duodenum: Duodenal mucosa with marked villous atrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes; see note.
New wedge-shaped hypoattenuation in the interpolar region of left kidney may represent infarct, although focal infection and neoplasm are less likely possibilities.
Followup contrast enhanced CT or MR when the patient's symptoms resolve recommended to exclude neoplasm.
Unchanged mildly dilated small bowel loops around anastomotic site.
Unchanged renal and hepatic hypodensities, and likely left lobe hemangioma.
Pancreatic cystic lesions, one of which represents IPMN based on prior ERCP stable from [**Month (only) **], but both slightly increased since [**2159**].
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and its branches.
Duodenum:  : Diffuse blunting of the villi was noted throughout the duodenum.
Impression: Gastric ulcer (biopsy) Normal mucosa in the duodenum (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  .
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a question of intramural edema involving the descending and sigmoid colons; however, this appearance may simply be due to nondistention and intraluminal fluid as the adjacent fat shows no definite inflammatory change.
No change in pancreatic lesions as described, expected pneumobilia, cholelithiasis, probable liver hemangiomas.
Small wedge-shaped area of absent contrast enhancement within the inferior pole of the right kidney, likely representing a small infarct, relatively acute or subacute given lack of renal capsular retraction.
Colonic mucosal biopsies: A.  Proximal descending: Colonic mucosa with focal acute inflammation and crypt regeneration, suggestive of adjacent injury.
Colonic mucosa with focal, mildly active colitis and erosion; see note.
Immunostain for CMV is negative for viral inclusions, with satisfactory controls.
A single 5 mm stone that was causing partial obstruction was seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
Repeat balloon sweeps were negative and occlusion cholangiogram revealed no residual filling defects.
A segmental dilation of the side branches of the pancreatic duct was seen at the head of the pancreas.
This was consistent with side-branch IPMN.
The main duct was without filling defects.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 8435**] is an 85 year old man with history of celiac disease, hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism, a fib, osteoporosis, and gallstone pancreatitis who presented with elevated WBC/fever/elevated lactate/diarrhea/ARF.
# colitis/GI bleeding: Pt admitted to ICU with sepsis (Febrile, tachycardic, leukocytosis, bandemia (bands 37 on admission), elevated lactate).
No evidence of colitis was present on abd CT scan, although this was a noncontrast study.
On transfer to the floor, the pt continued to have persistent leukocytosis and diarrhea.
The ID team was consulted to discontinue Zosyn given that his picture was consistent with colitis.
On [**12-21**], the pt underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy which revealed a friable, ulcerative colonic mucosa which was concerning for viral pathologies such as CMV.
He was empirically changed to PO vancomycin for concern of severe C diff and started on ganciclovir for empiric CMV coverage.
Pathology of colon biopsies was consistent with colitis, inflammation.
With the completely negative infectious results, there was also some strong concern that this event may have been ischemic colitis as the patint also has evidence of embolic infarcts in his brain and has atrial fibrillation, so the decision was made to restart the patient on coumadin with a heparin bridge.
While in the ICU he receieved 3U of blood and had a negative bleeding scan.
His Hct remained stable and he had a brown stool the morning of transfer back to the floor.
A repeat Flex sig [**2164-1-19**] showed good healing of the colonic lesions so anticoagulation was restarted.
These results showed celiac sprue, with MALT stain pending at the time of discharge.
At the time of discharge the patient had been receiving loperamide and was down to 1-2 BM per day, but was having some increasing abd distention.
[**Month (only) 116**] require intermittant transfusion if HCT drifts down as it has been slowly decreasing over last 2 weeks with blood draws and possibly slow loss from GI source.
# MRSA bacteremia - On [**12-18**]/2 blood culture bottles grew MRSA.
ID was consulted and recommended ordering a TTE which was negative for valvular vegetations.
After further review of his case (hx endocarditis [**2162**], as well as possible renal infarcts on CT scan).
PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**] and has final result of no growth.
TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE, which was negative for vegetations on [**2164-1-3**].
There has never been any problems flushing the line, just drawing labs back.
Patient is a difficult peripheral stick, but can be done if needed.
# UTI - Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time.
As U/A was unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**].
Repeat urine cultures 11/30 and [**1-3**] were negative for enterobacter, but positive for enterococcus.
Per ID a repeat UA was performed and was negative for nitrites and leuk esterase.
The ID recommended discontinuing ciprofloxacin [**1-3**] since the enterbacter had cleared and did NOT want to treat the enterococcus (VRE), since this is likely now a colonizer (UA was negative).
# RUE swelling - pt noted to have some RUE edema approximately [**12-28**].
Due to the ongoing need for PICC line for TPN as well as other indications for anticoagulation (Afib with hx embolic strokes), heparin gtt was entertained, but was not started given his falling Hct and guaiac positive stools.
* Biliary stent - The inpatient GI service recommended that ERCP be contact[**Name (NI) **] in order to determine how to manage his biliary stent in the setting of a rising lipase.
The ERCP team removed the stent on [**2164-1-9**] without complication.
* Acute on chronic kidney disease (Stage II): On admission, creatinine was noted to be 3.8 up from baseline of 0.6.
It was believed to be prerenal and secondary to severe dehydration.
* Anion gap acidosis [**3-6**] lactic acidosis and uremia - This was thought secondary to his severe colitis and MRSA bacteremia.
Vitamin K given in ICU and coumadin/ASA was held given diarrhea and guaiac positive stools.
Given his atrial fibrillation and subacute strokes and renal infarct, ASA was restarted on [**12-22**] and then stopped in the setting of GIB.
His goal INR should be [**3-7**] with ideal range 2-2.5 given his high bleeding risk.
* Atrial fibrillation with hx embolic strokes: On admission, his ASA and coumadin were held.
At [**Hospital1 **], he had complained of visual changes and he had a neurology consultation and was found to have subacute strokes - bilateral posterior infarcts (right side affecting posterior temporal and occipital lobes; left side involving medial right occipital lobe).
He was restarted on coumadin at [**Hospital1 **] at 5mg QHS but had supratherapeutic INRT.
His CT Abd revealed a new renal infarct, may be related to embolic phenomenon from Afib vs. endocarditis.
His ASA was restarted on [**12-22**] then held in the setting of GIB, which was felt to be due to ischemic colitis (other evidence for embolization).
* Transaminitis - Likely related to hypoperfusion from severe diarrhea.
Held intermittant with above complication, but has been restarted without event.
* Benign hypertension:  Some of his BP medications were held in the setting of septicemia picture in the ICU.
* History of PE:  S/p course of coumadin in past, but now back on anyway for AFib reasons and h/o embolic phenomenon.
Hold if any abdominal distention.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: GIB due to colonic ulcerations MRSA bacteremia of unclear source Celiac Sprue, refractory PUD Atrial fibrillation c/b embolic CVAs Hypertension, benign Recent occipital stroke ([**12-11**]) Renal infarct   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: The patient is being discharge to a facility with the following active problems:  1. diarrhea: has improved some with entercort and loperamide, both at the recommendation of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He still has path pending on the duodenal biopsies to see whether he has MALT lymphoma causing his worsening symptoms.
Of note, the patient has significant abdominal distention that is normal for him.
Please monitor frequently as he is a very high bleeding risk, but unfortunately for emoblic events as well.
See DC summary for h/o bleeding issues.
ID is very confident that this is not an infection, but we believe it should be monitored closely for bandemia or significant increase.
He does have colon ulcers and has guiac + stools, but without any  s/s of gross bleeding and stable HCT.
[**Month (only) 116**] require intermittant transfusion if HCT drifts down as it has been slowly decreasing over last 2 weeks with blood draws and possibly slow loss from GI source.
