Admission Date:  [**2200-9-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-9-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2153-12-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: trazadone / Serzone / metformin  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: GI Bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD [**2200-9-9**]   History of Present Illness: 46yo man with a h/o duodenal bulb ulcer (dx [**3-/2200**]) and cholecystal duodenal fistula (dx [**2200-8-21**]), psychiatric issues, polysubstance abuse, HCV/cirrhosis, remote EtOH abuse, and prior sternal osteo (due to IVDU, ~10 years ago, s/p flap for an open chest wound last year) admitted in the evening of [**9-7**] with coffee ground emesis 2 days PTA along with sharp RUQ pain.
In the OSH ED, he had 600cc of coffee ground emesis with hypotension to 107/75 with tachycardia to the 140s.
At that time, EKG showed TWI in V3-V6 with 1mm ST depressions in V2-V3.
He received 2L NS, 1 unit pRBC and general surgery felt teh cholecystoduodenal fistula was not the cause of his bleed.
Pt was started on protonix gtt and GI performed EGD on [**2200-9-8**], which per accompanying report, showed no varicies, no current bleeding, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] C esophagitis, clotted blood int he entire stomach adn duodenum, with a large duodenal bulb ulceration/fistula just past pyloric channel with mild oozing, clot exudates.
There was pyloric inflammation and concern for malignancy but no biopsies taken due to risk of bleeding.
GI there recommended emergent surgery, but surgery declined and suggested IR angiography and embolization and so he was transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Of note, pt had an admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**3-29**] to [**2200-4-4**] with a chief complaint of abdominal pain.
He was admitted to the acute care service with mid-abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting.
Upon admission, he was made NPO, given intravenous fluids and cat scan showed a contained perforation of a duodenal bulb ulcer.
On HD # 6, he underwent an upper GI study which showed no evidence of duodenal leak.
Prior to transfer from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**], report was given that he had an additional 350cc out his NG tube and was given an additional 1L NS with vital signs reportedly stable.
Tachycardic to 138 with SBP 100, and vomited 850cc of bright red blood and was getting 2 units pRBC en route.
He is mentating well and complaining of epigastric pain and nausea.
However, pt continues to have episodes of hematemesis.
He had one episode of hematemesis of 200-400cc.
He denies any bleeding from the rectum, with the last BM occuring 2-3 days ago.

There is some patchy opacification at the left base.
Stomach: Contents: Coffee ground heme was seen in the stomach without evidence of active bleeding.
Duodenum: Excavated Lesions A large cratered ulcer was found in the duodenal bulb with large amount of adherent clot.
A fistula was found in the first part of the duodenum on the inferior edge and to the left, most likely representing communication with the gallbladder.
This tract was in close proximity to the large cratered ulcer with overhanging edges.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 yo M w/ HCV/cirrhosis, h/o duodenal bulb ulcer (dx [**3-/2200**]) and cholecystal duodenal fistula (dx [**2200-8-21**]) who presents from OSH with active upper GI bleed.
#GI Bleed/Acute blood loss anemia due to duodenal ulcer - Pt with coffee ground emesis for 2 days PTA to OSH with decreasing HCT.
Hemodynamic instability with acute blood loss reflected in tachycardia to 150s on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] with pressures in the low 80s systolic.
Pt has hx of duodenal bulb ulcer that was not actively bleeding on OSH EGD, but this was deemed to be the most likely active source of bleeding.
Transplant surgery, GI and IR were consulted for assistance with management of his acute GI bleed.
Patient was intubated on HD#1 to allow for GI to perform EGD, which showed a duodenal bulb ulcer with adherent clot.
IR felt that given this bleed was venous in nature, they did not have a role in its management, and would be unable to embolize it.
Given there were no varices seen on EGD, it was decided not to initiate octreotide in this patient.
On HD#3 the patient did experience a HCt drop from 29.5 to 25.5 without any incidence of melena or BRBPR.
#Choleduodenal fistula - Pt has recent dx of choleduodenal fistula ([**2200-8-21**]), which is not likely contributing to his bleed, but may need acute management while in the hospital.
Possibility of chronic cholecystitis with erosion of gallstones into the lumen of the duodenum.
#HCV - Diagnosed 3 years ago with cirrhosis documented on OSH CT abd/pelvis.
Per history, no biopsy, no treatment.
He had no evidence of decompensated liver disease during this admission.
He refused his lactulose and had no asterixis.
#Non-healing right chest wound s/p right latissimus flap on [**2200-3-17**] complicated by hematoma - Patient is on methadone therapy for chronic pain due to this issue, which was re-started once he was extubated.
Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H RX *pantoprazole 40 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth twice daily Disp #*60 Tablet Refills:*0   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Duodenal ulcer bleed  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were seen by the GI specilists who looked with a camera within your stomach and small intestine and saw an area in the intestine which had likely been the source of the bleed.
