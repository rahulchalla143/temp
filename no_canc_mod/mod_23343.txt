Per OSH report, patient was admitted on [**12-7**] for hematemesis and melanotic stools.
He underwent EGD on [**12-7**], which revealed non-bleeding grade II esophageal varicies and 2 duodenal ulcers, which were thought to be the cause of patient's symptoms.
Duodenal ulcers did not appear to be rebleeding, and five bands were placed around esophageal ulcers.
Patient was noted to have BRBPR and colonoscopy was subsequently performed.
Patient subsequently developed massive hematemesis and a repeat EGD was performed.
There was question of aspiration during this episode of hematemesis.
Patient was started empirically on vanc/zosyn/flagyl for broad coverage.
There was also report of DTs during OSH admission.
He has had no subsequent episodes of hematemesis since EGD.

TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No intra-cardiac shunt seen - cannot excluded PFO/small ASD as bubble study not performed adequately.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Echogenic and nodular hepatic architecture.
Trace of ascites in the perihepatic space .
CXR [**2147-12-27**]: Previous areas of pulmonary opacity, in the left suprahilar and right juxtahilar lung have cleared.
A relatively small region of peribronchial opacification persists in the right lower lobe medially, but this is not a new finding.
There is no pleural effusion.
Stomach is distended with fluid and retained material.
US abd limited [**2147-12-27**]: no ascites .
[**2147-12-28**]: LENI: No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.
Microbiology: Blood cultures: [**12-27**]: negative Urine cultures: [**12-27**]: negative Peritoneal cultures: [**2147-12-23**]: negative Stool cultures/Cdiff: [**12-22**], [**12-23**], [**12-27**]: negative    Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 15655**] is a 50 year old gentleman with ETOH abuse admitted for an UGIB with hospital course complicated by newly diagnosed cirrhosis and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Initially thought to be secondary to pulmonary edema, possible PNA, restriction from abdominal distention.
Found to have one day of hypotension thought to be secondary to overdiuresis of 3L in 24 hours; pressures stabilized with small fluid boluses and administration of albumin.
Respiratory status continued to improve with diuresis on floor, oxygen weaned, and repeat CXR showed improvement in pleural effusions and no new consolidation.
#  UGI BLEED:  Likely due to duodenal ulcer (injected with epi on [**12-7**]) and esophageal varicies (5 bands placed on [**12-10**]).
He received EGD [**2147-12-29**] which showed one varix band in place, no new varices, no bleeding.
He will need repeat EGD in 6 months for varices surveillance.
He has a hypoechoic lesion noticed on RUQ US, likely focal fatty sparing.
# Hepatic encephalopathy: Likely due to GI bleed and sedation.
Did not exhibit signs of withdrawl on the floor.
# Fever: unclear source, presumed to be due to intra-abdominal translocation of bacteria during .
