Admission Date:  [**2182-10-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-10-31**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Hemotysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy, [**10-7**] IR embolization, [**10-8**] LLL biopsy, [**10-14**] R thoracentesis, [**10-18**] bilateral thoracenteses, [**10-25**]   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 23976**] is an 87 year-old Jamaican male with history of mucinous breast cancer (s/p MRM in [**2172**] and tamoxifen therapy), hypertension, CHF and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from an OSH for further evaluation of hemoptysis.
The patient had a recent admission to the same OSH from [**Date range (1) 23977**] for increasing dyspnea and was treated for a CHF and COPD exacerbation, as well as a RLL PNA.
On the following day, the patient re-presented with increasing dyspnea and several episodes of gross hemoptysis beginning on the day of discharge.
On presentation the patient complained of increased SOB and mild generalized fatigue.
He denied frank fever, chills, HA, dizziness, LOC, or chest pain at that time.
Admission imaging showed a CXR with a dense infiltrate in the LLL.
CT scan reported bilateral patchy infiltrates with small bilateral blebs.
Hemoptysis was thought to be secondary to pneumonia (possibly staph) and patient was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
The patient was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring, where he continued to have persistent spoonfuls of gross hemoptysis.
Bronchoscopy showed a small amout of blood diffusely but no clear sourc of bleedinge.
No frank endobronchial lesions in segmental and subsegmental divisions were identified.
The patient tolerated procedure well, but continued to have significant hemoptysis.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hemoptysis and for possible invasive endoscopic therapy.
Upon admission the patient continued to c/o hemoptysis and SOB with minimal exertion (even walking to bathroom is difficult).
He c/o recent fatigue over past few months, but notes that he was walking 3-4miles/day before these events occurred.
No heme/onc follow-up.

Nonoccluding pulmonary thrombosis, left descending pulmonary artery, may be due to vascular stasis from hilar infiltration rather than emboli; see 3. below.
Two lung masses at the lung bases are highly concerning for malignancy, especially metastases given the patient's history of breast cancer.
Diffuse bronchial wall thickening.
More severe occlusive narrowing and obliteration of the encased bronchial and arterial supply to the lingula and left lower lobe could be due to malignant infiltration of the hilus or inflammation such as fibrosing mediastinitis.
Bilateral lower lung lobe airspace consolidation could represent aspiration given its distribution, or postobstructive pneumonia.
Apical predominant emphysema.
Fluid filled left perifissural bulla could be superinfected, not hemorrhagic.
Tiny round foci in the left kidney are too small to characterize but may represent small cysts.
[**10-6**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

Worsening lower lobe consolidation with mass-like and lobular components, accompanied by extensive bronchovascular bundle thickening, bronchial narrowing and arterial narrowing, left greater than right.
Given the immune- suppressed status of the patient following chemotherapy, atypical organism should be considered including fungal organisms (Aspergillus and mucormycosis), although the appearance is not specific for a particular organism.
Slight reduction in size and decrease in the fluid level within large bullae or pneumatocele within left lower lobe, likely due to hemorrhage or infection.
New pneumatocele in right lower lobe with fluid/hemorrhage and debris.
Left lower lobe pulmonary artery thrombus no longer visualized, but marked narrowing of lower lobe arteries is present, and may be due to adjacent compression by perihilar soft tissue that may be neoplastic, infectious, or fibrotic.
Enlarging moderate right and small left pleural effusion.
Overall increase in bilateral pleural effusion with increased fluid component in the cystic structures bilaterally suggesting their relation to the major fissures.
Slight improvement in the left lower lobe consolidations with no significant change on the right.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-10-7**], pleural effusion has redeveloped.
Since four days prior, there is now re-accumulation of a large left pleural effusion.
Small right pleural effusions is present and the left basilar cyst is now fluid-filled.
The upper lungs are clear with no pneumothorax.
Procedures: [**10-7**] IP Bronchoscopy: bleeding source in LLL but no clear causative lesions noted.
Aortogram demonstrated no definite branches supplying the left lower lobe of the lung.
No collateral supply to the left lower lobe of the lung seen arising from the intercostal arteries or from the right bronchial artery.
- G stain: no org, cx neg, no growth - Viral cx neg to date - Fungal cx neg [**10-16**] galactomannan pending [**10-18**] pleural fluid: - HSV PCR neg for 1 and 2 - G stain: no polys, no mircoorg, no growth - fungal cx pending - AFB: smear neg, cx pending - viral cx neg [**10-19**] galactomannan neg.
[**10-14**] LLL biopsy: cytology negative for malignant cells Pathology of Lung, left lower lobe, needle core biopsy: Fibrosis, reactive type II pneumocyte hypertrophy, red cell extravasation, hemosiderin deposition, and fibrinous exudate, suggesting organizing pneumonia.
No carcinoma seen in this sample.
Note: No fungi or bacteria are identified in GMS and Brown-Brenn stained sections.
Immunohistochemical stains show cells lining fibrous septae to be positive for cytokeratin MNF116 and negative for calretinin and D2-40, consistent with type II pneumocytes.
No keratin-positive cells are present within the fibrinous exudate.
Admission CT scan showed emphysema with large bullae, small subsegmental PE in LLL, two lesions in LLL suspicious for malignancy, and bibasilar honeycombing (?UIP).
The pulmonary service was consulted, and suggested IP bronchoscopy that showed bleeding source to be LLL but no clear causative lesions noted.
In PACU post-proceudre the patient demonstrated increased work of breathing and increased O2 requirement (50% facemask to maintain O2sat > 90%).
Remainder of hospital course is by problem:  # ID: The patient initially presented with labs significant for a leukocytosis to 20 without evidence of fever during admission.
The patient presented with evidence of retrocardiac effusions with a possible suprainfected bullae in the LLL.
On [**10-11**] a repeat CT scan was performed to assess for efficacy of antibiotics.
CT showed improvement in LLL cyst with AF level; however interval development of RLL cystic structure with AF level.
Septic emboli was felt to be an unlikely etiology, as [**10-6**] Echo was negative for valvular vegitations.
On [**10-12**] BAL cultures returned as positive for aspergillus fumigatus (sparse growth) HSV-1 (by fluorescent antibody testing) and the patient was started on voriconazole and acyclovir.
Fungal sputum cultures were also sent, which returned positive for aspergillus fumigatus in [**12-18**] samples.
On [**10-14**] a biopsy of the LLL mass was performed by IR in order to further evaluate etiology of symptoms and progression on imaging.
Biopsy occurred without complication.
Results from this showed cultures consistent with aspergillus, as well.
Aspergillus fumigatus was thought to possibly be a contaminent as amount of growth was sparse in all cultures and the fact that presentation and imaging was not consistent with classic picture; however, the family adamantly refused VATS to obtain tissue diagnosis of masses.
The catheter was removed on [**10-31**] with no evidence of pneumothorax on CXR.
Throughout the admission, the patient complained of dyspnea with minimal exertion, which only improved after bilateral thoracenteses on [**10-25**].
Lung exam showed minimal improvement on antimicrobial therapy, with significantly decreased breath sounds at lung bases bilaterally.
# Lung masses: The patient was found to have bilateral lung masses on admission CT concerning for malignancy given patient's previous history of breast cancer and significant smoking history.
Bronchial brushings from [**10-7**] BAL were negative for malignant cells.
hcG and AFP were negative with elevated LD, which were interpreted as negative for embryonic tumor.
Pathology from CT-guided LLL mass biopsy on [**10-14**] was negative for malignancy.
CA 27.29 levels were sent to evaluate for possible breast cancer.
[**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA levels were sent given concern for hemoptysis and findings of bronchial inflammation on admission CT; results were negative, making vasculitis unlikely.
The Hematology/Oncology service was consulted, and they suggested CT abd/ pelvis in future for further assessment of possible metastases.
# ARF on CRF: The patient's creatinine remained stable within his baseline of 1.2-1.3 for most of his hospitalization.
ARF was felt to be secondary to intravascular depletion given volume losses, as above, and third spacing of fluid given low albumin.
LE edema was worsening on exam, yet adequate hydration was needed given administration of acyclovir.
# Anasarca: During admission the patient developed anasarca, likely secondary to low albumin from malnutrition.
He also developed bilateral pleural effusions, which were improved with thoracenteses, as above.
During this time the patient complained of pleuritic chest pain on the right.
On [**10-31**] a TTE showed large pleural effusions and trivial pericardial effusion.
# Hemoptysis/anemia - history as above.
The patient showed resolving symptoms throughout his hospital course.
He had decreasing nickel to dime-sized clots being expectorated by the time of discharge.
Hct upon discharge was stable at 25; however, this had been slowly declining throughout his hospitalization most likely secondary to slow ooze of blood.
# Pulmonary thrombosis: The patient was diagnosed with a nonobstructing thrombus in L descending pulmonary artery upon admission, which was not treated with anticoagulation given symptoms of hemoptysis.
LENIS were negative, indicating that there was no need for IVC filter.
TTE was performed, which showed no intracardiac clot.
There was no pulmonary thrombus present on repeat imaging on [**10-11**].
# CVS: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF with preserved EF of 50-55% on [**10-6**] Echo.
The patient had recent PMIBI at OSH which was negative.
The patient was continued on lopressor for CAD and rate control.
ASA was held given hemoptysis and can be re-started upon resolution of hemoptysis.
He had increasing peripheral edema on exam in response to holding diuretics to maintain adequate hydration for IV acyclovir.
He was given [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings during admission, and diuretics were restarted with mild decrease in dependent edema.
A foley catheter was placed during admission due to concern for obstruction, but was removed prior to admission.
A RUE US was performed and showed evidence of a non-occlusive thrombus in the right subclavian and axillary veins.
The PICC line was pulled without any anti-coagulation given presentation of hemoptysis and risk for further re-bleeding.
Workup has been negative and the patient continues to decline despite broad-spectrum treatment for possible infectious etiologies.
The patient's family refused any further diagnostic testing at this time, including aspiration of cyst fluid, and opted for discharge with Infectious Disease and Pulmonology follow-up.
