Atrial fibrillation.
Blood loss anemia.
Congestive heart failure.
Urinary tract infection.
Acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.
History of breast cancer with chest wall radiation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year old female with a history of hypertension, breast cancer and colon cancer, who presented to the Emergency Department with a four hour history of substernal chest pain and was found to have anterior lead ST segment elevation and was seen by cardiology at which time ACS protocol was undertaken and the patient was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.
She was tried for a first period on the cool myocardial infarction protocol but this was aborted with the finding of a severe three vessel disease with an ejection fraction of 35 percent and cardiothoracic surgery service was consulted after placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.
Her cardiac catheterization showed that she had one plus mitral regurgitation with 35 percent left ventricular ejection fraction and severe inferior, anterolateral and apical hypokinesis.
The angiography showed distal tapering of 60 to 70 percent of left main coronary artery and proximal ulceration with 90 percent stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and the left circumflex also had 90 percent ostial stenosis with 50 percent proximal stenosis of the right circumflex.
At the time, the patient was seen by the cardiac surgery service, she was afebrile and otherwise was hemodynamically stable.
Her sclerae were anicteric and her conjunctivae were pink.
The neck had no lymphadenopathy.
Otherwise, there was evidence of a radical mastectomy.
Her extremities had no significant varicosities.
The patient was initially unable to extubate secondary to apneic episodes but at the end of postoperative day number one, she was able to wean to extubation.
She remained in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit with some respiratory issues and was noted to have decrease in oxygen saturation over the course of postoperative days number four and five at which time a chest x-ray showed moderate left pleural effusion.
She was being given Lasix but continued to have some respiratory issues secondary to the pleural effusion.
Therefore, she underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2198-7-26**], to assess for any sort of bronchial plugging or lobar collapse.
Given the fact that her respiratory status continued to be her main issue, a left chest tube was placed at which time about 300 to 400 milliliters of serosanguinous fluid were removed.
She did have intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation postoperatively.
Notably, the insertion of her chest tube was complicated by a pneumothorax but this improved gradually with suction.
Otherwise, the remainder of the patient's postoperative stay in the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit was essentially for her atrial fibrillation and maintenance of blood pressure which was somewhat labile given her conversion of rhythms and also secondary to some hypovolemia for which she was given fluid.
The remainder of her hospitalization was essentially remarkable only for an episode of bradycardia to the 40s and sinus bradycardia which was thought to be secondary to a combination of her dose of Amiodarone and Lopressor.
Otherwise, there was no evidence of any ischemia subsequently on her electrocardiograms and she only had small bilateral pleural effusions which were not significantly affecting her respiratory status.
once daily for three days    for urinary tract infection.
