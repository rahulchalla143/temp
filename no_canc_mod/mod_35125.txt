Persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again seen with subsequent shift of the mediastinum/cardiac silhouette to the right.
The cardiac silhouette may be enlarged although the left aspect is not well assessed due to the elevated left hemidiaphragm.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with thickened septal leaflet.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE is suggested to better define the valves.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-23**], the septal tricuspid leaflet thickening and tricuspid regurgitation is increased.

Brief Hospital Course: 65 y/o male with DM II, COPD, and CKD stage V, started on hemodialysis approximately 2.5 weeks prior to admission, who presented with sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia/ HD catheter infection.
ACTIVE ISSUES # Sepsis due to MRSA Bacteremia: He presented without documented fevers but with leukocytosis with left shift and bandemia > 10%, HR>90, RR>20 and hypotension.
CXR revealed a chronically elevated left hemidiaphragm but no clear infiltrate.
Given recent HD line placement there was concern for sepsis from bacteremia.
Blood cultures ultimately revealed MRSA bacteremia.
A TTE was unremarkable for endocarditis.
# CKD stage V: Patient was started on dialysis approximately 2.5 weeks prior to presentation.
He initially required fluid boluses for hypotension but his fluid balance was subsequently managed with Lasix boluses.
He also received several doses of Kayexalate (in addition to Lasix) for hyperkalemia without EKG changes.
There were no acute signs of bleeding and he was guaiac negative.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # COPD on 2L home O2: Patient presented on 2L of oxygen with saturations in the high 90s.
His oxygen requirement increased to 4L during his ICU stay and was attributed to his volume status.
He had several episodes of respiratory distress that resolved with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and was breathing comfortably throughout most of his ICU stay and on the floor.
# Bipolar disorder/Schizoaffective disorder: Patient's affect was stable during this admission, and he had no signs or symptoms of psychosis.
Efforts were made to obtain more information about his diagnoses, as it is perplexing to have both an affective and psychotic disorder diagnosed.
On evaluation by our inpatient Psychiatry team, they recommended no changes to his complex psychiatric medication regimen, since he is so stable at this time.
# Diabetes mellitus II: He was managed on a Humalog ISS during his ICU stay.
He was continued on this on the floor, but required no insulin.
# HTN/dCHF/right heart failure (EF>55%): His Metoprolol and Aspirin 81 mg were continued initially.
Metoprolol was held for hypotension but was restarted prior to floor transfer.
# Rheumatoid arthritis: Continued hydroxychroloquine.
# Depression/Bipolar Disorder/Schizoaffective disorder: Continued divalproex, oxcarbasezpine, risperdone .
# Pulmonary Embolism on Coumadin: He presented with INR of 4.0 and Coumadin was held.
# Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and OSA: He was continued on BiPap throughout his ICU stay and on the floor at night, and intermittently as needed for respiratory distress.
