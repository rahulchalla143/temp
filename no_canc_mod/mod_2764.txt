History of Present Illness: 78 yo M with ESRD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, MGUS who presents with an approximately 7-day h/o desquamative rash that he states began after taking an antibiotic prescribed in [**Country 3594**].
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to a [**Hospital 15762**] hospital [**6-29**] with complaint of sore throat, 'heavy tongue' with difficulty talking, and generalized weakness.
After 3 days of taking the antibiotic, he began to have a generalized, desquamative rash, characterized by desquamation worst on the scrotum and lips, with ulceration, oral bullae, and also involving the trunk and to lesser extent on etremities.
At this point, he continues to experience some pruritis, though states that is has improved somewhat, and does not believe that he has had further ulcers appear over the past few days.
As a result of his oral involvement and some dysphagia, he has had decreased PO intake over the past several days.
Of note, MR. [**Known lastname **] had diffuse skin flaking noted after starting allopurinol [**2102**].
He denies any recent fevers or night sweats, shortness of breath, chest pain, diarrhea or dysuria.
He feels that the 'tongue-heaviness' and weakness have improved somewhat.
ED course also notable for markedly elevated Cr of 6.7, which is significanlty increased from prior measurement of 3.5 [**11-30**].
He was given 30cc of kayexalate for K=5.7, IV fluids for mild dehydration, and a dermatology consultation was obtained.
Thought to be secondary to nephrosclerosis.
Has significant ulceration involving lips, with areas of crusting and hemorrhage.
No oral lesions appreciated currently (per family, had grayish bullae earlier).
No HSM appreciated.
No edema SKIN: crusting hemorrhagic perioral erosions, with superficial desquamation involving primarily his trunk and to lesser extent extremities, with both penile and more significnatly scrotal ulceration, and ulcer involving lateral aspect of distal L lower extremity.
Musculoskeletal: no synovitis currently.
Skin, left ankle, punch (A-B): Subepidermal bullae with hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, scattered dyskeratotic keratinocytes, and a lichenoid lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate (see note).
Note: The findings raise a differential diagnosis including erythema multiforme/[**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Known lastname **] syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and bullous drug disorder.
Note: Sections show an epidermis with focal compact hyperkeratosis, and an interface dermatitis characterized by baso vacuolar degeneration, lymphocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction and dyskeratotic keratinocytes.
The differential diagnosis includes [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] syndrome/erythema multiforme spectrum of disorders or a lichenoid/fixed drug eruption.

No abscess or fluid collection identified.
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
Uncomplicated large right inguinal hernia containing multiple small bowel .
Skin, left lower leg (A-C): Multiple fragments of stratum corneum.
Skin, scrotum (D-E): Skin with ulceration, marked acute and chronic inflammation, focal necrosis and granulation tissue formation (see note).
The lungs demonstrate no focal areas of consolidation or effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
There is no hydronephrosis or stones.
Note is made of a tiny hypodense lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney measuring approximately 9 mm, consistent with a simple cyst.
IMPRESSION: 1) No hydronephrosis.
2) Small echogenic kidneys.
3) Partially distended bladder with a possible fold, although a diverticulum cannot be entirely excluded.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color  Doppler (cannot exclude).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild  (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
There  is no pericardial effusion.
No abscess or fluid collection identified.
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
Uncomplicated large right inguinal hernia containing multiple small bowel loops.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old male with ESRD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, MGUS who presented with Erythema multiform/[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Known lastname **] syndrome after taking allopurinol presumably.
He was managed on the floor in a supportive manner with fluids, empiric antibiotics, and wound care.
There was a question of Fournier's gangrene of the scrotum which was debrided by urology in the OR.
On the floor he had low grade feveres.
His central line was pulled and the tip grew out acinetobacter sensitive to cefepime.
Finally, he developed an acute gouty flare treated with colchicine, oxycodone, and prednisone.
2nd biopsy from leg could also represent TEN or drug reaction.
Dermatology recommended constant skin hydration w/ multiple ointments and topical steroid.
No IgG or steroids were started as the patient presented past the window during which time this is found to be a useful intervention.
The ID service was consulted for persistent fevers and a surveillance culture that showed GPC.
ID service recommended broad empiric antibiotics given travel hx and very complicated patient.
On [**7-15**], the urology service was consulted for worsening pain and skin breakdown on the scrotum and penis.
Line infection: On callout from the MICU, patient was having low grade fevers on the floor.
Patient's central line was d/c and tip grew out cefepime sensitive acinetobacter.
Scrotal lesion: It was minimally debrided for a concern of Fournier's gangrene but it did not appear gangrenous and urology OP note stated edematous but healthy tissue underneath.
The lesion did not appear gangrenous, and the patient remained afebrile with normal WBC.
Samples were also taken for HSV and VXZ.
A-fib: The patient was found to be in paroxysmal a-fib on [**7-10**].
Echo showed no clot.
Coagulation was held initially due to dysphagia and concern for mucosal involvement and bleed risk.
Currently, patient is supratherapeutic on coumadin.
CRI: Pt has baseline renal failure with a Cr of 3.4 in [**2102-11-27**] but presented w/ creatinine of 6.
The renal svc was consulted and he was volume repleted.
He had eos in his urine, so while hypovolemia was most likely the cause of acute on chronic renal failure, could not rule out AIN.
Constipation: Patient w/ h/o hemorrhoids.
On [**7-19**] he developed right knee pain and a low grade fever.
Thus, patient treated w/ renal dose of colchicine.
Currently, his pain is well controlled.
The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 672**] rehab in good condition with improving skin lesions, rate controlled heart in sinus rhythm, and well controlled pain.
Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response 3.
Dermal necrosis of the scrotum.
ESRD - Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis.
Anemia of ESRD/Chronic Disease.
Discharge Condition: afebrile (on steroids), skin healing, heart rate controlled, gout pain controlled.
Discharge Instructions: Monitor for fevers, chills, rashes, worsening knee pain, or increased sedation (on narcotic).
You should also NOT take VANCOMYCIN or CIPROFLOXACIN, as these medications may also have been involved in starting or worsening the rash.
