Complete aortic arch replacement with a 26 mm Dacron     tube graft and a 16 x 8 bifurcated Dacron graft going     from the neo ascending aorta to the left common     carotid artery and the innominate artery.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 49-year-old gentleman who presented with acute chest pain.
CT scan performed in an outside hospital made the diagnosis of an acute type A aortic dissection with the dissection extending from the sinotubular junction down to and including both common iliac arteries.
Peak arterial velocity within the left kidney is decreased compared to the right, though diastolic flow is preserved bilaterally.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
A mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta, arch and descending thoracic aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
The point of origin seems to be in the distal arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is left pleural effusion.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
LVEF 55% Aortic graft is seen in the ascending and arch position without any initimal flap.
There is no aortic regurgitation.
Status post repair of extensive type A aortic dissection with intact and patent ascending aortic graft and bifurcated graft which is anastomosed to the left common carotid and right brachiocephalic arteries.
A small amount of perigraft fluid is demonstrated.
No evidence of leakage from the graft.
Evaluation of the dissection flap within the abdominal aorta is limited due to technique with marked compression on the true lumen demonstrated in the abdominal aorta.
Previous CT from [**Hospital3 10377**] Hospital demonstrated marked compression of the true lumen, which supplied the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.
Two left renal arteries are demonstrated, the superior one appearing to be supplied by both lumens with the dissection flap extending into its proximal aspect, and the inferior left renal artery supplied by the false lumen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 37081**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2131-8-17**] via med flight for emergent management of his type A aortic dissection.
He was taken directly to the operating room where he underwent repair of a type A aortic dissection.
The nephrology service was also consulted and followed him daily for acute tubular necrosis related to hypoperfusion during his surgery.
He remained intubated due to agitation however was able to be extubated on postoperative day three.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12997**] continued to have periods of confusion requiring restraint as he pulled out his catheter and intravenous lines.
Ativan was used with successful control of his agitation and a 24 hour sitter was placed in his room.
Two left renal arteries were demonstrated, the superior one appearing to be supplied by both lumens with the dissection flap extending into its proximal aspect, and the inferior left renal artery supplied by the false lumen.
Labetalol restarted on [**9-26**] for hypertension and his renal function was monitored closely for possible continuing compromise of flow.
Left arm phlebitis continued to improve.Addiction service also consulted.
Discharge Instructions: 1)  Monitor wounds for signs of infection.
These include redness, drainage or increased pain.
In the event that you have drainage from your sternal wound, please contact the [**Name2 (NI) 5059**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1504**].
4)  No lotions, creams or powders to incision until it has healed.
