Chest x-ray showed an endotracheal tube in place and an nasogastric tube in place.
There was los of left diaphragm due to an opacity.
It was unclear whether there was a pneumonia in the left lower lobe versus an effusion.

However, on [**2163-9-7**] the patient complained of sharp pleuritic pain located on the left side of his chest.
Electrocardiogram did not show any acute changes and a chest x-ray was done, which showed an increased left lower lobe opacity.
The patient was started on Vancomycin to cover for staph aureus pneumonia.
CT angio was done, which showed a pulmonary emboli in the right lung, left effusion and a left lower lobe worsening infiltrate.
An ultrasound was done in the pulmonary specialty unit, which revealed a small effusion, which was unable to be tapped.
Due to the pulmonary emboli seen on CT angio the patient was started on heparin.
After starting the heparin the patient continued to complain of pain localized over his chest for which he was given several pain medications including morphine.
He stated that the pain improved within the next few days after starting the heparin.
