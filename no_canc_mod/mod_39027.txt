He has been hospitalized multiple times for COPD exacerbation and pneumonia requiring ICU admission and intubation on a single occasion in [**2131-9-23**], and most recently was discharged in [**Month (only) **] [**2131**] to rehab and has been home for a few weeks.
At baseline he is unable to walk a few steps without getting short of breath and he is not on supplemental O2 at home.
He was in his usual state of health when he developed worsening of his chronic, productive cough of white sputum, worsening dyspnea, and tachypnea last night.
His exam was notable for minimal air sounds and mild wheezes, and he was intermittently tachypneic to the high 30s, with tachycardia to the 130s.
A CXR demonstrated left sided infiltrate, which was confirmed on a chest CTA that was negative for PE but demonstrated multifocal pneumonia.

Pertinent Results: Leukocytosis on admission eventually trended down: (On admission) [**2132-8-3**] 03:10AM   WBC-30.6*# RBC-5.22 HGB-15.4 HCT-47.6# MCV-91 MCH-29.6 MCHC-32.4 RDW-14.2 NEUTS-89* BANDS-2 LYMPHS-3* MONOS-5 EOS-0 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-1* MYELOS-0  (-)UA on admission BCx had NGTD upon discharge.
[**2132-8-3**] CXR IMPRESSION: Interval development of left mid lung hazy opacity , concerning for pneumonia.
[**2132-8-4**] Chest X ray IMPRESSION: Unchanged left mid lung field opacity concerning for pneumonia.
[**2132-8-3**] CTA CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no pulmonary embolism.
The aorta demonstrates no acute pathology.
Moderate coronary calcifications are again noted.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged, compatible with the underlying pneumonia.
There is no definitive hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Again noted are severe emphysematous changes of the lung parenchyma, with upper lobe predominance and also parasagittal bulla in the anterior lungs.
There is interval increase of honeycombing opacity in the left upper lobe, with persistent left lower lobe consolidation, compatible with worsening infectious process in the left lung.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
BONE WINDOW: Multilevel degenerative changes are mild to moderate.
Mild-to-moderate loss of vertebral heights are again noted.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Interval worsening of left-sided multifocal pneumonia.
Near-resolution of right lower lobe pneumonia.
No PE or acute aortic dissection.
Incidental note of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Unchanged severe centrilobular emphysema.
There is non-occlusive thrombus in the superficial femoral vein on the left.
Overall, this represents partial resorption of clot seen on the prior exam [**2131-12-30**].
There is thrombus seen within the duplicated posterior tibial veins.
Partially resorbed clot in the left popliteal vein with persistent thrombus in the left superficial femoral vein.
New thrombus in the right posterior tibial veins.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo male with hx of severe COPD, recent DVT now off coumadin, AAA, and multiple admissions for COPD exacerbations and PNA, p/w COPD exacerbation and found to have multifocal PNA on CT.
COPD Exacerbation: Patient started on ceftriaxone, levaquin, and IV solumedrol on admission and required bipap.
Multifocal PNA: Patient had leukocytosis on admission and found to have evidence of multifocal PNA on CT.
The leukocytosis quickly resolved over the hospitalization and the ceftriaxone was discharged once patient was transferred to general medicine floor.
Cavitary Lung Lesion: Seemed to have decreased based on CT done on admission.
DVT: Patient received duplex ultrasound that demonstrated resolving clot in Left superficial femoral.
New thrombus found in posteriar tibial.
Hyperglycemia: Patient was on insulin sliding scale secondary to steroid use.
