Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Widespread ground-glass attenuation likely represents pulmonary edema as reported on serial chest radiographs, but superimposed asymmetrical foci of consolidation in the lower lobes and 2 small nodules raises the concern for coexisting pulmonary infection.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and anasarca.
[**2187-11-15**] Liver/Gallbladder US: No evidence of a distended gallbladder to suggest cholecystitis.
No significant change in the large right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma, 3.8x3.4cm subacute in stage with surrounding edema, peripheral nodular hyperintense areas and mild mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
No new hemorrhage or acute infarction.
Patent major intracranial arteries without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 3 mm within the resolution of MR angiogram.
Diminutive right distal vertebral artery, likely related to hypoplasia or normal variant (effective PICA termination); left fetal PCA.
Moderate amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on both sides and small amount in the left side of the sphenoid sinus.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 52F with OCD (stable recently, but h/o OD, anorexia and alcohol use in past), ileostomy, GERD with delayed gastric emptying, who presented to [**Hospital3 3765**] on [**10-28**] with nausea and dizziness.
There she was initially dx'd with dehydration, ARF and UTI but then found to have ALT of 25,370 and of AST 11,490, total bili of 2.0, INR of 4.0, Cr of 3.0.
She had been having fevers for ~10 days.
She continued to have general malaise and fevers despite bactrim and asa.
On [**10-28**] she called her PCP who recommended some tylenol.
There she was initially dx'd with dehydration, ARF and UTI.
She was thought to be in hyperacute fulminant liver failure either secondary to Bactrim reaction versus acetaminophen toxicity - tylenol level peaked at 10.0 >24 hrs after last ingestion.
She became progressively obtunded, with significant encephalopathy requiring intubation and ventilatory support.
She became progressively more coagulopathic, and it was thought that she was most likely going to need orthotopic liver transplantation for survival.
During her stay in the SICU, she required respiratory ventilation, vasopressors for hypotension and intracranial pressure monitoring.
The vasopressors were weaned by ICU day 6, and there was no further requirement for this.
Given the concern for hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema, ICP was initiated.
She had removal of her intracranial bolt on [**11-6**], [**2187**], and it was noted on subsequent imaging that she had approximately a 4-cm, right frontal, intracranial hemorrhage.
This was followed serially with CT scans and there was no progression of the bleeding.
The bleeding was thought to be secondary to her severe coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia in the setting of her instrumentation.
She was started on Keppra for seizureprophylaxis to finish a 10-day course.
In terms of her respiratory status, it is noted that the patient required full ventilatory support with hypoxic respiratory failure.
She initially did well, but, secondary to what was thought to be pulmonary edema, required reintubation on [**2187-11-13**] after failure of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.
She had some degree of what appeared to be an ARDS-type reaction or transfusion-associated lung injury.
The patient also spiked fevers intermittenly starting [**11-7**].
She was on Vancomycin fom [**2187-10-31**] for ppx with bold placement.
Zosyn was added for the concern for PNA when she spiked fevers and had a leukocytosis.
She then developed a drug rash leading to the discontinuation of Vanc and Zosyn on [**11-10**].
1 Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: s/p bolt removal with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy [**3-3**] liver failure.
EEG from [**11-19**] without epileptiform activity, consistent with encephalitis and focal findings consistent with intraparenchymal bleed.
She has had no evidence of seizure activity and is currently off seizure prophylaxis.
Pt failed video swallow [**11-20**].
# ARF- Possibly [**3-3**] AIN from Bactrim/ tylenol possibly with ATN component.
Of note, nephrology thinks that her ongoing acidosis is likely related to her liver pathology and does not think bicarbonate should be used to correct this.
# Respiratory failure- stable since extubation [**11-16**].
# Hepatic failure- LFT's leveling off.
# Fevers- currently resolved, afebrile since transfer to the floor.
Pt now without foley but incontinence also a risk factor for UTI.
However, pt currently afebrile with WBC 11.1. .
Likely due to reactive physiology.
iron/ TIBC ratio 17% indicating mild iron deficiency.
# Sacral decub: Pt with sacral decub developed in house.
Access- right PICC PPX- lansoprazole, no anticoagulation with h/o intraparenchymal bleed.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hyperacute fulminant hepatic failure Secondary diagnoses: Acute Renal failure Increased intracranial pressure s/p Bolt procedure Intraparenchymal bleed Aphasia Dysphagia OCD Anemia Drug rash   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with liver failure.
We are unsure of the exact cause of your liver failure at this time but we think it was a reaction to the tylenol and bactrim you had been taking.
In addition, you had increased pressure in your brain from your liver failure while you were here.
After this was removed, it was noticed that you had a bleed into your brain.
If you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, nausea, vomitting, yellowing of your skin or eyes, blood in your urine or any other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor or return to the ED.
