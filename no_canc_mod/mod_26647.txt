Admission Date: [**2147-11-15**]        Discharge Date: [**2148-2-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2147-11-15**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NB   HISTORY:  [**Known lastname 65231**] was born at 27-1/7 weeks and admitted to the newborn ICU with respiratory distress and prematurity.
Maternal history notable for previous early gestation loss and cerclage placement in this pregnancy at 14 weeks.
Pregnancy was complicated by premature prolonged rupture of membranes on [**11-3**] at 25-4/7 weeks.
Ultrasound at that time showed estimated fetal weight of 1100 grams with a very low amniotic fluid index.
The mother remained stable until the night prior to delivery when she developed a fever to 100.7 and painful contractions.
Ultrasound revealed estimated fetal weight of 1028 grams and a biophysical profile of [**5-16**] with an amniotic fluid index of 1.4.
Delivery proceeded via vaginal route and infant emerged with good tone, but limited respiratory effort and poor aeration.
She was resuscitated with stimulation, oxygen, and positive pressure ventilation.
She was intubated at approximately 6 minutes of life for persistent respiratory distress and brought to the newborn ICU where she was placed on synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation and given surfactant.
In general, she was an active, appropriately developed preterm infant vigorous with exam in moderate respiratory distress at rest with SIMV.
Her skin was warm, pink, and well perfused without rashes.
Mild molding.
Chest: Tight breath sounds, poor aeration, coarse grunting, flaring, and retracting.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur or gallop.
Abdomen: Soft, 3-vessel cord, no masses, no hepatosplenomegaly, quiet bowel sounds.
However, on day of life 2, became symptomatic for patent ductus arteriosus which was confirmed by echocardiogram.
She had a continuous soft grade 1/6 systolic murmur on exam and remained with normal blood pressures.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed which revealed a clinically insignificant PDA without left-to-right shunting.
Currently, her heart rate is 140-160, blood pressure 73/40 with a mean of 51 and a soft holosystolic murmur is present at the left upper sternal border.
In the interim, she received caffeine for apnea of prematurity on day 1 through day 49.
Her last apneic episode with any bradycardia or desaturation occurred on [**1-27**].
She was also started on Diuril on day of life 38 which was 114 because of chronic lung disease.
She continues to breathe comfortable in room breathing 40s-50s with very mild subcostal retractions with activity.
She had 1 episode of hypoglycemia noted on day of life 8 which responded to an increased glucose infusion rate.
She had transient decreased carbon dioxide in her serum which was corrected with adjustments to her parenteral nutrition.
She started on enteral feeds on day of life 5 and advanced without incident to full enteral volume by day of life 12 at which time her calories were increased to a maximum of breast milk 32 calories with ProMod fed over an hour and a [**12-11**] by gavage.
She was noted to have transient idiopathic hypernatremia which has resolved without treatment.
She tolerated her enteral advance of feedings and increased calories without incident.
Her placental pathology revealed cellular changes consistent with acute chorioamnionitis.
She received 7 days of antibiotics at which time a lumbar puncture revealed pleocytosis with a white count of 15,000, 33,000 red blood cells, protein 231, glucose 20.
Culture and Gram stain remain negative.
Neurology: Head ultrasound on day 7 revealed moderate ventriculomegaly.
Serial ultrasounds performed subsequent to that on day of life 10 and subsequent to that on [**11-27**], [**12-15**], [**12-27**] revealed ventriculitis, echogenic material in the lateral and 4th ventricle consistent with meningitis.
Her most recent head ultrasound on [**1-31**] revealed the ventricles to be normal in size, parenchymal echotexture is normal, and no extra-axial fluid collections seen.
She was noted to have upper extremity tightness upon her initial exam felt to be due to the oligohydramnios.
Serial exams revealed progressive retinopathy of prematurity advancing to stage I, zone II in the left, immature zone II on the right.
Initial screen showed increased tyrosine level likely secondary to parenteral nutrition with normal follow up.
Subsequent screens reveals an alpha-thalassemia trait.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Prematurity at 27-1/7 weeks, premature prolong rupture of membranes, respiratory distress syndrome status post surfactant replacement, patent ductus arteriosus status post indomethacin, apnea of prematurity, physiologic jaundice, sepsis suspect, meningitis with ventriculitis, retinopathy of prematurity, anemia of prematurity.
