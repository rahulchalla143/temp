Admission Date:  [**2141-3-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-3-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-3-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vicodin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Pneumonia, septic shock  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization [**3-13**]  History of Present Illness: This is a 61 year old female with PMH of interstitial lung disease presenting from an OSH for concern of septic shock in the setting of possible PNA vs. pancreatic process on imaging.
Review of the record indicates that her symptoms began 5 days prior with SOB, cough, and sputum production.
She did have a diffuse mild back ache the day prior to admission per her husband.
At OSH, she arrived in respiratory distress and was started on BiPAP with initial improvement per report.
CXR was read as PNA in setting of interstitial lung disease.
She then became hypotensive with SBPs in the 60s despite 2L IVFs and her RR was in the 50s per report.
She was given CTX and azithromycin at OSH for CAP and no further abx were given in the ED.
A CT torso was  performed and prelimiarily suggestive of a pneumonia superimposed on chronic interstital lung disease changes.
The was no PE, but there was evidence of gall bladder distention and fat stranding around the head of his pancreas.
A bedside u/s in the ED did not appreciate a pericardial effusion.
Her EKG showed a rate of 99, NA/NI, no STEMI.
Repeat EKG on arrival showed ST elevations in I, avL, and V2 and a code STEMI was called.
Past Medical History: Interstitial lung disease   Social History: - Tobacco: Never a smoker - Alcohol:  No drinks - Illicits:  No history of IV drug use   Family History: Mother passed from cancer (brain metastsis) Father passed from cancer   Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.2, BP: 186/126, P: 127, R: 26 O2: 99% on FiO2=50% assist control vent settings General: intubated, sedated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, ET tube in place, PERRL Neck: supple, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present GU: Foley in place draining clear urine Ext: warm, well perfused, Dopplerable DP/PT pulses bilaterally, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema Neuro: intubated/sedated   Pertinent Results: [**3-13**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal third of the ventricle and severe hypokinesis of the mid inferior and inferolateral walls.
The apex is mildly aneurysmal/akinetic.. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with apical aneurysm and dysfunction c/w Takostubo cardiomyopathy or mid-LAD disease.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Fibrotic changes in the lungs with bilateral lower lobe predominance.
Denser peribronchovascular opacities and scattered ground-glass opacities are concerning for acute superimposed infection.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Mild distention of the gallbladder and dilation of CBD.
Gallbladder wall edema versus pericholecystic fluid.
These findings could indicate pancreatitis or possible biliary source of infection.
Multiple hepatic and renal hypodensities most compatible with simple cysts.
Moderate new free fluid in the pelvis of uncertain etiology.
No evidence of abscess or osteomyelitis.
Chronic compression fracture of T12 vertebral body with minimal retropulsion as described above.
Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine at multiple levels without significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 61 year old female with PMH of interstitial lung disease presenting from an OSH for septic shock in the setting of a PNA.
# Septic Shock:  Patient had a fever to 102 on arrival with a WBC that trended up from 15.2 to 27.2 over the course of 6 hours since admission.
She was intubated with CT imaging showing pulmonary findings concerning for infection on top of a chronic interstitial lung disease.
She improved dramatically but had no positive cultures and prolonged hypotension requiring pressors until [**3-16**].
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim was performed for prolonged hypotension which was negative.
# Respiratory Failure:  The patient was intubated at an OSH prior to arrival here likely secondary to pneumonia on top of her baseline interstitial lung disease.
She was extubated on [**3-14**] without difficulty.
# Stress cardiomyopathy:  A code STEMI was called on arrival to ICU as patient had frank ST elevations in I, AVL, and V2.
An ECHO showed evidence of a stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo's) with an EF=40-45%.
# T12 compression fracture:  Patient has had back pain with right foot numbness but no motor deficits since the end of [**2140-12-29**].
She is on oxycodone and Flexeril as an outpatient but says that she gets minimal relief from these medications.
An MRI of her lumbar spine and pelvis was performed and positive only for a chronic compression fracture of T12.
Spine consult was obtained and recommended pain control only and no need for surgical intervention or TLSO brace.
The pt would like to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] for following for both her Interstitial Lung Disease and Stress Induced Cardiomyopathy.
Unfortunately these appointments could not be made for her as [**Hospital1 18**] is not a preferred provider with her insurance.
At the time of discharge pt requested a large quantity of Dilaudid pills, out of proportion to her requirement while hospitalized.
Disp:*10 patches* Refills:*0* 7. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheeze / sob.
of [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hospital Acquired Pneumonia T12 vertebral compression fracture  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with a pneumonia and also found to have a T12 vertebral compression fracture in your spine.
We treated your pneumonia with antibiotics.
The spine surgeons evaluated your fracture and have determined that you don't need surgery or to wear a back brace.
The following changes have been made to your medications: START: Lidocaine Patch for back pain Hydromorphone for back pain Naproxen for back pain Calcitonin for bone health Warfarin for anticoagulation Fentanyl patch for pain Calcium for bone health Vitamin D for bone health Alendronate for bone health   Followup Instructions: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Thursday [**2141-3-23**] @2:00pm [**Apartment Address(1) 92248**] [**Location (un) 9188**], MA
