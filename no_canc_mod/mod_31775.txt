Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 67yo F w/ a PMH of CHF, HTN, CRI and COPD who was found at her [**Hospital1 1501**] to be acutely SOB this AM, likely due to flash pulmonary edema.
# CHF: Patient was admitted with shortness of breath and pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive crisis.
The etiology of her pulmonary edema was unclear but was felt to be secondary to her high blood pressure.
Upon arrival to the MICU she was no longer significantly short of breath and was satting well on 3 L nasal cannula.
She was noted to have a slightly elevated troponin which peaked at 0.22 but she did not complain of any chest pain and had no EKG changes.

Her renal function was at her baseline and she had no evidence of encephalopathy.
# Elevated Lactate:  On admission the patient was noted to have a lactate of 4.9 with evidence of an anion gap metabolic acidosis.
It was thought that this was likely due to hypoperfusion in the setting of hypertensive crisis.
On admission she had no evidence of COPD exacerbation.
