Her pregnancy with conceived by IVF.
She is advanced maternal age and some gestational hypertension and Crohn disease.
However, over the last week and a half her amniotic fluid volume has lessened.
The patient had felt active fetal movement but given the gestational age that she was at and the low persistent amniotic fluid, she is consented for delivery.
Pt underwent repeat low transverse cesarean section.
She tolerated the exam well, however, given the large amount of blood and low blood pressure and her heart rate being in the 140s, the resource nurse, anesthesia and OB hemorrhage protocol was called.
While in the ICU pt required lasix for pulmonary edema with good response by urine output.
Pt treated with 10mg IV lasix as this was thought to be secondary to pulmary edema as pt had crackles on exam and was net positive on I/O's.
On [**12-22**], pt's temperature increased to 101.0, and she was treated with gentamycin and clindamycin for concern for endometritis given uterine instramentation for 24hours afebrile.
Pt continued to have a 4L O2 requirement and there was concern for pulmonary embolism given pt's multiple intrauterine procedures.
She underwent CTA which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism but mild fluid overload and bibasilar atelectasis.
