Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: HPI: 67 yo M w/PMHx sx for COPD and tobacco use who presented to an OSH today after a neighbor found him to be very dyspneic.
Per report, pt had been sick for three weeks with weakness and fever, with a productive cough with yellow sputum production, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, and difficulty breathing.
He also noted chest pressure.
[**Name (NI) **] report, patient had temperature to 101, with HR 120s, with O2 sats of 96% on 6L, with progressively increasing tachypnea and cyanosis on presentation to the OSH.
Patient was intubated at OSH for hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be [**2-18**] pneumonia.
Patient was also noted to have a leukocytosis with WBC of 24, with left shift and 1% bandemia, and a CXR which per report showed a LLL PNA.
Patient was also noted to have dark emesis/hemoptysis with NGT placement, and protonix was started.
Father with MI in 80s.
No scleral icterus.
Poor air movement throughout.
No rales or rhonchi.
No fluid wave.
No organomegaly.
Densely calcified pancreas, consistent with chronic calcific pancreatitis.
Poorly-defined multifocal patchy, nodular opacities seen distributed throughout the lungs bilaterally, with upper lobe predominance.
Findings are nonspecific but could be of infectious or possibly inflammatory etiology.
Enlarged left adrenal gland, incompletely evaluated on this single-phase study.
Small low attenuation lesion seen within the left kidney, possibly representing cyst but too small to characterize by CT. 6.
Low attenuation lesion seen in the anterior subcutaneous soft tissue, possibly representing sebaceous cyst.
No definite evidence malignancy identified on this study, however, this study was only performed with a single phase of contrast, limiting assessment for more subtle lesions, especially within the liver.
LIVER AND GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND: Liver is of normal echogenicity and echotexture and no focal lesions are identified.
No intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.
The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones.
[**3-21**] CT chest: FINDINGS: As compared to the prior study, there has been interval worsening of the multifocal areas of peribronchial consolidation in the upper lobes bilaterally.
Mild peribronchial infiltration in the lingula, right middle lobe, and lower lobes, and two more discrete nodular focal opacities in the right lower lobe (3A: 44) are unchanged.
Bibasal posterior subsegmental atelectasis are new.
A focal area of consolidation in the superior segment of the left lower lobe posteriorly is new.
There has been interval increase in size and number of multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, for instance, an 11-mm right lower paratracheal lymph node was 9 mm previously; a 9-mm left lower paratracheal lymph node was 6 mm in the past.
Bilateral mildly enlarged hilar lymph nodes are stable.
Dense calcification is seen in the right brachiocephalic artery.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A small layering left pleural effusion is new.
Dense calcifications through the pancreas are again noted.
Previously described small cortical lesions in the kidneys are not seen on this nonenhanced study.
Diffuse increase in density of the mesentery and subcutaneous fat in the abdomen could be due to anasarca.
The 25 x 30 mm low-attenuation oval-shaped lesion in the anterior subcutaneous abdominal wall is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo with h/o COPD, alcoholism, prsented to OSH with several weeks of fever, productive cough, hemoptysis and weight loss.
In the OSH intubated for hypercarbic resp failure and transferred here.
Despite improvement he still had a leukocytosis with immature forms.
A chest CT was notable for diffuse bronchiolitis.
Patient also had persistent diarrhea with multiple negative c diffs.
Believe to have aspergillous bronchiolitis.
With concern for cirrhosis (although none seen on ultrasound) should get weekly LFTs (have been normal here).
# Alkalosis: Patient has mixed acid-base with metabolic alkalosis (contraction) with chronic respiratory acidosis.
Can give lomotil prn for diarrhea.
With question of liver disease might still consider outpatient EGD, especially if repeat bleeding.
# Adrenal gland: Possibly enlarged on CT scan.
# Chronic pancreatitis: Found to have calcifications of pancreas on CT scan without elevation amylase/lipase.
You appear to have developed an aspergillus bronchiolitis.
You had an episode of melena (blood in your stool).
You were found to have heavy calcifications in your pancreas suggestive of possible chronic pancreatitis.
