Compared to prior EKG from [**2170-5-11**]: A-V paced rhythm w left axis, wide QRS.
CXR [**2171-9-14**]: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypo/akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall.
The apex is mildly dyskinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel CAD.
The LMCA was large, ectatic, with mild disease.
The proximal LAD was large, ectatic with mild disease.
The mid LAD was heavily calcified and subtotally occluded, with serial 80-90% stenosis more distally.
The distal LAD had a 50% stenosis and apical LAD had an 80% stenosis.
D2 had a 50% origin stenosis.
THe LCX was a small caliber (2mm) diffusely diseased vessel with an 80% origin stenosis but supplied very little LV.
The RCA had an upward takeoff with a mid-vessel 20% ISR and more diffuse disease distally.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with a 3.0 x 24mm Driver bare metal stent and POBA of the distal LAD with a 2.5 x 20 NC [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 108633**].
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated systemic arterial hypertension (153/65 mmHg), mild pulmonary arterial hypertension (38/19/26 mmHg), and mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures (mean RAP 11mmHg, RVEDP 13 mmHg, mean PCWP 13 mmHg).
Moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD and POBA of the distal LAD.
Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Non-contrast CT pelvis [**2171-9-20**]: Small hematoma in the right proximal thigh anteriorly but no evidence of lower abdominal or pelvic retroperitoneal hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] is an 86yo woman with known CAD who was admitted for NSTEMI.
# NSTEMI->STEMI: Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] presented to the hospital after having six hours of substernal chest pressure which had resolved on its own.
She presented with T-wave inversions in V2-V4 and Twave flattening in V5-V6 on EKG; serial EKGs showed impressive T-wave changes, deepening T-waves in V1-V6 with no ST depressions or elevations.
She was being treated with IV heparin while awaiting cardiac catheterization when she was noted to have marked ST elevations on telemetry.
When prompted, she endorsed recurrence of her chest pain and she was sent for emergent cardiac catheterization and transferred to the cardiology ICU.
Catheterization revealed 3 vessel disease with subtotal 80-90% occlusion of her mid LAD.
This occurred in the setting of catheterization and volume resuscitation.
Nevertheless, a CT pelvis was obtained and did not show evidence of retroperitoneal bleed or significant hematoma.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Shortly after her cardiac cath, Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] had low blood pressures and low urine output.
This was felt to be due to volume loss/blood loss with decreased systolic function.
However, several days later she became somewhat volume overloaded on exam and required some gentle IV diuresis.
She is not being discharged on lasix, but her volume status should be monitored as an outpatient.
# Abdominal tenderness: Significant reflux disease with very tender abdomen.
She was given ranitidine to treat GERD as PPIs should be avoided while she is on plavix.
Hydrocortisone 2.5 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Rectal TID (3 times a day) as needed for itching.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
