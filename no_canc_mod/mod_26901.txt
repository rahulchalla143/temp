No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet flail.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Pt was in sinus/ junctional tachycardia 1.
A mitral annuloplasty ring is seen well seated.
Some [**Male First Name (un) **] is noted that significantly improved with Beta Blockade and volume infusion.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-1-6**], the mitral valve has been repaired; trace mitral regurgitation is present.
SINGLE VIEW, CHEST: Unchanged loculated pleural effusion in the right minor fissure.
Mild interstitial edema and vascular engorgement slightly more prominent compared to prior study.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Slight interval progression of vascular engorgement with mild interstitial edema.
Unchanged right loculated pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis and mediastinal air.
Underwent MVrepair via sternotomy on [**1-6**] after mini-right thoracotomy approach was abandoned due to lung adhesions.Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on titrated phenylephrine and propofol drips.Extubated early in the AM POD #1.
Shower daily, let water flow over wounds, pat dry with a towel.
