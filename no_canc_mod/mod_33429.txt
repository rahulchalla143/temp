Small amount of hemorrhage in the b/l occipital horns, ?
third ventricle.
Mass effect on the 4th ventricle.
No shift of normally midline structures, e/o tonsillar herniation or overt hydrocephalus.
CTA: no flow limiting stenosis, large aneurysm or e/o dissection.
Both PCAs are seen well with no evidence of aneurysm or vasculitis.
Very prominent dural branch was seen with no evidence of dural AV fistula.
Left internal carotid artery arteriogram shows normal filling of the left internal carotid artery and its branches.
The left internal carotid artery fills well along the cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid portion.
Both anterior and middle cerebral arteries are seen well with no evidence of aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations or AV fistula.
Left common carotid artery arteriogram shows normal carotid bifurcation with no evidence of stenosis.
Left external carotid artery arteriogram shows no evidence of dural AV fistula or AVMs.
There is some tortuosity at the origin of the left PICA artery.
Right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows normal filling of the right internal carotid artery; the A1 is noted to be hypoplastic.
There is a very prominent superior hypophyseal artery with filling of the pituitary gland, however, no dural AV fistula is seen.
There is some early venous drainage from this pituitary area.
There is a prominent branch of the right cavernous carotid possibly supplying the meninges in the middle fossa.
Right external carotid artery arteriogram shows normal filling of the right external carotid artery and its branches with no evidence of dural AV fistula.
Right common femoral artery arteriogram shows normal filling of the right common femoral artery with no evidence of stenosis.
IMPRESSION:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] underwent cerebral arteriography which failed to reveal a source of his subarachnoid hemorrhage; specifically no aneurysms, AVMs or dural AV fistula was noted.
There was a prominent right superior hypophyseal artery with early venous drainage from the pituitary fossa, however, this was not really consistent with a dural AV fistula.
[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT) Study Date of [**2159-3-27**] 9:55 AM  FINDINGS: There is normal spontaneous phasic flow, compressibility and augmentation, without evidence of intraluminal filling defect.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
CT BRAIN PERFUSION Study Date of [**2159-3-28**] 11:30 AM  Final Report HISTORY: 48-year-old male with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: As expected, there has been progressive decrease in the conspicuity and quantity of subarachnoid hemorrhage, with small foci of persistent blood products seen interdigitating in the sulci in the left frontoparietal region (2:21).
There is also decrease in conspicuity of tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layering posteriorly in the lateral ventricles (2:18).
No new site of hemorrhage is seen.
There has been no development of hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of major vascular territory infarction.
The right maxillary sinus demonstrates partial opacification with air-fluid level, and the left maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst is partially imaged (2:1).
CTA HEAD: There has been progression of development of vasospasm involving the posterior circulation, with the basilar artery both narrowed in caliber and quite irregular distally, well seen on axial source images, and well demonstrated on curved reformation images.
This is new since the CT perfusion study [**2159-3-23**], and increased since the cerebral angiogram of [**2159-3-26**] which demonstrated slight irregularity of the basilar artery, but essentially normal caliber at that time.
There is no vascular occlusion or aneurysm.
The anterior circulation demonstrates maintenance of normal caliber, without evidence of vasospasm.
CT PERFUSION: There is no regional abnormality of mean transit time or cerebral blood flow, and the cerebral blood volume appears symmetric.
Decreased conspicuity and amount of left subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No evidence of acute ischemia.
[**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 1730**] E [**Age over 90 86147**] M  48  [**2110-5-1**]   CT BRAIN PERFUSION Study Date of [**2159-3-30**] 10:23 AM  FINDINGS:  HEAD CT: Again prominence of the ventricles seen with temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] prominence and small amount of blood within the occipital horns, unchanged from previous study.
No evidence of loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation seen or no new hemorrhage identified.
CT PERFUSION: CT perfusion demonstrates no territorial areas of abnormal perfusion.
Within the anterior circulation, no evidence of vascular occlusion is identified.
There remains hypoplastic A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery which is unchanged.
There is no evidence of occlusive vasospasm seen in the anterior circulation.
No definite aneurysm is identified.
Head CT shows slight prominence of ventricles with a small amount of blood in the ventricles.
No new hemorrhage.
CT perfusion of the head demonstrates no evidence of asymmetric perfusion or large territorial area of perfusion abnormality.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates vasospasm involving the basilar artery which is unchanged from [**2159-3-28**] but new since [**2159-3-19**].
No evidence of vasospasm seen in the anterior circulation.
There was no aneurysm detected.
On [**3-21**], patient remains nonfocal with a mild [**2-7**] headache.
He had a repeat angiogram on [**2159-3-26**] which was negative for aneurysm.
Patient continues to have a headache, but will be transitioned to PO meds.
He remains nonfocal and a CTA was oredered to access for vasospasm.
CTA showed vasospam of basilar and bilateral PCAs.
