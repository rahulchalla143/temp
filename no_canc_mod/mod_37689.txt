There is no pneumothorax.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling pressures with RVEDP 13mmHg and mildly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure with PCWP 14mmHg.
Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes.
Q-T interval prolongation and slowing of the rate as compared with prior tracing of [**2121-12-4**].
[**2121-12-5**] Chest x-ray IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-4**]: There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or mediastinal widening.
There is no edema manifested elsewhere in the lungs and pleural effusion if any is minimal.
[**2121-12-5**] US vein study FINDINGS: Focus color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] evaluation of bilateral subclavian and internal jugular veins demonstrated normal flow and compressibility.
There was no hematoma in the surrounding soft tissue.
IMPRESSION: Normal flow and compressibility of bilateral internal jugular veins without evidence of internal jugular vein thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE:  [**12-1**] - Episode of hypertension to 190/82 overnight treated with an extra home dose Nadolol - Obtained ABG due to concern regarding tachypnea although saturating well, 7.53/34/108/29 BaseXS .
F/U peritoneal cultures, blood cultures, stool cultures.
- ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Mild resting outflow tract [**Month/Year (2) **].
Minimal aortic stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-7-2**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased while the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased.
[**12-3**] - Mental status clearing.
Was tachycardic at times during [**Month/Year (2) 2286**], but maintained pressure.
Sinus tachycardia.
===== FLOOR COURSE:  The following issues were addressed during this admission after the patient was transferred to the floor:  # Altered mental status.
Worsening cirrhosis is a possibility.
# Pulmonary hypertension.
Patient had no further arrhythmia after arrival to the floor.
However, echocardiogram raised concern for possible pulmonary hypertension that could represent a contraindication to [**Month/Day (3) **].
# Wheeze, shortness of breath.
Once transferred to the floor, the patient experienced no further symptoms.
Repeat CXR showed no evidence of worsening infiltrate.
# UE venous study.
As Swan [**Last Name (un) 26645**] catheter was not possible to place, there was concern for possible venous occlusion in the upper extremity.
Patient underwent an ultrasound study which showed patent vessels.
She considered this degree of ascites consistent with her baseline and had no pain or shortness of breath so therapeutic tap was deferred.
# Diabetes mellitus type II.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Hepatic encephalopathy - Cirrhosis of the liver secondary to hepatitis C virus  Secondary: - Diabetes mellitus type II - End stage renal disease, on hemodialysis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] with confusion.
This will help to prevent confusion in the future.
