Diffuse, dense vascular calcifications, including coronary artery calcifications, much greater than expected for patient's age.
Extensive collateral venous drainage with associated focal narrowing of the left subclavian vein.

Brief Hospital Course: # Hypertensive urgency: Pt has a history of widely fluctuating BP [**3-17**] autonomic instability.
There is no sign of end-organ damage now with the HTN.
He at one point became hypotensive and required bolus of 500ccs, with BP meds held.
He complained of back pain which is a new complaint in him, and CTA chest was reassuring that there was no aortic dissection.
# N/V and abdominal pain: Pt with multiple admissions with similar complaints, etiology [**3-17**] gastroparesis, pain is now resolved.
He responds to dilaudis and ativan.
Abdomen-pelvis CT was obtained to rule out other pathologies that might have been masked by gastroparesis.
