HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old mostly Spanish-speaking male with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes, coronary artery disease, multiple line infections, recent presumed osteo of cervical spine, who presents from an outside hospital for a question of seizure.
The patient was feeling poorly on the morning of admission as well as at hemodialysis, complaining of increasing shortness of breath as well as shaking of the upper extremities which was interpreted as a possible seizure activity.
Head CT was negative for a mass or bleed.
History of MRSA epidural abscess, status post L2-3 I&D in [**2144-5-15**].
History of line infections with MRSA, VRE, Klebsiella.
History of thrombosis in the right IJ, right subclavian, right brachiocephalic from [**2145-9-14**].
Left IJ and left brachiocephalic clots.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Left AV fistula with positive thrill.
The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, new T wave inversions in V4 through V6, no peak Ts, no ST elevations or depressions, no Q waves.
No significant changes from [**2145-11-14**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 63-year-old mostly Spanish-speaking male with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presents with a question of seizures, intubated, now transferred to the floor with probable SVC syndrome and access issues.
NEUROLOGY:  It is unlikely that the patient ever had a seizure.
It is much more likely that the patient was simply having symptomatic hypoglycemia.
His head CT was negative, and his MRI was negative for bleed but showed only old bilateral lacunar disease.
No lumbar puncture was performed because of a low index of suspicion for infectious sources of mental status changes.
Given the new upper torso pitting edema and concern for SVC, it is probable that some of these clots have migrated into the path of the SVC.
The patient was also sent for hypercoagulability workup.
The patient was noted to have a protein S deficiency, but this may not be significant in the presence of active clotting.
This showed the presence of only left-sided internal jugular clots.
ACCESS:  On admission, the patient had an old left EJ versus subclavian that was inserted on this past admission about two weeks ago.
The patient also has a left AV fistula with positive thrill, however, poor blood flow was noted during hemodialysis on [**2145-11-24**].
The patient is status post fistulogram and angioplasty of that same AV fistula about a week and a half ago.
If AV fistula is not viable, Transplant Surgery will need to reassess the fistula, and a temporary Perma-Cath will need to be placed.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient is currently being treated for presumed osteomyelitis in the setting of MSSA bacteremia that was noted on past admissions.
His chest x-ray initially indicated the presence of opacity, but the final read was read as atelectasis.
The most likely source of the fever is the left-sided EJ versus subclavian that was placed on the last admission.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2145-11-25**], which showed an EF of 60-70%, bidirectional stent, ASD, normal free wall motion, and mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient has anemia secondary to renal failure.
