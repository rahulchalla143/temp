DIAGNOSIS: Massive hemoptysis from right middle lobe aneurysm, bronchial artery aneurysm.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 20-year-old normally healthy woman who developed shoulder pain and took two ibuprofen.
Additionally, flexible bronchoscopy demonstrated a pulsatile mass in the right middle lobe which upon evaluation opened up and began bleeding massive amounts of blood.
He evacuated the airways of 600 cc of blood and placed a bronchial blocker down the right main stem bronchus and inflated it.
The bronchial blocker balloon was deflated and there was no further bleeding.
The following day she went to the invasive radiology angio suite and had a aortogram which demonstrated a right middle lobe bronchial artery aneurysm.
This was successfully embolized due to desaturations and in the radiology suite she was placed on double lung ventilation and subsequently developed massive mediastinal air and high fevers.
High fevers, hypotension and sepsis.
Additionally we will obtain a CT scan to rule out a parenchymal mass.
There is no evidence on bronchoscopy or CT scan of any residual mass or aneurysm within the right frontal lobe.
