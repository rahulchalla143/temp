NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
TISSUE (Final [**2185-3-5**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had mild plaquing.
The LAD had a 50% distal stenosis.
The LCx and RCA had mild luminal irregularities without angiographically evident flow limiting stenosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures, with RVEDP of 12 mm Hg and LVEDP of 32 mm Hg.
Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was elevated at 43 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation.
The LVEF was 40% with global hypokinesis.
Supravalvular aortography revealed 4+ aortic regurgitation.
Severe aortic regurgitation.
Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA.
No thrombus in the LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild symmetric LVH.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Moderate global LV hypokinesis.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined - suspect 3 but can not rule out commissural fusion.
There is systolic doming of the aortic valve leaflets.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A likely torn mitral chordae is seen in the left ventricular cavity.
Mild to moderate ([**1-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Biventricular systolic function is improved.
There is septal dysynchrony most likely secondary to ventricular pacing.
There is a bileaflet prosthesis in the aortic position.
There is at least trace valvular aortic regurgitation.
A small perivalvular jet can not be ruled out.
The mitral regurgitation is improved, now mild.
No other significant changes from pre bypass study.
The lung volumes are low on the current exam and this may contribute to a larger contour of the heart although close follow up is recommended to exclude the true cardiac enlargement which may be consistent with pericardial effusion.
The bibasal atelectases are mild to moderate most likely related to recent discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.
No appreciable pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusion is seen.
