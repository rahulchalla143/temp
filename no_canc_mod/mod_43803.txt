Upon arrival to the ED he was found to have ST elevations in V1-V5 with ST depressions in  II, III, AvF and Q waves in v1-V5 and new RBB.
He was urgently taken to cardiac cath where he was found to have complete acute occlusion of the proximal LAD with an completely occluded RCA and 90% occluded circumflex.
During the procedure the patient had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and underwent electrocardioversion several times and started on amiodarone.
He became hypotensive and was started on dopamine 15mcg/kg.
Bedside echo showed an VEF of 20-25% with 3+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 6**] aortic balloon pump was not placed because he has a tortuous aorta.

#ECHO on [**2-21**]: LVEF = 20% ; 3+ MR ; Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior wall, septum, distal LV segments and apex.
There is hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 20%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen (no papillary muscle rupture or frank prolapse seen).
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel CAD.
The LMCA had no obstruction.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and right sided filling pressures, cardiogenic shock with a PCWP of 40 with V waves to 55.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a overlapping 2.5 x 18 and 2.5 x 12 mm minivision stents which were post dilated with a 3.0 x 15 mm Quantum balloon.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
Acute anterior STEMI, cardiogenic shock and VT requiring defibrillation/pacing for heart block.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed stent thrombosis within the previously placed proximal LAD distal BMS.
The LMCA had no significant disease.
The LAD stents were patent with a distal filling defect and probable stent underexpansion with stent thrombosis.
Successful balloon angioplasty of the LAD stents with a 2.75 balloon with no residual stenosis, defect or dissection.
# [**2-28**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler examination of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed.
There is a deep venous thrombosis in the right superficial femoral vein extending all the way down to the popliteal vein with intraluminal clot expanding the vein and absence of flow consistent with complete occlusion.
There is no evidence of deep venous thrombosis involving the left leg.
# [**3-4**] V/Q scan: Low probability  # [**3-4**] CXR:IMPRESSION: Mild CHF with small pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo male with a history of coronary artery disease status post STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**], anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2 overlapping BMS to proximal LAD, anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with stent thrombosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI.
# CAD/Ischemia:  Status post STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**], anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2 overlapping BMS to proximal LAD, anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with stent thrombosis.
Patient presented with anterior STEMI with ST elevations V1-V4 and ST depressions in II III and aVf.
By cardiac angiography he was found to have completely occluded proximal LAD, 80% occlusion of the Lcx and complete proximal occlusion of the RCA with distal flow from collaterals.
The LAD lesion was opened by angioplasty and a bare metal stent was placed.
During the procedure the patient became hypotensive with episodes of V Tach and V fib requiring multiple cardioversions.
On [**2137-3-1**] pt developed chest pain while at rest and was found to have anterior ST elevations in V1-V3.
# Pump: At presentation the patient developed cardiogenic shock and was found to have a PCWP of 40 with VEF 20% by echo with 3+ MR, and septal and anterolateral ventricular akenesis.
In the first 24 hours post cath he developed several episodes of sinus bradycardia and hypotension when attempting to wean down the dopamine that required atropine boluses on one occasion.
On [**3-1**] he developed dyspnea and appeared fluid overloaded on clinical exam and has begun on Lasix for diuresis.
# Rhythm: During cardiac catherization patient had ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation that required multiple cardioversions to regain perfusing rhythm.
On [**2-23**] and then again on [**2-24**] he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular repsonse in the context of attempted ventilator weens.
Coumadin dose was held on [**3-25**] for supratherapeutic INR.
# Respiratory: During cardiac arrest the patient vomitted and was intubated for airway protection.
Since, he has used up to 3L O2 by nasal canula after patient reported subjective dyspnea though he has maintained 02 saturations above 95%.
He has had episodes of dyspnea with elvated JVP and lower extremity edema, and signs of CHF on CXR;  Diuresis with lasix was begun on [**3-1**].
The dose was uptitrated from 40mg PO lasix to 80mg PO lasix based on increased pulmonary edema on CXR.
VQ scan was low probability for pulmonary embolism on [**3-4**].
During initial cardiac catheterization he received  600cc dye load and  had episodes of hypotension.
# DVT: Despite therapeutic heparin levels, patient developed a right sided femoral to popliteal DVT discovered on ultrasound on [**2-28**].
Because of DVT despite heparin for ACS on presentation and antiplatelet therapy peri-MI as well as in-stent thrombosis on adequate antiplatelet therapy, concern for hypercoagulable state is high and pt should have full hypercoagulable work up once other issues are stable.
# R arm cellulitis: In addition he developed an infiltrated right forearm venous access site that became ecchymotic and tender and was presumptive treated with cefelaxin for concern of a possible cellulitis.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual ASDIR (AS DIRECTED) as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease, s/p ST elevation myocardial infarction Diabetes Mellitus type 2 Hypertension Hypercholesteremia Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with an ST elevation myocardial infarction.
You also had a decrease in the pumping function of your heart and medications have been added to compensate for this.

YOU MUST TAKE THIS MEDICINE EVERY DAY TO PREVENT HEART ATTACKS FROM YOUR STENTS.
If you develop chest pain, jaw pain, or chest pressure with pain radiating into arm, or if you for any reason become concerned about your medical condition please call 911 or present to nearest ED.
- We also gave you Nitroglycerin tablets to take if you experience chest pain, please call 911 or your doctor if chest pain recurs even if it dissapears with nitroglycerine.
