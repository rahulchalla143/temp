He had been on caffeine, which was discontinued due to persistent tachycardia.
During this time period, he was weaned to room air by [**2-11**], and has remained on room air saturating greater than 95% with no significant respiratory distress.
He continues to have upper airway nasal congestion likely due to narrow nasal passages.
He does not have episodes of apnea of prematurity.
Cardiovascular:  Prior hospital course was notable for a murmur heard on day of life six with echocardiogram not showing a patent ductus arteriosus.
During this interim period, he continues to have an intermittent soft murmur, but has remained cardiovascularly stable with no active issues.
During his previous hospital course, he had persistent episodes of hypoglycemia, necessitating the high caloric density and q.3h.
Evaluation previously revealed an appropriately suppressed insulin, growth hormone elevation, but inappropriately low cortisol at 5.7.
Replacement steroids have not been started, but stress-dosed steroids should be given if the baby becomes ill or requires surgery.
GI:  No active gastrointestinal issues.
No active hematologic issues.
Infectious disease:  Because of the patient's continued mild nasal congestion, respiratory washings were sent for direct immunofluorescence as well as viral culture on [**2-19**].
The IFA was negative for RSV as well as influenza A and B.
However, on [**2-24**], the viral cultures showed evidence of cytopathic effect consistent with CMV.
Liver function tests on [**3-7**] are largely normal with an ALT of 8, AST 18, total bilirubin 0.7, alkaline phosphatase mildly elevated at 594.
A CBC sent on [**3-7**] was normal with a white blood cell count of 12.9 with 13% polys, 68% lymphocytes, hematocrit 32, and no evidence of thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 197,000.
Review of measurements at birth revealed that the patient was intrauterine growth restricted symmetrically with no microcephaly.
Furthermore, head ultrasounds in the past on days of life one, seven, and 30 were also normal, as have been ophthalmologic examinations during screening for retinopathy of prematurity.
Prematurity at 28-3/7 weeks gestational age.
Possible cytomegalovirus infection.
