Admission Date:  [**2141-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-9-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-7-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**] Chief Complaint: diarrhea, vomiting, found to have elevated creatinine at primary care physician's office  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 77 y/o African-American male with PMHx of hypertension, gout on colchicine, osteoarthritis, and heavy alcohol consumption who has recently been seen for nausea and diarrhea, and found to have new acute renal failure on his labs.
Per the patient's history, he has had diarrhea off-and on since starting colchicine, but this has been progressively worse over the last 3-4 weeks with frequent bowel movements following meals and also nocturnal bowel movements.
He has had no bloody bowel movements, nor melena though he reports them as darkened.
He also has had some nausea/vomiting following certain foods that has been increasing in severity/frequency, but it not a consistent feature.
No hematemesis.
He reports a 30 pound weight loss over the last 4 months with decreased appetite.
He has also been having chronic knee pain off and on for at least the last 5 years, either gouty or chronic osteoarthritis (has had a knee replacement in the past).
ROS is otherwise notable for mild dyspnea on exertion that is not acutely new, and right leg>left leg that is old as well.
He reports pain on digital rectal exam and pain on bowel movement, some prostatic symptoms of nocturia and frequency, but no dysuria.
He has had no fevers, headache, visual changes, or abdominal pain.
He was guaiac negative in the ED, though recently had been guaiac positive in his PCP's office.
Past Medical History: - Hypertension - osteoporosis, s/p total knee replacement in left knee several decades ago - history of heavy alcohol consumption - history of gout - questionable depression  Social History: Retired.
Family History: Reports history of hypertension but no renal disease/disorders.
Neck supply with no JVD.
CARDIAC:  RRR with no m/r/g.
Gynecomastia noted.
LUNG:  CTA bilaterally with no w/r/r.
EXT:  no pedal edema noted.
Mild enlargement of right lower leg compared to left, without overlying erythema or tenderness.
No palpable cords.
DERM:  No caput medusa.
No capillary angiomas.
No palmar erythema.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2141-9-19**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Pyuria without casts .
Sinus rhythm.
Atrial ectopy.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
CXR ([**2141-9-17**]): IMPRESSION: Prominent superior mediastinum likely secondary to techinque, patient position, and low long volumes.
Otherwise,no acute cardiopulmonary process.
The mediastinum is widened mainly due to tortuous and elongated aorta.
There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
Biapical pleural thickening is mild.
There are moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound ([**2141-9-20**]): Pending  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 77 year old male with a PMH significant for hypertension, osteoporosis, gout, daily heavy alcohol use who presented with nausea and diarrhea for the last 3-4 weeks in the setting of long-term colchicine use, found to be in acute renal failure with hypotension that improved with IV hydration.
# Acute Renal Failure: Given response to fluids with increasing urine output and falling creatinine, this was most consistent with volume depletion secondary to chronic diarrhea, vomiting, and poor po intake.
Continued daily heavy alcohol consumption and continued blood pressure medication intake in the setting of hypotension are also likely contributors to acute renal injury.
Also concern for acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypotension but urine sediment was without casts.
# Hypotension/tachycardia: Most likely cause was intravascular volume depletion as above, with decreased cardiac output given preload and stroke volume.
Pt did not appear septic and hypotension resolved with IVFs.
Noted to be in sinus tachycardia generally with heart rate in the low 100s with brief rises to the 170s when ambulatory.
Pressures remained stable and patient was asymptomatic with no signs of ischemia on ECG.
Tachycardia thought secondary to reflex tachycardia from the holding of his outpatient clonidine, diltiazem, amlodipine.
# Diarrhea: Unclear etiology, but patient reported long-term history of intermittent diarrhea since beginning colchicine therapy.
No reported medication changes in the last month to explain his acute exacerbation, but patient may have a superimposed gastroenteritis.
Colchicine medication has been held temporarily as patient does not appear to be having a gout flare-up currently.
Patient reported cessation of diarrhea since arriving to the floor.
# Deep venous thrombosis: Patient had mild swelling of the right calf, without overlying erythema, palpable cords, or tenderness.
Lower extremity ultrasound revealed clot in the right posterior tibial vein thrombosis.
# Urinary Tract Infection: Urine culture found to be growing e. coli with 10,000-100,000 organisms.
CIWA scale not implemented due to low clinical suspicion.
Did not exhibit any signs of withdrawal.
# Gout/Hyperuricemia: Colchicine stopped due to suspicion that this medication may have explained recent diarrhea episode.
Will hold outpatient colchicine and allopurinol in setting of resolving acute renal and resolving diarrhea.
# Deconditioning: Likely secondary to gout/chronic osteoarthritis.
# Mild Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting intravascular volume depletion secondary to diarrhea.
# Elevated Ferritin: Likely related to anemia of chronic disease and chronic alcohol consumption.
Will suggest repeating once renal failure resolves as well as acute illness.
Unknown risk of hemochromatosis, but clinically without diabetes or markedly abnormal lfts.
He has had elevated ferritins in the past however.
HLH is not suspected given absence of fever and illness.
# Tortuosity on CXR: Per radiology, mediastinum widened mainly due to tortuous and elongated aorta.
Given low clinical suspicion and equal blood pressures in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] defer to primary care physician the decision to follow up with CT.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Roscommon  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Acute renal failure -Gout -Osteoarthritis -Urinary tract infection -Heavy alcohol consumption .
Secondary: -History of hypertension   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable, blood pressures stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for chronic diarrhea in the setting of your long-term colchicine medication and heavy alcohol consumption, which likely contributed to your dehydration, low blood pressures, and acute renal failure.
You were temporarily observed in the ICU due to your low blood pressures, which normalized after you received several liters of IV fluids.
You were also found to have a blood clot in your right lower leg.
Should you develop lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, poor urination, fever, chills, please contact your primary care physician or go to the emergency room.
