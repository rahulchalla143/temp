Admission Date:  [**2133-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-2-11**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: CODE STROKE (@[**Hospital1 18**] ED, called for right facial droop, right hemiparesis and receptive aphasia)  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IV-tPA   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old right handed woman with a history including dementia with delusions, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented about one hour after the acute onset of right facial droop, right hemiparesis and receptive aphasia for whom a code stroke was called.
Although the examination fluctuated, initial NIH stroke scale score was 12 for inability to answer month and age (2), failure to follow commands (2), right facial droop (1), decreased movement of both lower extremities - likely a function of comprehension difficulties (2, 2), severe aphasia characterized by relatively fluent non-sensical speech and poor comprehension (2), and dysarthria (1).
Although a stat CT scan was unrevealing, the examination findings were considered concerning for a left MCA stroke.

Diffuse ST-T wave changes as recorded [**2133-1-10**].
The rate has slowed and the ST-T wave changes are somewhat less prominent.
Frequent atrial ectopy has appeared.
The aorta is tortuous and calcified, but the mediastinal contours are unchanged from prior.
Low lung volumes are again noted.
There is mild atelectatic changes noted in the left lung base.
Degenerative changes are seen within the left glenohumeral joint.
There are no pneumothoraces or pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: Mild left basilar atelectasis.
NCHCT on admission: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
The ventricles and sulci appear prominent due to involutional change but not overtly changed from prior study and likely appropriate given the patient's age.
There is no edema or mass effect.
In the left parotid gland, there is a hypodense round mass that measures 19 x 17 mm (2;3) which has increased in size from the prior study.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Left parotid mass which has increased in size since [**2127**]; nonemergent MR imaging is recommended with contrast.
MRI/MRA [**2133-2-9**]: MRI BRAIN: There is a moderate to large acute infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory, involving the parietal lobe and insula.
Gradient echo images demonstrate increased susceptibility artifact in a small left parietal portion of the infarct, consistent with blood products.
There is unchanged severe ventricular enlargement and moderate sulcal enlargement, most likely due to atrophy with central predominance.
There are multiple foci of T2 hyperintensity in the supratentorial white matter, suggesting chronic small vessel ischemia.
The known left parotid mass is poorly assessed due to motion.
There is flow in the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, without evidence of occulsion.
Flow within these arteries appears diffusely attenuated, possibly due to motion, but it is not possible to accurately assess for stenoses.
Acute left middle cerebral artery territory infarct, involving the left parietal lobe and insula, with hemorrhagic transformation.
Motion-degraded head MRA with limited diagnostic utility.
No evidence of occlusion of the left internal carotid or proximal left middle cerebral artery.
Limited evaluation for stenoses or aneurysms.
Unchanged severe ventricular and moderate sulcal enlargement, likely due to central atrophy.
However, please correlate clinically whether the patient may have symptoms of communicating hydrocephalus.
On the right there is mild heterogeneous plaque in the ICA.
On the left there is mild heterogeneous plaque seen in the ICA.
Left vertebral antegrade artery flow.
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
CV: Home BP meds were held on admission for permissive hypertension post-stroke.
Her amlodipine was not as yet restarted, to avoid causing hypotension / hypoperfusion of the brain.
Please monitor her BPs and re-start this medication if needed for hypertension (>140/90).
Pulm: Inh Tx for COPD (Advair) was cont'd.
GU: Also, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was found to have a UTI on admission (her UA showed leukocytosis to >50 WBC, +nitrites, moderate leuk.esterase, many bacteria).
Pt had h/o several prior UTI with 3x pan-sensitive E coli and very recently a partially-resistent Proteus sp., and was initially started on IV cefepime by ICU team.
Her UCx revealed a multi-drug-resistant E coli species (resistant to Bactrim, Cipro, Ampicillin).
Given that her current E coli infection is Bactrim-resistant, this plan should be re-evaluated by her PCP (Bactrim was not re-started).
Of note, oxybutinin was not continued (anti-cholinergic medication in a patient with dementia who is being actively treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor).
No active issues.
Also, there was an incidental parotid-gland finding on her MRI (see report, above).
