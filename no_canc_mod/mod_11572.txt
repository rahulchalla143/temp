Admission Date: [**2117-4-9**]        Discharge Date: [**2117-4-21**]   Service:  MED   DATE OF DEATH:  [**2117-4-21**]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Increased shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old male with coronary artery disease, status post recent catheterization in [**2-21**] with critical AS, atrial fibrillation, GERD who presented on [**2117-4-21**] to an outside hospital with increased shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, and cough with bloody sputum.
The patient was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate at that time and a white blood count of 19.2 consistent with pneumonia and worsening of chronic renal insufficiency.
Sputum culture was without significant growth, but chest x-ray was questionable for new left-sided infiltrate.
At home, the patient was with progressive increasing dyspnea, reports of subjective fevers, chills, and sweats.
Denies nausea or vomiting.
No choking or palpitations.
The patient still with mild blood-tinged sputum, but decreased production overall.
Denied pleuritic pain, questionable history of diarrhea with mild abdominal pain, but no constipation.
Shortness of breath was reported to be at rest, and the patient re-presented to the outside hospital today.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate, hematocrit of 28.7.
Chest x-ray was repeated showing left lower lobe infiltrate.
KUB was performed secondary to nonspecific abdominal pain showing no free air and 1 dilated loop of bowel.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 2.4- 2.5.
Anemia secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.
Question of COPD with bronchospasm, recently on a steroid taper.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient is an elderly male in mild acute distress, dyspneic with speech, and pale appearing.
Dry mucous membranes.
Harsh crescendo and decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Questionable [**1-23**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.
Lungs with crackles at the bases bilaterally.
There were no masses.
Extremities with trace to 1 plus lower edema bilaterally.
Evidence of ecchymosis on the upper extremities, but no rash.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  EKG showed atrial fibrillation with left axis, 2-mm ST depressions in V2-V6, T-wave inversions in 1 and aVL.
Again, chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Sepsis, likely secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia, but consider an additional abdominal process.
The patient subsequently developed a drug reaction rash to the Zosyn and was started on imipenem.
The patient was given fluconazole for evidence of yeast in the urine as well as sputum.
However, the patient persisted to have hypotension, which was fluid responsive; however, the patient was showing marked signs of volume overload.
At the time of death the patient still remained pressor dependent with no signs of improvement.
Of note, Xigris was considered early in hospital presentation, however, due to concerns for bleeding as well as anticoagulation, this was felt not to be a safe option for the patient as well as the patient met significant exclusion criteria for use.
The patient initially had a large AA gradient, which was likely secondary to pneumonia.
There was some concern for aspiration.
However, the patient was ultimately intubated for increasing hypoxia and hypocapnia.
There were episodes where patient appeared to have increased work of breathing.
A CT scan was obtained showing no significant abdominal pathologies.
The patient did have episodes of diarrhea; however, all were negative for C. difficile.
Initially, the patient presented with an anion gap acidosis, which resolved quickly.
This was thought initially to be due to diarrhea.
The nonanion gap metabolic acidosis was subsequently thought to be due to renal failure as well as aggressive saline infusion.
However, given the need for large amounts of volume for resuscitation, the patient developed signs of volume overload.
ST depression in the anterior leads were thought to be demand ischemia in the setting of decreased blood pressure, anemia, and aortic stenosis.
The patient was transfused to maintain a hematocrit above 30 and the patient was continued on aspirin and Plavix especially in the setting of recent stent.
An echo was rechecked, showing again the EF of 60-65 percent with severe AS.
The patient had evidence of rate-controlled atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
The patient's antihypertensives were held secondary to hypotension.
Other sources of the infection were entertained.
However, no further sources of infection could be identified.
Sepsis and respiratory failure were all attributed to the patient's multifocal nosocomial pneumonia.
There was some concern that the patient may have developed a ventilator associated pneumonia.
However, there may have been some resistance to imipenem, as the patient continued to be febrile with evidence of septic physiology.
However, the patient's infection persisted because of persistently poor clinical course and no signs of improvement despite all aggressive measures.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Hypotension (pressor dependent).
Atrial fibrillation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Acute renal failure/chronic renal insufficiency.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Critical aortic stenosis.
Coronary artery disease.
