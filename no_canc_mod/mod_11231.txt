This is a 63 year-old white female with a history of atrial fibrillation status post cerebrovascular accident times four, peripheral vascular disease, status post popliteal peroneal bypass graft with a left TMA resulting in a left below the knee amputation in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year and a right popliteal peroneal nonrevealing saphenous vein in [**Month (only) 956**] of this year who developed right third toe discoloration a few weeks prior to admission.
She was seen by her podiatrist initially and then on follow up noted to have gangrenous changes.
Atrial fibrillation initially diagnosed in [**2168-6-13**].

Thyroid nodule with subtotal thyroidectomy.

Peripheral vascular disease.
Left popliteal peroneal nonreverse saphenous vein in [**2168-6-13**].
General appearance, alert, cooperative white female in no acute distress.
There are no femoral bruits.
Abdominal examination was obese with bowel sounds, nontender, no masses or organomegaly.
Left below the knee amputation is a 1 cm lateral incision opening with foul odor and surrounding erythema.
There is a 1 cm diameter traumatic lesion on the dorsum of the right hand and right knee with surrounding erythema, but no drainage.
The right leg is moderate ankle edema and erythema of the distal two thirds of the leg.

Right heel is without fissures or pressure ulcers.
Neurologically she has expressive aphasia and emotionally is very labile.
Chest x-ray showed no active cardiopulmonary disease.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation.
Blood cultures were obtained on [**2169-9-26**], which were no growth and finalized on [**2169-10-2**].
Blood cultures were no growth and finalized.
Stool cultures were obtained, because of loose stools.
Arteriogram demonstrated abdominal aorta widely patent with infrarenal aorta with bilateral renal arteries and brisk filling nephrograms.
There is a widely patent common iliac and external iliac arteries, hypogastric bilaterally are patent.

There is a blind segment of popliteal and reconstitutes and then occludes.
The patient underwent on [**2169-9-30**] a right distal superficial femoral artery proximal anterior tibial nonreverse saphenous vein graft bypass using two segments of the greater saphenous from the right and left thighs, angioscopy with valve lysis.
The patient continued to do well and showed a dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial and popliteal pulses on the operative side.
The patient was in atrial fibrillation and she required beta blockade for rate control.
The patient required neo-synephrine postoperative and fluid boluses for systolic hypotension.
She remained in atrial fibrillation with a V rate of 77, systolic was 132, diastolic 49, CVP 2.
Blood cultures were obtained, which were finalized at no growth.
She had dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibial pulses and palpable popliteal.
The wound was clean, dry and intact.
The amputation sites were clean, dry and intact without erythema, ecchymosis or ischemic skin changes.
