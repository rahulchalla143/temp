[**2116-8-13**] - Cardiac catheterzation   History of Present Illness: CC: 74-year-old male patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 120**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9193**] [**Name (STitle) 9194**] with a history of mitral regurgitation who is scheduled for repair of the valve on [**2116-8-14**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], referred for a right and left heart catheterization followed by surgical repair of his mitral valve.
HPI: This is a 74-year-old male with a history of [**Last Name (STitle) 9195**] and hypertension who has been routinely followed by cardiology for mitral regurgitation.
On [**2116-7-21**] he had his routine yearly echocardiogram.
He was found to have an increase in his pulmonary artery pressure to 38 mm Hg.
The report also found mitral valve prolapse with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.
In terms of symptoms Mr. [**Known lastname 9196**] reports an increase in exertional dyspnea over the past two years ago.
He also has occasional dyspnea associated with the chest pressure.
In addition he reports occasional bilateral ankle edema.
Of note this gentleman had a stress echo on [**2114-5-16**].
He was noted to have 0.5-1mm ST segment depression in the inferolateral leads which resolved with 2 minutes of rest.
He experienced no chest discomfort, shortness of breath or dyspnea.
The echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation but pulmonary artery pressure was normal.
Past Medical History: Severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 9197**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] s/p resection [**Last Name (Titles) **] Hypertension Arthritis of his fingers  Social History: Married with two grown children.
?s but no history of premature CAD.
Bilateral varicosities.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  revealed no angiographically apparent obstructive coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 28 mm Hg.
There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with PA systolic pressure of 33 mm Hg.
There was systemic arterial hypertension with aortic pressure of 181/79 mm Hg.
There was no evidence of mitral stenosis on simultaneous measurements of LVEDP and PCWP.
There was no transaortic valve gradient upon pullback of the catheter from LV to aorta.

He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed no coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation.
Given his history of [**Known lastname **] cancer and prostatectomy, the urology service was consulted.
A catheter was placed using a flexible cystoscopy and dilation was performed of a tight bladder neck contraction.
He developed atrial fibrillation for which amiodarone was started with good rate control.
He developed a right pneumothorax after chest tube removal which required the placement of a chest tube on [**2116-8-18**].
The pneumothorax improved and the chest tube was removed with a small right apical pneumothorax remaining.
Cleared for discharge to home on POD #6 with instructions for CXR and wound check in 1 week.
