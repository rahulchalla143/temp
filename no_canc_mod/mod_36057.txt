Admission Date:  [**2174-12-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-7-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 66 yo male with h/o AAA, HTN, and remote Tobacco use (quit in '[**49**]) who presented to the ED with chest pain, transferred to CCU after cardiac catheterization for STEMI.
He described the pain as a burning mid chest pain that started over a week ago, which he thought was heartburn.
Prior to admission, the pain had worsened and he took two ASA at home.
Cardiac cath showed severe 3vd.
There was a 90% LAD stenosis at the D1 bifurcation with distal occlusion in the RCA, but with collaterals from the LAD.
No intervention was performed.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, cough, hemoptysis, black stools, or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain as described above.
He denied dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No S4, no S3- but distant heart sounds and difficult to auscultate Chest: No chest wall deformities.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had mild diffuse disease with a 20% stenosis throughout.
The LAD had a 90% stenosis at the D1 bifurcation.
The RCA was markedly tortuous with large thrombus burden and distal occlusion.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction, with unsuccessful PCI of occluded RCA managed by medical therapy.
TTE [**12-10**] -  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
LV systolic function appears mildly-to-moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior free wall and moderate hypokinesis of the posterior wall.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion  TTE [**12-12**] - The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior wall, distal septum and apex.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-12-10**], mild mitral regurgitation is now identified with normal valve mophology suggestive of papillary muscle dysfunction.
Blunting of the costophrenic angles persists though there is no evidence of acute pneumonia.
There is noted hemopericardium along the posterior aspect of the heart measuring at greatest diameter 5.1 cm (This measurement was taken after patient expired).
There is no apparent aortic dissection.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo male with a history of AAA, HTN, and remote Tobacco use (quit in '[**49**]) who presented to the ED with chest pain, transferred to CCU after cardiac catheterization for inferior STEMI.
1) Cardiac Ischemia: The patient presented with a inferolateral STEMI and underwent emergenct cardiac catheterization that revealed severe 3-vessel disease as per the cath report with failed PCI of the tortuous, thrombus filled RCA.
However, when cardiac surgery scheduled the patient for a CABG on hospital day three, both heparin and integrillin were restarted as he was thought to be a high risk for rethrombosis.
A HgbA1c was not significantly elevated and fasting lipids were checked.
Unfortunately, on hospital day 3, the patient had a fever to 101.5 and his CABG was further postponed.
His temperature was thought to be secondary to post-infarct epicardial inflammatory changes and atelectasis.
Serial EKGs were not significant for evolving ischemic changes.
After intubation and several rounds of CPR and epinephrine and atropine, the patient was rushed emergently to the OR where he was found to have a perforated wall of his ventricular cavity.
A TTE was significant for a LVEF 40% with hypokinesis of inferior free wall and posterior wall, triv MR, and LVH.
On hospital day 3, a rub vs. a MR murmur was heard on exam.
A repeat TTE was significant for new onset mild mitral regurgitaiton that was consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction.
A trivial pericardial effusion was also noted.
On hospital day 3, telemetry was significant for Wenkebach and the patient's beta-blocker was held.
His UA was negative X 2, and all blood and urine cultures were no growth.
There were no signs of focal consolidation on CXR.
His fever was thought to be due to a combination of atelectasis and post-infarction epicardial inflammation as above.
3) h/o AAA: Undergoing surveillance as an outpatient.
