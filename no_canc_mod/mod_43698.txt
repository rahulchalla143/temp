Patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) **]/08 with hypotension and sepsis requiring ICU admission.
A RIJ was placed due to persistent hypotension initially SBP 70-->100s, down to 80s again.
CXR no infiltrate.
No CP, abd pain, hip pain intermittently  Past Medical History: 1.
Paraplegia (fell 13 years ago working on construction) 2.
Depression 3.
Indwelling foley with persistent L sided hydronephrosis (per last DC summary from [**1-/2164**]) 6.
Anemia (Hct baseline 28-30) 7.
Sacral decubitus, stage IV, with recent osteomyelitis, s/p approximately 11 wks of Vanc/Zosyn (completed [**2164-5-7**]), followed  by ID (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1075**]) 8.
H/o sepsis requiring ICU admission  Social History: No smoking, no alcohol, no drug use.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease.
Dilated aortic root.
Lung volumes are again low, and there are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
**FINAL REPORT [**2164-6-30**]**     WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2164-6-30**]):    No significant growth.
SURVEILLANCE BLOOD CULTURES: NGTD  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 65 M with paraplegia, chronic stage VI decubitus ulcer and osteomyelitis, recurrent UTI [**2-25**] to neurogenic bladder and chronic Foley placement who presents with fever and hypotension off antibiotics from nursing home.
Wound looked good, no pus drainage, no + wound culture, per plastics seemed to be improving.
Despite treatment for infection patient would still become hypotensive with SBP in the high 60s or 70s during deep sleep, UOP was > 100cc / hr and he would mentate perfectly when awoken so likely some degree of hypotension purely related to sleep and possibly some autonomic dysfucntion but no evidence of poor perfusion.
Chronic Sacral Decubitus Ulcer/Osteo: healing well.
- continued Zinc, vit C  Anemia.
Anemia of chronic disease according to iron studies, normal B12 and folate, retic inappropriately low at 1.7 %.
Smear not notable for significant abnormalities.
Neurogenic Bladder.
He appears to have chronic colonization.
