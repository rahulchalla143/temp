No masses or organomegaly Back: No spinal or CVA tenderness.

This finding is non-specific in nature, but could represent atypical infection, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or Acute Interstitial Pneumonia.
Hand X-Ray [**2127-2-12**]: Findings most consistent with advanced osteoarthritis, though the second MCP joint is narrowed as described.
Foot X-Ray [**2127-2-12**]: There are no fractures.
There is marked medial subluxation of the second and third proximal phalanges on the metatarsals, and marked lateral subluxation of the fourth and fifth distal phalanges on the proximal phalanges.
There are no focal osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
There are no marginal erosions.
There is a posterior calcaneal spur.
There is soft tissue prominence in the region of the MTPs.
Diffuse lung disease with upper lobe predominance (left greater than right).
The areas of ground-glass opacity with traction bronchiectasis have increased in density when compared to [**2127-2-11**], but are otherwise unchanged.
If the patient has a fever, these findings would consistent with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or other atypical infectious processes.
Other conditions that could be included on the radiographic differential diagnosis include chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, vasculitis, drug toxicity, or acute interstitial pneumonia.
CXR [**2127-2-21**]: Observed changes suggest improved aeration of the areas with less degree of ground-glass densities but persistent mostly interstitial infiltrates.
No other significant interval change since [**2-14**].
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo f with PMH sig for RA treated with pred/MTX, CAD, long h/o GERD, breast ca s/p left mastectomy presents from OSH for further eval of hypoxia (85% on RA) in the setting bilateral pulm infiltrates.
She notes slight subjective improvement in SOB with exertion since admission.
Bronch vs VATS were considered to get a tissue diagnosis given her repeat CT after two weeks of PCP treatment with continued ground glass opacities, however pulm/thoracics/cardiology felt that these  procedures were too high risk given underlying cardiac disease (reversible defect on recent MIBI ([**10-12**])).
She will be treated with high-dose steroids empirically for interstitial lung dz and followed closely by pulmonary.
She should have a CBC with diff checked in one week for concern of granulocytopenia with primaquine and RA.
She is currently on high dose steroids for lung issues which is also controlling her RA.
Her pain is currently controlled on a Fentanyl patch.
She notes short term memory impairment and should have an outpt evaluation.
