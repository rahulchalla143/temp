He was transferred for cardiac catheterization following a positive stress test revealing inferior and anterior apical artery reversible defects with an EF of 25 to 30%.
Two dimensional echocardiogram done at [**Hospital3 1443**] revealed a mild MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] presently complains of symptoms of left sided weakness as well as a throat burning with exertion typically ambulating one flight of stairs.

Congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%.
Non Q wave myocardial infarction.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
In general he is a healthy appearing middle aged male in no acute distress.
Both the Vascular Surgery team and the Cardiac Surgery teams were consulted for his symptomatic transient ischemic attack and his coronary disease.
He had a carotid ultrasound that demonstrated less then 40% internal carotid stenosis bilaterally.
He had right internal carotid stenosis in the area of the petrous bone.
Of note, they also believed that he has a right subclavian steel syndrome.
All of his neurologic checks were without deficits.
He had oxygen requirement for several days, but by the day prior to his discharge he had been adequately diuresed and no longer required oxygen while at rest.
[**Last Name (STitle) 42843**]evelop a low grade temperature to 100.0 on postoperative day number five with some scant sternal drainage.
