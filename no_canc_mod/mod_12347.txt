This past [**Month (only) **] while on [**Hospital3 **], he has a rescue percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty stenting of his distal right coronary artery for acute myocardial infarction.
On [**10-1**], he had an exercise tolerance test/thallium where he exercised for nine minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol and stopped because of fatigue.
He had electrocardiogram changes and sharp pain in the early recovery.
Ejection fraction was calculated to be 46% and he had a moderate partially reversible inferior defect.
He has done well until recently when he began to notice recurrent symptoms.
He reports having chest tightness and shortness of breath when exerting himself such as walking up a slight incline.
Coronary artery disease risk factors:  Hypertension, cholesterol, tobacco abuse, quit 10 years ago.
Denies diabetes, positive family history and patient's father died of an myocardial infarction at age 43.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, renal stones, recent retinal vein occlusion with minimal carotid artery disease, sleep apnea, presently on CPAP.
ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, penicillin, tetracycline cause swelling and rash, shellfish and dye.
General:  Appearance, well-dressed, well-nourished gentlemen appearing his stated age in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No jugular venous distention, carotids without bruits.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
Extremities:  Bilateral peripheral pulses.
No varicosities.
Left anterior descending with 50% diffuse proximal and 60-70% diffuse mid vessel disease, 80% proximal stenosis of the first diagonal.
Left circumflex has diffuse disease and 70% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systolic and left ventricular filling pressures.
Left ventriculography revealed mild anterolateral hypokinesis and severe posterobasal inferior hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 35%.
Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of OM1 with type C dissection.
Saphenous vein graft was used for an anastomosis to the diagonal and a saphenous vein graft was used in anastomosis to the right posterior descending artery.
His pain was controlled and was voiding and felt ready to go home.
