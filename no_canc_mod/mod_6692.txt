Myocardial infarction.
Ventricular tachycardia.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old male who was taking his garbage out to the curb when he had the sudden onset of severe chest pain associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath.
It was described as similar to chest pain he had during a CHF exacerbation at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2112-7-14**].
The patient contact[**Name (NI) **] the EMS System who found him in ventricular tachycardia and he was cardioverted in the field to sinus and brought in and referred to an outside hospital.
Coronary artery disease, status post MI in his 30s.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  The patient was in no acute distress.
Chest: There were coarse breath sounds bilaterally with right greater than left.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, without masses or organomegaly.
The chest x-ray showed only mild atelectasis at the right lower lobe, no acute CHF picture.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially on a lidocaine drip for his ventricular tachycardia.
The patient did rule in for an MI, although there were no ST elevations detected on the EKG.
The Electrophysiology Service was consulted in regards to his episode of ventricular tachycardia.
VT ablation versus ICD were discussed and both were possibilities.
Catheterization was performed on [**2115-3-11**] which revealed an ejection fraction of 20%, as well as diffuse disease of a right dominant system.
It was also noted that the patient had a very large abdominal aortic aneurysm greater than 7 cm at this time.
The patient continued, however, to have an episode of ventricular tachycardia postprocedure.
It was asymptomatic and identical to the episode described three days prior.
The patient underwent CABG times three on [**2115-3-13**] with LIMA to diagonal artery, saphenous vein graft to LAD and acute marginal.
He continued to have recurrent ventricular tachycardia status post ablation and the patient remained A-paced using temporary pacing wires.
The patient also had multiple episodes of NSVT and Amiodarone bolus was given as well as Amiodarone drip.
The patient had recurrent prolonged runs of NSVT on postoperative day number two and the EP Service continued to follow.
