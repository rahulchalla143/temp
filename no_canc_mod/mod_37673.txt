HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 71 year-old male was noted to have an elevated creatinine by routine screen at his primary care physician's office and abdominal ultrasound demonstrated abdominal aortic aneurysm.
A CT scan was performed which demonstrated a 5.4 to 6 cm juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm asymptomatic.
Patient denies abdominal pain, claudication, can play a round of golf without symptoms.
Denies rest pain, strokes, symptoms or amaurosis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  No known drug allergies.
ILLNESSES:  Include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiently.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of a myocardial infarction.
Mother with asthma and colon carcinoma.
General appearance: This is an alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress.
The pulse examination shows 2+ radials, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibials bilaterally palpable.
Epidural catheter was placed intraoperatively for analgesic control.
The patient developed overnight oliguria and renal was consulted, recommendations were to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 140 to 160, volume repletion, rule out for myocardial infarction and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Although he had diminished urinary output an ultrasound of the renals were obtained which showed echogenicity consistent with chronic cystic renal disease without obstructive disease.
Patient developed a temperature.
There was no obstructive disease or ischemic disease noted.
CT scan showed no retroperitoneal hematoma.
There was a small amount of hyperdense fluid in the dependent pelvis in keeping with the recent blood products.
A moderate atelectasis in the dependent lower lobes from basilar pleural effusions, a moderately distended, mildly thickened gallbladder.
The wall thickening may be due to patient's low albumin rather than inflammatory process.
There was no other intraoperative findings on CT. General surgery was consulted regarding patient with postoperative fever, undetermined etiology, looking for an intra-abdominal source.
After examining the patient and review of the patient's CT and gallbladder ultrasound I felt there was no intra-abdominal source.
On [**12-1**] patient continued to have episodes of hypertension requiring adjustment in his beta blockade and hydralazine.
The patient did have episodes of hyperglycemia while on total parenteral nutrition requiring IV insulin drip or glycemic control.
A repeat urine culture was sent which was positive for pseudomonas.
P.o.s were begun with sips and on the 19th the patient's diet was advanced secondary to passing flatus.
Patient's renal function remained with an elevated creatinine between 3.6 and 4.6.
Juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and right iliac     aneurysm, status post repair on [**2179-11-22**].
Chronic renal insufficiency compounded with postoperative     acute tubular necrosis and acute renal failure.
Postoperative blood loss anemia, transfused, corrected.
Postoperative failure to extubate secondary to volume     overload, corrected.
Postoperative pseudomonas urinary tract infection,     treated.
