No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is left sided pleural effusion.
POST_chest closure Moderate global RV systolic dysfunction.
Interval removal of the right internal jugular introducer with placement of a central line which has its tip in the superior vena cava.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Stable postoperative appearance to the cardiac and mediastinal contours with persistent prominence in the left hilum in the region of the pulmonary artery.
Persistent bibasilar patchy opacities, left greater than right with associated layering pleural effusions most likely representing compressive atelectasis although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
On post operative day one his paralytic was temporarily stopped to evaluate neurological status and he opened his eyes to command, he was then resumed on paralytics to reduce potential for complication with open chest.
He continued on sedation and was gently diuresed with lasix due to volume overload.
He was in atrial fibrillation on return from the operating room.
Post extubation he experienced post-operative delerium which was managed with Haldol initially, this cleared and on post operative day seven and five he was transferred to the floor for continued care.
He continued on heparin drip as he continued to be loaded with coumadin for mechanical valve and atrial fibrillation.
