BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM:  Exam limited by films only taken in supine and 15 degree semierect views  FINDINGS: The esophagus is noted to be grossly distended with abnormal primary and secondary contractions and diffusely increased tertiary contractions.
Distally, there is abrupt narrowing in the region of the lower esophageal sphincter ([**Location (un) 74164**] beak) consistent with underlying achalasia.
IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with achalasia.

CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE  FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute malalignment or loss of vertebral body height.
Prevertebral soft tissue swelling is identified.
Visualized contrast within intrathecal sac appear unremarkable.
There is suggestion of a lucency involving the left T1 transverse process.
Limited examination of lung apices displays bilateral problem medial small bullae.
No cervical fracture or malalignment identified.
PSubtle lucency involving the left T1 transverse process most likely due to vascular channel.
