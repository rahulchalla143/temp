Ground-glass airspace opacity involving the majority of the left lung and also within the right middle lobe concerning for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
Please note other etiologic considerations include atypical pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Status post right lower lobe resection with open window thoracoplasty changes and packing material in the right pleural space.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Stable small filling defect within the right lower lobe pulmonary artery is compatible with chronic thrombus related to right lower lobe resection.
Multiple thoracic spine compression fractures, with a new T5 compression.
Consider MR for further evaluation.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
- Dermal hemorrhage.
Note: PAS-D and Gram stains are negative for fungal and bacterial organisms respectively.
There is dermal hemorrhage, however, no significant dermal inflammation or vasculitis is observed.
Skin, right shin, biopsy (B): Diffuse dermal hemorrhage consistent with ecchymosis (see note).
Note:   There is dermal hemorrhage, however, no significant dermal inflammation or vasculitis is observed.
Rare group of atypical epithelioid and squamous cells.
Numerous neutrophils and pulmonary macrophages.
Brief Hospital Course: 70M with HIV (undetectable VL), inflammatory arthritis on chronic steroid therapy, SCC s/p RLL lobectomy [**8-7**] complicated by bronchopleural fistula treated with [**Last Name (un) 72968**] window, as well as empyema and invasive aspergillosis on outpatient voriconazole admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and septic shock from pneumonia.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Due to right sided air leak and dense disease on left lung it was difficult to ventilate the patient with a single endotracheal tube.
Multiple blood and sputum cultures were obtained without definitive results.
Due to the severity of his illness and his compromised immune status and risk for infection(HIV, chronic steroid use, malnutrition, and extended hospitalizations) he was treated broadly for HCAP with a 14 day course ending of [**2147-8-21**] as well as a 21 day course of therapeutic bactrim and steroids for PCP.
He had significant difficulty managing his airway due to increased secretions and had repeated episodes of hypoxia from mucus plugging.
After tracheostomy fever and increased sputum returned.
#Hypotension: Patient presented with septic shock physiology.
On arrival to the ICU he had persistently low blood pressures, tachycardia, and low urine output despite agressive volume resuscitation in the setting of active lung infection.
#Sinus tachycardia: Patient with persistent tachycardia throughout most of admission.
Tachycardia was believed to be multifactorial due to intravascular depletion, fever, infection, pain, hypoxia, pressors, and withdrawal of sedation.
With resolution of infection and management of oral secretions his rate fell to 90-110s.
He was ultimately started on metoprolol to improve cardiac output given his diastolic heart failure.
# Liver lesion/nodularity:  Incidental finding on admission imaging.
# BP fistula: No evidence of infection during hospitalization.
#CAD: Patient with known history of CAD s/p PCI.
- Continue ranitidine 150 mg daily for stress ulcer prophylaxis while on ventilator.
If fever recurs whould have high suspiscion for extrapulmonary source (i.e.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for yeast.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob/wheeze.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob/wheeze.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 2-4 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB/Wheeze.
Patient afebrile and off pressors for several days prior to discharge.
Your hospital course was complicated by elevated heart rates, persistent fevers, altered mental status, malnutrition.
Unfortunately you continued to have great deal of secretions that caused you to become short of breath and you were too weak to protect your lungs.
