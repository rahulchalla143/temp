Not anticoagulated due to poor compliance and followup.

Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] is a 60 year old male with Hypertension, history of recurrent PE s/p IVC filter not on anticoagulation due to poor medication compliance, history of substance abuse initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-4**] for drug overdose (suspected seroquel, klonopin, oxycodone, methadone overdose).
He was initially monitored in the ICU due to bradycardia with a prolonged QT interval.
His hospital course was complicated by a left foot cellulitis at site of IV on patient's foot, treated with one week of Vancomycin and Unasyn.
He was getting ready for discharge when he was found in his room unresponsive and hypotensive and then sent back to the MICU.
Patient's BP and responsiveness improved with monitoring and was suspected to be due to Klonopin/oxycodone/methadone overdose, but he was ruled out for PE with echo and LENIS which were unremarkable.
Patient initially admitted to MICU for observation secondary to drug overdose and prolonged QT interval of 0.52.
He was given a dose of narcan and a dose of glucagon for concern of opioid and beta-blocker overdose.
Psych was consulted and did not feel he had active suicidal ideation at time of transfer out of MICU.
When he returned to the MICU on [**9-25**], it was suspected that had horded pills and then taken a supply of these medications all at once resulting in minimal responsiveness and hypotension.
Patient noted to have a left lower extremity cellulitis at the site of an IV.
Patient reported to have history of hypertension and reports significant concern about his blood pressure being elevated.
On [**9-24**], patient was found to be hypotensive to 70s systolic and unresponsive likely secondary to up-titration of antihypertensives plus suspected hording of oxycodone/klonopin/methadone.
The MICU team felt that his hypertension should not be aggressively managed given his history of poor compliance as and outpatient and fluctuations of BP due to drug abuse.
Patient seemed to be at greater risk for episodes of hypotension than the consequences of chronic hypertension.
He did not receive CPR because he was found to have a pulse and SBP in 70s.
He cannot get a CTA due to renal failure and V/Q scan is likely to be difficult to interpret in setting of prior multiple PEs.
He was started on empiric anticoagulation with lovenox with the knowledge that he would not continue on anticoagulation as an outpatient due to history of poor compliance.
BP and mental status improved overnight and he was trasnfered out of the unit on [**9-26**].
He has not been anticoaulated due to poor compliance.
There was breif concern for a recurrent PE when patient was transferred back to MICU on [**9-25**] with hypotension and unresponsiveness.
He cannot get a CTA due to renal failure and V/Q scan is likely to be difficult to interpret in setting of prior multiple PEs.
He was started on empiric anticoagulation with lovenox with the knowledge that he would not continue on anticoagulation as an outpatient due to history of poor compliance.
BP and mental status improved overnight and he was trasnfered out of the unit on [**9-26**].
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: overdose (benzodiazepines, opiates, methadone) left foot cellulitis/phlebitis hypertension depression   Discharge Condition: stable Against Medical Advice  Discharge Instructions: Patient left AMA from Hospital -- this is what was supposed to be given to patient  Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**], You were initially admitted to the intensive care unit because you overdosed on several drugs (opiates, benzodiazepines, and methadone).
