Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with Parkinson's disease, dementia, DM, anemia, urinary retention & overflow incontinence who intially presented with altered mental status found to be in DKA.
Patient's course was complicated by pneumonia and C.diff infection.
#Diabetic ketoacidosis: Precipitant was likely multiple infections as below.
Patient has history of DKA during prior admission also in the setting of urosepsis.
After resucitation she was volume overloaded and required 10mg IV Lasix which she responded with brisk UOP.
Patient's gap closed and her ketosis and lactic acidosis improved.
This was thought to be the likely contributing precipitant of patient's diabetic ketoacidosis.
She completed 9 days of treatment and had been afebrile for several days before discharge to hospice.
#Hospital-acquired pneumonia: Patient's chest x-ray on [**8-19**] showed signs of new right-sided pneumonia.
DDx included aspiration PNA versus hospital-acquired.
Patient was tachypneic, mildly febrile and with persistent leukocytosis but otherwise asymptomatic with no cough or sputum production.
Patient's cefepime was re-dosed to treat for pneumonia and she completed 9 days of treatment.
#Clostridium Difficile infection: Patient was noted to have loose stools on transfer from the ICU.
KUB was obtained on [**8-24**] showing only some mild ileus but no signs of megacolon.
#Hypertension: Pt's blood pressures reflected isolated systolic hypertension only, with peaking SBP approximately 170.
#Tachycardia: Patient's rate was irregular, tachycardic and suggestive of a wandering atrial pacemaker.
Patient had two brief episodes of atrial fibrillation on hospital day 8 in the setting of hypoglycemia and possible hypovolemia.
She spontaneously converted back to sinus rhythm and her metoprolol was increased to TID with some improvement of her heart rate.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM: #Parkinson's disease: Stable, with chronic muscle rigidity.
Discontinued simvastatin due to lack of risk factor modification benefit .
#Anemia: Likely of chronic disease.
Transitional Issues: - patient has a foley due to long-standing urinary incontinence and muscle rigidity from parkinson's, this should be monitored - patient was discharged to hospice and her medications were adjusted to promote comfort per the recommendations of the palliative care team and the wishes of the family  Medications on Admission: (Per Nursing Home Records) levothyroxine 50mcg omeprazole 40mg MVI Miralax Cranberry pills Vitron C 125mg carbidopa/levadopa 25/100 [**Hospital1 **] Calcitriol 0.25 MCG 1 cap daily Dorzolamide Hcl 2% Eye drops left eye TID APAP 650 [**Hospital1 **] prn pain metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] colace artificial tears amlodipine 2.5mg QD Simvastatin 20mg QD Lexapro 20mg daily Procrit [**2181**] mg qwk Insulin NPH Insulin humalog (complex sliding scale outlined in Nursing home chart)   Discharge Medications: 1. dorzolamide 2 % Drops Sig: One (1) Drop Ophthalmic TID (3 times a day): Left eye.

Lomotil 2.5-0.025 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO twice a day as needed for diarrhea.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Facility: [**Hospital 13054**] Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: Delirium secondary to infections below Healthcare associated pneumonia C. difficile associated diarrhea Urinary tract infection .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Parkinson's disease Dementia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
We found evidence of a urinary tract infection as well as a pneumonia and an infection in your intestines.
Unfortunately, this is a common result of Parkinson's and dementia and is unlikely to get better.
The intestinal infection was called C. diff diarrhea and is common in people who are hospitalized or who live in [**Hospital 4382**] facilities.
