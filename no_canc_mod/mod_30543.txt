Admission Date:  [**2118-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-5-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-6-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: ORTHOPAEDICS  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 64**] Chief Complaint: S/p Total Hip Replacement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: total hip replacement  History of Present Illness: This is a 74 year old male with PMH significant for HTN, CAD, diastolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated PASP of 41 mm Hg on last ECHO in [**4-4**], OA, hyperlipidemia, DM2, who was admitted to the MICU for post-operative monitoring following a L THA revision.
Post-operative course was complicated by development of AMS, left-sided facial droop, and left sensory neglect.
X-rays at that time showed a periprosthetic fracture with the Accolade femoral stem rotated and a displaced fracture of the left greater trochanter.
Unfortunately, the surgery was complicated by a large amount of blood loss and hemodynamic instability requiring Levophed 0.1 mcg/kg/min and phenylephrine.
Anesthesia was attempting to wean the phenylephrine prior to transfer to the ICU.
He was kept sedated with propofol and small bolus doses of ketamine and fentanyl during the procedure.
He did not have a central line, but has good peripheral access and an A-line.
Patient was intubated, off of sedation, and minimally responsive.
Phenylephrine was weaned off due to bradycardia to the 30s.
Past Medical History: hypertension, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, and occasional anxiety; tonsillectomy   Social History: Retired, lives with wife.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Bradycardic, 2/6 SEM radiating to the left axilla Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding.
GU: Condom cath to drainage bag [**1-26**] scrotal edema Neuro: Intact with no focal deficits LLE: * Incision healing well with staples * Thigh full but soft * No calf tenderness * 5/5 strength * SILT, NVI distally * Toes warm   Pertinent Results: [**2118-5-20**]: CT head w/contrast: 1.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Multiple paranasal sinus disease, likely relates to the endotracheal intubation.
This is a 74 year old male with PMH significant for HTN, CAD, diastolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated PASP of 41 mm Hg on last ECHO in [**4-4**], OA, hyperlipidemia, DM2, who was admitted to the MICU post-operatively while still intubated and sedated for hemodynamic monitoring following a left THA revision complicated by a large amount of blood loss and hemodynamic instability requiring two pressors.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: The patient had extensive blood loss requiring 12 units of pRBCs, 14 units of FFP, and a 6 pack of platelets.
There was concern for CVA or neurogenic shock as his blood pressures have varied widely from 80s-180s systolic, he is bradycardic, however CTA head was negative.
Central line was placed and levophed continued for low pressures.
He was also noted to have ST elevations on EKG likely in setting of demand ischemia related to hypotension and blood loss in setting of CAD.
POD 4 - Hct 26.9 -> Transfused 1 unit PRBCs  Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.
The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage.
The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen.
The patient's weight-bearing status is PARTIAL (50%) weight bearing on the operative extremity at all times with posterior/trochanter off precautions.
3. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): hold for loose stools.
6. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: L hip greater trochanteric periprosthetic fracture with stem rotation Hypotension Hypovolemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Please return to the emergency department or notify your physician if you experience any of the following: severe pain not relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased sensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5, shaking chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision site, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns.
You have been given medications for pain control.
As your pain decreases, take fewer tablets and increase the time between doses.
This medication can cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily and take a stool softener (such as colace) as needed to prevent this side effect.
Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken out by the visiting nurse (VNA) or rehab facility three weeks after your surgery.
Check wound regularly for signs of infection such as redness or thick yellow drainage.
VNA (once at home): Home PT/OT, dressing changes as instructed, wound checks, and staple removal at three weeks after surgery.
No strenuous exercise or heavy lifting until follow up appointment.
Physical Therapy: LLE PWB (50%) at all times 2 crutches or walker at all time Posterior/trochanter off precautions Mobilize HIGH fall risk  Treatments Frequency: Dry sterile dressing daily as needed for drainage Wound checks Ice as tolerated Staple removal POD 21 ([**2118-6-9**]) - replace with steristrips TEDs x 6 weeks  Followup Instructions: Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 177**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3260**], [**MD Number(3) 3261**]:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**] Date/Time:[**2118-6-17**] 11:00    Completed by:[**2118-5-25**
