Provisional Findings Impression: JRCi WED [**2166-1-15**] 7:48 AM Further evolution of hemorrhagic products without evidence of new hemorrhage or herniation.
FINDINGS: Numerous metallic foci with streak artifacts present within the left frontal lobe region, unchanged consistent with embolization of left frontal arteriovenous malformation.
Similar regions of hyperattenuation consistent with hemorrhage when compared to prior study with surrounding edema consistent with further evolution without new hemorrhage detected.
Similar mass effect upon the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is mild and unchanged.
No evidence of intraventricular spread of hemorrhagic products.

No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
CT imaging demonstrated a left frontal IPH which was a confirmed Arterio-venous malformation via the angiogram.
