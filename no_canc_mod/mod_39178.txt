Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a right handed 63 yo M with hx parathyroid adenoma that was here transferred from OSH with a R occipital hemorrhage on [**3-26**].
He presented a history of  developing a headache while sitting on the couch at 10:45 AM he developed a severe right temporal headache then moving toward his occiput.
Pain waxed and waned and was able to ambulate during this.
Upon arrival to OSH he was found to be in atrial flutter with BP 161/128.
CT head showed a large right occipital IPH and was given fosphenytoin, Ativan, started on a dilt drip and transferred here.
Past Medical History: -parathyroid adenoma -prior trauma to R eye   Social History: -lives with wife, no tobacco, occasional wine   Family History: -no history of strokes or hemorrhages   Physical Exam: O: T:  BP:112 /89         HR:125    R 16   O2Sats 93 Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger on fisharge he has a non focal neurological exam with persistent decreased vision to left eye.
Essentially unchanged large right occipital lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with mild mass effect in the adjacent parenchyma but no gross midline shift.
Differential diagnosis consideration for acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage includes hypertension, underlying brain lesion, AVM, or amyloid angiopathy.
No intraventricular hemorrhagic extension.
No new foci of hemorrhage.
No developing hydrocephalus.
Right occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema.
Findings on CT angiography of the head suggest a most likely an arteriovenous malformation in the region of hemorrhage within tortuous arterial structures supplying the region with a 5-mm density could represent compressed nidus or venous aneurysm.
No other vascular abnormalities.
Unchanged size of the right occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and surrounding edema, and minimal mass effect on the adjacent occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Extensive paranasal mucosal thickening and opacification of mastoid air cells bilaterally could represent an ongoing inflammatory process.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2139-4-5**]: No significant interval change.
Similar size of right occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding edema with a similar mass effect on occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle.
He also was noted to go into aflutter with RVR and was started on diltiazem gtt.
Upon txfer to [**Hospital1 18**], he was noted to have a left facial droop with good motor strength throughout.
Repeat head CT showed that the hemorrhage had grown to 4 x 2.3cm with edema but no midline shift.
A TTE showed an EF >75% and impaired relaxation.
On [**3-30**] he underwent a TEE which showed no clot and then underwent cardioversion into normal sinus rhythm.
