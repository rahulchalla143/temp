Admission Date:  [**2138-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-10-1**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 15716**] is an 84 year old female with CAD s/p CABG on [**2138-7-29**], AS, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on vanco for MRSA pneumonia who now presents with worsening shortness of breath and increasing oxygen requirements.
She reports ongoing productive cough though her cough is weak.
She denies fevers, chills, chest pain.
She reports that she remains mostly in bed following her previous admission for pneumonia.
Past Medical History: Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Aortic Stenosis Coronary Artery Disease History of Pulmonary Embolus Sjogren's Syndrome Osteoporosis Kyphosis Compression Fractures Cataract Surgery Colonic polypectomies  Social History: She is widow and lives alone, but has been at rehab since surgery.
BNP 4965 (no priors for comparison) .
Retrocardiac opacity along with atelectasis and left basal effusion, likely a combination of atelectasis and pneumonic consolidation.
Atelectasis is also seen in the right mid-zone.
Superimposed mild CHF.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Mild to moderate ([**11-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-8-4**], the gradient across the prosthetic aortic valve has increased and the aortic regurgitation is also increased.
Improvement of left lower lobe collapse.
Change in location and overall increased multifocal pneumonia, now more in the right lower lobe, less marked in right upper lobe, right middle lobe and left lower lobe.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications.
Enlargement of main pulmonary artery, suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
Left adrenal adenoma.
Kyphosis and unchanged multiple compression fractures.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 15716**] is an 84 year old female with CAD, AS, diastolic CHF admitted with a worsening shortness of breath likely due to worsening aspiration pneumonia and CHF.
Ms. [**Known lastname 15716**] was was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] with pneumonia, treated with levaquin and 14 day course of vancomycin for MRSA PNA completed on [**9-18**].
She presented on this admission with leukocytosis, though denies fevers or chills.
She had significant secretions, requiring deep suctioning due to patients poor cough.
She was treated with Vanco/Zosyn and deep suctioning and her pneumonia improved.
Patient had LE edema, shortness of breath.
She did not tolerate diuresis ddut to low blood pressures.
An echo revealed high pressure gradients across her recently (2 months prior) replaced aortic valve suggesting and malfunctioning valve.
Patient was anticoagulated for PE from 6 months prior and anticoagulated for A. fib.
However, developed significant epistaxis due to frequent deep suctioning requiring reversal of anticoagulation.
No evidence of a cardiac event during hospital stay.
Lisinopril was held due to hypotension.
During hospital stay, patient became progressively more tachypneic.
She had evidence of CHF but did not tolerate diuresis due to hypotension.
She was treated wtih vancomycin and zosyn for PNA and her pneumonia symptoms seemed to improved.
She developed worsening shortness of breath, and ABG revealed significant hypercarbia, likely due to tiring, worsening pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
