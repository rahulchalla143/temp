Admission Date:  [**2113-11-19**]      Discharge Date:  [**2113-12-2**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old white male with a history of hypertension and stroke who presented to the [**Hospital **] Hospital with complaints of back pain for three days.
The workup would include an ultrasound of the abdomen revealing a 10 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
The patient was also noted to be orthostatic and was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for further care for the possibility of a leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Cerebrovascular accident.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was mildly distended in his abdomen, but firm with a pulsatile mass.
He was brought to the operating room on [**2113-11-19**] with the likely diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
In the operating room, they found a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm which was repaired with an aortic bifemoral bypass graft.
He had full vent support and Levophed was started as well to maintain his systolic blood pressure.
He was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively, and he had a complicated and long Intensive Care Unit course including a myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, acalculous cholecystitis, status post cholecystostomy drainage tube, acute renal failure with aneuria, hemodynamic instability, anemia, electrolyte abnormalities, hypotension, and hyperalimentation for malnutrition, unable to eat, ventilator dependence, volume overload requiring Lasix.
Cardiology was following him as well secondary to the atrial fibrillation in which he had amiodarone drip performed and transitioned to po.
Continuing on his TPN with sips of water and with moderate thick bilious output from his gallbladder drain to relieve the gallbladder inflammation.
In addition to the anemia, he also had leukopenia as well as leukocytosis.
Tachycardia went along with his atrial fibrillation.
The worsening clinical course including an increasing distended abdomen, hypotension down to the 70 systolic range, metabolic acidemia, decreasing white count which was worrisome for sepsis and the origin was thought to be in his abdomen.
The procedure was exploratory laparotomy, left colectomy, transverse colostomy, drainage of multiple intra-abdominal abscesses as well as assessing the cholecystostomy tube for the gallbladder.
At surgery, it was confirmed that he had an open perforation with stool in his peritoneal cavity.
Multiple units of fresh-frozen plasma was given for his coagulopathy and all the abscesses were drained.
Renal consult was obtained suggested a continued TPN and to continue with volume resuscitation, who felt the oliguria was secondary to septic shock.
Continued to have respiratory distress and ventilatory dependence as well as dependence on total parenteral nutrition on pressors without any signs of improvement.
Continuing to be coagulopathic and family discussions with the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and the Surgical staff took place, and ended up deciding to change the patient's status to comfort measures only.
