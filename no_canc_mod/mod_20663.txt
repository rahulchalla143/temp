A failed intubation occured in the field, the pt was taken to an outside hospital and intubated there, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
She had an echo showing severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, a dilated right ventricular cavity with severe global free wall hypokinesis, Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation, mild (1+) mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
She experienced brief hypotension after propofol, NTG gtt, and lasix and was temporarily placed on levophed.
At the time, per the patient's husband, the patient had been doing well, without f/c/n/v, doe, cough, chest pain, sob, orthopnea/pnd with some LE edema, but stable.
Past Medical History: Hypertension - Longstanding hypertension since before [**2135**], medical records from PCP indicate BPs in the 140-170s/90-100s despite 3 antihypertensive management.
Pt was unaware of pregnancy until 3 weeks before delivery and was consuming alchol and tobacco up through c-section.
Family History: Identical twin sister with hypertension and episode of cardiomyopathy seen on echo that has since resolved with normal repeat echos.
Mother (living) - atrial fibrillation and hypertension.
Uncle (deceased) - Coronary Artery Dz at age 32, died of MI at age 42.
2 sisters (living) - hypertension, elevated cholesterol.

Severe systolic dysfuction with EF of 20% and global hypokinesis.
Ischemic origin excluded w/ cath (see below), familial and viral etiology could not be excluded.
ETT MIBI performed on [**6-29**] under Modified [**Doctor First Name **] Protocol had exercise duration of 6 min with termination for fatigue and 89% of maximum heart rate obtained; ECG showed diffuse upsloping ST segment depressions and sinus rhythm without ectopy.
Stress images showed a partially reversible, moderate-severe myocardial perfusion defect involving the distal anterior wall and apex, consistent with LAD distribution.
Cardiac catheterization performed on [**6-30**] revealed a right dominant system with normal coronary arteries and no flow limiting disease.
Patient will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] to evaluate for myocardial recovery.
Continue coumadin for global hypokinesis.
RHYTHM: Tachycardicia in hospital.
Consider electrophysiologic evaluation for risk stratification for an arrhthmic event (if depressed EF persists after time alotted for recovery from hibernating myocardium).
HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY: Found in the field with SBP > 200.
RESPIRTORY FAILURE: Collapsed at home with respiratory failure and intubated at outside hospital for severe respiratory distress.
CXR representative of CHF as well as focal opacification in the left lung base which could be a superimposed infection.
Patient received 10 day course of antibiotics for empiric treatment.
Respiratory failure most likely [**1-20**] pulmonary edema [**1-20**] cardiomyopathy or aspiration pneumonia.
On discharge, patient had O2 sats > 97% on RA, no shortness of breath, and able to ambulate without difficulty.
FEVER/LEUKOCYTOSIS: On admission, patient had a fever of 103 and leukocytosis with a WBC count of 34.9.
Fever and leukocytosis most likely caused by aspiration pneumonia.
