-Gait: deferred as pt is hand cuffed to bed and somewhat encephalopathic   Pertinent Results: NCHCT: (At [**Location (un) 620**]) There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or vascular territorial infarction.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL PROCESS.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 40029**] is a 45 year old right handed man with an extensive EtOH and cocaine hx as well as depression transferred after reported witness seizure at jail and then a possible seizure vs. syncopal episode in the MRI scanner at an outside.
There was no electrographic correlate to this episode.
Further history obtained on the floor noted that the patient has never had any limb shaking episodes associated with loss of consciousness ever before.
MRI of the head did not reveal any acute infarct or other intracranial abnormality.
The patient may have suffered a provoked seizure in the setting of alcohol withdrawal.
The episodes of "graying out" associated with altered consciousness are of unclear etiology.
There is no EEG correlate.
Cardiac telemetry revealed episodes of bradycardia to the mid 40's while the patient was sleeping.
Twelve lead EKG did not reveal any conduction abnormality.
Should further episodes of loss of consciousness occur in the future cardiac Holter monitoring may be considered.
He additionally reported a history of generalized anxiety disorder, for which he previously took citalopram.
Further evaluation for anxiety/panic disorder and clear depressive symptoms would greatly benefit the patient should he be amenable in the future.
