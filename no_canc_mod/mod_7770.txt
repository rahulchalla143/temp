However, on morning of admission patient awoke in a cold sweat with chest pressure in substernal area.
He describes this as somewhat similar to his previous anginal pain, but much more mild in nature.
Pain has radiated at times to his left shoulder and right shoulder.
Patient noted to have an episode of CP in the ED with relief by SL NTG x 1.
CXR with ?atelectasis RLL.
On arrival to the general cardiology floor patient remained with chest pain (apparently may never have been c/p free in ED).
Was started on nitro gtt with chest pain increased from [**4-23**] to [**6-23**].
Patient described some radiation to the back and was given 2mg of morphine with improvement in his pain at that time (but not resolution).
Past Medical History: - severe ischemic cardiomyopathy secondary to old inferolateral wall MI - CAD s/p MI x 3 (age 39, 42, 45) - ICD implantation initially for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, developed recurrent ventricular tachycardia status post multiple ablation, most recent VT ablation in [**2179-6-15**], complicated by laceration of the right iliac artery and significant retroperitoneal hematoma - H/O slow VT suppressed in a combination of amiodarone and mexiletine - H/O GERD and Barrett's esophagus - hyperlipidemia - hypertention - amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis with subsequent development of hypothyroidism: risk of recurrence approximately 10%, endocrine evaluated pt in past and thought it was OK to restart; currently on amiodarone.
- CKD with baseline Cr 1.4  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current or past tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death, but his his 2 brothers are both in their 60's and suffer from CAD, his father had multiple MIs and a CVA in his 80's.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thyromegaly or nodules.
Distant heart sountds.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
Unchanged appearance of multiple renal cysts.
Right basilar atelectasis.
No acute intrathoracic process.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 69 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy, two [**Month/Day/Year 12425**] CAD, p/w known slow VT and chest pain.
VT: Likely [**1-16**] scar from underlying ischemic disease.
Restarted on mexilitene, with no further VT, as well as amniodorone.Supply confirmed with patient's pharmacy.
Chest Pain: Pt was initially on ngt/heparin drip but ruled out for  MI with negative biomarkers.
Did have 1 episode of CP in ICU with 1mm ST elevation and T wave changes, resolved with morphine.
Majority of CP episodes seem related to severe gerd for which he was treated with pantoprazole, ranitidine, sucralfate and GI cocktail PRN.
Pt did have known hx of Lcx, LAD lesions which had not been intervened upon.
He received a thallium viability study to evaluate the myocardium supplied by these coronary vessels which showed that these areas were infarcted and thus non viable.
Pt noted to have bibasilar crackles on exam, with peripheral edema.
He received IV lasix with good response and became euvolemic.
CTA chest ruled out PE but did show sabre shear trachea consistent with obstructive lung disease which should be followed up as o/p by PCP.
L femoral bruit: pt with L femoral bruit after L groin arterial access with AV fistula on US.
CT pelvis with no fistula but aneurysm.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Secondary Slow Ventricular Tachycardia Ischemic Cardiomyopathy s/p ICD placement   Discharge Condition: stable, good, chest pain free, baseline mental status, baseline ambulatory status .
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having chest pain.
This was most likely due to your heartburn.
