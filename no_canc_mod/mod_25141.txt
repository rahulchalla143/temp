His hospital course was complicated by multifactorial shock, empyema formation, community acquired pneumonia, acute renal failure, and heart failure.
Myocardial Infarction Upon admission to the hospital, patient was found to have ST depressions in V4 through V6 with markedly elevated CK to a peak of 2843 with MB 618 and Troponin T peaked to 13.88.
He was taken emergently to catheterization where he was found to have 3 vessel disease, aortic stenosis (valve area of .9), and cardiogenic shock.
Etiology was thought initially due to cardiogenic shock in the setting of his acute myocardial infarction.
His blood pressure improved; however, he was then thought to be septic due to bacteremia.
His blood pressure improved with medical management of his heart disease and bacteremia.
His liver function tests and creatinine were transiently elevated in the setting of his hypotension but improved throughout hospital course.
Sepsis Patient was found to have MSSA bacteremia with an associated MSSA empyema.
He also had line associated coag negative staph bacteremia (1/4 bottles) and was treated with 7 day course of vancomcyin to be completed on [**2190-3-4**].
Pneumonia Patient had an initial sputum culture which was positive for moraxella catarrhalis.
Empyema During his hospitalization, patient developed recurrent fevers.
Repeat chest CT imaging demonstrated development of a complicated left sided effusion.
He underwent a thoracentesis by thoracic surgery and his effusion was consistent with an empyema.
He has an appt with a thoracic surgeon in 1 week with a CXR before the appt to evaluate the tube and possibly remove it.
Bacteremia During his hospitalization, patient developed recurrent fevers.
He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2190-2-18**] which did not demonstrate a clear cause of his respiratory failure.
His respiratory status improved with diuresis, treatment of his underlying infection, and treatment of his cardiac disease.
Acute Kidney Injury Patient initially presented with marked acute kidney injury with a creatinine that peaked at 4 during his admission.
Given his shock, fluid overload, and respiratory failure, patient was started on CVVH for a short time during his admission for aggressive fluid removal.
Etiology of his renal failure was thought likely related to shock, infection, sepsis, and bacteremia.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patient was converted from multiple outpatient oral medications to insulin with an insulin sliding scale.
Anemia Etiology appears most likely related to chronic inflammation, chronic renal insufficiency, sepsis, and multiple blood draws.
Hypernatremia Patient did have complications of hypernatremia during this admission with a peak sodium of 150.
Acute Systolic Heart Failure Patient was found to have a markedly reduced EF of [**10-7**]% thought likely related to ischemic heart disease.
We would recommend that his lasix be increased if he develops any signs of fluid overload.
Aortic Stenosis Patient was found to have a moderate aortic stenosis with a valve area of [**12-24**].2cm2.
Delirium Patient had brief episodes of delirium thought related to prolonged hospitalization and ICU course, medications related to benzodiazepines and opiates.
His symptoms improved quickly with frequent reorientation and avoiding further sedating or altering medications.
Heparin, Porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Acute Renal Failure 3.
Myocardial Infarction 4.
Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure 5.
Aortic Stenosis  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
This was thought likely related to a heart attack, lung infection related to your recent falls and rib fractures, and rib fractures.
Your hospital course was also complicated by a severe blood infection for which you were treated with antibiotics.
This should be stopped on [**2190-3-4**] - nafcillin - this is an antibiotic to treat your lung infection and this should be continued until [**2190-3-12**].
- provigil - we have discontinued this medication -your ACE inhibitor was stopped because of acute renal failure, it should be restarted once your kidneys improve.
Please return to the hospital if you have any fevers, shaking chills, night sweats, worsening or changing shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity swelling, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.
