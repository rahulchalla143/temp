Admission Date:  [**2114-3-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2114-3-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2045-11-30**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of primary biliary cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease awaiting transplant with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and depression who presents with increased confusion and worsening mental status over the past two days.
The patient has had increased diarrhea/loose stools four to five times per day, and notes that in the past week she has had bright red blood on her tissue with wiping and a question of blood with her stools.
The patient denies nausea, vomiting, fevers, abdominal pain, or increased abdominal distention.
She noted a cough in the supine position.
Primary biliary cirrhosis with end-stage liver disease; having rapid progression over the past year.
History of atrial fibrillation.
Anxiety and depression.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was a markedly jaundiced and obese female, confused, in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed anicteric sclerae.
There was no lymphadenopathy.
No jugular venous distention.
There was upper quadrant fullness bilaterally.
No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin revealed blanching patchy rash on the medial aspect of her right leg, markedly jaundiced throughout.
Urinalysis revealed moderate bilirubin and 1+ urobilinogen; otherwise negative.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An abdominal ultrasound revealed portal vein was patent, small ascites (not enough for paracentesis), and nodule seen in the left lobe of the liver (which corresponds to an enhancing mass seen on recent computed tomography).
No new masses present.
Cholelithiasis was present without evidence of cholecystitis.
A chest x-ray revealed a left pleural effusion, questionable left lower lobe infiltrate versus consolidation, and mild pulmonary edema.
HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY ISSUES:  The patient had confusion and a change in mental status attributed to hepatic encephalopathy likely related to her dehydration, gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, and the possibility of infection.
Given her recent increase in diuretic doses, dehydration was the most probable cause of this decompensation.
The patient was eventually weaned off of lactulose and then developed some mild confusion.
She was to follow up with her hepatologist with regard to further management of her hepatic encephalopathy.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient had evidence of a gastrointestinal bleed with guaiac-positive stools and a history of bright red blood per rectum.
During her hospital stay, she had a colonoscopy that showed nonbleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed a small hiatal hernia, grade 1 varix at the gastroesophageal junction, and portal gastropathy.
She was to follow up with her gastroenterology specialist with regard to further management as no active bleeding was suspected.
END-STAGE LIVER DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had continued workup for her transplant including a stress test which showed no myocardial perfusion defects and had [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus testing.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient had evidence of acute renal failure on presentation that was due to prerenal causes given her history of gastrointestinal bleed and marked volume depletion on presentation with a history of diuretic dose increase.
She will be restarted on low-dose diuretics for discharge and should have close followup from her hepatologist with regard to her volume status and renal function.
She had no hypertension during her hospital stay.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had evidence of consolidation/infiltrate on her admission chest x-ray.
Although, she was afebrile and did not have a white blood cell count elevation, there was concern that an infectious process could be leading to her decompensation.
She was given a course of Levaquin for seven days and remained afebrile and stable without a white blood cell count elevation.
PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her outpatient Zoloft dose to address her baseline depression and anxiety.
A chest x-ray done following this event showed a small left pleural effusion, but no evidence of infiltrate or congestive heart failure.
Primary biliary cirrhosis with end-stage liver disease.
Acute renal failure.
Depression and anxiety.
The patient was instructed to follow up with her liver doctor (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]) within the next week to follow up on management of her hepatic encephalopathy and her volume status.
She will need followup regarding her renal failure issues.
