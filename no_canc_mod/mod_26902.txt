NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  FINDINGS: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left temporal lobe, in addition to surrounding subarachnoid hemorrhage within this region and the left frontoparietal lobes displays expected decreased attenuation, however, no significant change in size.
Additional large subdural hematoma along the left frontal vertex is markedly decreased in attenuation.
A small left parietal subdural hematoma is not well visualized.
Bilateral subdural hygromas have enlarged substantially since the prior study of [**2134-12-24**].
Multiple new punctate areas of hyperdensity are noted along the right frontal lobe, not seen on prior examinations, likely consistent with smal amounts of hemorrhage within the subdural hygromas.
No significant mass effect, midline shift, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial infarct is identified.
The size of the lateral ventricles remain stable with the amount of blood layering within the occipital horns appearing markedly decreased in size and attenuation.
Left mastoid air cells appear to be surgically removed.
Multiple small punctate areas of hemorrhage within the right subdural hygroma.
No significant interval change to left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and scattered areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Left parietal and right and left frontal subdural hematomas display interval evolution and decrease in size.
Decreased size and increased evolution to intraventricular hemorrhage.
No overt hydrocephalus identified.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  Reason: S/P FALL Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old man with AMS, vomiting after being found down at bottom of stairs REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evaluate for intrathoracic, intraabdominal pathology CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
There are nodular opacities in "tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]" pattern within the right upper, lower and middle and the left lower lobe.
Bilateral small pleural effusions and dependent atelectasis.
There is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is detected.
The stomach is markedly dilated and fluid filled.
No oral contrast was administered which limits the evaluation of the small and large bowel; however, no gross abnormality is detected.
There is no free fluid within the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Scoliosis with associated degenerative changes are noted.
IMPRESSION: Findings in the lung parenchyma may represent bronchiolitis and developing bronchopneumonia.
Aspiration pneumonia should also be considered.
He developed high fevers and was pan cultured; chest CT scan of his chest revealed evidence of a likely bronchial pneumonia.
