No active bleeding.
Bile noted in duodenum, no blood.
Recommendations: Small non-bleeding ulceration and gastritis noted in stomach.
1.5 cm raised gastric lesion of unknown significance potentially from previous ulcer with raised edges or potential submucosal lesion such as GIST.
Recommend repeat endoscopy in 6 weeks to assess improvement in ulceration and address raised lesion if still present and or need for EUS.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 89 year-old woman with atrial fibrillation on warfarin who was admitted for an upper gastrointestinal bleed with an INR of 3.2.
An upper endoscopy revealed gastritis, small non-bleeding antral ulcer and 1.5 cm raised gastric lesion.
# Atrial fibrillation: She had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and had been anticoagulated with coumadin.
Upon discharge, it was decided that given her risk of stroke anticoagulation should not be discontinued altogether.
# Acute Renal Failure: Her acute elevation in serum creatinine was likely due to relative renal hypoperfusion in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for black tarry stools, a sign of upper GI bleeding.
