Interval development of bilateral interstitial opacities as well as bilateral pleural effusions, the findings are suggestive of interstitial edema.
Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence for pneumonia.
Diffuse ground-glass opacity with intralobular septal thickening suggestive of volume overload; however, other entities including PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/or drug reaction can provide a similar picture.
No retroperitoneal hematoma.
Diffuse anasarca.
Extensive coronary artery calcification.
Extensive calcification of the abdominal aorta and its branches.
Atrophic kidneys.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
Extensive degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine with old compression deformities at L4 and T9-T10.

Large hiatal hernia.
Right pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Dilatation of the common bile duct with no visible obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: 1)Respiratory distress:  He initially presented with respiratory distress which was most likely due to combination of dietary indescretions and having to go an extra day without dialysis over the weekend.
He was initially admitted to the MICU but his symptoms resolved quickly with dialysis.
He had a CT of his chest which did not show any evidence of pneumonia.
He ruled out for influenza with a nasal aspirate.
He was transferred to the floor where he remained stable from a respiratory standpoint until 2 weeks into his course when he developed hypoxia and respiratory alkalosis due to over medication with morphine.
His antibiotic coverage was expanded to include levofloxacin and flagyl because he had some abdominal pain at the time.
The flagyl was continued given a positive CDiff test and will be continued on discharge.
2)Coagulase negative staph bacteremia - He was found to have coag negative staph growth on blood cultures from admission, unclear if contaminant or if true bacteremia, however given h/o multiple lines and limited options for future dialysis access, will treat with course of antibiotics for bactermia for two weeks.
He did have Lspine MRI last admission with concern for L3/4 abnormality which could be c/w infection.
He had a repeat MRI L spine which showed no change.
He did well following this with no complications.
4)Anemia: acute on chronic, decrease during this admission likely [**2-9**] right fem line placed in the ED on admission which had continued bleeding for several days until removal.
Since line removed, no further bleeding with stable HCT.
5)Acute on Chronic systolic CHF: TTE last admission showed global hypokinesis with decreased EF from prior (35-40%).
Presenting symptoms likely at least in part due to volume overload.
Now resolving as pt's dyspnea improved, CT [**12-25**] showed no pulm edema.
Last HD was [**2127-1-6**] - Continued nephrocaps, sevelamer - vanco locks to dialysis line after dialysis to prolong lifespan of line  # Hypertension: Blood pressure has been well controlled, trending toward low-normal BP rather than hypertension.
A low-grade infection could not be ruled out on imaging, however, Neurosurgery declined intervention at that time.
Repeat MRI showed no change.
# History of graft thrombosis: Multiple clots in grafts and IVC in past.
# Type 2 diabetes: No acute issues - Humalog sliding scale - no fixed dose - Continued gabapentin for neuropathy  # Chronic draining chest wound: VISA.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for heartburn.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: community acquired pneumonia acute systolic CHF Bacteremia Pseudoaneurysm s/p repair Clostridium difficile infection   Discharge Condition: The patient was afebrile, normotensive, satting 100% on RA with resolving diarrhea on discharge   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having difficulty breathing.
Your breathing difficulty was most likely related to eating too much salt and your kidney disease.
Your symptoms improved with dialysis.
During your hospital stay you were found to have an aneurysm on your right arm which was repaired by the surgeons.
You also developed an infection with increased WBC and diarrhea which was likely an infection in your colon.
You are being treated with IV antibiotics for this infection and your diarrhea is resolving.
You had an episode of confusion that was likely because of too many pain medications - specifically morphine - and your infection.
5)You were started on Flagyl 500mg IV every 6 hours for your colon infection (C.Diff).
You should call your doctor or come back to the emergency room if you develop fevers, chills, headache, confusion, neck pain, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, blood in your stool or black stools, diarrhea, leg swelling, more than 3 pounds weight gain in one day or any other concerning symptoms.
