Admission Date:  [**2151-5-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2151-5-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2086-6-28**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU MEDICINE  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post LAD stent in [**2145**] complicated by in-stent thrombosis after one week status post thrombectomy.
The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2145**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1, SVG to PDA, to PLV for a nonintervenable lesion of the PDA.
The patient also has a history of hypertension, elevated cholesterol.
He had a Persantine MIBI in [**9-7**] for unstable angina which showed only a small fixed inferior defect which was thought to be artifact and an ejection fraction of 63%, now presenting with worsening exertional chest pain and shortness of breath for the last month.
The patient was found to have new T wave inversions in leads II, aVF, V2 through V4 on the EKG.
The patient reports chest pain with minimal exertion such as walking one to two blocks or climbing two to three flights of stairs associated with shortness of breath.
Denied any chest pain at rest.
Denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity edema, orthopnea.
At catheterization, he was noted to have two 80% serial lesions between the RPDA and RPL anastomoses.
When the wire crossed these lesions, the patient became bradycardiac and had an asystolic arrest.
No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Slight parasternal tenderness to palpation.
The EKG was normal sinus rhythm, rate of 70, normal axis and intervals, Q waves present in leads III and aVF, ST elevations of 3 mm in II, III, and aVF and biphasic T present in V6.
Persantine MIBI in [**9-7**] showed mild fixed inferior defect, ejection fraction of 63%.
Left ventriculogram showed normal ejection fraction with no mitral regurgitation.
LAD showed mild in-stent occlusion, distal filling via LIMA.
No significant disease.
Left circumflex showed distal subtotal occlusion with small distal vessel, RCA showed an occluded PDA and mid PL branch, both filling via saphenous vein graft.
Mild disease SVG to RPDA to RPL.
After his interventions, the patient was noted to have ST elevations in inferior leads and complained of chest pain.
ACUTE INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION SECONDARY TO DISTAL EMBOLIZATION DURING PCI:  EKG after catheterization showed residual ST elevation in II, III, and aVF.
Peak CKs were in the 2,000 range with no evidence of RV infarction by right heart catheterization.
His pain was controlled with a nitroglycerin drip and Dilaudid p.r.n.
After about eight hours post catheterization, his pain subsided.
HYPOTENSION:  The patient was transiently hypotensive during catheterization and was placed on dopamine temporarily which was discontinued after the patient left the catheterization laboratory.
HEMATURIA:  The patient was with gross hematuria after catheterization, likely secondary to combination of Bivalirudin, Integrilin, Plavix, and aspirin during his catheterization.
The patient had several episodes of large clots obstructing which were flushed and suctioned out of his continuous bladder irrigation.
After his Integrilin was discontinued, his hematuria resolved over the next day and his catheter was pulled after his urine drained clear.
SUPERFICIAL THROMBOPHLEBITIS:  On the patient's third hospital day, he was noted to have swelling and tenderness over his left dorsum of his hand associated with a peripheral IV site.
There was erythematous tracking noted up to the antecubital fossa.
for an acute myocardial infarction.
GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE:  Per the patient's wife, he has a history of elevated glucose which has previously been diet-controlled.
It was consistent with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] with satelite lesions present.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is ambulatory, chest pain-free, saturating well in room air.
