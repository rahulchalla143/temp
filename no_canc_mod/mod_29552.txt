HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old female, status post right nephrostomy tube placement for hydronephrosis, who, in the past had had a left colectomy with a coloanal anastomosis, who, also underwent XRT which was the cause of her hydronephrosis, who, presented with increasing right flank pain and right lower quadrant pain and abdominal distention.
Her husband had placed the nephrostomy tube which was clamped to gravity and started her on Ciprofloxacin for a possible urinary tract infection and brought her to the hospital.
She had abdominal pain with no fevers or chills and had a regular bowel movement with no blood and no diarrhea.
She did notice some decreased appetite and increasing pain in her abdomen.
She has a seizure disorder due to encephalitis.
She has Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infections in the past.
ALLERGIES:  She had no known drug allergies.
Her heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Her abdomen was distended and tender and tympanitic with no masses and no hepatosplenomegaly and positive bowel sounds.
She had mild edema and her neurological exam was unchanged from prior.
Urinalysis was sent which showed positive nitrites and positive leukocyte esterase and from 10 to 20 white blood cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted with urinary tract infection to the Medical Service and given antibiotics to cover both Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and gram negative rods and continued on her medications.
During her hospital course, a CT scan was obtained which found a large abscess in her low pelvic region which also showed mild air in that region as well consistent with a perforation near her anastomosis of her colon.
On [**2161-11-21**], in the evening, the patient was noted to have increasing abdominal pain and temperature to 101.5.
On exam by the Surgical Service, it was noted that she had feculent material coming out of her Foley catheter and a colovesicular fistula was diagnosed.
She continued to have increasing abdominal pain with increasing white count and on [**2161-11-22**], it was decided that the patient should go to the Operating Room for a diverting loop transverse colostomy.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room where an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and loop colostomy was performed.
She did well postoperatively, however, her blood pressure was quite labile and she had a temperature spike to 103.2 and was hypotensive.
She was continued on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl for both Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as for her colovesicular fistula.
Therefore, pain medication was slowly titrated to an adequate amount of pain control, however, without the side effect of hypotension.
She had significant dilated loops of bowel intraoperatively as well as postoperatively and was required on significant fluid volume.
A PIC line was placed for long term TPN and for access purposes.
She was started on continuous bladder irrigation at a very slow rate and this was found to help clear the feculent material from the bladder and her blood pressure slowly resolved.
Her white count stayed elevated for a significant time before returning to normal prior to discharge.
She was slowly started on sips which she tolerated, however, when she had been advanced to a full diet, she began having episodes of emesis and was made NPO.
A repeat KUB at the time showed dilated loops of small bowel and it was decided that she would be made NPO.
Physical Therapy was also consulted when the patient arrived on the floor for strengthened ambulation due to her prolonged Intensive Care Unit stay as well as her decreased nutritional status.
The patient continued to have continuous bladder irrigation and a Foley catheter was used to flush the distal aspect of the colon.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and the output of the colovesicular fistula reduced.
At that time, it was decided that the continuous bladder irrigations could be stopped and the patient continued to put out clear urine through her Foley.
The patient was able to void adequately in spite of having the colovesicular fistula after closure of the diverting loop colostomy distal end.
Urology was following for that purpose.
The Vanco was stopped after Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not identified in the urine and Flagyl was stopped after cultures were negative for anaerobes.
Nutrition was following for calorie counts at the time of discharge to assess nutritional requirements as well as whether or not the patient could meet her nutritional needs.
Her TPN was cycled in order to increase the amount of time she would be without infusion and the patient tolerated this well.
The patient had calorie count which were done, however, for two of the three days, the patient was kept NPO for procedures, therefore, the calorie counts were continued until this time as an adequate and correct count could be done.
Colovesicular fistula, status post exploratory laparotomy and diverting loop colostomy.
