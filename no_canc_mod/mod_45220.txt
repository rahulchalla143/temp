In brief, this is a 48 year old lady with a history of hepatitis C, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis who was initially transferred from [**Hospital1 328**] to the Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 536**] for respiratory failure status post intubation for community-acquired pneumonia, status post cardiac arrest secondary to tension pneumothorax in the form of a PEA arrest.
Since the last Discharge Summary, the patient developed persistent fevers and a new onset rash in her extremities and upper torso.
This was felt likely to be secondary to either the Dilantin or the Trilafon.
In addition, the patient developed elevated liver function tests.
As stated in the previous discharge summary, the patient had an episode of pancreatitis and transient elevation of the transaminases which were decreasing at that time.
The patient continued to have fevers greater than 102.0 F., on a daily basis.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained on [**1-30**] to rule out any evidence of cholecystitis.
There showed no evidence of cholecystitis based on this ultrasound.
On [**2-1**], given the patient's lack of neurological improvement and decline after stopping the anti-seizure medications, this was discussed with Neurology and it was felt that the patient would benefit from an EEG and initiation of a new anti-seizure medication.
The patient's EEG did not show any evidence of seizure activity but it was felt that this was less conclusive given the fact that she has been recently medicated as well as it was just a snapshot of her neurological status.
Given her dramatic improvement after starting the Keppra, it was felt that the patient's declining neurological status was most likely secondary to underlying seizures with intermittent post-ictal states.
On [**2-2**], five days after the cessation of her Dilantin and Trilafon medications, the patient continued to have marked improvement in mental status and effectively defervesced.
Since then, the patient has been afebrile with temperatures in the range of 97.0 F. to 98.0 F.  The patient's liver function tests subsequently began decreasing and at the time of this dictation, the patient's AST is in the 200's and ALT is in the 100's.
It was felt that the fevers were of unknown origin and her CBC and liver function tests were likely secondary to the Dilantin therapy.
Respiratory failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia.
Underlying seizure disorder.
