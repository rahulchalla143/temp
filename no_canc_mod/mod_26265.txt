History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 496**] is a 43-year-old woman with a history of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement 6-years-ago for aortic insufficiency/endocarditis.
According to patient, she had been doing well until this summer when she moved down to [**State 108**] and noticed worsening shortness of breath.
She initially attributed these symtpoms to humidity, but eventually returned to [**State 350**] where she was supposedly diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and treated with antibiotics.
Ms. [**Known lastname 496**] somewhat better and went to [**Location (un) **] to visit her uncle; during this trip developed worsening shortness of breath and was hospitalized for a CHF exacerbation.
She was subsequently told to go to the ED for treatment of CHF exacerbation.
Ms. [**Known lastname 496**] complains of progressive dyspnea since this summer, worse in the last month.
She endorses symptoms of orthopnea, cough, and hemoptysis.
She states that she has had some fever and chills for the past week, though hadn't taken her temperature.
On further review of systems, patient denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed no significant coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 40 mmHg and low central aortic pressures 66/47 with a mean of 57 mmHg.
There was severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 97 mmHg.
Supravalvular aortography revealed 3+ aortic regurgitation.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: On Milrinone, epinephrine, vasopressin, levophed, IABP Mild global RV hypokinesis.
Thoracic aortic contour is intact.
2+ eccentric MR jet.
[**2180-11-11**] Postop ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

The patient was placed on BiPAP, and given mild diuresis.
There, severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 97 mm Hg was discovered.
The supravalvular aortography revealed 3+ aortic regurgitation.
She experienced a postoperative coagulopathy, receiving large amounts of blood products.
She went on to develop hypotension with escalating pressor requirements.
Echocardiogram was consistent with tamponade and she eventually required re-exploration with significant improvement in hemodynamics.
Also developed oliguric acute renal insufficiency secondary to acute tubular necrosis, and was started on CVVH.
