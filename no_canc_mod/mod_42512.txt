1) Hypoxia: The patient presented with bilateral infiltrates, fever, and markedly elevated WBC count with bandemia and imaging was consistent with a multilobar pneumonia.
Given his markedly elevated INR it was thought unlikely for him to have had a recurrent PE.
Given the wedge-shaped opacities on the chest CT, he had a TTE to evaluate his right sided heart valves which showed no signs of vegetation.
His oxygenation improved steadily, but note should be made that given his marked vasculopathy his pulse-oximetry should be measured from either his forehead or ear instead of his fingers.
His CT appeared to show a tracheo-esophageal fistula but on review of the images this was thought to unlikely.
He passed a bedside and video-swallowing eval and showed no sign of aspiration.
Following discharge he should have a follow-up appointment in pulmonary clinic to confirm resolution of his infiltrates, if his infiltrates do not entirely resolve, consideration should be made for lung biospsy to further evaluate his more chronic respiratory symptoms.
# Altered mental status: The patient presented with non-focal neurologic exam and following commands appropriately.
The likely cause was the significant hypoxia likely exacerbated by his pain medicine regimen.
# Coagulopathy: The patient presented with a markedly elevated INR likely induced by coumadin.
He showed no evidence of acute bleeding or consumptive coagulopathy.
# Acute renal failure: The patient presented in non-oliguric renal failure.
This was likely of pre-renal etiology given minimal protein in the urine and unremarkable urinalysis.
# Chronic pain: His pain medicines were decreased on admission given his altered  mental status then gradually re-introduced as his pneumonia improved.
# Hypothyroidism: There were no acute issues and he remained on his home dose of levothyroxine.
Robitussin Cough-Congestion 10-200 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: [**2-4**] PO every six (6) hours as needed for cough.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) nebulization Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
You had a severe Pneumonia and you were treated initially in the Intensive Care Unit with Vancomycin.
If you experience worsening cough, fevers > 101, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or any other concerning symptoms then please call your doctor or report to the nearest emergency room.
