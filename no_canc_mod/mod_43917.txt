Admission Date:  [**2140-7-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2140-7-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-9-28**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old woman with vulvar cancer originally diagnosed in [**2131**], status post surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, coronary artery disease, and severe dilated cardiomyopathy, who presented to the hospital on [**7-11**] with perineal pain and was noted to have genital, perineal, and sacral decubitus ulcers.
She was evaluated by Plastic Service, General Surgery, and Gynecology and was planned for in no acute distress with diverting colostomy.
The patient was noted to have signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure on admission; however, diuresis was deferred secondary to a question of dehydration.
The patient was placed on antibiotic coverage for a possible skin infection as well as urinary tract infection.
Further studies revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion, hepatic congestion, as well as a left hip incision draining sinus from a previous total hip replacement.
There was evidence of periosteal elevation on pelvic plain films concerning for osteomyelitis and potential septic hip joint.
On the morning of [**7-14**], the patient was noted to become acutely short of breath.
Coronary artery disease; status post cardiac catheterization in [**2135**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent of the left anterior descending artery.
Cardiomyopathy; echocardiogram in [**2135**] revealed severe global left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 20%, severe mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Splenic artery aneurysm, status post embolization.
She was relatively immobile secondary to severe degenerative arthritis.
The abdomen was mildly distended, nontender.
Perineum revealed extensive excoriation, erythema, and ulcerations on the labia bilaterally.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray revealed a dilated heart, pulmonary edema.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, a left bundle-branch block, with more prominent T waves precordially and increased ST depressions in V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 62-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, and severe dilated cardiomyopathy, and a history of vulvar cancer who presented to the hospital with a perineal ulcer.
She was noted to be in mild congestive heart failure on presentation.
She was treated with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection and covered with cefazolin for possible infection in the perineum.
She was seen by General Surgery, Plastic Service, and Gynecology and was planned for surgical intervention with incision and drainage and a diverting colostomy.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**7-14**] for acute shortness of breath with a primary metabolic acidosis and secondary respiratory alkalosis.
Examination and chest x-ray were consistent with congestive heart failure.
She was evaluated by the Cardiology Service given her severe dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure and hypotension.
They recommended placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter prior to initiation of tailored therapy.
The patient continued to be markedly short of breath and desaturated with increased FIO2 requirements.
Her FIO2 requirements continued to increase, and she became hypotensive to the 70s.
This was no successful.
A follow-up chest x-ray revealed  the patient had developed a large left-sided tension pneumothorax.
The patient's family was kept informed of the ensuing events and decided to make the patient comfort measures only given her overall clinical status and declining quality of life over the past several years.
The patient subsequently became hypotensive.
Perineal ulcer.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
Severe dilated cardiomyopathy.
Urinary tract infection.
