This was done as a elective procedure after he had episodes of amaurosis fugax in right eye few days ago which on evaluation shows BL significant (more than 80 percent) carotid stenosis.
This am after waking up he noted weakness on right hand, arm followed quickly by right LE and difficulty speaking.
He was noted to have "Moderate difficulty with speech, and moderate right sided weakness."
CT head shows left thalamic bleed about 2.5 cm.
Past Medical History: HTN CAD s/p ACS CHF COPD on home O2 1L seemingly due to med non-compliance - PCP does not have record of this HLD Diverticulosis BPH Old left frontal stroke - no apparent deficits  Social History: lives with wife and normally mobilises well himself.

Comprehension relatively spared, can answer with head nodding to yes and No type questions.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
Sensation: Intact to touch and pain on left, difficult to assess right side.
Transfer out of ICU exam [**12-14**]:  Gen: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit Back: No point tenderness or erythema CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake, alert.
Some naming difficulties especially wioth body parts but seems to be improving.
Fundus per admission exam - no papilledema.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Right UMN facial weakness and considerable dysarthria.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
Sensation: Intact to touch and pain on left with decreased sensation on right per patient.
Reflexes: Presnet in UE and LE but absent ion bilateral ankles.
Coordination: difficult to assess due to compliance on left and hemiparesis on right  Gait/Romberg: Not assessed  =================================  Exam on discharge:  Essentially unchanged.
Continues to have significant aphasia with receptive and productive deficits.
Microbiology: [**2119-12-13**] 2:10 pm URINE     Site: CATHETER                              **FINAL REPORT [**2119-12-14**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2119-12-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
There is an increased amount of layering hemorrhage in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
A small amount of intraventricular blood is noted in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, unchanged.
There is surrounding edema, appears stable from prior CT. Also noted is a hypodense area in the left frontal lobe that appears unchanged and likely represents encephalomalacia from a prior infarct.
There is no shift of midline structures.
There is no new area of hemorrhage identified.
Stable left thalamic hemorrhage with slight increase in intraventricular hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle.
No new areas of hemorrhage identified.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2119-12-13**] 12:52 PM IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Within these limitations, left thalamic hematoma is redemonstrated, with surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality.
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.
Left thalamic hematoma is redemonstrated.
Stable left basal ganglia hemorrhage with partial resorption of intraventricular blood in the lateral ventricles.
No new areas of hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 RHM with HTN, HLD, CAD with previous MI, COPD on home O2 due to med non-compliance per wife, CHF, bilateral carotid stenosis >80% with elective seemingly uneventful right CEA for right sided amaurosis fugax on [**12-8**] and discharged on aspirin with no anticoagulation presented as transfer from OSH on [**12-13**] with right hemiparesis and severe expressive aphasia.
CT head at OSH reveals an 18x22mm left thalamic ICH with minimal intraventricular extension and old left frontal infarct and no hydrocephalus.
Exam in ED revealed R hemiplegia but it is unclear whether he was not putting in effort as 2 hours later he had some movement in R UE>LE.
He had a variable exam due to poor cooperation but was stable into [**12-14**].
Patient was very cantankerous and initially it was unclear what his right sided power really was.
Anticoagulation: repeat Ct did not show worsening basal ganglia hemorrhage.
8. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob wheeze.
9. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for sob wheeze.
10. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain fever.
PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: St [**Hospital **] Hospital Rehabilitation Unit - [**Location (un) 8117**], NH  Discharge Diagnosis: Hemorrhagic stroke in the thalamus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for concerns for right sided weakness and difficulty speaking.
Imaging tests revealed a stroke with bleeding in your brain.
Given the concern for bleeding in your brain, we stopped giving you aspirin.
You should only restart this medication once there is confirmation that the bleeding has stopped.
