The patient was then noted to have a sudden decrease level of consciousness with a heart rate on the pulse oximeter noted to be down to 44.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was alert and oriented x1 with bilateral rales and positive coffee ground emesis x2.
Furthermore, the patient also had a few more episodes of decreased responsiveness with heart rates in the 40s and systolic blood pressures to the 80s.
The electrocardiogram obtained at that time showed that the patient was bradycardic secondary to Mobitz type I AV block as well as ST depressions in V1 and AVL.
The patient's chest x-ray at this time was negative for any acute process.

Vitamin D 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
GENERAL:  The patient was in no apparent distress lying in bed.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended, nontender and positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  There was no cyanosis or clubbing.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The day of admission the patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit due to the episodes of coffee ground emesis as well as the episodes of bradycardia and unresponsiveness with hypotension.
CARDIAC:  An echocardiogram was obtained on the date of admission which showed preserved biventricular systolic function as well as aortic sclerosis.
Cardiology and EP was consulted to evaluate the patient for a pacemaker based on her new cardiac conduction abnormality.
The patient failed to have any more bradycardic episodes throughout her stay.
GASTROINTESTINAL/FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient had coffee ground emesis on admission and as well in the Emergency Room.
The patient had no further episodes throughout her stay.
The patient had nasogastric lavage which was negative.
PULMONARY:  On the day after admission, the patient had a follow up chest x-ray which showed interval development of a left lower lobe consolidation and collapse as well as possibly a small left pleural effusion.
Given the rapid change from her unremarkable chest x-ray on admission, this is likely aspiration pneumonia as related to her emesis.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient has hypothyroidism and her TSH was checked and was within normal limits at 0.77.
