She described being "unable to catch her breath," and not related to worsening ascites as her abdomen is soft.
The patient denies dyspnea on exertion but endorses orthopnea (baseline 6 pillows) and paroxymal nocturnal dyspnea.
The patient had been recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] 2/14-27/[**2132**] for alcoholic hepatitis with encephlopathy and hepatorenal syndrome.
Her Etoh hepatitis was addresss with steroids and NJT placement (subsequently DC'd).
The patient's diuretics had been stopped due to HRS.
The patient called the Liver Center today endorsing significant dyspnea and some respiratory distress.
Given concern for volume overload vs. infection, she was brought in by EMS to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
She continue to have nasal congestion from dry, bleeding mucosa.
CXR was not concerning for pneumonia or effusion.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with isolated T wave inversion in III.
She did have leukocytosis to WBC 18.1 (from [**9-29**]) with worsened left shift.
She was treated for a URI and at 5am on [**2133-1-15**] she had ~ 1L of hemetemesis during a BM.
Past Medical History: -Alcohol cirrhosis - diagnosed 6 years ago, complicated by esophageal varices (Grade 3 on EGD [**2129**] at [**Hospital6 28728**] Center), ascites, SBP (treated at [**Hospital3 7362**] [**2129**]), recent encephalopathy.
Also with portal gastropathy and recent hepatorenal syndrome -GERD -E. coli bacteremia/sepsis  Social History: -Tobacco history: At least 25 years -ETOH: Started drinking at 11 years old, by 18 years old was taking [**1-18**] drinks daily X 15 years.
No history of IVDU, tattoos or transfusions.
CARDIAC: RRR with no excess sounds appreciated LUNGS: CTA b/l with no wheezing, rales, or rhonchi.

No HSM or tenderness appreciated.
**FINAL REPORT [**2133-1-17**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2133-1-17**]):    NO GROWTH.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
CXR [**1-15**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute disease.
Low lung volumes with minor basilar atelectasis.
EGD [**2133-1-16**]: Normal mucosa in the duodenum Varices at the fundus Erythema and mosaic appearance in the body and fundus compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy Esophageal ring Varices at the mid esophagus Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (ligation) Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Echo [**1-16**]: Extremely limited image quality.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
PA pressure could not be determined due to extremely suboptimal image quality  Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 43 year old woman with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis/hepatitis complicated by ascites, encephalopathy and a history of SBP and HRS with known grade 3 esophageal varices on subtherapeutic nadolol presenting with dyspnea, with course complicated by esophageal variceal bleed.
Active Issues:  # Hemetemesis: Pt had a sentinel variceal bleed with 1L of hematemesis while on the hepatobiliary service.
On EGD she was found to have 4 non-bleeding grade III esophageal varices that were all successfully banded.
She was then extubated and had no subsequent hematemesis or melena.
She received 3 days of ocreotide and pantoprazole gtt, and she was started on PO pantoprazole, carafate, and ciprofloxacin for SBP ppx.
# Dyspnea: Pt initially presented with dyspnea of unknown etiology which resolved.
Thought likely [**12-18**] worsening ascites since her breathing improved with large volume paracentesis.
Alternatively she may have underlying reactive airway disease (is current smoker and uses albuterol inhalers at home).
Chronic Issues:  # Alcoholic hepatitis: Recent episode and diagnosed last admission.
Diuretics were held in setting of GI bleed and restarted after her Hct remained stable.
She had no signs of withdrawal.
# Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Stable, likely due to chronic liver disease/splenic sequestration.
