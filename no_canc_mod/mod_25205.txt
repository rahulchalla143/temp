Briefly, 68-year old man from [**Location (un) 5165**] admitted [**3-21**] for CABG, found to have tick on abdomen in OR on [**3-21**] (identified by micro as Ixodes; d/w micro - engorged).
On review with team: - no fevers during admission - no skin eruption, including site of bite - CBC post-op noted, w/ expected anemia, mild thrombocytopenia - pre-op liver panel wnl  Risk of disease transmission from Ixodes is for Lyme, Babesia, Anaplasma.
Very early in the season for Lyme transmission, particularly by adult tick; similar for Anaplasma (typically [**Month (only) 116**]-[**Month (only) 205**]); Babesia transmitted primarily by nymphal ticks in [**Month (only) 116**]-[**Month (only) 216**].
No presenting symptoms to date (Lyme: EM seen in 70-80%).
Rec: - monitor symptoms, particularly constitutional - eval LFTs x1 - CBC in coming weeks to ensure return to baseline CBC - f/up with primary care  If any abnormalities in symptoms or [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] refer to [**Hospital **] clinic for further evaluation.
He had an episode of bradycardia requiring pacing on post operative day 2.
He was asymptomatic at this time.
It is noted that the patient did have a tick removed from his left lower abdomen on arrival to the operating room.
His risk for Lyme disease and other infectious process is low given the species of tick and the season.
There is no rash on the time of discharge, and LFTs are normal.
It is the recommendation of the ID service to monitor the patient for constitutional symptoms and follow CBC.
