The LMCA had a mild 20% ostial stenosis.
The LAD had mild luminal irregularities but no angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
The LCx had a 90% stenosis just proximal to the bifurcation of the OM1 and OM2 branches involving the origin of these branches.
There was diffuse OM2 spasm with slow flow.
The RCA had mild disease and no angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
Limited resting hemodynamics performed after angiography and intervention revealed normal right- and mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 5 mmHg, mean PCW 19 mmHg).
The pulmonary artery pressure was mildly elevated at 23 mmHg.

Final angiography demonstrated a residual 60% ostial stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow   History of Present Illness: This is a 53 year-old man with history of hyperlipidemia and current tobacco use.
He developed acute-onset chest pain at  midnight on the day of transfer.
At 4am, the pain became unremitting and he presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.
Initial ECG showed anterior ST-elevations in leads v1-3 and he was treated with thrombolysis with tenecteplase at 10am.

Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Echo ([**7-11**]): 1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include hypokinesis of the inferior wall and akinesis of the inferolateral and lateral walls.. 3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

1) Anterior STEMI: Mr.B presented with persistent ST elevations after thrombolysis; his peak CK was 4651 and MB>500.
Cath revealed one vessel coronary artery disease and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Because Mr.B had initially received thrombolytic treatment, he was at risk for becoming hypercoagulable.
He was transferred to the CCU on the night of [**7-10**] for close monitoring.
Serial EKGs showed no signnificant change and cardiac enzymes trended down, so he was transferred back to the floor [**7-12**].
Post-MI echo showed a mildly dilated LA, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with LVEF of 30-35%.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include hypokinesis of the inferior wall and akinesis of the inferolateral and lateral walls.
Because these wall motion abnormalities put him at risk for thrombus formation, he was started on coumadin 5mg QD with a goal INR of [**12-28**].
As well, he is to undergo ETT with T wave alternans and echo, a signal average EKG, and a Holter monitor for risk stratification to determine whether he would benefit from an ICD.
2) CAD--Mr.B's has the following risk factors for CAD: tobacco use, dyslipidemia, HTN and being overweight.

Please return to the hospital in one month for echocardiogram and stress test (you will be contact[**Name (NI) **] with your appointment date and time).
Please return to the hospital for follow-up studies: ETT with T wave alternans and echo, signal averagibg EKG, and holter monitor.
