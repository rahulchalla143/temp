The patient underwent upper endoscopy, which showed esophagitis, non-bleeding gastric and duodenal ulcers.
The patient had continued GI bleed and scoped an additional three times.
The patient was found to be H. pylori positive and was started on Flagyl 500mg PO TID and claritromycin 500mg PO Q12H.
Additionally, the patient underwent thermal therapy and endovascular clipping with EGD at multiple sites as these gastric ulcers were later found to be bleeding.
Pt had his toenail removed and given cipro 400mg and flagyl 500mg given concern for stool contact with open wound.

IMAGING: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Mild prominence of the bifrontal subdural spaces likely represents to a component of atrophy.
Mild- to- moderate periventricular and subcortical white matter hypointensity represents small vessel ischemic changes.
There is evidence of a small prior left parietal lobe infarct.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous carotid arteries is noted bilaterally.
The surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable without evidence for fracture.
Mild bilateral ethmoid and maxillary sinus mucosal thickening is noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FOOT: No fracture or dislocation is identified.
Degenerative changes are most pronounced involving the first IP and MTP joints with joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation.
Soft tissue swelling is seen involving the first toe diffusely, but most prominent medial to the first MTP joint.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Erythema and friability of the mucosa with contact bleeding were noted in the antrum.
Excavated Lesions Multiple erosions were noted in the stomach body.
A single non-bleeding ulcer with clean basis was found in the stomach body.
Impression: Scarring in the duodenal bulb Erythema and friability in the antrum Erosions in the stomach body Ulcer in the stomach body Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum   Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo M with DM, HTN, CAD s/p CABG recently in [**9-10**] with subsequent a-fib with recent admission for upper GI bleed who presented with syncope, hypoglycemia and acute blood loss.
Pt admitted to ICU initially late evening [**10-16**] for concern for acute GIB with decreased Hct to 24.5 and received 2u pRBC.
# Upper GI Bleed with known gastric/duodenal ulcers - After transfer to the medical service, the patient underwent EGD on [**10-18**] that revealed a single non-bleeding ulcer with clean basis in the stomach, erythema and friability in the antrum and erosions in the stomach body and scarring in the duodenal bulb.
# Syncope: Pt with concerning episode of syncope PTA given recent GI bleeds.
He had no further episodes.
# Hypoglycemia/Diabetes II, controlled, without complications: Pt with low FS in ED and initially on the floor.
Likely [**2-3**] decreased po intake in the setting of glipizide with impaired renal clearance.
Likely [**2-3**] lactic acidosis from GI bleed or possibly mesenteric ischemia and uremia from renal failure.
No evidence of active infection.
#Transaminitis:  Pt with elevated LFTs on admit, likely related to hypotension.
No evidence of hepatitis.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency, IV: Baseline Cr 3.0-3.7,  Pt around baseline.
Likely mutifactorial given hx of DM and hypertension.
# Hypernatremia: Resolved.
# CAD s/p recent CABG: currently ASx.
