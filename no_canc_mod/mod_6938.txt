A color Doppler signal of near-continuous left-to-right shunt is seen across the interatrial septum c/w a secundum type atrial septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
He remained pain free on medical therapy but continued to experience symptomatic runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Cardiac catheterization on [**8-7**] revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease for which cardiac surgery was consulted.
It was felt that the ventricular tachycardia was ischemia related and agreed with plans for surgical revascularization.
There was [**2-16**]+ mitral regurgitation and no aortic valve disease.
It was also notable for a left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest, consistent with secundum atrial septal defect.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from inotropic support without difficulty.
There was no sequele.
Pt progressed with PT to a state that he could go home with VNA services  To note pt did have post operative Afib on the 28th.
