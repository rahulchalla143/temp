Admission Date:  [**2112-1-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-2-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-7-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Bactrim DS / Bactrim / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**] Chief Complaint: Back pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Multiple thoracic laminotomies from T3 to T12.
Anterior instrumentation T7-10   History of Present Illness: 59M with diabetes, parkinson sent in from [**Hospital3 **] for back pain and compression fractures.
He started developing back pain s/p several forceful transfers 3 weeks ago.
A T-Spine XR on [**1-19**] at [**Hospital1 **] showed possible Fracture, and he was transferred to Caritas [**Hospital3 **] ( [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]) where he had an MRI that showed severe compression fracture at T8 with less severe compression at T9, with complete obliteration of intevening joint space.
It also showed retropulsed fracture fragments producing effacement of 60% of the AP diameter of the spinal cord.
Of note, 5 years ago the patient tore his left quadriceps tendon which has required 6 lifetime surgeries, with a course that has been complicated by MRSA infection of his wound.
He delayed going to the hospital and wound up with a septic shoulder ([**2111-11-26**]), c/b abscess in his right axilla and biceps.
He was admitted to the medicine service for preoperative cardiac risk stratification.

Destruction of T8 vertebral body with retropulsion into spinal canal.
Constellation of findings most consistent with discitis osteomyelitis.
Tumor is a diagnostic consideration but considered less likely given the involvement of two contiguous vertebral bodies.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Lung volumes are quite low and there is vascular crowding at the lung bases particularly the right, but no focal pulmonary abnormality.
Rightward deviation of the trachea in the neck could be due in part to low lung volumes but suggests an adjacent mass effect, such as a large left thyroid lobe, as confirmed by the thoracic spine CT reported separately, which also showed small pleural effusions not apparent on this conventional radiograph.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Moderate medial and patellofemoral joint space narrowing.
The differential diagnosis includes changes related to osteomyelitis (subacute, chronic or old) and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
No focal ostelysis or acute periosteal new bone formation to confirm the presence of osteomyelitis, but soft tissue infection or early osteomyelitis might not be apparent radiographically.
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND [**2112-1-26**]: There is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation in the bilateral subclavian and right internal jugular, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.
Mild subcutaneous edema is present.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2112-1-27**]: The left atrium is moderately elongated.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated aortic root.
Persistent left retrocardiac opacity likely representing a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
No evidence of osteomyelitis.
No drainable fluid collection.
Nonspecific muscle and subcutaneous edema, soft-tissue infection not excluded.
Postsurgical changes at the patellar tendon and retinacula.
Abnormal appearance of the quadriceps tendon is suboptimally assessed and may reflect old or more recent injury or postsurgical changes; not well differentiated on this study which was optimized for detection of infection.
Concern for meniscal tears, though this would be better assessed with routine non-contrast study if clinically indicated.
Markedly abnormal right glenohumeral joint with extensive periostitis, bony destruction, disorganization, a large amount of debris and fluid in the joint as well as synovitis.
The findings may represent acute-on-chronic or chronic infection.
Anterior superior dislocation.
Right-sided pleural effusion.
Persistent left retrocardiac opacity likely representing a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 90030**] is a 59yoM with a history of diabetes, Parkinsons disease, septic shoulder and septic knee who presents with T8 compression fracture and cord compression s/p OR x 2 with subsequent vetebrectomy and laminectomy and fusion of the thoracic spine and culture data showing likely osteomyelitis with MSSA.
His MRI was concerning for possible discitis/osteomyelitis driving the acute fracture.
He was admitted to the medicine service for perioperative risk stratification which was felt to be low.
He went to the OR on [**1-24**] for multiple thoracic laminotomies from T3 to T12 and fusion of T3 to T12.
A spinal epidural catheter was placed for post operative pain control.
They were removed on [**2-1**] after drainage was noted to be minimal, and there was no further signficant drainage.
OSTEOMYELITIS/DISCITIS:  He was empirically started on vancomycin [**2112-1-23**] due to MRI evidence of discitis/osteomyelitis accounting for his compression fracture, and due to his history of both MSSA and MRSA infections.
He was afebrile throughout his stay on the general medicine floor.
The cause of his recurrent joint and soft tissue infections was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 6**] MRI of the left knee was obtained on [**2112-1-30**], which showed only chronic inflammation without concerning abscesses or fluid collection.
MRI of the right shoulder was attempted due to his history of septic joint, but proved impossible to obtain due to patient's parkinsonism and claustrophobia.
Orthopedics was consulted, but were unable to aspirate fluid from the joint, and felt the likelihood of a septic right shoulder was unlikely based on patient's clinical exam.
This was felt to be driven by acute blood loss in the operating room.
He received an additional unit of blood aside from his OR requirements.
HCT was stable and improving at time of discharge; patient remained hemodynamically stable.
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY SWELLING: Upon transfer to the general medicine floor, asymmetric swelling of the right upper extremity was noted.
Doppler ultrasound was negative for DVT.
The swelling slowly dissipated but was persistent on discharge- it was felt to be due to his recent shoulder surgery and removal of indwelling drain.
He was discharged back to his home metformin dose of 1000mg [**Hospital1 **], which should be discontinued in the event of renal dysfunction based on his weekly lab draws.
HYPERTENSION:  His lisinopril, HCTZ, amlodipine, metoprolol, and aldactone were held while in the hospital due to borderline low blood pressure post-operatively.
His amlodipine can be restarted as his pressures rebound with increased activity.
HYPOKALEMIA:  He is on spironolactone presumably for hypokalemia as an outpatient, which was discontinued in favor of daily potassium supplementation.
CONJUNCTIVITIS:  He developed injection of the left eye on [**1-30**] with some purulent discharge.
He may also use saline eye drops as needed for symptomatic relief.
GERD:  He carries a diagnosis of GERD, though has had no recent symptoms.
His PPI was discontinued due to increased risk of fracture, which is pertinent to his presenting complaint.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 90030**],  You were admitted to the hospital with back pain and a fracture of part of your spine.
You were brought to the operating room and underwent a surgical repair with removal of the infected vertebrae and fusion of part of your spine.
We could not find a likely source of infection accounting for your multiple joint and tissue infections, but we imaged your knee and shoulder to be sure.
There was no evidence of an ongoing infection in your knee, but a CT scan showed a large fluid collection in your right shoulder.
Your pain improved post operatively and you were discharged to rehab on antibiotics.
STOP omeprazole as it has been associated with increased risk of fractures 3.
You may have some constipation after surgery.
If the incision is draining cover it with a new sterile dressing.
If the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet.
Please allow 72 hours for refill of narcotic prescriptions, so please plan ahead.
