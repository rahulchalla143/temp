Admission Date:  [**2183-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-7-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-9-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**] Chief Complaint: Left leg pain and swelling  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 53yoM w/ h/o SMA thrombosis s/p partial small bowel resection, possible protein C deficiency, asthma and hemochromatosis who presents with a 4 day history of persistent L leg pain and swelling.
The patient has also experienced of some SOB, exacerbated with activity, and development of a nonproductive cough over the past few days as well associated with his leg pain.
He quit smoking two weeks ago (not due to shortness of breath).
Physical exam was notable for left leg with 2+edema.
Ultrasound down in the ED demonstrated deep vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity venous system extending from the calf veins (mid superficial femoral, distal superficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins) to the mid superficial femoral vein.
The patient also received a CT of the chest w/ and w/o contrast, and the preliminary read demonstrated bilateral pulmonary emboli extending from the main pulmonary artery at the level of the bifurcation into both the upper and lower pulmonary arteries bilaterally.
Patient received 6 months of Coumadin for his SMA thrombosis.
Review of systems:  (+) Per HPI  (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.

Lives on [**Location (un) **] with his brother who is a quadriplegic.

Discharge: VS 97.3-97.7, 104-121/56-71, 77-91, 96% RA GEN Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT NCAT MMM EOMI sclera anicteric, OP clear NECK supple, no JVD, no LAD PULM Good aeration, inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, no rales, ronchi CV RRR normal S1/S2, no mrg ABD midline scar, well healed, soft NT ND normoactive bowel sounds, no r/g EXT WWP 2+ pulses palpable bilaterally, no c/c/e, tender left lower calf.
There is no mediastinal, axillary, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Extensive coronary artery calcifications are noted.
The pericardium is unremarkable witout thickening or effusion.
The esophagus is within normal limits without evidence of hiatal hernia.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
CTA:  The aorta is well opacified and is normal in caliber throughout without evidence of dissection.
In the right, pulmonary artery embolus extends from the right pulmonary artery into both the upper and lower lobar arteries, with almost complete occlusion of the upper lobar branch and extending to the subsegmental branches.
In the left, there is also an embolus straddling the bifurcation of the left pulmonary artery extending into both the superior and inferior lobar arteries.
No definite findings to suggest right heart strain.
No significant reflux of contrast into IVC.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No lytic or blastic lesions concerning for malignancy.
Multiple bilateral lobar pulmonary artery emboli as described above with extensive clot burden.
No defintie CT findings of right heart strain.
Multiple spiculated pulmonary lesions are new from prior exam.
However, the mid superficial femoral, distal superficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins are not compressible with absent color flow, consistent with thrombus extending from the calf veins to the mid superficial femoral veins.
IMPRESSION:  Deep vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity venous system extending from the calf veins to the mid superficial femoral vein.
Non-diagnostic Q waves in the inferolateral leads.
Poor R wave progression.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes which are no-specific.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis (apical sparing, "[**Last Name (un) **] sign" of acute pulmonary hypertension).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated right ventricle with mild RV systolic dysfunction.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
The severity of pulmonary hypertension suggests that a large component of it is chronic, since an "untrained" right ventricle is unlikely to be able to generate such pressures.
Consider baseline pulmonary disease or prior thromboembolism.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2175-5-17**], right ventricle now appears large and hypokinetic.
CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2183-7-4**] 5:22 PM FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN:  The visualized lung bases are clear of nodules, consolidations or effusions.
Mild dependent change is present at the lung bases bilaterally.
Imaged portion of heart shows coronary artery calcifications.
Noncontrast evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates no new hepatic lesions.
Small hyperdense stones layer in the gallbladder neck.
Noncontrast appearance of the kidneys within normal limits; incidental note is made of a cortical cleft or scar in the interpolar region of the left kidney.
No ascites is present.
There is no evidence of intra-abdominal hematoma.
Scattered mesenteric and periaortic retroperitoneal nodes measure up to 9 mm in short axis (2:27) and are similar to appearence in [**2175**].
There is no ascites.
Hyperdense material within the gastric antrum and elsewhere in the bowel including a pill shaped focus in the right colon are likely ingested material.
A small bowel anastomosis is noted in the right upper quadrant.
Sigmoid colonic diverticulosis noted without inflammatory change.
There is no free pelvic fluid or evidence of hematoma.
No concerning lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.
No retroperitoneal hematoma or other evidence of intra-abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage to explain acute anemia.
Mildly prominent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are grossly similar to [**2175-5-20**].
Sigmoid colonic diverticulosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 53yoM w/ h/o SMA thrombosis s/p partial small bowel resection, possible protein C deficiency, asthma and hemochromatosis who presents with a 2 day history of persistent left leg pain and swelling, now found to have DVT of his left leg and bilateral pulmonary emboli.
#DVT/PE: Pt presents with unprovoked DVT and PE with fairly significant clot burden.
Given his h/o SMA thrombosis, clots in both arterial and venous systems suggest considering Protein C def/ antiphospholipid antibody syndrome as a unify etiology of his emboli.
We held on Fe replacement given therapeutic phlebotomy in [**2174**] and recorded history of hemochromatosis.
Possibly Group 1 versus previous thromboembolic disease.
Will be difficult to determine in setting of acute PE.
This is likely hypovolemic hyponatremia [**2-20**] poor PO intake.
Patient recently quit smoking, has chronic non-productive cough.
Had some elevated glucose levels while in house but in the setting of dextrose in his heparin drip.
No evidence of asterixis on exam.
No intervention  #HYPERTENSION.

You were admitted for pain in your legs and shortness of breath and found to have a pulmonary embolism.
Since you had a blood clot and have a history of possible predisposition to clotting, as well as the fact that you seem to have iron deficiency anemia despite a diagnosis of hemochromatosis in the past, you have been referred to [**Hospital **] clinic.
Note that you also had elevated blood sugars during our stay, but your diabetes medications had been held for much of the admission.
Please continue these medications and follow up at [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes about your blood sugar (appointment listed below).
Finally, because you have a history of hepatitis and liver disease, you should have a screening liver ultrasound and blood test (AFP).
We made the following changes to your medications: Please START Warfarin (Coumadin) Please START Lovenox (your PCP will tell you when to stop this, once the Warfarin level is therapeutic) Please START Tylenol as needed for pain (no more than 3 grams per day) Please START Oxycodone as needed for pain control (do not drive, operate machinery, or take sedating medications while on this).
