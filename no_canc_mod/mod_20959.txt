Admission Date:  [**2162-7-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-7-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-12-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: Vfib arrest.
CT showed occipital hematoma from fall with likely contracoup left frontal subdural hematoma and contusion, also small subarachnoid.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p CABG - stents and s/p balloon angioplasty revision - DM2 - HTN  Social History: SocHx: Married, bank worker/chamber of commerce/sedentary.
Pertinent Results: [**Known lastname 58154**],[**Known firstname **]: [**Hospital1 18**] Neurophysiology Detail - CCC Record #[**Numeric Identifier 58155**]  04-1819D - CCC REPORT APPROVED DATE:[**2162-7-21**] TEST DATE: [**2162-7-20**] INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] L.  FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY#1: The background rhythm is low voltage.
At 2 microvolt amplification [**Hospital1 **]-frontal beta activity is visible and there is intermittent theta frequency activity with a 1 Hz delta frequency background rhythm.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 108 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the low voltage background activity.
[**Hospital1 **]-frontal beta activity is present as is intermittent theta frequency slowing of the background rhythm.
These findings suggest a severe encephalopathy and could be consistent with hypoxic injury from cardiac arrest but medication effects are also possible.
A narrow complex tachycardia was noted on the cardiac monitor.
OBJECT: 62 year old man with a history of recent cardiac arrest.
He was cardiovascularly supported in the CCU, with the hope that the neurological sequelae of his vfib arrest might resolve.
However, CT imaging determined that extensive severe anoxic brain injury had occurred.
Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular fibrillation leading to severe anoxic brain injury.
