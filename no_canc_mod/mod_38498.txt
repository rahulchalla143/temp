Significant short-interal enlargement of the right parieto-occipital parenchymal hemorrhage, with internal blood/fluid levels, likely related to previous anticoagulation, with possible contribution of CAA.
New intraventricular hemorrhagic extension without evidence of hydrocephalus.
Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the lobar hematoma, also suggestive of underlying CAA.
CXR [**2105-2-11**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of infection.
Slightly irregular contour of the right mediastinal border.
CT Chest: [**2105-2-13**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute aortic syndrome or pulmonary embolus.
Unchanged intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, intraventricular hemorrhage and mild mass effect.
No evidence of amyloid angiography, abnormal blood vessels, or neoplasm although these etiologies would be better evaluated after the administration of contrast.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 24049**] is a 77 year old right handed woman presenting with new onset left sided weakness and ICH.
# Cardiovascular: we maintained an SBP < 160 with PRN hydralazine as needed, however, pt was able to maintain these blood pressures without any intervention and did not require hydralazine.
We stopped her premarin to prevent any future clotting risk.
# Pulmonary: pt's CXR showed a possibly enlarged mediastinum so we got a CT of her chest, which did not show any abnormalities, and therefore was likely related to the positioning of her CXR.
