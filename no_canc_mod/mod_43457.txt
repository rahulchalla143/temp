LENIs IMPRESSION: Limited exam, with nonvisualization of calf veins and distal left common femoral vein due to patient discomfort, but no DVT otherwise detectible  Ankle xray IMPRESSION: Intra-articular trimalleolar fracture with disruption of the ankle mortise, as detailed.
CXR on admission IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacification may represent atelectasis or pneumonic consolidation.
Recommend lateral with improved inspiration  Repeat ankle xray There is a trimalleolar fracture with an oblique/spiral fracture of the distal fibular shaft, extending to the lateral plafond.
There is a transverse fracture of the base of the medial malleolus, now with slight medial displacement of the distal fragment.
A vertical fracture is seen through the posterior tibia, extending to the plafond.
IMPRESSION: There is a trimalleolar fracture.
The distal tibial fragment appears displaced slightly medially compared to its previous location, although the medial joint space again measures 4 mm   Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old female with hx of DM, HTN, CAD, diastolic CHF, polysubstance abuse here with cellulitis.
She also had a course of steroids for a COPD flare.
Her VBGs were monitored by her PICC due to difficulty obtaining ABGs.
# Cellulitis: Pt had a leukocytosis and large ulcers on her left calf.
She will need ABI studies once more awake as an out pt to evaluate for vascular disease with follow-up appointment with .
# Acute renal failure: Likely was thought to be prerenal given hyperglycemia.
She was treated with IVF for a decreased urine output.
Urine lytes were consistent with prerenal ARF.
# Anion Gap Acidosis: Pt had an elevated lactate on admission.
Was thought to be secondary to her infection.
# Pain Control: she was on oxycodone and had been on standing tylenol until discharge, though the standing tylenol was discontinued as her temperatures had been running approxmiately 98.4 to 99.7 in the 2 days prior to discharge.
However, she did not have any evidence of infection at discharge.
# Multifocal Atrial tachycardia: seen on EKG.
Pt had intermittent runs on tele.
# Diastolic heart failure: Had peripheral edema in legs on admission.
Lasix was latter stopped due to renal failure.
# Intertriginous erythema: Likely secondary to fungal infection.
Now completed a course of antibiotics and having continue treatment with topical miconazole.
# Rt ankle Fracture: She had pain on admission from a fall with injury to her ankle.
# Colonization of sputum with E. coli: after completion of tx for [**Name (NI) 16630**], pt sputum showed E. coli that was multidrug resistant.
She had no fevers and her vent settings were improving therefore this was assumed to be colonization.
# Hypernatremia: pt had auto-diuresis and became hypernatremic.
