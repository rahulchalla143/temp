L hip/pelvis XRay: There is an intramedullary rod in the left femur with a single proximal screw.
There is also varus angulation and deformity seen of the femoral head and neck and due to difficulty in positioning patient, this area is not fully evaluated; however, there is likely a fracture involving the femoral neck on the left side.
Dystrophic calcifications are identified.
There are degenerative changes and joint calcifications involving the right hip.
As seen earlier today, there is an acute fracture of the left femoral neck.
The spiral fracture of the left femoral shaft is evaluated, and there is no change in fracture fragment position or hardware appearance compared to [**2102-4-20**].
ECHO [**2102-6-12**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The aortic  valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No  aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Low normal left ventricular systolic function without definite regional dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CT HEAD done on [**2102-6-14**] for acute delirium There is no intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
There is volume loss in the right lung, with apical pleural thickening.
Linear atelectasis versus scar is noted in the right mid lung.
Retrocardiac atelectasis is noted, which appears slightly increased from prior study.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hip fracture: pt had removal of previous hardware and plating/hemiarthroplasty - involved procedure.
#Hypotension: after surgery pt had some episodes of hypotension, likely secondary to blood loss during surgery and agressive diuresis.
His lasix has been held, with no evidence of worsening CHF on chest x-ray ([**2102-6-16**]).
# CAD: extensive history but stable during this hospitalization.
