Admission Date:  [**2165-12-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-12-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-8-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Zocor / Ciprofloxacin / Quinolones / Statins-Hmg-Coa Reductase Inhibitors / Niacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with no stents on [**2165-12-24**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 72 y/o M with PMHx significant for CAD s/p MI and CABG, DM, HTN, PVD, prostate CA, and pancytopenia currently being worked up, who was initially admitted to OSH on [**12-23**] with unstable angina.
Ruled out for MI with negative troponins, echo showed inferolateral akinesis.
Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization, which showed proximal LCx angulated high grade lesion and distal OM branch tight lesion: LMCA - non-obstructed LAD - 80% mid-vessel ISR in the distal aspect of the stent LCx - 90% ostial stenosis and there is a 90% stenosis in the upper pole of the OMB PCA - known occluded, not engaged SVG-OM - known occluded, not engaged RIMA-RCA - subselectively negaged and non-obstructed  In the cath lab, the OM lesion was wired and then ballooned open using 2.0mm balloon to 4 ATM.
The ostial LCx lesion was then ballooned using a 2.5mm balloon.
After, there was concern for dissection vs. perforation in the area of PTCA in OM.
Given concern for potential dissection vs. perforation, the patient did not receive heparin, and angiomax was stopped.
Echo performed in cath lab showed no pericardial effusion.
The patient was free of chest pain throughout the entire procedure.
He endorsed approx 1 month of worsening exertional chest pressure that radiated into the neck.
States that these symptoms were consistent with prior anginal symptoms.
He also endorsed recent hematuria and polyuria.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Family History: Father passed away from CAD at age 49, uncle with CAD age 50.
No other cardiac history.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple, with no JVD noted.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES: Right: DP 2+ Left: DP 2+  Discharge exam: Unchanged, except for as below Extremities: minimal bruising at right radial artery access site, no hematoma or bleeding  Pertinent Results: Labs: [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD WBC-2.6* RBC-3.66*# Hgb-12.2*# Hct-35.1* MCV-96 MCH-33.2* MCHC-34.7 RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-80* [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD Glucose-149* UreaN-14 Creat-0.8 Na-141 K-3.8 Cl-105 HCO3-29 AnGap-11 [**2165-12-24**] 10:45PM BLOOD CK-MB-2 [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD CK-MB-3 [**2165-12-25**] 03:36AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.0  Procedures: -Cardiac cath ([**2165-12-24**]) -  COMMENTS: 1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated native three-vessel coronary artery disease, with progressive coronary disease in two native vessels.
The LMCA had no angiographically-apparent coronary disease.
The LCx had 90% ostial stenosis; there was also a 90% stenosis in the upper pole of the OM branch.
2) The RIMA-->RCA was subselectively engaged and had no angiographically-apparent coronary artery disease.
3) PTCA of OM1 branch and ostial LCX, complicated by dissection at position of balloon dilatation in the OM.
This initially appeared suspicious for perforation, but echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion, and patient remained hemodynamically stable.
4) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 154/76 mmHg.
PTCA of the lower pole of the OM branch, complicated by a deep vessel dye stain versus perforation.
Procedure terminated with a view to likely further procedure to relook at OM branch and possible PCI of ostial LCX or mid LAD ISR.
Moderate systemic arterial hypertension.
-TTE ([**2165-12-25**]) - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pericardial effusion.
Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 y/o M with PMHx significant for CAD, DM, HTN, PVD, prostate CA, and pancytopenia, who was admitted to OSH with unstable angina and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
Now, s/p PTCA of OM and ostial LCx lesions, complicated by concern for coronary dissection vs. performation, admitted to the CCU for monitoring.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  #CAD/PUMP - Pt was transferred from an OSH for cardiac cath because of chest pain with a positive stress test, CK-MB at [**Hospital1 18**] were noted to be negative.
The cardiac cath showed native triple vessel disease with stenoses in the LAD and LCx.
Immediate bedside echo did not show evidence of a pericardial effusion.
Formal transthoracic echo the next day also did not show evidence of pericardial effusion.
He is not taking Plavix because of pancytopenia.
#RHYTHM - His home metoprolol was decreased from 50mg to 25mg daily because of bradycardia to the 50s.
Metprolol was decreased as above, amlodipine increased to 10mg for increased antianginal benefits.
INACTIVE ISSUES:  #Pancytopenia - Plavix and heparin were held given low patelets.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Unstable angina Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for chest pain and cardiac catheretization.
You had a positive stress test which showed some poor blood flow in part of your heart.
During the procedure, no stents were placed because of difficulty accessing some of the arteries.
