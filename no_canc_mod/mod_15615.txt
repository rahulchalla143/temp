Admission Date:  [**2129-5-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2129-6-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2129-5-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Choking with occasional feeding.
Former premature female infant readmitted for choking episodes with feeding.
Mother had reported an occasional episode at home, which the baby recovered from with just removal the nipple from the mouth.
She was brought to the pediatricians office and they requested an observation of the feed at which time the baby choked, became apneic and took some time to recover.
This episode was  associated with desaturations.
She had an initial 20 day course for management of prematurity with minor issues of ruling out sepsis and learning how to feed.
Mother reports that since home she has the occasional episodes that responded to her interventions except for the event as indicated above at the pediatrician's office.
Mother reports that her activity and urine and stool output remain as usual with no new concerns.
On admission her physical examination was essentially within normal limits and it was thought that she had feeding discoordination associated with prematurity.
Respiratory:  The infant remained in room air throughout her hospital course and had no episodes of apnea or bradycardia unassociated with feedings.
At that time she had some nasal congestion with a fair amount of greenish mucous secretions that could be suctioned from her nares.
Cardiac:  There were no cardiac issues.
She received no antibiotics.
It was noted that the infant did have some greenish mucous, which had been suctioned from her nose and this continued for approximately 7 to 10 days of her hospital stay.
She had several episodes of choking followed by bradycardia and desaturations while in the hospital.
These appeared to be related to some suck swallow incoordination due to her prematurity and her being quite vagal.
Parents understood that as the baby matured these episodes would become less in number, and had decreased in quantity and quality, not needing supplementary oxygen by discharge.
Overall it si felt that the infant is very vagal and that these episodes will improve over time.
