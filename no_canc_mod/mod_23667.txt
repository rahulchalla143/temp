Admission Date:  [**2140-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-8-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-4-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: Unstable angina  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Cardiac catheterization with left circumflex stenting; stenting of dissected obtuse marginal 1 vessel following deployment of left circumflex stent -Transesophageal echocardiogram -Electrocardioversion   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 39008**] is a 68 year old male with history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on the morning of admission for elective catheterization to evaluate intermittent anginal symptoms.
The patient reports that 2 days prior to admission he climbed the equivalent of 7 flights of stairs, after which he noted a pain across his hard palate.
He denies any chest pain, or associated shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, radiation of the pain to his neck or arm, however he did have diaphoresis.
The pain in his mouth subsided only after about 2.5 hours of rest.
He reports another episode of mouth pain later that night, while resting in bed, relieved by getting out of bed and sitting in a chair.
His EKG did not demonstrate ST changes, however did incidentally demonstrate atrial flutter with variable block and HR 50-110.
He had an echo there which demonstrated a nondilated LV with mild LVH and anterior apical hypokinesis and an EF of 45%.
Catheterization on the day of admission revealed a flow-limiting stenosis of the left circumflex artery that was stented with a 5.0 DES.
While finishing the cath, the patient began complaining of severe substernal chest pain, with noted ST elevations on monitor.
It is presumed that the initial stent partially overlapped the opening of OM1, with dissection and propagation of clot just underneath, occluding the vessel lumen.
He was transferred to the CCU in stable condition, for monitoring overnight.
On further questioning, he describes exertional pain in his hard palate for at least the last few months.
He notes that he did have a nuclear stress test in [**2134**] that he reports was normal.
He subsequently has had a stress echo every two years, last in [**2138**], which have repeatedly demonstrated borderline LVEF of 50-55%, with LVH.
3) Low back pain 4) Colonic polyps 5) Cholecystectomy 6) Hemorrhoidectomy   Social History: Lives with his wife in [**Location (un) 11790**], RI.
Smoked 3 PPD for many years, but quit in [**2122**].
Family History: Both parents deceased; father with an MI at uncertain age, mother with a cerebrovascular accident at 89.
No family history of diabetes.
GROIN:  Right groin with sheath in place; no evidence of hematoma.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed a one vessel coronary disease.
The LAD had moderate luminal irregularities but no flow limiting disease.
The OM1 was a large vessel with a 50% stenosis at its origin.
The RCA had mild luminal irregularites.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, who presented with presumed unstable angina, with cath revealing a 90% proximal LCx lesion which was stented, complicated by edge dissection and occlusion of flow to OM1, subsequently stented as well, with full restoration of flow.
1) Coronary artery disease/post-procedure ST-elevations: Following stenting of proximal circ lesion, the pt developed anginal-equivalent symptoms (jaw pain).
Symptoms resolved & EKG done just after catheterization was without ST elevations.
Pt's CK's did not rise, suggesting that, in fact, he may not have actually had ST-segment elevations on tele.
The pt underwent TTE which revealed an EF of 45-55% as well as suspected distal septal and inferior hypo to akinesis of the inferior wall.
2) Atrial flutter:  Noted to be in flutter at OSH of unclear duration.
3) Low back pain 4) Colonic polyps 5) Cholecystectomy 6) Hemorrhoidectomy   Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: -Please take your new medications: coumadin and lovenox as prescribed.
-Please call your doctor or go to the ER if you have chest pain, jaw pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, light-headedness, or any other change in your health.
