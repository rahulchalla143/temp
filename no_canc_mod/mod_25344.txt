Admission Date:  [**2135-7-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-7-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Fosamax  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Inferior wall MI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Esophagogastroduodenoscopy   History of Present Illness: 82 year old male with history of DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, [**Hospital 67277**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of acute inferior wall MI.
The patient says that on the morning of admission, he woke up at midnight with shortness of breath which was worse on laying down and prevented him from sleeping.
He additionally noted a dull chest pain, as well as pain in his cervical spine.
The pain was [**9-13**] in severity and continuous throughout the night.
There was no associated presyncope, palpitations, or diaphoresis.
He presented to his primary care physician in the AM, and was directed to go to the ER after an EKG reportedly with atiral flutter.
An EKG at that time reportedly showed rapid AF.
He was given SL nitro for his chest pain with decrease in BP to 83/59.
Given the persistence of his chest pain he underwent CTA which was negative for dissection.
A repeat EKG later in the afternoon demonstrated prominent ST elevation in the inferior leads.
In the cath lab he was found to have a dominant LCx with an ulcerated 90% distal lesion prior to the bifurcation of the PLBR and PDA that was stented with a drug eluting cypher stent.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
EKG [**2135-7-7**] Irregular supraventricular tachycardia, possibly multifocal atrial tachycardia.
Inferior ST segment elevations suggestive of an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Non-diagnostic T wave flattening in the precordial leads.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Local anesthesia was provided by of the echocardiographic results by e-mail.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm, mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
EGD [**2135-7-11**] Findings: Esophagus:  Mucosa: Localized mild erythema of the mucosa was noted in the gastroesophageal junction.
These findings are compatible with mild esophagitis.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Localized discontinuous erosions and erythema of the mucosa were noted in the antrum.
These findings are compatible with gastritis with erosions.
Other findings: Brunner's gland hypertrophy Impression: Mild erythema in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with mild esophagitis Erosions and erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis with erosions Brunner's gland hypertrophy Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Okay to use full anticoagulation.
[**2135-7-7**] 09:06PM   calTIBC-386 FERRITIN-56 TRF-297 [**2135-7-7**] 09:06PM   TSH-0.052* [**7-8**] Free T4-1.1  Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old male with history of DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, [**Hospital 67277**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of acute inferior wall MI.
1) Inferior wall MI:  Patient went to catheterization on arrival and was found to have a dominant LCX with a 90% stenosis that was stented with a drug eluting Cypher stent.
2) Low cardiac index: The patient's low CI during cardiac cath could not be completely explained by his inferior MI, and a possible secondary component of cardiomyopathy was evaluated.
Given the patient's atrial tachycardia on EKG and report of previous episodes of palpitations, tachycardia-induced-cardiomyopathy was the primary consideration.
Echo was performed which demonstrated severe LV global hypokinesis.
Due to some increased lower extremity edema, the patient's outpatient dose of lasix was increased from 20 mg to 40 mg. .
EKG consistent with atrial tachycardia vs atrial flutter.
Likely related to underlying lung disease from chronic smoking history.
TEE demonstrated no thrombus and patient was successfully electrically cardioverted and remained at a sinus rate <100, with irregular beats.
Coumadin could be continued at the discretion of the patient's PCP and cardiologist, dependent on bleeding risk.
Patient subsequently had one guiac positive stool that was described as melanotic.
The patient had an EGD which demonstrated gastritis and mild esophagitis but no obvious bleeding source.
Because no gastroduodenal ulcer was found and patient's hematocrit remained stable prior to discharge, he was deemed safe for discharge on warfarin.
Medications on Admission: Humalog 75/25 36 units in AM, 25 QPM Metformin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] Pioglitazone 45 mg [**Hospital1 **] Omeprazole 40 mg PO DAILY Gemfibrozil 600 mg PO BID Atorvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY Lasix 20 mg PO DAILY Ecotrin 325 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Home Health Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses 1) Inferior Myocardial Infarction 2) Supraventricular Tachycardia 3) Gastritis 4) Benign prostatic hypertrophy  Secondary diagnosis 1) COPD 2) Diabetes type II 3) hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Stable Ambulating without assistance Tolerating normal diet   Discharge Instructions: When you came to the hospital, you had a blockage of one of your coronary arteries.
You have been placed on a blood thinner [**Hospital 4085**] called "coumadin" to prevent a stroke from occurring.
If you take too much coumadin, you will be at increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
You had a black stool while you were in the hospital, which is a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding.
[**Last Name (STitle) 29478**], about this, and you will need further evaluation for this problem.
If you have more black stools, or if you feel persistently lightheaded and dizzy, these may be signs that you have a gastrointestinal bleed and need to go to the emergency room immediately.
This is the most important thing you can do to prevent a second heart attack.
Followup Instructions: You have an appointment to have your blood drawn to check your INR on Friday of this week.
