Although this is worrisome for a mass, it is conceivable that this represents merely a dilated azygos vein in a person with extremely poor inspiration.
Her first debridement revealed a relatively small abscess cavity which was copiously irrigated and evacuated.
While recovering in the PACU, she remained tachycardic and exhibited increasing erythema around the perineum.
She returned to the OR directly from PACU for re-exploration, during which necrotic tissue and increasing abscess were discovered.
At this time, we began to consider Fournier's gangrene as a diagnosis.
She was transferred to the ICU given concern for impending sepsis.
She was transiently hypotensive and tachycardic following the procedure, which improved with resuscitation.
Her white blood cell count remained in the high teens but she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
On HD3, she had a large loose bowel movement which violated the vac dressing, so the vac was taken down and replaced with wet-to-dry dressing.
A small amount of murky fluid was broken free from deep loculation and a second incision was made anteriorly to the first.
Her vancomycin troughs were closely monitored and she did have mild renal insufficiency with an elevated creatinine to 2.2.
She returned to the operating room on [**8-29**] for re-exploration of the wound and surgical debridement.
Her Foley catheter was discontinued on [**9-1**] and she has been voiding without difficulty.
She was re-evaluated by the Infectious disease service  on [**9-7**] and recommendations made to change her antibiotics.
Because of her continued leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, her antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and levofloxacin for an additional 1 week course.
She is preparing for discharge home with VNA services for dressing changes and IV therapy.
