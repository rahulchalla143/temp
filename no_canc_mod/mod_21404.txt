Seen in [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2146-6-22**] for agitation and subsequent lethargy, found to be hypernatremic (Na 148).
This morning he was found acutely short of breath and diaphoretic with diminished responsiveness.
On prior admissions, he had been sedated, but on one occasion, suffered respiratory failure as a result, and was therefore not sedated on this presentation for this reason.
He was given 2 grams of CTX IV for meningitis dosing, as well as one gram of IV vancomycin.
The 3rd and 4th tubes were notable for xanthochromia.

Brief Hospital Course: 70 year-old man with history of dementia (attributed to Korsakoff?????
?s syndrome, [**2-23**] prior alcohol abuse), COPD, and CHF initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**7-3**] from [**Hospital3 **] home.
He initially had been found to have WBC count of 20, Na of 155, T 104, HR 150; also found acutely short of breath and diaphoretic and minimally responsive.
He was given 2 grams of CTX IV for meningitis dosing, as well as one gram of IV vancomycin.
The MICU was consulted originally for muscle rigidity and an elevated CK of 1287.
He was transferred to the MICU [**7-7**] for concern of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome and for nursing issues.
Psychiatry was consulted and did not feel that the etiology of his fevers was secondary to NMS as he had been tapered on haldol and then stopped prior to admission and fevers and that his mental status improved on the floor while off all neuroleptics.
Recommended treating agitation with Zyprexa.
His hypoxia was stable with chest X-rays that revealed no cardiopulmonary disease.
His mental status remained stable, alert but groaning and minimally responsive.
Given a concern for PE, a femoral line was placed and CTA performed which revealed no PE and stable RLL infiltrate.
On the floor he continued to be tachynpneic and grunting while awake.
Neurology saw the patient on his second transfer to the MICU and felt that his history of his med exposures was not consistent with NMS.
Their impression was that his encephalopathy was more likely toxic-metobolic, due to a combination of pneumonia and hypoxia, (and perhaps recent increase in steroids).
Recommended stopping Zyprexa as it can cause extrapyramidal side effects and restarting Seroquel (as patient had been treated with it prior to admission).
His respiratory distress was felt to be more likely psychiatric in origin, as he improved while sleeping and his symptoms did not seem to be related to his level of hypoxia.
A TTE revealed R to L shunting and mild pulm HTN.
Finished a course of Flagyl and levofloxacin for pneumonia but his WBC continued to trend up.
Sputum cx was obtained which grew moderate MRSA.
However, pt continued to be tachypneic with increased work of breathing and decreasing O2 sats which was believed to be related with his psych problems and constantly pulling his facial mask.
After talking with the pt, pt wished no more aggressive treatment including PEG or NGT but wanted to be fed and be comfortable.
