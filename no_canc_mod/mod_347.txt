Admission Date:  [**2149-11-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2149-12-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2080-11-2**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CA/TH [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69 -year-old male patient who was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] through the Emergency Department on [**2149-11-15**], with increasing shortness of breath.
The patient had a previous hospitalization from [**11-2**] through [**11-6**] for which he was scheduled for an attempted apical canalization.
However, he was found to have significant aortic insufficiency and the procedure was aborted.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was discharged home on [**2149-11-6**], without diuretic and he was scheduled to undergo aortic valve replacement on [**11-17**] with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
On admission to the hospital, the patient was noted to have a chest x-ray which was significant for a right pleural effusion as well as congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times five in [**2140**].
Status post myocardial infarction in [**2129**].
Aortic stenosis with aortic insufficiency with a calculated aortic valve area of 0.8-0.9.
The patient also has a history of multiple falls with rib, ankle, and forearm fractures in the past, question if this is related to his alcohol intake.
ALLERGIES:  The patient states that an intolerance to sedation as this causes increased confusion and agitation.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat unremarkable.
Neck without jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur.
Extremities are without edema and he had 2+ palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.
His electrocardiogram on admission to the hospital was normal sinus rhythm with a left anterior fascicular block and a right bundle branch block as well as left ventricular hypertrophy.
The patient initially on extubation, was quite confused; however, no agitated at that time.
The patient was started on nitroprusside due to hypertension and oral Captopril was added.
The patient continued to have a fair amount of chest tube drainage from his pleural tube, of serosanguinous fluid so that was left in for another couple of days.
The patient, on postoperative day two, required Haldol and Ativan due to increasing confusion and agitation.
The patient wound up being oversedated due to his severe agitation, requiring re-intubation because of respiratory compromise.
He could also have decreased clearance of all the sedating medicines which he received for previous agitation due to renal and hepatic dysfunction.
On [**11-21**], the patient experienced rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with Lopressor.
The patient was not given amiodarone at that time because he has a history of slow heart rate as well as questionable liver function due to his alcohol history.
The patient extubated himself later that evening and remained confused and extremely agitated.
On [**11-24**], the patient was reintubated due to significant hypercarbia and respiratory distress, respiratory acidosis.
He had some intermittent confusion, but much less agitation.
Since he did not pass his bedside evaluation, it was recommended that he go for a video swallow which showed that he was at risk for aspiration.
The patient progressed throughout the day with increasing agitation, attempting to discontinue IV lines, arterial catheter, as well as his nasogastric tube, and a one-to-one sitter was obtained at that time.
He was noted to have questionable arrhythmia of either non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, versus wide complex supraventricular tachycardia; however, he continued to have multiple episodes of this.
Condition today, [**2149-12-5**], the day of discharge is as follows: the patient is without complaints.
His sternum is stable without drainage.
DIET:  The patient's diet is a dysphagia diet with no thin liquids and he may tolerate Boost shake or Boost pudding tid for caloric supplements.
Aortic insufficiency, status post aortic valve replacement on [**2149-11-18**].
Postoperative atrial fibrillation / non-sustained ventricular tachycardia / bradycardia.
Postoperative dysphagia.
Tracheobronchitis with Enterobacter as the identified bacteria.
