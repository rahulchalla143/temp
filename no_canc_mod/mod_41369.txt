#Right Basal Ganglia Infract from Right Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion (and Right Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion - since recanalized): Initially on admission a code stroke called given his significant acute deficits.
There was evidence of a right MCA and ICA occlusion on CTA concerning for dissection.
CTP showed a large area of right MCA hypoperfusion.
After this, his symptoms initially significantly improved with good antigravity on the left with NIHSS then 3.
However, as his blood pressure dipped to SBP 140-160s, his weakness worsened and the gaze deviation reappeared, with evidence of left hemisensory deficit.
(The difficulty passing the catheter through the ICA was thought to be suggestive of an occlusion from plaque rather than dissection.)
After his first two hospital days, the patient was started on lisinopril which was uptitrated to 20mg QD with a goal SBP of 140-180; some degree of autoregulation was desired to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion in the setting of the fixed deficit (ie the persistent R ICA occlusion).
He was continuually monitored on cardiac telemetry without any adverse events or evidence of cardiac arrhythmias.
#Left Rib Pain, Left Ankle Pain s/p fall: Patient had a CXR and a Left Ankle Xray without evidence of fracture.
He was treated with acetaminophen for pain and tolerated this well.
