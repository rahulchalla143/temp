There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is elevation of left hemidiaphragm.
No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
Low lung volumes are present.
IMPRESSION: Elevated left hemidiaphragm.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Head CT [**2100-11-25**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, shift of midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
No suspicious osseous lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality .
In one of the brachial veins, there is incomplete compressibility and echogenic material within it.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality.
Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
No definite valvular abnormality or pathologic flow identified.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define any valvular pathology .
Bilateral upper extremity venograms demonstrate non-occlusive right brachial thrombus as on the prior ultrasound.
Moderate right subclavian stenosis is seen along the midpoint of the vein with extensive collateralization.
Mild-to-moderate stenosis of the central most portion of the left subclavian vein is also noted.
Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood cultures          positive for Staphylococcus aureus, yeast or other fungi.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2100-11-26**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2100-11-28**]):    NO GROWTH.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO VIRUS ISOLATED.
Brief Hospital Course: 54M with ESRD HD-dependent, diabetes, MR in from dialysis with chief complaint of low grade temps and AMS.
History of chronic exit site infections at his dialysis catheter site and new onset confusion at hemodialysis, now back to baseline.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # fungemia: Pt has history of positive fungal cultures at dialysis for which he was previous treated with Diflucan, last dose given [**2100-11-13**].
Since then, he has continued to have positive fungal cultures without any apparent treatment.
Pt was evaluated by ophtho, with no evidence of any endophalmitis but he does have enlarged cup to disk ratio which should be followed as outpatient.
TTE was performed which was a very poor study but no valvular abnormalities noted.
# elevated LFTs: Pt noted to have increased LFT to low 100s, which have remained stable.
He has no history of hepatitis that we are aware of.
He remained subtherapeutic at time of discharge so he was sent to rehab for continued bridging.
#Altered Mental status: Pt was admitted with altered mental status which improved within 24 hours of admission.
It is likely that his AMS was secondary to his fungemia.
# bacteremia: Pt has had negative bacterial blood cultures while here, though he has been treated for coag negative staph with vanc 1gm and gentamycin 80mg for unknown bacteria at dialysis.
He has a history of recurrent infections.
Pt would likely benefit from more permanent HD access given his recurrent infections with lines.
# atrial fibrillation: Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has history of afib when septic, otherwise seems to remain in sinus rhythm.
He should likely be anticoagulated for 3 months in setting of RUE clot.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: fungal infection renal disease on hemodyalisis  Secondary: diabetes   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We found that you had a fungus infection in your dialysis line.
We also found that you had a blood clot in your arm so you were started on a blood thinner.
If your blood pressure is low again tonight, you should get another fluid bolus.
You should discuss with your brother the possibility of having more permanent dialysis access, as you seem to have problems with continued infections.
