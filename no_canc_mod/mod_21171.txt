Pregnancy complicated by: 1) advanced maternal age, amniocentesis normal 46 XY, 2) preterm labor, initially admitted from [**Hospital3 3765**] on [**2198-10-22**], with contractions and cervical shortening.
Maternal past medial history - nephrolithiasis.
Review of other perinatal sepsis risk factors - GBS unknown, prematurity, no maternal fever, rupture of membranes at the time of delivery, interpartum antibiotics since [**10-28**].
Maternal general anesthesia/ fentanyl PCA.
The infant responded well, given facial CPAP support aeration for poor respiratory effort.
Decreased activity and tone most likely due to maternal general anesthesia.
No vesicular rashes or lesions.
RESP:  Poor respiratory effort and aeration, retractions noted.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY:  The infant was initially on CPAP and was intubated shortly after admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for increased respiratory distress.
The infant was started on caffeine citrate on day of life 15 for apnea and bradycardia.
The infant developed a murmur on day of life 1 and an echocardiogram showed a moderate sized patent ductus arteriosus.
He was treated with indomethacin and a repeat echocardiogram on day of life 5 showed a small patent ductus arteriosus and the infant was treated with a second course of indomethacin.
Two follow up echocardiograms on [**11-8**], and [**12-27**], showed very small patent ductus arteriosus and the infant continues to have a soft murmur.
The infant tolerated feeding advancements without difficulty.
Due to continued desaturations with feedings, a feeding study and upper swallow study was performed at [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**1-10**] which was normal.
No aspiration and no evidence of an H-type fistula.
Discoordination with feeds was felt to be due to his prematurity and has resolved.
No episodes of significant desaturation with feedings have been noted for the past 5 days.
The baby has an umbilical hernia that is easily reduced.
GENITOURINARY:  The infant was noted to have bilateral hydroceles.
Due to maternal history possible chorioamnionitis, viral meningitis, the infant was started on ampicillin, gentamicin on admission and received a total of 7 days of ampicillin and gentamicin.
Surface cultures for HSV and enterovirus were also sent on admission which were negative.
The infant has not had any other issues with sepsis throughout this hospitalization.
He has had oral thrush since [**1-8**] and has currently been treated with oral Nystatin.
NEUROLOGY:  Head ultrasound on day of life showed bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhages and bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage.
A follow up head ultrasound on day of life 11 showed bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhages with intraventricular hemorrhages with mild to moderate lateral ventricular dilatation.
Head ultrasound on [**11-20**], day of life 19, showed severe bilateral ventricular dilatation with increased resistive indices.
The most recent head ultrasound on [**1-15**] showed no change.
4. with chronic lung disease.
Before    this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life,    immunization against influenza is recommended for    household contacts and out of home caregivers.
Status post respiratory distress.
Status post apnea of prematurity.
Status post anemia of prematurity.
