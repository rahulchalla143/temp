1 bilateral supracondylar fracture The patient was placed in bilateral air casts while in the ED.
Her pain was controlled with narcotics and she underwent initial closed reduction of her posterior 90% angulated comminuted R supracondylar fracture while in the ED.
She was also noted to be hypotensive with a Hct that had dropped from 30.9 to 26.3.
Abdominal CT was negative for intraabdominal / retroperitoneal bleed.
Post transfusion, she remained hemodynamically stable with stable serial Hct b/w 30-33.8. guiaic (-) and no obvious source of bleed found.
Because of her severe osteoporosis and COPD, it was determined that the risk of ORIF was too high, and that conservative management of her fx's with bilateral leg casts for 6 wks would provide greater benefit than surgery.
Her pain is currently being controlled with tylenol q6h and 5-10 mg of oxycodone Q4 hours prn.
However, pt often forgets to ask for the pain medicine so it is important to remind her to ask for medicine for pain relief.
Respiratory distress-Patient with tachypnea (up to RR of 36), inc wob, tachycardia, and diaphoresis on hospital day 7.
Her decline in respiratory status was most likely due to combination of very poor baseline pulmonary function (restrictive and obstructive disease), (aspiration) pneumonia, and derecruitment from being in bed so much.
Echo to r/o CHF in unit revealed: EF>55% and mild symmetric LV hypertrophy.
COPD - On admission, pt was placed on inhaled steroids and bronchodilators.
O2 was continued at her baseline requirement of 4L.
Her decline in respiratory status was attributed to COPD exacerbation in setting of PNA requiring BIPAP.
Pt with occassional(1-2Xper week) substernal chest pain which is typcial for her for months.
Relieved spontaneously or with sublingual nitro.
R/o for MI on admission.
afib on admission - paramedics noted "atrial fibrillation" at the scene.
No prior history of afib.
NO obvious bleed.
Cont replacement of calcium/phosphorus at rehab.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
