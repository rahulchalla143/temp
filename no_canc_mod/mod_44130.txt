Admission Date:  [**2173-4-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-4-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-7-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**] Chief Complaint: hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 59 yo female with a history of Addison disease, COPD, on 0.5 dexamethasone daily, presented to NWH with a couple days fever, cough, n/v/d, lethargy.
Found to be hypotensive and given 100mg hydrocortisone and 3L IVF at OSH.
SBP remained 65-80 and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hypotension; concern for possible sepsis or adrenal crisis.
Pt reports some epigastric pain prior to vomitting, also some lingering cough from a pneumonia she was recovering from during prior hospitalizaition several weeks ago.
Also noted some mild leg swelling and ?SOB.
At [**Hospital1 18**], initial VS were: 96.7 76 83/47 19 93% 4L NC, although SBP dropped to 65 when sitting up.
Bedside U/S showed 30% IVC collapse with respiration, no pericardial effusion, no abdominal fluid.
Of note, per records, pt reported fatigue and occasional dizzy spells at office visit on [**2173-4-9**] (told pt to reduce pain meds).
On [**4-17**] at [**University/College **] urgent care pt was seen for dizziness in addition to episodes of discomfort in her chest, with some shortness of breath, lasting a few minutes, mild, increasing in frequency.
Had one episode of pressure in the chest which radiated to her left arm.

Thre is no pneumothorax.
There are mild reticular bibasilar opacities and mild vascular congestion.
Right basilar opacity has mildly improved.
Mild hyperinflation of the lungs.
IMPRESSION: Mild vascular congestion.
[**2173-4-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: A right pleural effusion is best seen on the lateral projection and is mild to moderate in size.
A poorly defined opacity in the right lower lobe has progressed since [**2173-4-24**] and most likely represents an evolving pneumonia, linear densities in the medial right lower lobe likely represent atelectasis.
Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right, but small in volume.
Evolving hazy opacity in the right lower lobe likely reflects pneumonia.
[**2173-4-26**] RUQ u/s:  FINDINGS: Liver appears normal in echotexture without focal abnormality or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Moderate-sized layering right pleural effusion.
Trace perihepatic ascites.
No fluid is seen in both lower quadrants or within the pelvis.
The proximal common duct is mildly dilated measuring 7 mm and is nonspecific in the setting of cholecystectomy.
Intrahepatic portion of the IVC has normal ultrasound appearance.
Preserved corticomedullary differentiation and cortical thickening bilaterally.
Moderate layering right pleural effusion.
Trace perihepatic ascites without significant fluid in the four quadrants or pelvis.
Proximal common duct measures 7 mm, minimally dilated and nonspecific.
[**2173-4-28**] KUB: FINDINGS:  Supine and upright views of the abdomen demonstrate multiple dilated loops of small bowel.
There is no pneumatosis or free air.
There is air in the rectosigmoid colon.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
Right lower lobe hazy opacity appears improved from [**2173-4-26**] exam.
IMPRESSION:  Multiple dilated loops of bowel, compatible with obstruction .
No free air.
No small bowel obstruction.
Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with the common duct maximally measuring 1.5 cm, unchanged since [**2169-7-23**].
Small-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Effusions in combination with mild periportal edema, small amount of simple ascites and subcutaneous edema suggest increased volume status.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59 yo woman with PMHx significant for Addison's disease on chronic steroids, COPD, chronic pain who presented to OSH with fever, cough, n/v/d, and lethargy.
Found to be hypotensive and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of hypotension; concern for possible sepsis or adrenal crisis.
# Hypotension: Likely secondary to adrenal insufficiency and mild hypovolemia in the setting of not taking steroids and inadequate PO intake from nausea and vomiting.
On admission she received broad antibiotics out of concern for sepsis; however, these were discontinued secondary to low clinical suspicion for bacterial illness and rapid improvement with hydration.
However, as she developed a pneumonia (see below), she was discharged on 1 mg twice daily of Dexamethasone to be taken until her antibiotics are completed (higher dose kept in setting of current infection).
# Adrenal insufficiency: This episode of hypotension was likely secondary to nausea/vomiting (secondary to viral illness) and relative adrenal insufficiency due to inability to take po steroids and concurrent stress.
Her steroids were slowly weaned, however she was continued on a higher-dose (1 mg twice daily of dexamethasone) due to her concurrent pneumonia.
She recently had been hospitalized for another episode of hypotension at [**Hospital3 **] prior to this hospitalization; the etiology of this is not clear.
# Pneumonia, bacterial: Patient reported development of a cough and slight shortness of breath during her hospitalization.
She was afebrile and concern for resistant organisms was very low, so she was started on Ciprofloxacin for a 7-day course.
She had small bilateral pleural effusions on CXR; in discussion with pulmonary, these were too small to be tapped.
She would benefit from a repeat CXR next week to ensure no enlargement of the effusions.
These effusions are likely secondary to her aggressive fluid resuscitation on arrival.
# Abdominal distension without obstruction - The patient complained of acute on chronic abd distension (for months, with worsening over the past few days), without n/v.
She noted excess flatus chronically and irregular bowel bovements.
Abd u/s was negative for ascites (slight perihepatic fluid only, likely secondary to her aggressive fluid resuscitation).
KUB was read as obstruction, however upon review with the radiologist, the KUB was only significant for dilated bowel.
A subsequent CT abd revealed NO evidence of obstruction.
# Hyponatremia - stable during her hospitalization .
# Chronic Pain: continued on outpatient regimen.
Initially, frequency of narcotics were reduced in setting of hypotension, but were restarted at her home dose during her hospitalization.
She was recommended to taper these medications, as they can be contributing to her constipation and hypotension, however she notes that her pain is still at a constant and chronic level, requiring her current dose of medications.
# GERD - continued on PPI   Medications on Admission: Per Atrius records: Gabapentin 600 mg tid Abilify 2 mg daily Klonopin 0.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], 1 mg qhs Duloxetine 60 mg daily Nexium 40 mg daily Lamictal 200 mg qhs Lidocaine patch Advair - dose unknown Dexamethasone 0.5 mg daily (recently decreased from 0.5 mg twice daily) Trazadone 200 mg qhs prn Calcium citrate-vit D3 2 tabs twice daily  Discharge Medications: 1. gabapentin 300 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO Q8H (every 8 hours).

Your initial work-up did not show evidence of an infection, but a repeat chest x-ray on [**4-26**] showed concern for a developing pneumonia, so you were started on Ciprofloxacin for a 7-day course.
If you develop pain in the ankle, please STOP this antibiotic immediately.
Your xray also showed some fluid in the lung spaces, but this was too small to be drained.
You also had abdominal distension, so an ultrasound was done, which ruled out signficant fluid in the belly.
An xray showed a lot of air in the bowel, so a CT scan was done to evaluate for obstruction.
This was negative for obstruction and only confirmed gas in the colon.
CONTINUE Miralax and simethicone as needed for constipation and gas.
