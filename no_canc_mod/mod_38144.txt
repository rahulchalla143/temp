Left clavicular, bilateral rib, left iliac, and right sacral fractures.
Full-thickness splenic laceration, with surrounding hemorrhage.
Left gluteus maximus hematoma, with active arterial extravasation.
Trace bilateral pneumothoraces, with dissecting subcutaneous air in the right anterior and left posterior chest walls.
No cervical spine fractures.
Severe degenerative changes at C4-C5 through C6-C7, with severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at C5-C6 but no "critical" spinal canal stenosis.
Active arterial extravasation/bleeding was documented from the distal segment of the left L4 lumbar artery.
Successful transarterial embolic occlusion of the distal segment of the left L4 lumbar artery resulting in hemostasis  [**2113-6-28**] Left shoulder : These two exams consist of five images of the left clavicle and left shoulder.
There is an essentially undisplaced fracture of the mid distal shaft of the left clavicle.
The left AC joint shows minor osteophytic changes with no joint separation.
Normal shoulder without fracture or dislocation.
I cannot entirely exclude an undisplaced fracture of the posterior left third rib.
Left gluteus maximus hematoma with active arterial extravasation.
New bilateral pleural effusions, greater in size on the left than the right.
Full-thickness splenic laceration is again visualized with a small amount of surrounding hemorrhage.
Comminuted mildly displaced fractures involving the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] and the right sacrum are again visualized.
Dissecting subcutaneous air is again visualized in the right anterior and left posterior chest walls.
Stable size of large left gluteal hematoma with no evidence of active extravasation.
No other sites of active extravasation or vascular injury identified within the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Large left-sided pleural effusion and moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion, both of which have increased in size since the [**2113-6-29**] study.
Bilateral rib fractures, left clavicular fracture, left iliac fracture, and right sacral fractures are unchanged.
Splenic laceration is not as well seen on arterial phase study; however, overall it appears stable in extent with no perisplenic hematoma.
A grade 3 splenic laceration was found on CTA, as well as active extravasation from a left lumbar artery.
She was taken immediately to IR for embolization of the bleeding lumbar artery, and then to the TICU for observation.
Her Hct continued to trend down from 30 to 24, and a repeat CTA was obtained, which showed a small amount of active extravasation into her left gluteal hematoma.
Following transfer she developed a left pleural effusion and subsequently had a left chest tube placed as she had a hemothorax.
She felt better after > 1L of blood was evacuated and her oxygen requirements decreased.
If her hematuria were to recur a CT cystogram was recommended.
Her chest tube was removed on [**7-6**] and her post pull film showed a small residual apical pneumothorax which was noted on a previous film, other than that  was stable.
She was noted with intermittent complaints of nausea felt most likely secondary to her increased narcotic use because of her rib fractures.
She was seen by the Physical Therapy service and a short term rehab was recommended prior to returning home.

Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital after your fall with multiple injuries including rib fractures, a broken collarbone, a lacerated spleen and active bleeding in your pelvis causing a hematoma.
* You developed blood in your left chest requiring drainage with a chest tube *  Rib fractures can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
* If you develop any dizziness, feel faint or have any more blood in your urine please call your doctor or return to the Emergency Room.
*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs ( crepitus ).
You will need an end expiratory chest xray for this appointment.
Follow up in [**Hospital 159**] clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] in the next [**11-20**] weeks if failed voiding trial and also if hematuria returns, call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 164**] if you need to be seen.
