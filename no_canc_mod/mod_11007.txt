Admission Date:  [**2175-9-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2175-10-3**]   Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old female transferred from an outside hospital with congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and shortness of breath.
Electrocardiogram at the time showed ST depressions in leads V1 through V3, and right bundle-branch block, and the patient was ruled in for myocardial infarction by enzymes.
It was crepitus throughout her entire body but she was never in any acute distress, and chest tube that was placed in the operating room showed a small air leak.
So, the chest tube was left in for several extra days.
On postoperative day eight, the patient's subcutaneous emphysema improved and serial chest x-rays over the past few days have shown no pneumothorax.
Another chest x-ray was taken showing no pneumothorax, and the patient's subcutaneous emphysema improved.
Upon discharge, the patient still had some crepitus throughout her upper chest wall, the back, the head, and bilateral lower extremities; however, the crepitus was much more improved than previously.
