HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 51 year old male with a history of alcohol abuse, transferred from [**Hospital3 3834**] after presenting with weakness, falls and a large left leg hematoma.
According to the transfer summary, the patient's wife, who has limited contact with the patient, reported some weight loss, heavy drinking and multiple falls with some recent vomiting, although she was unsure if there was any blood present.
He has also had a chronic cough that is unchanged.
He had a head CT scan that was negative and a CT scan of the abdomen where there was some question of retroperitoneal varices and soft tissue swelling of the left leg.
The patient has a large left leg ecchymosis.
Apparently, there has been no evidence of an obvious source of blood loss, no evidence of hematemesis, bright red blood per rectum or melena at the outside hospital.
Oropharynx with poor dentition and dried blood, but mucous membranes moist.
Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention but prominent venous waves.
Cardiovascular:  Distant heart sounds but regular rate and rhythm; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen soft, mildly distended; some mildly tender hepatomegaly and a reducible umbilical hernia; no fluid wave.
Extremities with large ecchymosis of the left hip to lower leg with mild pain on passive flexion of the left hip but no point tenderness.
Two plus pitting edema of the left lower extremity, no clubbing.
Chest x-ray shows chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and no acute process.
Abdominal CT scan shows cirrhosis with no clear evidence of retroperitoneal varices or retroperitoneal hematoma but shows a left gluteal hematoma.
No ascites or splenomegaly.
FALLING HEMATOCRIT:  The patient presented initially with a hematocrit of 11% and an INR of 4 with a left lower extremity hematoma.
His CT scans were reviewed here and were consistent with a left gluteal hematoma, but no retroperitoneal bleeding and no gross evidence of gastrointestinal bleed.
The Gastrointestinal Service performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to rule out varices and he was found to have no varices.
For left lower extremity hematoma:   He was given fresh frozen plasma intermittently for an elevated INR.
METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BACTEREMIA: the patient initially p9resented with high grade bacteremia on [**1-16**] with four out of four positive bottles.
On [**1-18**], he had one out of two positive bottles with an unclear source of his Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
He had no joint symptoms.
Transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for any evidence of endocarditis.
He has had no central venous lines this admission and only had peripheral intravenous lines and an arterial line.
There was some question that his left lower extremity hematoma had been super-infected.
He had no tenderness to palpation of his spine and no meningeal signs.
No ascites by CT scan.
DECREASING MENTAL STATUS:  This initially was thought to be alcohol withdrawal and he was initially Ativan responsive, presenting with an increased heart rate and blood pressure.
Now, his mental status is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy as he is beyond the window for alcohol withdrawal.
He has had no evidence of seizure activity this admission and no meningeal signs.
COAGULOPATHY SECONDARY TO HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION.
Fresh frozen plasma was given to decrease his INR less than 1.6 for bleeding from his A-line site.
No gross evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
CIRRHOSIS SECONDARY TO ALCOHOL ABUSE:  Evidence on ultrasound and stigmata present on examination.
No esophageal varices by esophagogastroduodenoscopy, complicated by coagulopathy.
He has had no seizures this admission.
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:  Questionable left lower lobe infiltrate on his admission with an elevated temperature.
He was intubated briefly for two days for airway protection secondary to decreased mental status.
