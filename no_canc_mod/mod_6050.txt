Recently, she became more symptomatic especially more short of breath and more fatigued.
She had an echocardiogram on [**11/2149**], which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65%, aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 42, severe MAC, one plus mitral regurgitation and trivial tricuspid regurgitation.
She also had a Persantine MIBI in [**11/2149**], which revealed mild ischemia of the apical segment of the inferior wall and a mild fixed defect of the apical segment of the anterior wall.
Most recently, an echocardiogram showed aortic gradient of 68, and left ventricular hypertrophy with good left ventricular function.
Congestive heart failure.
Aortic and mitral valve disease.
Diabetes mellitus.

History of cerebrovascular disease with mild right sided weakness.
Partial hysterectomy.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given symptomatic disease, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2150-11-2**].
The findings were 30% distal stenosis of the LMCA, 60 to 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending, mild disease of the left circumflex and 95% stenosis of the right coronary artery.
There were no complications.
She was noted to be wheezing and appeared mildly fluid overloaded on examination.
A chest x-ray showed atelectasis and right sided pleural effusion.
The patient was also noted to be slightly hypertensive and her medications were adjusted accordingly.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting times two.
Aortic disease status post aortic valve replacement.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease.
