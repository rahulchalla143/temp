He was shocked three times and given Epinephrine 1mg x 3, Atropine x 3, and Lidocaine 100 mg once with return of sinus tachycardia.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 1443**] where he was found to be in a wide complex tachycardia at 120, BP 80/50, agonal, and was placed on a lidocaine drip.
It was difficult to get the patient cooled, which was concerning for an underlying infection.

NEURO ExAM [**2120-1-29**] VS: T: 98.2 P: 100 BP: 113/67 RR: 22 SaO2: 99% intubated General: Lying in bed, not arousible to voice or noxious stimuli MS: No arousal to voice or noxious stimuli.
Slight skew deviation, with right eye elevated a few mm compared to the left.
Small lateral movements noted with oculocephalics.
No response to painful stimuli in bilateral lower extremities.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no angiographically apparent obstructive coronary disease.
The LMCA, LAD, Lcx and RCA all had no angiographically apparent disease.
There was no transaortic valve gradient on careful pullback from LV to aorta.
TTE [**2120-1-25**]: Conclusions The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Chest Xray [**2120-1-24**] IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema, adequate placement of the endotracheal tube.
There is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure.
Retrocardiac and left lower lung opacification suggests volume loss and possible pleural effusion.
Equivocally increased liver echogenicity, which may be technical, though alternatively may suggest a mild degree of fatty infiltration.
Likely segment III hemangioma.
No biliary duct dilation.
MICRO: URINE CX [**2120-1-25**]: NO GROWTH .

Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 52 yo M with reported hx of cardiomyopathy s/p Ventricular Fibrillation cardiac arrest in the community, transferred to our facility, found to have no hemodynamically significant coronary disease, preserved ejection fraction, who underwent cooling protocol for neuroprotection.
Neurological evaluation revealed only minimal neurogical brainstem function.
ACTIVE ISSUES # Ventricular Fibrillation Cardiac Arrest: Unclear etiology.
He was intubated in the field and initially brought to [**Hospital3 19345**], then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he immediately went for cardiac catheterization, which revealed no significant coronary artery disease.
An echocardiogram obtained the day after admission revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved ejection fraction.
# Therapuetic Cooling for Neuroprotection after Cardiac Arrest: The interval between arrest and initiation of cooling was 5 hours.
However, the patient was difficult to cool to optimal temperature of 33 degrees, which was concerning for underlying infection.
During his cardiac catheterization he showed no signs of meaningful interaction.
His labs were closely monitored for the expected hypokalemia and hyperglycemia during cooling and hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia during rewarming.
He received continuous video EEG, which revealed seizure activity consistent with status epilepticus.
Off of sedation he remained non-responsive to stimuli.
While the patient was still exhibiting some signs of brainstem activity, these were all poor prognostic signs for a meaningful recovery.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated by EMS secondary to his neurological insult after cardiac arrest.
This was most likely secondary to a Ventilator Associated Pneumonia, as his PaO2 improved with aggressive suctioning of thick green secretions that grew methicillin-resistant staph aureus in culture.
# Hypotension: The patient had a brief period of hypotension requiring transient use of pressure support with norepinephrine.
This was likely secondary to hypovolemia, and improved with fluid boluses.
# Coagulopathy: The patient was on coumadin for atrial fibrillation as an outpatient.
He presented with a supratherapuetic INR, which increased during the cooling process, but then trended down with vitamin K. Labwork was negative for DIC.
He showed no evidence of active bleeding.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Likely pre-renal in etiology as improved with IV hydration.
Enterococcus grew in urine ~6000 units.
Vancomycin for positive sputum culture continued.
He was found to have clean coronaries during cardiac catheterization and preserved ejection fraction without significant valvular abnormalities on echocardiogram.
# Atrial fibrillation: He remained in sinus rhythm.
# HTN: We held his antihypertensives which were started HD 5 after warming as patient became hypertensive.
