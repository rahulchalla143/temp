RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY, NINE RADIOGRAPHS: There is transverse fracture through the mid portion of the right femur, with medial angulation of the fracture fragment and posterior displacement with bayoneting of the distal fracture fragment.
Additionally, there is a fracture of the lateral aspect of the proximal tibia, extending to involve the lateral tibial plateau.
There is approximately 1 to 2 mm displacement at the fracture line.
No definite fracture of the fibula is identified.
Limited images of the right ankle joint demonstrate no definite effusion or associated fracture.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY, FOUR RADIOGRAPHS: On these single view images of the left lower extremity, no definite fractures are identified.
No knee joint effusion is seen.
Transverse fracture of the mid portion of the right femur, as described above.
Longitudinal fracture of the proximal portion of the left tibia, extending to the lateral tibial plateau.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 46 year old man with Right femoral and R tibial plateau fracture s/p ORIF now with cellulitis R shin and edema of thigh and tenderness.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: 46-year-old man with right femoral and right tibia plenty of fracture, cellulitis at right shin, and edema of thigh.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity venous system.
HISTORY: 46-year-old man with femur and proximal tibial fractures.
There is again seen an intramedullary rod with one proximal and two distal interlocking screws fixating a transverse fracture through the proximal right femoral shaft.
Images of the tibia and fibula demonstrates interval placement of a lateral plate with multiple cortical screws fixating a fracture of the right tibial plateau.
There is no evidence for hardware complications.
Orthopedics was immediately consulted because of patient's injuries.
He was taken to the OR on [**11-29**] for IM rodding of right femur fracture and on [**12-2**] for ORIF of tibia fracture and closure of wound left lower extremity.
At this time his HCTZ and Atenolol have been on hold secondary to orthostasis and dizziness.
On [**12-7**] patient noted with cellulitis of his RLE anterior tibia region; he was started on Ancef 1 GM IV every 8 hours and underwent LENIS which were negative for DVT.
