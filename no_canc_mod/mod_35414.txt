Pregnancy was complicated by preterm labor and known breech presentation.
At the time of delivery, the mother had experienced increased blood pressure and the decision was made to deliver by Cesarean section.
Color mildly jaundiced, pink.
Cardiovascular:  1-2 SEM at left upper-mid sternal border with radiation to axilla and back.
Clinically consistent with Peripheral Pulmonic Stemosis (PPS).
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  Respiratory:  This infant was noted to have mild transitional respiratory distress with grunting respirations upon admission to the NICU.
She had one episode of spontaneous apnea on [**2125-3-16**] with no recurrent apnea or bradycardia events since that time.
The murmur is clinically consistent with Peripheral Pulmonic Stenosis (PPS).
Infectious disease:  Due to her prematurity and the respiratory distress noted at the time of birth, this infant was evaluated for sepsis upon admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
The infant remains slightly jaundiced at the time of discharge, and a repeat bilirubin was 8.7/0.3 on the morning of discharge.
Musculoskeletal:  As noted, this infant was delivered from the frank breech position and her initial hip exam revealed unstable hips left>right.
A hip ultrasound was obtained on [**2125-3-15**] revealed shallow acetabulae and completely subluxed femoral heads.
There were no neurologic concerns at discharge.
No medications.
This infant     was observed in her car seat for 90 minutes without any     episodes of oxygen desaturation or bradycardia on     [**2125-3-22**].
There has been no notification of abnormal results to     date.
Immunizations recommended:     Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **]     through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following     four criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born     between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with two of the following:     Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household,     neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age     siblings; (3) chronic lung disease or (4) hemodynamically     significant congenital heart disease.
Before     this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life,     immunization against influenza is recommended for     household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
The     American Academy of Pediatrics recommends initial     vaccination of preterm infants at or following discharge     from the hospital if they are clinically stable or at     least 6 weeks but fewer than 12 weeks of age.
Transitional respiratory distress.
Apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
Suspicion for sepsis ruled out.
Developmental dysplasia of the hip.
