No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Mild symmetric LVH.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Markedly dilated ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Focal calcifications in descending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Suboptimal image quality.
Results were  REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions PRE CPB No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is markedly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly to moderately thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Later in the post-bypass period, severe inferior wall hypokinesis was seen.
There was also some inferoseptal dyskinesis.
There is a trace valvular paravalvular leak seen.
Mitral regurgitation remains mild.
The descending thoracic aorta and distal aortic arch appear intact.
[**2175-8-14**] 09:08PM   PT-14.1* PTT-30.9 INR(PT)-1.2*  Brief Hospital Course: Mr.[**Known lastname **] was transferred from an outside ED after presenting with SOB and "CHB", although he was stable.
The urology service saw him for a  left scrotal mass which was deemed a hydrocele.
EPS was consulted for his episodes of asymptomatic bradycardia to the 30s with AV block ( ?
His CXR showed resolving pulmonary contusions with small effusions and no evidence of CHF.
He weaned from CPB on Milrinone, epinephrine, neosynephrine and propafol.His CV status stabilized with volume and pressors and these were gradually weaned off in the first 48 hours.
All AV node blockers were withheld due to his underlying dysrhythmia and there were rare episodes of bradycardia after surgery.
There continues to be episodes of blocked APCs and some Mobitz I block, but no high grade AV node block.The EP service has been following the  patient and recommends no further intervention/treatment at this time.
No creams,lotions or powders to incisions.
Report any temperature greater than 101 Report any drainage or redness of incisions Take all medications as ordered No lifting more rthan 10 pounds for 10 weeks No driving for 4 weeks and off all narcotics  Followup Instructions: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in 4 weeks ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**]), call for appt.
