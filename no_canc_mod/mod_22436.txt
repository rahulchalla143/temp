Admission Date:  [**2167-2-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-3-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-12-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU ROM  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for severe COPD, AFib, anxiety and depression, who was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2167-2-22**] to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation of his COPD.
To briefly summarize their report, the patient was transferred on [**2167-2-22**] with issues including failure to thrive, COPD, cachexia with severe malnutrition, and a small/medium vessel vasculitis resulting in multiple skin erosions on all four of the patient's extremities.
The Pulmonary service recommended inhaled steroids as well as around-the-clock MDIs including Atrovent and albuterol for his pulmonary disease.
This is consistent with very severe COPD.
The patient had a CT of the chest with and without contrast on [**2167-2-24**] that showed no lymphadenopathy, extensive emphysematous changes bilaterally, and multiple small bilateral vague patchy areas of nodularity of uncertain significance.
There were no pleural or pericardial effusions, no infiltrates.
An incidental finding was made of an infrarenal aortic stenosis and extensive vascular calcifications.
Because of this incidental finding, the patient had bilateral PVR testing that revealed significantly decreased flow to the right leg and a normal PVR of the left leg.
The patient subsequently had bilateral lower extremity angiograms on [**2167-2-27**], which revealed near total occlusion of the right common iliac artery and therefore, the patient underwent two stents by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] being placed in that artery.
As far as further significant events during his CT Surgery hospital course, the patient was evaluated by Dermatology and had multiple biopsies of the skin ulcerations.
He was diagnosed with a medium vessel vasculitis thought to be secondary to medications.
The most likely culprit is amoxicillin, which the patient had been taking for a COPD flare prior to his hospitalization at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
There was no evidence of a systemic vasculitis or rheumatologic issue based on multiple testing including negative [**Doctor First Name **], negative rheumatoid factor, negative ANCA, and negative RPR.
These ulcers secondary to vasculitis on the patient's extremities grew out both MRSA and Enterococcus, therefore the patient was placed on linezolid and ciprofloxacin to cover these organisms.
The reason antibiotics were started was that the patient had a leukocytosis with a peak white blood cell count of 28,000 while on the CT Surgery service team.
Also from an ID perspective, the patient was treated empirically for Clostridium difficile infection because of profuse diarrhea, which improved with Flagyl.
It was felt that because of the patient's multiple comorbidities including malnutrition and this vasculitis, he was not currently a candidate for lung volume reduction surgery.
The patient was transferred to the MICU Green Team Resident Only Service on [**2167-3-9**] for hypercapnic respiratory failure.
For 24 hours prior to transfer, the patient had been having difficulty breathing and was somnolent on the floor.
Serial ABGs showed a worsening hypercapnia.
The patient on examination was noted to have diffuse expiratory wheezes and was found to be in hypercapnic respiratory failure.
A chest x-ray was obtained post intubation that showed no evidence of infiltrate, no new pneumothoraces, and no obvious explanation for why the patient had a hypercapnic respiratory failure.
Of note the patient had recently been hospitalized in [**Month (only) 404**] for a pneumonia and a COPD flare requiring BiPAP use.
prednisone for COPD flare.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated.
MRSA wound infections in the lower extremities, also Enterococcus, and gram-negative rods in the wound infection/vasculitis.
Patient is very cachectic.
Heart:  S1, S2, regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs:  Diffuse expiratory wheezes bilaterally, no crackles.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Multiple ulcers in the legs and arms and some areas of modeling in the legs.
Old Q waves in the inferior leads and slightly early R-wave progression.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with severe COPD initially admitted to the CT Surgery service on [**2167-2-22**] for evaluation for potential lung volume reduction surgery.
As the patient had multiple other comorbidities as noted including a medium vessel vasculitis thought to be secondary to medication, extreme cachexia from his COPD and malnutrition, and likely Clostridium difficile colitis, the surgery was deferred.
The patient had an episode of hypercapnic respiratory failure and therefore was transferred to the MICU for further care and was intubated.
Initial chest x-ray on admission showed no evidence of pulmonary infiltrates, and no evidence of pneumothoraces.
While a central line was being placed in the right internal jugular vein, the patient became severely bradycardic and eventually asystolic.
The patient then entered a ventricular fibrillation and was shocked multiple times.
This showed a very large right-sided tension pneumothorax.
Based on the above description, it was felt that the patient's hypotension post BiPAP and intubation likely reflected the beginnings of a pneumothorax and that with subsequent PEEP as well as auto PEEP, this developed into a tension pneumothorax leading to a PEA arrest.
Although this occurred in the setting of a right IJ placement, it was not felt that the pneumothorax was due to the right IJ being placed, although this is a possibility.
As the patient became hypotensive immediately after intubation, however, it is most likely that the patient had an apical bleb then ruptured with intubation.
The right apical pneumothorax was stable and this decompensation was felt to be due to extremely severe COPD.
As the patient was becoming difficult to wean, it was decided that it would be in the patient's best interest to have a tracheostomy placed for further weaning and for patient's safety.
He was able to be weaned to CPAP with pressure support and on the day of discharge to the pulmonary rehab facility, he was requiring 0 PEEP and a pressure support of 8 with excellent oxygenation and no signs of hypercapnia.
as the patient no longer had any IV access as these were all removed to prevent line-related infection, and as the patient was clinically was much more stable.
Chest x-ray prior to admission showed no pneumothorax, no infiltrates.
Furthermore, the patient was fitted with a Passy-Muir valve on two days prior to discharge and was able to use this without any respiratory difficulty.
Cardiovascular:  As noted above, the patient was hypotensive immediately post BiPAP and post intubation likely secondary to the tension pneumothorax on the right side.
After the patient's cardiac arrest, which as stated above included asystole, then PEA, then ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, he was placed on an amiodarone drip for 24 hours.
The patient does have a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, however, the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm during his hospital course.
The patient had no other cardiac issues during his hospital stay.
He was noted at times to have some hypertension once he was weaned off the pressors.
Therefore, he was placed on Lopressor for a short period of time.
However, he did not tolerate this longterm and became somewhat hypotensive with the use of Lopressor.
The patient has no history of essential hypertension, and therefore he was not rechallanged with Lopressor.
Thrombocytopenia:  When the patient was admitted, he had a reactive thrombocytosis most likely with platelets up to 600,000.
At the outside hospital, he had been on Lovenox for prophylaxis.
The degree of drop in platelets as well as the time course was highly consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
They agreed with the high clinical suspicion for HIT and recommended sending a second HIT test.
The second test also returned negative as this is a highly sensitive test for Heparin dependent antibodies and the HIT syndrome, it was felt that he does not have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Rather, it was felt that the patient's thrombocytopenia was medication induced, most likely secondary to linezolid.
The patient had an extensive workup for this thrombocytopenia before this conclusion was made, however, including he was ruled out for DIC, ruled out for TTP, and ruled out for ITP with a negative platelet antibody test.
The patient was noted to have old clots within his left femoral artery as well as in his left upper extremity.
The patient had a speech and swallow evaluation on two separate occasions, once immediately pre-PEG placement and one on the day prior to discharge to rehab.
Infectious disease:  The patient did have a leukocytosis as mentioned above with a peak white blood cell count of 28,000.
This was felt to be due to both steroid use as well as the infection in the vasculitic ulcers in the patient's extremities.
As this patient not infrequently causes thrombocytopenia, the drop in platelets was attributed to this medication.
Three Clostridium difficile toxins were negative, however, with cessation of Flagyl on the CT Surgery service, the patient developed severe diarrhea and with reinitiation of Flagyl, this stopped.
Once he finished his Flagyl course, he had no recurrence of diarrhea.
There were no other infectious issues throughout the rest of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course.
He remained afebrile with no evidence of pneumonia, no line infections, and his skin lesions did not become reinfected.
The Psychiatry service did see the patient for his history of depression and anxiety, and followed him throughout his hospital course.
They recommended avoiding benzodiazepines and narcotics as much as possible as they resulted in paradoxical reactions with the patient's mood.
for clot prophylaxis.
