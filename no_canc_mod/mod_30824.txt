Admission Date:  [**2187-8-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-8-9**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**] Chief Complaint: hyponatremia, decreased mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Peripherally inserted central catheter  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with H/o hypothyroid  presents after fall.
Recently admitted for fall and pain control on [**9-6**], noted to have low Na (129) at the time, she then returned with altered mental status in setting of hyponatremia (112).
Initially attempted correction with normal saline, but she became volume overloaded w/ pulmonary edema [**12-21**] diastolic dysfunction.
Then, attempted diuresis caused bradycardia and hypotension.
She was transferred to MICU for further stabilization, and did well subsequently with minimal intervention - fluid restriction and small amount of hypertonic saline, which was discontinued.
<BR> On evaluation of her back, an MR of the L-Spine revealed acute compression fracture of L1 vertebra with retropulsion and 50% narrowing of central portion of the spinal canal, moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 level due to disc and facet degenerative changes.
Moderate-to-severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 level secondary to disc degenerative changes and facet degeneration.
<BR> Pt was initially placed on a fentanyl patch (25mcg) in MICU for pain control.
<BR> On transfer, pt was denying any pain, chest discomfort or shortness of breath   Past Medical History: 1.

Moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 level due to disc and facet degenerative changes.
Moderate- to-severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 level secondary to disc degenerative changes and facet degeneration.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**11-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
9.There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F Mitral regurg, probable diastolic dysfunction intially admitted with delirium probably secondary to hyponatremia, poor PO intake, and severe pain [**12-21**] L1 compression fracture.
She was given NS which precipitated volume overload and pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation.
She subsequently had an episode of hypotension [**12-21**] overdiuresis and was transferred to the ICU.
Volume was allowed to reequilibrate, and the patient's sodium improved with fluid restriction and a small amount of hypertonic saline.
This was therefore thought to be as a result of combination SIADH as well as hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Compression fracture: An MRI showed a compression fracture of the L1 vertebra with retropulsion and 50% narrowing of central portion of the spinal canal, moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 level due to disc and facet degenerative changes.
She may be a candidate for future kyphoplasty.
Heart failure: The patient's pulmonary edema is resolving.
Pain Control: for the patient's compression fracture, Mrs. [**Known lastname 98082**] pain was controlled with a Lidocaine patch, oxycodone sustained release 10mg q12, OxycodONE liquid 2.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN pain.
Narcotics should be used very carefully in this patient as she tends to become confused and is susceptible to falls.
Pneumonia: As pt became hypoxic in the setting of mental status changes shortly after admission, she was treated empirically with a course of levofloxacin.
