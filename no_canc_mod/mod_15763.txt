Admission Date:  [**2173-4-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2173-5-4**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  IDENTIFICATION:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 406**] is a now day of life 42 ex-24-1/7 week male who is to be transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital3 1810**] [**Location (un) 86**] for treatment of possible septic arthritis.
Respiratory:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 406**] is currently intubated and ventilated with chronic lung disease status post hyaline membrane disease.
As detailed in his previous transfer summary, he received two doses of surfactant subsequent to delivery and has since that time developed chronic lung disease.
He is relatively stable on these settings; however, he does have some swings in oxygen saturation which are characteristic of chronic lung disease.
His chest x-rays are significant for characteristics of chronic lung disease.
He has had no episodes of hypotension or hypertension or tachycardia or any other rhythm disturbance.
He has had no difficulty with feeds and he has had regular stooling and voiding.
He also had developed a temperature of 102??????
A CBC was obtained, as well, on [**2173-5-4**], and was significant for a rising white blood cell count of 24,300 with a differential of 54 segs and 7 bands without immature cells.
Blood culture was obtained at the same time and, after approximately eight to ten hours, grew out Gram positive cocci in clusters and in pairs.
Examination of the leg on [**2173-5-4**], revealed that the induration and erythema had reduced and warmth over the leg had also reduced.
The infant had not been febrile since [**2173-5-3**]; however, there was still significant swelling of the leg and the question of osteomyelitis and/or arthritis became paramount.
Infectious Disease also recommended that a lumbar puncture be obtained and an ultrasound of the hip joint was obtained as well.
The finding was consistent with either a fluid filled pocket which could be pus either isolated from or communicating with the hip joint and involving the muscle as well raising the question of a pyomyositis.
Orthopedics consult was obtained secondary to the concerns of septic arthritis and the recommendation of Orthopedic consultation was that the infant be brought to the Operating Room for exploration of the muscles overlying the hip joint secondary to concerns of pyomyositis as well as an exploration of the hip joint itself.
