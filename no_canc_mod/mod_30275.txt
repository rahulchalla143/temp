He was placed on high-dose steroids which resolved his pulmonary process and hypereosinophilia, but during the work-up, it was noted that he had dramatic decrease in his left ventricular function.
Cardiac catheterization in [**2107**] did show some coronary disease with moderate pulmonary hypertension and evidence of a left-to-right shunt due to an ASD.
He has been medically managed since [**2107**] and was referred for both coronary and lower extremity angiography because of bilateral claudication, right worse than left.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
Vertebral artery stenosis.
Peripheral vascular disease.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
He also had significant disease with near total occlusion of his right superficial femoral artery and moderate diffuse disease in his left superficial femoral artery.
Cardiac catheterization also showed evidence of a left-to-right shunt.

Lungs:  He had decreased breath sounds at the bases.
There was a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the second intercostal space.
Nontender and nondistended abdomen.
He had decreased distal pulses.
On postoperative day #1, he had no events overnight, with a stable blood pressure of 137/62.
He had decreased breath sounds at the bases but no air leak.
His lungs again had decreased breath sounds at the bases.
