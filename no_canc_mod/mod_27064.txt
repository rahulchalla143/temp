# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure with a LVEF of 20%: Upon arrival to the floor ~8am [**2196-4-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname 10794**] was in florid heart failure.
His pulmonary exam notable for diffuse inspiratory rales.
At that time, he noted left sided chest cramps.
An EKG was performed which showed no dynamic changes concerning for ischemia.
Due to concern for impending respiratory failure secondary to volume overload, he was transferred to the medical ICU for overnight monitoring.
He responded very well to the diuretics and upon discharge had an ambulatory saturation in the mid 90's on room air, no JVD, and no lower extremity edema.
The patient was counseled extensively on the importance of a low sodium diet after the patient admitted to eating foods high in salt like ramen and BBQ.
These values are suggestive of both a component of restrictive and obstructive lung disease.
Given his previous admissions for respiratory failure induced by pneumonia and crack-cocaine pneumonitis combined with his chest xray which showed diffuse infiltrates concerning for possible pneumonia.
Given his dramatic improvement with lasix and no signs of underlying infection (no leukocytosis, left shift) and no signs of an acute COPD flare, his steroids and antibiotics were discontinued on hospital day two with no adverse affect.
No changes were made to his outpatient COPD treatment.
# Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was maintained on his outpatient regimen of [**Hospital1 **] lantus with a sliding scale with [**Hospital1 **] sugars ranging in the 160s to low 200s.
Close monitoring of volume status and titration of lasix dosing.
Follow up with liver center in 3 months with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for hep c management.
