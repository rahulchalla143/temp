Around the same time, his surveillance culture in his nose turned positive for streptococcus pneumococcus.
An eye culture was sent that also grew strep pneumococcus.
At this time his eye medication was changed from gentamicin to extended gram positive coverage with Ciprofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution (this was discussed with the [**Hospital3 1810**] ID Fellow).
He will also have follow-up audiology for brainstem evoked responses and otoacoustic emission testing due to the family history of deafness.
Immunizations recommended: Synagis RVS prophylaxis should     be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who     meet any of the following 3 criteria: #1, born at less     than 32 weeks, #2, born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of     the following: Daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the     household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or     school age siblings, or #3, with chronic lung disease.

Before     this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life,     immunization against influenza is recommended for     household contacts and out of home caregivers.
