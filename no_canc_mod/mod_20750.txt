Admission Date: [**2193-9-11**]        Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:  [**2135-12-13**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] stock is a 57 year old woman who was transferred to [**Hospital6 23127**] after a long admission for subarachnoid hemorrhage with craniotomy clipping of aneurysm with complications of pseudomonas in sputum and blood during her admission, with prolonged fever.
At the rehabilitation hospital, she was found to have a left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis by ultrasound that was present in the left distal femoral vein, down to the popliteal and gastrocnemius veins.
There was minimal attempt to localize with painful stimulation in the right upper extremity and minimal withdraw on the left extremity.
Lower extremity showed no swelling or erythema.
Lungs showed coarse breath sounds throughout the right and left.
There was a few bacteria and few yeasts.
She had a chest x-ray done that showed linear atelectasis versus opacity in the right lower lobe.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.
She was to have an inferior vena cava filter placement.
Postoperatively, she was seen by infectious disease who felt that she did likely not have a pseudomonas pneumonia.
She did have signs consistent with a urinary tract infection and, therefore, it was recommended that the Foley be changed and repeat urinalysis and urine culture were sent.
They also recommended a dermatology consult for some bulbous formation on her left hip region.
Infectious disease did continue to follow and on a chest CAT scan, on [**9-14**], this showed a new right lower lobe consolidation.
All urine cultures showed yeast but grew out no bacteria.
Dermatology did see the patient for the blisters, primarily on the left hip region and felt these were likely due to friction and pressure and recommended local wound care.
The infectious disease team checked on the chest CT with cardiologist and felt that the picture was most consistent with atelectasis, and therefore, recommended that the Gentamycin could be discontinued.
She continued to be afebrile with stable vital signs and neurologically stable.
