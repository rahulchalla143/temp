Poor precordial QRS progression.
Non-specific inferior T wave changes.
The large right basal ganglia hemorrhage extending to the corona radiata and anterior temporal white matter is unchanged, but surrounding edema has increased, resulting in increased leftward shift of midline structures, partial effacement of the right aspect of the suprasellar cistern, and mild right uncal herniation.
2.Persistent intraventricular hemorrhage.
Slightly increased dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.
Possible evolving acute infarction in the right caudate head.
Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2108-8-1**] 11:55 AM Final Report by Radiologist IMPRESSION: The patient is status post right frontal temporoparietal craniectomy, no significant change since the prior examination, persistent midline shift with approximately 5 mm of deviation towards the left, stable intracranial and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Unchanged edema surrounding the area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and similar mass effect along the left frontal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Bibasilar opacities have increased compared to [**7-28**], pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
There is no acute parenchymal abnormality.
Radiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2108-8-4**] 11:41 AM BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    55 year old man with fever spike to 102 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    pna?
Wet Read: PXDb SUN [**2108-8-5**] 8:32 PM Increasing opacity in bilateral lower lobes, R>L, may reflect ateletectasis, superimposed on mild volume overload with cephalization and blurring of perihilar vasculature.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-4**]:  Interval increase in caliber of mediastinal vasculature suggests that some of the new interstitial abnormality in the left lower lung is asymmetric edema, but there is more consolidation at the left lung base and was present previously, concerning for new pneumonia.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and pulsed Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed on the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.
IMPRESSION: Near complete occlusive clot within the left cephalic vein.

His Head CT showed large IPH right deep basal ganglia.
On [**7-29**], his Head CT revealed no progression of right basal ganglia hematoma with preexisting 6 mm left midline shift and new small subarachnoid hemorrhage in a left paramedian frontal sulcus.He unserwent an angiogram which was negative.
On [**7-31**], He went to the OR for a Decompressive right hemi-craniectomy for his intracranial hemorrhage, post-operatively he was given Mannitol 25 mg q 8 hours, his post-operative Head CT was consistent with improvement in leftward midline shift and decreased dilation of the left lateral ventricle.
On [**8-1**], the patients Head Ct was consistent with no significant change since the prior examination, persistent midline shift with approximately 5 mm of deviation towards the left, stable intracranial and intraventricular hemorrhage and unchanged edema surrounding the area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
On [**8-2**], he experienced fevers was started on antibiotics for pneumonia, the patient was pancultured for other possible sources of infection.
Bilateral Lower Extremity venous ultrasound was performed with no evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
On [**8-6**], overnight pt spike a temperature of 102.3 and was pancultured and a chest x-ray revealed increased opacities in the lower lobes r>l.
The patient was started on ciprofloxacin to emperically to treat a pneumonia on [**2108-8-5**].
If the patient re-spikes a fever would consider ID consult at your facility and obtain appropriate specimens.
