There is residual gastrografin within the colon from previous small-bowel follow through.
There is no evidence of obstruction identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction identified.
There is also likely a component of atelectasis.
This could represent aspiration or pneumonia.
Postsurgical changes in both shoulders.
The stent in question has migrated proximally above the thoracic inlet since the prior study of [**8-4**].
Unchanged bilateral upper lobe airspace opacities which could represent aspiration or pneumonia.
There is a patchy opacity in the left upper lung zone which could represent pneumonia or aspiration.
There is also a patchy opacity in the right upper lung zone, and right mid lung zone concerning for the same.
There is a retrocardiac opacity also concerning for same.
Again noted is a total left shoulder prosthesis and postsurgical changes in the right shoulder.
New patchy opacities left upper lung zone, right, mid and lower lung zones, concerning for aspiration vs. pneumonia.
<br> BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT  [**2101-9-2**] 3:35 PM There has been interval migration of the esophageal stent which now is located at the level of upper esophagus and distal pharynx.
There is no retention of the contrast in th e valecula or piriform sinuses.
No aspiration or penetration was noted.
The esophagogram demonstrated normal appearance of the gastric pull- through with no stricture or leak.
No leak or stenosis is noted.
No aspiration was visualized.
<br> ESOPHAGUS  [**2101-9-1**] 10:04 AM FINDINGS: Patient was administered Conray orally, no evidence of extravasation was seen.
There is no stricture at the anastomosis.
IMPRESSION: Status post esophagectomy, gastric pull-up No evidence of extravasation or strictures at the anastomosis.
There is no gas seen within the stomach in the mediastinum.
Left basilar consolidation persists and there is high- density material overlying the left lung base which could represent retained barium if there has been administered since [**2101-8-4**].
Consolidation in the left mid lung and right apex are unchanged and may represent slow resolving aspiration versus scarring.
There is likely a small left pleural effusion, however, the right pleural effusion appears to have resolved.
No new pulmonary opacities.
Total left shoulder arthroplasty and right chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy changes and post- surgical suture anchors are unchanged.
Migration of esophageal stent into the cervical esophagus.
Persistent pulmonary opacities with new high-density material overlying the left lung base which could be barium within the stomach or within the lung.
Barium swallow showed no perforation.
<br> 2) Aspiration PNA Patient was hypotensive and hypothermic in setting of multiple scopes, patient likely aspirated.
She was given viscous lidocaine to help with her throat pain.
<br> 4) Hypertension After initially being held, her metoprolol was restarted.
Lidocaine HCl 2 % Solution Sig: Twenty (20) ML Mucous membrane TID (3 times a day) as needed for sore throat.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
