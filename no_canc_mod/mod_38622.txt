Some reports that she could have perhaps had a headache or slightly confused at that time, but this is unclear.
Per NH, patient has baseline dementia but is usually alert and oriented.
Per discussion with the husband, patient is alert and oriented x2 only and per previous [**Hospital6 1597**] Records, the patient is confused at baseline possibly in the setting of persistent uremia.
Patient triggered for generalized tonic clonic seizure which lasted for 1-2 minutes.
Given concern for head bleed, she received CT head which showed no acute intracranial bleed preliminarily.
She was also loaded with phenytoin 1000 mg. CXR showed a widened mediastinum, because there was no prior CXR to compare to, the ED performed CTA neck/chest which showed no arterial dissection or major occlusions.
It was noted to have some diffuse subcutaneous emphysema, which may have been a result of the difficult intubation.
An LP was performed given acute mental status change to rule out meningitis which did not show any evidence of meningitis.

Evidence of small vessel ischemic disease as described above.

No prior examinations available for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old female with multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation not on coumadin, frequent falls, seizure disorder, chronic kidney disease who presents from rehab s/p fall and with altered mental status.
Altered mental status post fall: Likely due to seizures that led to her fall and perhaps was post-ictal morning of the fall.
Patient also had frequent falls noted and has been transitioned to a nursing home since her last admission to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Month (only) **] [**2162**].

No evidence of ventricular arrythmias on her pacer per EP, only a few episodes of atrial fibrillation.
No evidence of meningitis on LP.
Head and neck CT negative for acute intracranial bleed or aortic dissection.
She was intubated in the setting of her altered mental status.
No MRI done as she had a pacemaker.
Oxygenating well with no evidence of pneumonia or aspiration in the ED.
Patient was a very difficult intubation and has signs of subcutaneous emphysema on CXR.
