Admission Date:  [**2195-5-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2195-5-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2129-3-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiac Surgery  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chief complaint was vague upper chest pain with positive stress test.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 35119**] is a 66-year-old male with a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, portal vein thrombosis, with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid disease, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presents following cardiac catheterization suggesting the need for revascularization.
He had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in [**2194-4-15**].
During that time, he was also found to have 50% stenosis of the left main which was not hemodynamically significant by wire transduction, mild diffuse disease of the left anterior descending artery, and 40% stenosis at the ostium of the left circumflex with an 80% middle circumflex lesion.
Since that time, he has been relatively asymptomatic; however, he had a positive stress test in [**2195-4-15**] in which he had anterolateral electrocardiogram changes and reversible ischemia involving the inferior wall, anterolateral wall, and apex on nuclear imaging and was referred for catheterization.
Coronary artery disease (as described above) with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2194-6-15**] with right coronary artery stent and stent placement in [**2194-7-16**] to the middle and distal circumflex artery.
Adult-onset diabetes mellitus.
A 3.7-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.3.
A nonfunctioning right kidney secondary to a ureteral pelvic obstruction.
Peripheral vascular disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
External carotid artery.
That evening in the Intensive Care Unit, he was extubated without incident.
He did have paroxysmal round of atrial fibrillation that always lasted less than one minute and broke spontaneously.
The frequency of these incidents markedly diminished; although, he did still have occasional ones on postoperative days three and four.
However, by this time, he did become mildly bradycardic, and his amiodarone dose was decreased.
By the fifth postoperative day he was eating, ambulating, and voiding, and walking independently in the hallway, and ascending a flight of stairs without any difficulty.
He may need to have some of his other antihypertensive agents started in the more immediate postoperative period.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.
Rapid atrial fibrillation; spontaneously converted.
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease.
