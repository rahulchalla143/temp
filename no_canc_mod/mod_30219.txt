no LOC, no head trauma.
No antecedent CP/SOB/PALP/LH/N/V/diaphoresis.
Neighbors brought him inside, ~1hr later, pt started c/o mid-back and central chest pain with some radiation to both shoulders, dull, no sob/n/v/diaphoresis, starting ~7PM, at 930pm pain persisted, pt called EMS.
no pain with inspiration, no pain with exertion (though pt not moving much).
EMS initial VS= BP 126/80 99%RA, EKG per report, sinus arrythmia, nonspecific ST changes, poor r-wave progression.
given nitro with resolution of CP prior to arrival at OSH ~1030 (unclear if before or after nitro).
[**Name8 (MD) **] RN pt denied CP, though reported intermittent pain to cardiologist.
With regard to cardiac review of systems, pt denies any h/o regular angina or chest pain with exertion.
His bilateral ankle edema is chronic and unchanged of late, with chronic venous stasis changes.
He denies PND/orthopnea, but notes an episode of syncope prior to his most recent hospilazation, though it is unclear if he truly lost consciousness.
He denies any preceding cp/sob/palpitation/n/v/diaphoresis, and states he slipped getting out of the tub.
ROS: +cough, non-productive, +DOE, claudication - after walking 20-30 feet, bilateral calf pain, improves within 10-15min, no rest pain, but + "numbness" bilateral feet with "pins and needles" which improves with walking.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock pain.
Past Medical History: - CKD (bl creatinine 1.6 - 1.8, stable over the past 10 years) - h/o DVT on coumadin (date=6-10y ago) with low protein C - morbid obesity s/p gastic bypass [**2088**] - h/o b knee pain [**12-23**] OA - scheduled for R knee replacement [**2124-12-1**] - spinal stenosis - h/o falls x 1/month x 1 yr [**12-23**] "balance" - h/o hypokalemia - s/p appendectomy as child.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
no m/r Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
midline vertical scar RLQ (appy), epigastric horizontal well healed scar.
no palpable aorta, no renal bruit.
No femoral bruits.
2+ B LE EDEMA to knee.
STUDIES: [**2124-11-15**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior, septal and anterior walls, and apex.
No defininte left ventricular thrombus is seen, but views of the apex are suboptimal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD (mid-LAD and PDA lesions).
decreased S wave amplitude in V1-2.
mild LVH.
Impression: Technically liited study [**12-23**] pt's COPD and obesity.
no cp, no diagnostic ECG chagnes, no arrythmias.
inferior wall defect on rest and [**Last Name (un) **], most liekly [**12-23**] diaphragmatic attenuation.
no definitive evidence of ischemia or prior infract.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 M h/o CKD, PVD, morbid obesity, transferred from OSH after presenting with CP s/p fall, with positive CE.
# Chest pain - initial differential included ACS, PE, dissection, or mechanical pain [**12-23**] fall.
Given cardiac risk factors, +enzymes, and TTE with new wall motion abnormality on TTE, felt ACS more likely, pt hydrated with 1L IVF bolus, bicarb, and mucomyst.
Left heart catheterization revealed clean coronaries on [**11-17**], EF=20%, with severe HK and AK apically more suggestive of ?takasubo's [**12-23**] pain from fall.
# CAD/Ischemia: no frank h/o CAD, TTE [**11-16**] c/w multivessel CAD, however clean coronaries on cath.
# Pump: pt grossly euvolemic currently, EF > 55% on TTE and PMIBI [**2124-11-8**] discharge, now with EF 20% on LV gram, severe HK and AK.
Transitioned from heparin to coumadin for akinetic wall segments as well as history of deep vein thrombosis.
# HTN: normotensive currently.
# PVD - dopplerable pulses bilaterally, and palpable on R LE.
unclear if LE pain is clearly claudication or more neuropathy, esp given h/o DM, and B12 injections.
# CKD - baseline 1.6-1.8 per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 46296**] unclear no known HTN or DM.
A1c <6, no obvious HTN, SPEP and UPEP negative.
rhabdo - pt on ground for ?1hr, CKs trending down (peak 1100), with renal failure.
# knee pain - likely OA [**12-23**] weight, with recent meniscal tear.
# FEN: - cardiac diet for now, npo p mn for cath [**11-17**].
# Prophylaxis: - heparin gtt -> will transition back to coumadin.
- bowel regimen.
# DISPO - needed home services, currently lives alone, PT consult cleared to home, set up home VNA, arranged for INR check.
