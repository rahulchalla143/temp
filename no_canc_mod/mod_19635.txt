DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]    RADIOLOGY  Final Report  MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-9-3**] 10:13 AM  MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  Reason: r/o dissection Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 59 year old man with SDH, SAH s/p mechanical fall, Basillar skull fx extending to jugular foramen REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o dissection ROUTINE MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT GADOLINIUM.
HISTORY: Assess for dissection.
Again seen are bifrontal and left temporal hemorrhagic contusions with significant surrounding edema and mass effect.
There is a mild amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage diffusely.
A small sliver of subdural hemorrhage is also seen, without substantial change from the prior examination.
There is a minimal amount of intraventricular blood.
Evaluation of the brain MRA demonstrates no hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm.
Evaluation of the neck MRA demonstrates no evidence for dissection.
IMPRESSION:  Multiple supra and tentorial hemorrhagic contusions, mild subarachnoid hemorrhage and a tiny extra-axial hemorrhages as described.
There is no evidence for dissection.
Borderline first degree A-V delay.
Left atrial abnormality.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 59 year old man with mechanical fall and periorbital ecchymosis L eye w/o visual changes.
No C spine ttp or HA.
HISTORY: Fall with periorbital ecchymosis around the left eye without visual changes.
There is loss of consciousness.
No intravenous contrast was administered.
FINDINGS: There is a large subgaleal hematoma posteriorly extending to the vertex.
There is a nondisplaced occipital fracture, right of midline extending from near the lambdoid suture caudally and along the right occiput into the region of the hypoglossal canal and posterior edge of the jugular foramen, reference series 3, image #7.
A Lobulated soft tissue mass is identified within the left sphenoid sinus likely a mucous retention cyst versus a polyp.
There is mucosal thickening within the left maxillary antrum as well.
No air fluid levels are identified.
Minimal fluid is identified posteriorly in the left mastoid air cells.
Intracranially, there are extensive hemorrhagic contusions along the basal frontal lobes bilaterally, left worse than right.
There is subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly layering over the frontal lobes and extending over the left parietal convexity and in scattered foci elsewhere.
Small punctate hemorrhagic focus is also present in the left parietal lobe which is likely contusion as well.
A small extra-axial hematoma is evident at the right frontal temporal region, likely subdural.
There is likely a continuation of this hematoma anteriorly over the right frontal lobe.
A small left frontal subdural hematoma is likely present as well.
There is subdural hematoma, particularly along the right frontal temporal convexity and possibly anterior to the left frontal lobe as well.
These collections are extremely small, and result in no significant mass effect.
No clear involvement of the carotid canal or occipital condyle is seen.
Scalp hematoma as above.
Left preseptal periorbital soft tissue swelling.

On initial eval his GCS was 15 then shortly after 14,  later that night it dropped to 11 and there was question of whether or not he would require intubation for some periods of apnea and altered resp pattern.
A stat head CT was done which showed blossoming of bifrontal contusions.
On initial CT he was noted to have an occipital fracture that extended to the jugular foramen on the right.
Blood cultures are still pending but the fever is no longer.
He was seen by urology and no specific recommendations or follow was given or necessary.
