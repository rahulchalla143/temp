Blindness of the right eye.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

No wheezes or rhonchi.
The superior sternal aspect was mildly erythematous and an opened area at the inferior two inches with purulent drainage.
The wound was cultured.
Electrophysiology consulted and recommended aggressive antibiotic treatment for his sternal site to avoid implantable cardioverter-defibrillator infection.
Social Work, Case Management, Psychiatry Service, Cardiology Service, and the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service all advised against this and felt that he would be better served being discharged to a rehabilitation facility at least for a period of time to insure proper resolution of this episode.
