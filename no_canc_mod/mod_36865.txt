Admission Date: [**2136-6-30**]        Discharge Date: [**2108-4-9**]   Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old Spanish speaking male with a history of hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, obstructive/restrictive lung disease and primary biliary cirrhosis who was in his usual state of health until four days prior to admission when he developed progressively worsening edema in his lower extremities and dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to shortness of breath at rest.
The patient denies any recurrent or current chest pain and pleuritic chest pain.
He had a stress test in [**2134-5-10**], consistent with average exercise tolerance and his last echocardiogram was in [**2134-2-9**], which showed an ejection fraction over 55 percent.
The patient reports that he is now unable to climb more than one to two stairs without becoming short of breath and that he sleeps on a large pillow at night although he denies that his dyspnea is positional.
In addition, the patient reports milder symptoms of shortness of breath since being seen in the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**] in [**2136-2-9**], when he was diagnosed with a pneumonia/upper respiratory infection.
The patient reports that he has not experienced lower extremity swelling in the past.
In addition to these symptoms, the patient reports an unintentional weight loss of 20 pounds in the last year and five pounds in the last month in addition to generalized fatigue.
The patient denies recent fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, nausea, vomiting.
diarrhea and proximal/distal muscle weakness.
A bedside ultrasound was consistent with pericardial effusion.
A bedside echocardiogram was performed and consistent with moderate pericardial effusion, left atrial compression, right ventricular flap but no compression, normal flow and ejection fraction with no abnormalities in the left ventricular wall thickness or motion.
Anemia, baseline hematocrit around 30.0 with MCV around 80, diagnosed as iron deficiency anemia with a ferritin of 6.3 in [**2136-5-10**].
Obstructive/restrictive lung disease diagnosed by recent pulmonary function tests.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Last stress test in [**2134-5-10**], revealed average functional exercise tolerance without anginal symptoms.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, he is awake, alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.
There is no rhinorrhea or frontal or maxillary sinus tenderness.
The neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy, no masses or thyromegaly, jugular venous pressure is estimated at ten centimeters.
Lungs - The patient has bibasilar inspiratory crackles without wheezing.
There are mild rales diffusely, no dullness to percussion, no egophony, good respiratory effort.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, II/VI holosystolic murmur at the inferior sternal border, no gallops or rubs.
No carotid bruits.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, mildly distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding.
There is evidence of hepatomegaly.
The patient has two plus pitting edema in the lower extremities bilaterally extending up to his knees.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Shortness of breath - The patient was admitted with progressive shortness of breath and bilateral lower extremity edema and found to have an elevated jugular venous pressure on examination.
A bedside ultrasound in the Emergency Department was consistent with pericardial effusion and a bedside echocardiogram revealed left atrial compression and a moderate pericardial effusion.
Pericardial access was obtained on the first attempt of the xiphoid with yellowish serosanguinous fluid.
An echocardiogram after 300cc of fluid removed showed a smaller pericardial effusion and ultimately 600cc of bloody serosanguinous fluid that appeared yellow in the tubing was eventually removed with improvement in pericardial and right atrial pressures.
Given continuous output from the pericardial drain, cardiac surgery team was contact[**Name (NI) **] and performed a pericardial window on [**2136-7-6**].
Studies on the pericardial fluid were negative for infection and cytology.
The etiology of the patient's pericardial effusion at this point is considered idiopathic.
Primary biliary cirrhosis - The patient is noted to have a history of primary biliary cirrhosis and was asymptomatic with stable liver function tests and coagulation studies throughout his hospitalization.
The patient also has a history of grade I varices and esophagitis/gastritis and was continued on proton pump inhibitor .
Anemia - The patient was admitted with a history of iron deficiency anemia.
Hypertension - The patient was noted to be hemodynamically stable and normotensive throughout his admission.
Pulmonary - The patient was admitted with a history of obstructive/restrictive lung disease by recent pulmonary function tests.
The etiology of his shortness of breath as discussed previously was considered likely secondary to his pericardial effusion.
After pericardiocentesis and pericardial window placement, the patient's shortness of breath improved throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
for shortness of breath.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy - The patient was asymptomatic throughout his hospitalization and he continued on his outpatient dose of Terazosin.
