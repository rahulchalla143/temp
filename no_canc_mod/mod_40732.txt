Left ICA less than 40% stenosis .
No evidence of aortic aneurysm.
No ascending aortic calcifications with calcifications seen only at the level of the aortic valve.
Extensive calcifications of the aortic valve itself consistent with known aortic valve stenosis.
Right lower lobe 6 mm spiculated nodule that should be reassessed in three months for assessment of stability to exclude the possibility of neoplastic growth.
Additional pulmonary nodules mentioned in the body of the report can be reassessed at the same time.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

A carotid duplex ultrasound was obtained which showed less then a 40% bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis.
A chest CT scan was performed which showed no significant aortic calcifications but did note a right lower lobe 6 mm spiculated nodule that should be reassessed in three months for assessment of stability to exclude the possibility of neoplastic growth.
Labs showed that he had elevated liver function studies.
On [**2141-5-12**], Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels and replacement of his aortic valve with a tissue valve.
He was noted to have some confusion, hallucinations and somnolence.
The stroke service was consulted who suspected a metabolic or possible infectious etiology to his confusion- no acute infection was detected.
All narcotics were discontinued and his pain was managed with Tylenol only.
Mild confusion noted again on POD#4 and Ultram was discontinued.. Confusion improved.
POD#5 he went into rapid a-fib  and remained in it for several hours, was started on Amio and returned to SR for 24 hours prior to discharge.
He was noted to have some serosanguinous drainage from his mid sternal pole.
He was sent home on no antibiotics and will return for a wound check on [**5-23**].
