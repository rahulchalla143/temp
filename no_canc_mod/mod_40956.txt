This study neither confirms nor excludes the possibility of non-radiopaque foreign body in the esophagus and if clinically warranted, further correlation with CT or barium swallowing (upper GI study) should be considered.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
EGD: Impression: Food in the lower third of the esophagus (foreign body removal) Erythema and congestion in the lower third of the esophagus Erythema and congestion in the whole examined stomach No esophageal stenosis or stricture Diverticulum in the upper third of the esophagus Otherwise normal EGD to stomach body Recommendations: The findings account for the symptoms, and the residual food bolus in the esophagus is known to be non-obstructing.
No esophageal stenosis or stricture noted, so symptoms are likely due to an esophageal dysmotility issue.
Brief Hospital Course: 66F with HTN, asthma, recurrent food impactions requiring endoscopy now presenting with likely food impaction.
Esophageal food impaction: Pt has h/o recurrent food impactions requiring endoscopy although none in our system.
Differential diagnosis of recurrent food impaction includes mechnical obstruction such as stricture or ring or eosinophilic esophagitis.
