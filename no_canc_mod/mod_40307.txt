Admission Date:  [**2192-8-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-9-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2161-11-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: unresponsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2192-8-14**]: Right-sided hemicraniectomy for decompression, evacuation of hematoma, repair of laceration, durotomy, duraplasty.
Neurosurgery was consulted for poor GCS and head injury.
Left pupil 4 and sluggish Vomiting and airway.
No stepoffs Chest: Bilateral breath sounds, no step-offs or crepitus Cardiovascular: Bradycardic.
Regular Abdominal: Soft GU/Flank: No step-offs Extr/Back: No extremity injury Neuro: Patient moans to pain.
No purposeful movement.
Multi-compartmental intracranial hemorrhage, with 11 mm right cerebral subdural hematoma, and right inferior frontal hemorrhagic contusions with adjacent subarachnoid blood.
Significant intracranial mass effect, with 5-mm leftward midline shift and diffuse sulcal effacement, cisternal effacement, and fullness of the foramen magnum suggesting downward brain herniation secondary to diffuse brain edema.
Complex left temporal bone fracture, extending to the skull base, crossing the left carotid canal.
Right subdural hematoma and right frontal hemorrhagic contusions with complex left temporal bone fracture are redemonstrated.
There is no CT evidence of stenosis, occlusion or dissection of the carotid arteries or the vertebral arteries.
An MR is, however, more sensitive to rule out arterial dissection.
A possible left ICA bifurcation aneurysm is seen; however, artifact due to concurrent venous filling is not entirely excluded.
Post-surgical changes from evacuation of a right-sided subdural hematoma.
Comminuted fracture of the left parieto-occipital skull, and the left temporal bone, involving the left mastoid air cells; better-characterized previously.
New developing left parieto-occipital extra-axial, likely epidural hematoma subjacent to the skull fracture.
Bifrontal linear hyperdensities suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Left lower lobe consolidation, with associated opacification of the left lower lobe bronchus, compatible with aspiration.
Left 1st and right 2-4th non-displaced posterior rib fractures, with associated small left apical pneumothorax.
No evidence of hemothorax.
Small amount of hyperdense free fluid in the pelvis, which may reflect an occult mesenteric or bowel injury not apparent on this study.
1.6 cm hyperdensity within the mid esophagus, adjacent to the patient's nasogastric tube, which may reflect a swallowed tooth.
Clinical correlation is advised, as this may also represent a swallowed foreign body.
Right subdural hematoma and right frontal hemorrhagic contusions with complex left temporal bone fracture are redemonstrated.
There is no CT evidence of stenosis, occlusion or dissection of the carotid arteries or the vertebral arteries.
An MR is, however, more sensitive to rule out arterial dissection.
A possible left ICA bifurcation aneurysm is seen; however, artifact due to concurrent venous filling is not entirely excluded.
Post-surgical changes from evacuation of a right-sided subdural hematoma.
Comminuted fracture of the left parieto-occipital skull, and the left temporal bone, involving the left mastoid air cells; better-characterized previously.
New developing left parieto-occipital extra-axial, likely epidural hematoma subjacent to the skull fracture.
Bifrontal linear hyperdensities suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage  [**2192-8-15**] CT head 10am 1.
Post-surgical changes from recent extensive right craniectomy.
Reappearance of the suprasellar and quadrigeminal plate cisterns, suggestive of improving edema; the degree of cerebellar tonsillar herniation appears unchanged.
Small left parieto-occipital epidural hematoma, unchanged, with overlying non-displaced fracture.
Bifrontal superficial linear hyperdensities, also unchanged and suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, diffuse axonal injury or both  [**2192-8-15**] MRI c-spine Unremarkable MRI of the cervical spine.
No change in edema or degree of cerebellar tonsillar herniation.
Multiple nondisplaced fractures as described above, unchanged.
No new hemorrhage.
Post-surgical changes from recent right craniectomy and right temporal lobectomy.
[**2192-8-19**] MRI neck New edema in the posterior paravertebral soft tissues of the upper cervical spine compared to [**2192-8-15**], which is of uncertain etiology, but may sometimes be seen secondary to prolonged supine positioning.
[**2192-8-24**] Abdomen No evidence of ingested foreign body within the abdomen  [**8-27**] Gtube check  Large pneumoperitoneum with tip of PEG tube within lumen of the  stomach.
No evidence of contrast leak from the stomach.
CT head [**2192-8-30**] Rim enhancing fluid collections seen within the right temporal fossa, right frontoparietal subcutaneous tissue and right frontal lobe, which is concerning for abscess formation.
Massive pneumoperitoneum and mixed density free fluid as well as findings consistent with peritonitis throughout the abdomen.
The site of the perforation cannot be determined with certainty, though the majority of extravasated oral contrast is located in the left upper quadrant and a leak from the stomach seems most likely.
Alternative considerations would include the colon in the right lower quadrant.
Diffuse bowel edema, small bowel distention with a transition point in the right lower quadrant, findings that are concerning for bowel ischemia and possibly superimposed right lower quadrant small-bowel obstruction.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
[**2192-8-30**] ECG Sinus tachycardia versus atrial tachycardia at the rate of 150 beats per minute.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-8-16**] the morphology of the P waves is distinct and suggests an ectopic focus of the probable atrial tachycardia.
Clinical correlation is suggested  [**2192-9-1**] MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2221**] somewhat limited by difficulties with patient positioning and motion, as well as the extensive post-surgical changes with abundant residual blood products, 1.
The right-sided extra-axial and scalp fluid collections demonstrate "simple" fluid with only thin and discontinuous rim enhancement more suggestive of post-surgical seromas.
However, there is material demonstrating slow diffusion, apparently sedimenting within the dependent posterior component of the right parafalcine subdural collection, and purulent material related to pyogenic superinfection is a consideration.
Extensive fluid-opacification of the mastoid air cells with layering fluid within the right sphenoid air cell; while this finding is commonly seen in intubated patients with protracted supine positioning, it should be correlated clinically.
Decreased posterior paraspinal soft tissue edema without evidence for ligamentous injury.
Fluid within the mastoid air cells  [**2192-9-3**] LENS No lower extremity DVT.
Significantly decreased (compared to [**8-30**]), but residual mild to moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis and lower quadrants with peritoneal enhancement, consistent with peritonitis (peritonitis was also seen on [**2192-8-30**]).
The fluid seems to be interconnecting, but follow-up exam is recommended to monitor for loculation and abscess formation.
Moderate left inferior and anterior pneumothorax which has increased in size since [**9-8**].
Small posteromedial hydropneumothorax with some septations and loculation also increased since [**2192-9-8**].
Left lower lobe consolidation, stable.
Slight interval healing of bilateral upper rib fractures.
[**2192-9-17**] portable abdomen Limited study, no evidence of obstruction.
Since the prior study, patient is now status post cranioplasty with a small extra-axial collection with a dense linear-appearing area withing in which may be related to duraplasty but close followup to exclude hemorrhage is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: Admission synopsis: 30F ped struck, mass lesion from multi-focal ICH s/p R craniectomy, PEG for enteral access c/b leak s/p ex-lap, JT placement, L sc CVL c/b ptx requiring CT, now resolved convalescing well with improving mental status, tolerating tube feeds, and without CT.  Trauma SICU Course: The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] following polytrauma as a pedestrian struck with , primary survey notable for impending airway compromise and asymmetric fixed pupillary exam.
She was subsequently intubated and underwent CT scan following completion of primary and secondary survey revealing intracranial hemorrhage with signs of midline shift and herniation.
Pt was emergently brought to the operating theater for R craniectomy and subsequently admitted to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment and management of her traumatic brain injury.
Injuries: - Complex L temporal bone fracture - Multi-compartment ICH (R SDH, R frontal contusions, SAH, +midline shift, +herniation) - R ptx  Neuro: Mass effect from multifocal ICH s/p R craniectomy.
The patient received seizure prophylaxis without evidence of seizure activity during ICU course.
R craniectomy site oversewn with concern for superficial separation without CSF leak or evidence of frank dehiscence.
No hemodynamic instability Pressors: (-EKG/CE-) (-ECHO-)  Pulmonary: The patient arrived to the ICU with an oxygen saturation of (-) and an ABG demonstrating (-).
CXR on post-operative day (-) demonstrated resolution of pneumothorax and chest tube was placed to wall suction.
Repeat CXR demonstrated no reaccumulation of pneumothorax and chest tube was removed with final CXR demonstrating fully re-expanded lung (-).
(-TPN-)  PICC line established with proper position confirmed and was started on TPN for (-).
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound care:  Incisional wounds were regularly monitored for signs of infection of which there were none.
(-Vac-) Wound was opened bedside on post-operative day (-) and drained of seroma fluid.
The wound was probed and no evidence of fascia defect was demonstrated.
However, she had low-grade temperatures in the 100s but on [**8-30**] triggered for a temp of 103.5 for which cultures were sent.
Her tachycardia worsened to the 170s and she was hypertensive, febrile to 104.
A CT scan was done, which showed intraperitoneal fluid collection.
She was transferred to the ICU and went to the OR on [**8-31**] for ex-lap, which found a leak around the PEG site with TFs in the abdomen.
Was kept intubated given concern for evolving sepsis.
Her scalp incision was noticed to have dehisced slightly and neurosurgery saw the patient and closed her incision at bedside.
Given concern for possible brain abscess MRI was repeated [**9-1**] and likelihood of abscess based on this was considered low.
MRI c-spine obtained [**9-4**] shown to be negative for ligamentous injury and c-collar removed.
CV: Fluid resuscitation continued postop with combination crystalloid/colloid fluids.
Beta blockage [**9-4**] for persistent sinus tach.
P: In the ICU, an attempt was made to place a L subclavian CVL but was complicated by a L PTX.
Chest tube re-positioned [**9-1**] for persistent PTX.
GI/GU: Patient was NPO postop and resuscitation was carried out with crystalloid/colloid fluids.
Patient had indwelling foley postop.
ID: ID consulted given spillage of TFs into abdomen and significant peritoneal contamination related to gastric perforation.
Her chest tube was put to water seal without leak and was pulled on [**9-7**].
Postop head CT demonstrated no new hemorrhage.
She remained very restless in the first few days after surgery and she was unable to sleep.
Careful titration of pain medications as well as PRN ativan and trazadone for sleeping helped to improve her symptoms of restlessness and insomnia and by POD4 the patient was less restless and her family noted that she had returned to her pre-cranioplasty sleep patterns.
On [**9-25**] she received 2 doses of Geodon IM for her agitation and then had an episode of emesis likely related to the Geodon administration.
She was sent with instructions for followup with both neurosurgery for postoperative evalaution and with plastic surgery for evalaution of her incision and removal of her sutures.
