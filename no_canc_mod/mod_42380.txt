Admission Date:  [**2198-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-5-10**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Beta-Blockers (Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agts)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pericardiocentesis and drain placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 38807**] is a [**Age over 90 **] F with a distant PMH of breast cancer who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2198-5-7**] from [**Hospital6 3872**] where she had presented from her rehab with progressive dyspnea x 2 weeks.
At MWH, she was seen by pulmonary for a large left sided pleural effusion found on chest radiograph.
CT scan of the chest showed large left pleural effusion and a moderate to large right pleural effusion w/o lymphadenopathy.
There were diffuse interstital abnormalities of the left lung concerning for lymphangitic spread of tumor.
She underwent a thoracentesis which showed a pH 7.4, LDH 248, c/w exudative effusion, with gram stain negative and NGTD on culture and pending cytology.
A TTE showed a moderate sized paricardial effusion with no signs of tamponade.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent repeat transthoracic echo on [**5-8**] which revealed preserved EF of 55% but also showed a pericardial effusion with sustained RA collapse and right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with cardiac tamponade.
Prior to her admission, she denied fevers, chills, or any viral syndrome, but endorsed nausea and constipation for several months.
She denies chest pain.
She reports increased thirst and some increased "thickness" of her legs since her pelvic fracture.
Past Medical History: # Breast Cancer: # s/p lumpectomy of left breast, XRT and tamoxifen # s/p lumpectomy of right breast # Afib: diagnosed [**4-5**], not on anticoagulation # s/p Pelvic fracture # frequent UTIs # hypertension # h/o cholecystitis # osteoporosis  Social History: Prior to pelvic fracture, pt had been living independently in her home in [**Location (un) 745**].
No history of lung cancer.
Physical Exam: On admission -  VITAL SIGNS: afebrile 119/54 86 20 95-98% 3L NC GENERAL: elderly woman, no acute distress, c/o mild chest pain.
+ mild pallor.
No scleral icterus.
No murmurs appreciated.
LUNGS: Decreased air movement overall, with diminished breath sounds at bases bilaterally.
No appreciable consolidation/dullness to percussion.
No HSM appreciated.
GROIN: R groin femoral arterial and venous sheaths removed, no oozing or hematoma noted.
Pericardial Fluid Cytology - NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2198-5-9**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Significant aortic regurgitation is present, but cannot be quantified.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed from post tap) of [**2198-5-8**], no change.
Emergent pericardiocentesis for pericardial tamponade with removal of 380 cc of bloody fluids.
Persistent elevation of pericardial pressure indicative of constrictive effusive etiology.
============ Radiology ============ Chest X ray [**5-10**]  Bilateral pleural effusions have not significantly changed in the interim and the slightly better aeration of the right lung base may be due to redistribution of the fluid.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with a history of breast cancer who is transferred to the CCU after TTE revealed pericardial effusion cuasing tamponade physiology, s/p pericardiocentesis and drain placement.
# Pericardial effusion with tamponade - Had pericardiocentesis and drain placement [**5-8**] with subsequent removal the following day.
Given persistently elevated pericardial pressures after drainage, this is likely constrictive disease.
Etiology thought to be likely malignant given history of BrCA and coincident pleural effusions with CT chest showing suspicion of lymphangitic spread of CA, but cytology was negative.
Repeat TTE showed no signs of tamponade.
Pleural effusions - these were most suspicious for malignancy given that OSH CT scan also with interstial process of the left lung.
Has large right pleural effusion that has not been tapped.
There was no evidence of empyema or parapneumonic effusion.
No current evidence of pneumonia.
Not currently anticoagulated given fall risk and possible procedures.
