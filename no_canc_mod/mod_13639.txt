This [**Known lastname **] very well be an incidental finding representing a developmental venous anomaly.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old male who was found unresponsive at home, taken to OH where he had a GTC and was found to have a right parieto-occipital hemorrhage.
It is unclear whether he fell due to a seizure/bleed or whether the bleed was traumatic from the fall itself.
Neuro:  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage-area of surrounding edema on CT concerning for underlying mass, infarct or AVM.
He underwent a MRI with gado and MRA which showed prominance of the veins near the area of hemorrhage-there was no enhancing mass visualized.
Repeat head CT showed no change in hemorrhage.
CTA was done to look for AVM and showed an area of abnormality anterior to the right parietal hemorrage (unrelated to it) which was thought to represent an AVM or venous malformation.
Cerebral angiogram was done to clarify this question and showed no evidence for AVM, but suggested an underlying venous anomaly in the internal cerebral veins.
CV:  EKG shows no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmia -Rule out MI with serial CE -telemetry -Keep SBP 120-150  3.
If you have any further seziures, headache, vision changes, new numbness, weakness, incoordination or dizziness-please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7994**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**] or come directly to the emergency room.
