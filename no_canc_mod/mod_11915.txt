CT of the head was notable for a dense left MCA.
Due to bed avialability issues at [**Hospital1 2025**], the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for additional care.
According to his daughter, he called his PCP yesterday complaining of tightness in his throat, concerning for angina.
Otherwise, he had no recent illnesses.
At present the patient denies headache, vision loss, chest pain.
He has no abdominal pain.
- Diastolic CHF- ECHO [**5-/2197**] with EF 65% - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Married, retired.
Family History: Not available   Physical Exam: Initial Exam:  BP 167/90 HR 76 RR 18 O2%  97% 2L General: Awake Head and Neck: no cranial abnormalities, no scleral icterus noted, mmm with copious oral secretions.
No carotid bruits appreciated.
Small hematoma on the right lower lip.
Pulmonary: Clear anteriorly Cardiac: irregular rhythm with frequent PVCs on tele.
Distand heart sounds, no murmurs appreciated.
Abdomen: normoactive bowel sounds, non-tender Extremities: well perfused Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Neurologic: Awake, follows midline and appendicular commands but there is some left right confusion which can be overcome with re-prompting.
Right facial droop.
No pronator drift.
-Sensory: Absent sensation to pinprick and touch on the right hemibody.
Exam at discharge: Much improved speech - near fluent but halting and severely dysarthric.
R hand weakness but antigravity with wrist extension and finger flexion.
Pertinent Results:     13.4 88 10.0>---<245     40.3 N:86.0 L:11.9 M:1.7 E:0.2 Bas:0.2 PT: 13.7  PTT: 21.3  INR: 1.2  135  100  17  AGap=18 -------------<115 4.0  21  0.8  CK: 96  MB: 4  Trop-T: <0.01  Ca: 8.4 Mg: 2.0 P: 3.6  Diagnostic Studies:  EKG: Sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay.
Left atrial abnormality.
CXR: Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.
Left base opacity which may represent atelectasis although consolidation cannot be excluded  CT PERFUSION: There is a matched region of increased MTT and decreased rCBV in the left frontal lobe that corresponds to the area of infarction on non-contrast CT. No additional areas of abnormal perfusion are identified.
HEAD CTA: This portion of the study is limited due to suboptimal bolus timing.
There is no evidence of intracranial flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm within limits of this study.
NECK CTA: This portion of the study is limited due to suboptimal bolus timing.
Fairly extensive region of "blooming" susceptibility artifact involving much of the infarcted territory, representing hemorrhagic transformation, new since the CTA performed the preceding day.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage elsewhere.
Small focus of slow diffusion at the right frontovertex, which may be either embolic or, possibly, ACA/MCA watershed infarction.
Scattered FLAIR-hypointensities in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter, likely the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
TTE: No PFO or ASD seen.
Mild pulmonary hypertension   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 39440**] initially presented to OSH with right arm weakness and speech difficulties (he was noted to be not responding verbally at home).
He was given IV tpa at OSH for L MCA stroke and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
His exam was noted to improve since onset of syptoms, though post-tpa he continued to have a nonfluent aphasia, weakness of the right lower face and hand and right sided sensory loss.
By report, he had a transient episodes of AFib in the ambulance bringing him from [**Hospital1 1474**] to [**Hospital1 18**], but there has been no documentation of this.
There was also hemorrhagic transformation noted of his stroke.
In addition, there was a small focus of slow diffusion at the right frontovertex, which raises the probability of an embolic event as there are b/l infarcts.
He had TTE, which showed no PFO or ASD and normal global biventricular systolic function; there was mild pulmonary hypertension.
Instead, he was kept on ASA 325mg once daily and will get repeat CT head in 2 weeks, with consideration of starting Coumadin at that time if no further hemorrhage.
A urine sample was collected in his next void after blood noted and UA sent; there was no blood in the UA.
Senna Plus 8.6-50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left MCA stroke  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear but with nonfluent aphasia with moderate/severe dysarthria Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a stroke; the stroke affected your speech and also resulted in weakness of your right lower face and right wrist/hand.
On your MRI, there was blood noted in the area of the stroke, so blood thining medication was not started at this time.
You will need to get a repeat CT scan of your head in 2 weeks to assess if there is any further blood and then decision will be made at that time to start you on a blood thinner.
