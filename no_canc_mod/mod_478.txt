Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital for firing of your ICD and for fluid overload.
The fluid overload was most likely caused by a worsening of your heart failure, since you had not been taking medications for several weeks.
The heart failure worsening likely was also the cause of arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) that caused your defibrillator to fire.
You should weigh yourself every morning and call your doctor if weight goes up by more than three pounds in one day or five pounds in three days, as this can be a sign of fluid overload.
Decrease Allopurinol because of your kidney function 4.
STart Colace, seanna and miralax to prevent constipation 8.
