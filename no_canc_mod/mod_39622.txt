There is no pneumothorax.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
[**6-20**] CXR IMPRESSION No evidence of pneumonia.
[**6-25**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-20**], there is no interval change or evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Specifically, no pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
Partial opacification of the biliary tree was performed because of clinical suspicion of cholangitis- no evidence of stones or filling defects was seen.
Successful placement of a 7cm x 10Fr stent for biliary drainage- with drainage of clear bile.
No definitive explanation for jaundice found on ERCP, although contrast opacification limited.
Consider evaluation for other causes of jaundice including viral hepatitis.
Repeat ERCP in 4 weeks for stent removal and complete evaluation of biliary tree.
[**6-18**] RUQ US FINDINGS: The liver is diffusely increased in echogenicity, consistent with fatty infiltration of the liver.
No focal hepatic mass is definitely noted.
There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct measuring 4mm.
The gallbladder is mildly distended, without wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
Additionally, there are echogenic foci with dirty posterior shadowing in nondependent portions of the gallbladder is consistent with air within the gallbladder lumen, likely from recent ERCP and sphincterotomy.
The spleen is mildly enlarged measuring 13 cm.
There is no ascites.
Bilateral kidneys are without evidence of hydronephrosis.
Gallbladder sludge without acute cholecystitis.
There is also evidence of air within the gallbladder lumen, likely from recent ERCP and sphincterotomy.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration of the liver.
More significant liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded based on this study.
[**6-21**] MRCP MR ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is marked diffuse fatty deposition of the liver in addition to more focal areas of almost mass-like fatty deposition surrounding the gallbladder fossa (3A:9, 12).
There is a heterogeneous enhancement pattern to the liver suggesting diffuse liver disease beyond fatty deposition.
This appearance could be seen with chronic fibrosis, although there are no other findings on this study to suggest cirrhosis.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation.
While there is mild enhancement of the bile duct wall at the level of the stent, above the level of the stent, the bile ducts do not demonstrate any abnormal enhancement to suggest cholangitis.
There is diffuse gallbladder wall edema which is likely related to the underlying liver process.
There is no hyperenhancement of the gallbladder wall or surrounding liver to suggest acute cholecystitis.
No pancreatic mass is identified.
There is small amount of peripancreatic fluid/edema consistent with patient's diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
There are no fluid collections.
There is a trace amount of perihepatic and perisplenic ascites.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
No evidence of pancreatic mass.
Small amount of peripancreatic fluid/edema is consistent with uncomplicated acute pancreatitis.
Trace perihepatic and perisplenic ascites.
Marked diffuse fatty deposition in the liver.
However, heterogeneous enhancement of the liver suggests diffuse liver disease beyond fatty liver, possibly reflecting hepatitis oor fibrosis, though there is not overt cirrhosis.
Gallbladder wall edema, likely due to underlying liver disease.
Biliary stent in place without intra or extraphepatic biliary dilation.
Mild enhancement of the common bile duct is likely from stent placement.
There is no evidence of abnormal biliary ductal enhancement above the level of the stent to suggest cholangitis.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 year old female with a medical history of hypertension & depression transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] after presenting with 4 days of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and worsening jaundice.
Admitted to the ICU, found to have acute alcoholic pancreatitis and hepatitis.
# Acute Alcoholic Pancreatitis: Pt presented to OSH with symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis.
The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, but initial denied alcohol use within the past 2 years, so gallstone pancreatitis was suspected.
Lipase was initially quite elevated and trended down moderately after aggressive IVF.
Other possible causes for her pancreatitis were explored, including the possibility of abdominal trauma suffered in a single-car accident the patient suffered two weeks before this admission.
When TTG was elevated and patient was confronted with the lack of other explanations for her acute pancreatitis/hepatitis, she admitted to drinking 1.5 bottles of wine/day prior to admission (see below, alcohol abuse).
# Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis: Pt also presented with elevated LFTs and jaundice.
Alcoholic hepatitis was diagnosed when biliary obstruction and viral hepatitis were ruled out.
She had initially been started on antibiotics in the ED, but these were stopped given lack of concern for infection.
Patient provided additional history of recent MVA with 6 g/day tylenol use for 3 days thereafter ([**Date range (1) 24996**]) + intermittent alcohol use.
Hepatology was consulted in the ICU with concern for PSC or other liver parenchymal process, in addition to alcohol and possible tylenol overdose; the patient was transferred to the hepatology service after discharge from the ICU.
Her leukocytosis persisted, LFTs remained elevated and she continued to spike fevers.
These were thought to be [**12-21**] underlying alcoholic hepatitis rather than infection, especially since only 1 bottle of many many blood culture samples was ever positive for bacterial growth, and thus was thought to be a lab contaminant.
She does not have a reported history of liver disease and is not on anticoagulation at home.
Best explained by new diagnosis of acute alcoholic hepatitis.
Patient was hypotensive on admission with SBP 90s despite receiving significant IV fluids at OSH.
Her hypotension was likely related to fluid shifts from acute alcoholic pancreatitis rather than sepsis.
She was restarted on a decreased dose of home metoprolol (25 mg QD) but home lisinopril was held given acute renal injury (below).
This likely represented hypovolemic hyponatremia from her pancreatitis and volume depletion from GI losses and poor PO intake.
The most likely etiology was prerenal from hypotension and fluid shifts in the context of pancreatitis.
# Metabolic Acidosis: Patient had an anion gap acidosis at the OSH.
Acidosis thought to be related to pancreatitis, [**Last Name (un) **], and ketones from alcohol intake/poor nutrition prior to admission.
# Depression: Reports 25-lb weight loss in past 3 weeks secondary to stress.
She is on Lexapro for depression and .
Family meeting was held prior to discharge, to discuss prognosis for alcoholic hepatitis, request that husband remove all alcohol from the home, agree upon a plan for post-discharge detox program, and to re-inforce the absolute importance of abstinence for her survival.
# Recent motor vehicle accident: Large bruise noted on pt's lower back during physical examination in the ICU.
Pt reported history of a single-vehicle car accident on [**6-5**]: she drove over two curbs in trying to avoid other drivers, resulting in two blown tires.
She denies steering wheel impact and did not seek police or medical attention after the accident.
Secondary Diagnoses: Depression Alcohol Abuse Sleep Apnea Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and jaundice.
No gallstones or obstruction was seen.
A stent was placed in the bile duct, to allow free drainage of bile into your intestines, in case there was some mild obstruction not seen on the test.
These were very elevated when you first arrived, but they trended down with IV fluids and time.
You were not having any abdominal pain.
We looked for infection but did not see any signs.
You do have several reasons for increased stress in your life recently.
When you first arrived, we treated you with intravenous antibiotics to fight a possible bacterial infection in your gallbladder.
Later we gave you antibiotics again when we suspected an infection in your blood.
