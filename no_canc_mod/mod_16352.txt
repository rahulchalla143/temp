Admission Date:  [**2117-9-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2117-9-4**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for hypertension who was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.
The patient was in his usual state of health until admission when he noted a coldness and numbness and urinary symptoms.
No fevers or chills.
The patient then presented to his primary care physician's office three days prior to admission complaining of a cough and mild shortness of breath.
He was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 150.
Upon admission to the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be in a near complex tachycardia with a rate in the 140s to 150s; thought to be atrial flutter versus atrial tachycardia.
He had an echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 20% and severe mitral regurgitation.
He cardiac catheterization revealed single-vessel coronary artery disease with 80% stenosis of his proximal left anterior descending artery.
Cardiac catheterization revealed systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
No known coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No family history of coronary artery disease.
The patient was in no acute distress.
The patient had poor dentition.
Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rate and rhythm.
A 1/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the apex.
The abdomen was soft and obese.
There was 1+ lower extremity edema.
Neurologic examination revealed no focal deficits.
There was concern that his recent atrial fibrillation and severe congestive heart failure could be ischemic in origin.
However, his cardiac catheterization showed only 1-vessel disease with an 80% stenosis of his left anterior descending artery.
The patient had no active ischemic symptoms or chest pain during his hospitalization.
Following the cypher stent to his left anterior descending artery, the patient was stable and had no complications with stenting.
(b)  Pump:  The patient was admitted with no prior history of coronary artery disease.
However, an echocardiogram done at an outside hospital revealed severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20%.
The patient was thought to have a new onset dilated cardiomyopathy likely following a viral myocarditis subsequent to his recent viral upper respiratory tract infection.
The patient was started on Coumadin for anticoagulation given his severe ventricular dysfunction.
(c)  Rhythm:  The patient was admitted with the new onset of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter following his new onset dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis.
TRANSAMINITIS ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with mildly elevated liver function tests.
These were thought to be related to his acute viral syndrome and to concomitant congestive heart failure.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with a slightly elevated creatinine which was thought to be acute renal failure due to his dye load following the cardiac catheterization.
PULMONARY ISSUES:   A computed tomography at the outside hospital showed a right upper lobe nodule.
The patient did not have any acute pulmonary issues during this hospitalization.
The patient was briefly on oxygen in the setting of congestive heart failure, but he was quickly weaned to room air which he tolerated well.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was initially nothing by mouth for procedures.
His electrolytes were followed, and he had no significant abnormalities.
Dilated cardiomyopathy.
Viral myocarditis.
Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
