FINDINGS: There is a linear dense foreign body measuring up to 6.6 cm in length beginning in the mid trachea and extending inferiorly to the left mainstem bronchus.
Beginning at the left main bronchus, there is fluid/mucoid material seen with several distended impacted bronchi throughout the left lower lobe.
Additionally, there are ground-glass opacities of the lung parenchyma which are nonspecific.
A ground-glass opacity of the medial basal segment of the right lower lobe is also nonspecific.
There is a tracheostomy.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
No lymphadenopathy identified in the visualized portions of the mediastinum and axilla.
The left mainstem bronchus and distal bronchi appear distended with fluid/mucoid impaction.
Distal ground-glass opacities within the lung are nonspecific and consistent with inflammation or possible infection likely postobstructive in nature.
There is volume loss with shift of the mediastinum to the left and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
There is some patchy opacity in the remaining aerated left upper lung, which is also slightly worse.
The right diaphragm is slightly hyperinflated, with findings raising question of background COPD, but no acute right-sided pulmonary process is identified and there is no right-sided effusion.
Volume loss on the left, with increased opacity in the left lung and with slight increase in opacity of the left lung compared with [**2104-11-8**] at 4:43 a.m. No pneumothorax is detected.
[**11-10**] CXR:FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-9**], there is a slight increasein opacification in the left hemithorax, consistent with increasing effusion.Shift of the mediastinum to the left is consistent with substantial volume loss in the lower lobe and lingula.
[**11-11**] CXR: MPRESSION: Improved aeration of left lung with continued significant volume loss of left lower lobe.
[**11-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Worsening left upper lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia.
Left lower lobe collapse and atelectasis appears stable.
Lab Results on Discharge:  [**2104-11-12**] 06:00AM BLOOD WBC-5.5 RBC-3.45* Hgb-10.6* Hct-31.7* MCV-92 MCH-30.7 MCHC-33.4 RDW-12.6 Plt Ct-301  Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 51 [**Last Name (un) 9232**] with tracheostomy [**2-20**] throat cancer who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for removal of part of a brush that broke off during cleaning of her tracheostomy tube.
She tolerated the procedure well without complications.
She had no fever and no leukocytosis and showed no sign of post-obstructive pneumonia, and was discharged home to f/u with PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 3754**] was an area of haziness on CXR on final day of hospitalization but patient showed no leukocytosis or fever, so she was left to follow-up with PCP.
S/p chemo/radiation for tongue/laryngeal cancer: Speech and swallow evaluated patient and found no swallowing deficits.
She was maintained on a puree diet per her request for comfort given that she is edentulous and does not chew food.
Transitions in Care: Patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] with her outpatient radiation oncologist.
Secondary: History of laryngeal cancer with tracheostomy tube placement   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
