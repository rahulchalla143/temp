Admission Date:  [**2111-2-23**]     Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2067-4-23**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 43 year old Caucasian male with no significant past medical history who presents with worsening shortness of breath.
He awoke with right sided chest congestion and pressure along with cough and shortness of breath.
The patient also notes that he has had a dry cough for approximately one week.
He states he had an episode of bronchitis several months ago and was given antibiotics by his primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] also states there were sick contacts at work and he was recently exposed to a young child who apparently had upper respiratory infection.
He also complains of mild diffuse myalgias and a mild headache.
He denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was given two liters of normal saline for fluid resuscitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hereditary angioedema; the patient has swelling in the arms and legs with stress or trauma.
He denies any history of throat swelling or respiratory involvement.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient is well developed and well nourished in mild respiratory distress.
Neck is supple with no jugular venous distention.
Lungs - The patient has diffuse wheezes bilaterally and decreased breath sounds at the right upper lung.
There is no egophony.
Extremities - There is no edema.
There are no rashes.
Chest x-ray significant for right upper lobe consolidation.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 126 beats per minute with left axis deviation.
Sepsis - The patient was involved in the MUS protocol for sepsis.
In addition to the fluid resuscitation, the patient was started on vasopressors for his hypotension.
Respiratory failure - After approximately one day in the hospital, the patient had increased respiratory distress as well as increased oxygen requirement.
The patient remained intubated for several days while he was being treated for sepsis and pneumonia.
Pneumonia - By chest x-ray, the patient was seen to have a right upper lobe pneumonia.
Following intubation, the patient also had a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.
This was also sent off for culture.
Blood cultures eventually grew out pneumococcus and sensitivities showed that it was pansensitive.
This was continued while in the hospital as the patient showed gradual and continual improvement.
Repeat chest x-ray showed gradual resolution of the right upper lobe consolidation.
By x-ray and CAT scan of the chest, the patient was also seen to have a right lung pleural effusion.
It was likely a parapneumonic effusion.
Cardiovascular - The patient had cardiac enzymes drawn to rule out acute myocardial infarction.
This showed that this troponins were elevated at approximately 0.3.
It is possible that this represented a non Q wave myocardial infarction or was related to sepsis induced cardiomyopathy.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was also done which showed a depressed ejection fraction of 20%.
Given that the patient had no known history of cardiac disease, this likely represented sepsis induced cardiomyopathy.
Anemia - While in the hospital, the patient also developed decreasing hematocrit.
It was not clear if this was due to mild bleeding from the chest tube site or from repeated phlebotomy that the patient was receiving.
Fevers - The patient continued to have low grade fevers despite clinical improvement and respiratory status improvement.
Repeat cultures remained negative and a clear source for these fevers was not yet identified.
