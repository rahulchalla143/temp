Admission Date:  [**2141-10-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2141-10-23**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic renal insufficiency who is admitted for asymptomatic right carotid stenosis now here for stenting.
As an outpatient the patient underwent ultrasound on [**2141-9-22**], which showed a 40 to 60% stenosis and his right carotid artery and a 20 to 40% stenosis in his left carotid artery.
The patient reports no associated symptoms with this and denies any weakness or neurological defects.
He did have a left CEA in [**2131**].
He also reports a previous MRI that showed "old tiny strokes," but otherwise has no neurological history.
At the time of his admission to the Coronary Care Unit the patient denies any concurrent complaints and confirms the above history.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2131**] four vessel disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Peripheral neuropathy.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
History of basal cell carcinoma status post resection.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Physical examination older gentleman in no acute distress, conversant.
2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the apex.
Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft and nontender.
Extremities no edema or cyanosis.
Chest x-ray cardiomegaly, large pericardial fat pad, no acute infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram sinus rhythm at a rate of 68, PR interval .256, right bundle, no acute ST changes.
This was following a carotid duplex in [**Month (only) **], which showed significant occlusion in his right ICA with moderate to severe disease with 40 to 60% stenosis on the right.
Cardiovascular:  Coronary artery disease, the patient with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Additionally the patient had no symptoms of ischemia at admission.
Several days into his hospitalization he did develop acute angina and had minor electrocardiogram changes, which did resolve with nitroglycerin.
Given the patient's new unstable angina and his recent catheterization, which showed poor visualization of his grafts the patient did undergo coronary catheterization.
His left circumflex had a 50% stenosis at the origin, 70% stenosis proximally and 80% stenosis in the portion supplying collaterals to his right coronary artery.
He did have occasional pauses on telemetry, thus his beta blocker was unable to be titrated up.
The patient was briefly on heparin prior to catheterization given his unstable angina.
Pump, the patient admitted with diagnosis of congestive heart failure.
He had no echocardiogram reports on file, but reportedly had an EF of approximately 30%.
The patient had no active symptoms of heart failure throughout the hospitalization.
Valve, the patient with known mitral valve disease who was thought to need a mitral valve repair in the future.
He had no acute symptoms related to his mitral disease.
The patient was to follow up with CT surgery following discharge to formulate plans for mitral valve repair.
He did have brief sinus pauses on telemetry, but related to nodal blockade.
His beta blocker was titrated down and these symptoms resolved.
The patient had no acute symptoms related to this and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the hospitalization.
Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of approximately 2.1.
He did have a mild bump in his creatinine at this admission thought to be due to dye nephropathy.
Right ICA stenosis status post stent placement.
Coronary artery disease status post catheterization with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to his left circumflex.
Urinary tract infection.
Follow up with CT surgery Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on [**11-2**] at 1:30 p.m. with plans for MVR in approximately one month as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2546**] evaluations.
Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in approximately three months with a carotid ultrasound at this point.
