This AM, he still was unable to rouse her and noted urinary incontinence, so he called EMS.
No observed tonic clonic movements or bowel incontinence; no h/o seizure d/o.
He was concerned for overdose given some unidentified, empty pill bottles found near her, h/o overdose 8-9 years ago , and recent multiple stressors including ongoing psych med adjustments, recent cholecystectomy, and strained relationship with parents although.
She developed hypoxemic respiratory failure with ABG 7.525/33.4/46 requiring intubation.
CT torso showed left lung consolidation with volume loss and distal left mainstem bronchus narrowing.
She was given Zosyn and K 40-60 mEq for hypokalemia and transferred here for further evaluation.
Read here of OSH CT chest noted mediastinal shift to the left with left lung atelectasis; hypodense material in the airways, mostly at the left lung base; and pericardial effusion.
Per boyfriend, 1.5 ppd of cigarettes x 25 years, h/o EtOH abuse but none in [**5-11**] years, h/o cocaine 10 years ago; no h/o IVDU.

Confused at times (could not remember what city she lived in).
MODERATE GROWTH.
Left lung collapse with leftward shift of the mediastinal structures.
Hypodense material within the airways of the left lung, mostly within the left lung base which could be aspirated material or mucous impaction.
Ill-defined nodular opacities in the right lower lobe which could indicate small airway disease or aspiration.
Residual dense consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe but increased aeration of the left upper lobe compared to prior study.
Patchy atelectasis in the right upper and lower lobes.
Small pleural effusions which have developed since the prior study bilaterally.
Moderate pericardial effusion which has increased from prior study.
Small amount of free fluid in the gallbladder fossa and in the pelvis.
Comparison to the previous study shows the left lower lobe atelectasis has cleared.
The right lower lobe border is not seen but the lungs are clear with no mass, consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo female with h/o bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to OSH with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
# Respiratory failure: Bronchoscopy on admission without evidence of obstructive lesion.
Left lung collapse thought to be secondary to consolidative pneumonia with copious secretions.
Respiratory cultures grew out pansensitive MSSA, and initial broad coverage with vanc, zosyn, and levofloxacin pared down to zosyn and then to nafcillin.
Multiple bronchs done given persistent copious sputum with gradual improvememt in purulent secretions seen in left lung, pt eventually extubated s complication.
# Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled per PCP records with concern in past that pt may have been abusing medications for weight control.
# Altered mental status: Pt initially responsive only to pain.
This was thought [**1-5**] to untreated hypothyrodism v. polypharmacy v. underlying bipolar disorder v severe infection.
No h/o seizure disorder per OSH records.
Her delirium improved daily.
Hopefully pt will continue to improve back to her baseline, though cannot exclude the possibility of anoxic brain injury [**1-5**] her respiratory status prior to admission.
Pt was occasionally agitated at night.
Agitation was treated initially with haldol but because of her improving mental status and lengthening QT, this was changed to occasional prn ativan 0.5mg which had good effect.
# CHEST PAIN: pt had one short episode of chest pain which resolved c nitroglycerin.
Pt's EKG was found to have 1mm ST depression in V3-5 (most prominent in EKGs from [**2167-6-22**] at 9:30am) and pt was ruled out with three sets of negative enzymes (trop 0.03, 0.02, 0.02).
Pt will follow-up with cardiology as outpt to determine the need for stress testing.
# Ileus: Pt developed large bowel ileus without evidence of small bowel obstruction (perhaps [**1-5**] hypothyroid?).
# Metabolic acidosis: Pt c nonanion gap metabolic acidosis, likely [**1-5**] normal saline.
# Pericardial effusion: TTE showed only small pericardial effusion (appeared moderate on chest CT) with no evidence of tamponade.
Pt did not have elevated pulsus paridoxus.
# FEN/SWALLOW EVAL: Pt initially received tube feeds.
Speech and swallow did a video evaluation which showed some aspiration risk so pt was started on thickened liquids and pureed solids.
# Communication: No HCP.
