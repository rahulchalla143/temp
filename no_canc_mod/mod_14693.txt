He was also noted to become hypotensive with SBPs in the 60s, shortly prior to his transfer to the ED.
He was given 250cc NS bolus x 2 for this and for poor urine output.
He was also noted to have tremulous extremities.
The patient was intubated for progressive respiratory distress.
His serum K was noted to be elevated and he was treated with Ca, insulin, glucose and bicarb.
The patient's most recent admission was for evaluation of hypotension in the setting of receiving SL NTG despite his known AS.
His hospital course was complicated by hematuria, a UTI, and a new diagnosis of frequent aspiration.
Just prior to that [**Hospital1 18**] admission, he had been hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] medical center for an NSTEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient is somnolent and unresponsive to painful stimuli.

SKIN: Mild stasis dermatitis changes.
No other ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: ([**2138-7-18**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the posterior wall and anterior septum, and hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions.
CT C/A/P ([**2138-8-2**]) (PFI): Pulmonary edema, bilateral plueral effusions.
Fluid in trachea and bronchi concerning for aspiration.
Gallbladder severely enlarged with stone in neck may relate to cholecystitis.
CT Head ([**2138-8-2**]) (PFI): No acute intracranial pathology; chronic small vessel ischemic changes; fluid in the nasopharynx likely due to intubation.
PFTs ([**4-14**]): Mild obstructive ventilatory defect.
The reduced FVC may be due to gas trapping but a coexisting restrictive defect cannot be excluded.
Suggest lung volume measurements if clinically [**Month/Year (2) 9304**].
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yoM with multiple medical problems including extensive CAD, AS, sCHF, AF, DM and CKD presents from rehab with lethargy, hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension.
Pt's muscle fasciculations continued in CCU, likely related to his uremia or hyperkalemia.
Pt was found unresponsive, without electrical activity on cardiac monitor and with no pupillary reflex.
Polyethylene Glycol [**Hospital1 **] PRN constipation 17.
Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 **] through [**2138-8-3**] for UTI .
