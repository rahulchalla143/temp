(Paraesophageal diaphragmatic hernia found incidentally on CXR, elective surgery scheduled).
History of Present Illness: 42-year-old gentleman with a [**Known lastname **] complicated upper gastrointestinal history.
This was complicated by severe erosive esophagitis and eventually an undilatable stricture requiring transhiatal esophagectomy.
This was subsequently complicated by severe and unrelenting bile reflux and was treated with biliary diversion and a Roux- en-Y gastrojejunostomy.
He has continued to have inability to aliment himself orally with a postprandial severe pain.
Radiographic and endoscopic examinations revealed an incarcerated portion of bowel in the chest to the level the main pulmonary artery.
There appears to be a bezoar in the small bowel component of this and I am concerned that this is an incarcerated hernia involving part of the colon but also part of the Roux-en-Y limb.
I recommended  reduction of this hernia and the possible need to revise again the gastrojejunostomy.

INDICATION: Diaphragmatic hernia repair, postop day 6 with desaturation, evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is marked enlargement of the main and right and left main pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
No definite filling defects are identified within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus.
The patient is status post esophagectomy with a large portion of the stomach located within the thorax.
Surgical clips are seen within the mediastinum consistent with postoperative change.
There are bilateral pleural effusions of moderate size which appear partially loculated and contain multiple air-fluid levels, and atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
There is additional atelectasis within the lingula.
Multifocal patchy ground- glass opacity and interlobular septal thickening is seen in a geographic distribution involving primarily the right upper and lower lobes and left upper lobe.
There is additional patchy airspace consolidation within the lung apices.
The heart and pericardium appear unremarkable.
There are numerous subcentimeter mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymph nodes not individually meeting criteria for pathologic enlargement.
BONE WINDOWS: Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformations demonstrate marked enlargement of the pulmonary arteries without evidence of filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolus.
No pulmonary embolus.
Marked enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Bilateral pleural effusions and ground- glass opacity and interlobular septal thickening suggests pulmonary edema which may be cardiogenic or noncardiogenic.
Loculated bilateral pleural effusions with air-fluid levels on the left.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
