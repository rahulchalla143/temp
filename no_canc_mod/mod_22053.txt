Admission Date:  [**2132-12-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2132-12-22**]   Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest and abdominal pain.
Electrocardiogram revealed anterior ST elevations.
Cardiac catheterization revealed 100% lesion in the proximal left anterior descending, with a 70% lesion in her D1 and also a 60% lesion in her mid right coronary artery.
Cardiac catheterization was complicated by episodes of ventricular fibrillation when pulmonary artery catheter was attempted to be advanced past right ventricle.
The patient was successfully defibrillated for these episodes of ventricular fibrillation.
Pelvic fracture five years ago.
Childhood polio with residual left leg weakness.
Chronic abdominal pain.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The lungs are with anterior crackles.
She has Dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
[**Street Address(2) 2811**] elevations in leads V2 through V4 with inferior lead ST depressions.
Cardiac catheterization - right heart catheterization shows right atrial pressure mean 19, right ventricular pressure 42/22, unable to advance to pulmonary arteries secondary to episodes of ventricular fibrillation.
Left heart catheterization shows right coronary artery lesion 50% proximal and 50% mid right coronary artery lesion, 100% proximal left anterior descending lesion, 50% septal one lesion, 70% diagonal one and two lesions and obtuse marginal one 60% lesion.
Cardiovascular - Coronary artery disease - The patient was admitted from outside hospital for treatment of anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction and went to cardiac catheterization laboratory and underwent successful PCI of 100% lesion in the proximal left anterior descending.
Cardiac catheterization does show that she has disease in her right coronary artery.
She was also started on Heparin initially for anticoagulation in the setting of a recent anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Later, this was discontinued as the patient was judged to be a moderate to severe fall risk.
She did not complain of any chest pain or abdominal pain during the remainder of her hospital course.
Pump - The patient was transferred from outside hospital following anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction and was status post successful stenting of proximal left anterior descending.
Transthoracic echocardiogram during her hospital course showed an ejection fraction of 25 to 35% with a mildly dilated left atrium.
She was found to have 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
She was found to have anterior, septal, apical and distal wall akinesis.
Although complete right heart catheterization was unavailable secondary to episodes of ventricular fibrillation, right atrial pressures did suggest volume overload at the time of admission.
Given her old age and her tendency towards decreased p.o.
intake, she runs the risk of hypovolemia and renal insufficiency.
As mentioned above, she is not a candidate for anticoagulation in the setting of recent myocardial infarction and markedly depressed ejection fraction.
Rhythm - The patient initially admitted to CCU following ventricular fibrillation arrest, status post successful defibrillation in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.
There initially were some concerns that the patient's electrocardiogram showed new development of a right bundle branch block in addition to her old left anterior fascicular block.
Later during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, the patient developed new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Hemodynamics - The patient remained hemodynamically stable during her hospital course even in the setting of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Pulmonary - As mentioned above, limited right heart catheterization and chest x-rays do confirm the patient to be in congestive heart failure.
Late in her hospital course, the patient was complaining of increased abdominal pain.
The patient had Foley placed at this time and will need follow-up with urology for new onset urinary retention.
As mentioned above, she is not a candidate for anticoagulation secondary to fall risk.
Infectious disease - The patient remained afebrile during her hospital course.
New Allergy/Adverse Drug Reaction - The patient became unresponsive in the CCU after being administered Phenergan.
Her electrolytes, electrocardiogram had not changed and her chest x-ray was without significant changes.
At this point, the nature of the reaction was unclear, but Phenergan should be listed as an allergy for this patient and should not be administered again.
Coronary artery disease, status post anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction with successful stenting of left anterior descending.
Ventricular fibrillation arrest in the setting of advancement of pulmonary artery catheter, status post successful defibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
New onset atrial fibrillation.
Urinary retention.
New allergy to Phenergan.
She was also to have follow-up with urology for urinary retention on [**2132-12-31**], at which time she would have her Foley removed.
