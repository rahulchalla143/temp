No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Sequelae of massive aspiration with bilateral lower lobe consolidation and scattered centrilobular ground-glass opacities.
TTE [**10-28**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and mild global hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 40 %).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild regional and mild global left ventricular systolic function.
No pathologic valvular flow identified.
Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Moderate primary pulmonary hypertension.
Acute posterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
Technically limited study secondary to motion artifact without evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Bibasilar consolidations, right more than left.
No evidence of intra-abdominal source of fever.
Fatty liver  Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo man with presumed CAD, DM who presents w/ resp distress found to be profoundly hypertensive, evidence of aspiration on CT chest and rising CEs.
1) NSTEMI:  Pt presented with shortness of breath, rising troponins, and LBBB (unknown baseline), overall suspicious for ACS, possibly in the setting of hypertensive emergency and flash pulmonary edema.
Troponins were cycled X 3 with elevation in CK-MB and troponins.
ECHO showed akinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and mild global hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 40 %).
Cardiology was consulted, and cath patient underwent cardiac cath, which showed in-stent restenosis of patient's prior LCx stent, and underwent thrombectomy and re-stenting.
Patient was also found to have moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension.
2) Acute on chronic Heart Failure:  Patient was found to have moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction (EF 40%), and required Lasix diuresis for fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
He responded well to a Lasix drip, with no supplemental O2 requirement on discharge.
2) Aspiration PNA - Febrile with WBC count elevated at 27 on initial labs, now trending down likely after fluid resuscitation.
Aspiration PNA vs pneumonitis read based on appearance on CT Chest.
Patient finished a course of treatment for aspiration PNA and antibiotics were subsequently d/c'ed.
3) Persistent Fevers - Patient continued to be febrile despite broad antibiotic coverage, and was believed to be febrile [**2-24**] DTs vs. drug fever, as all cultures and infectious w/u was negative following the initial imaging of aspiration PNA vs. pneumonitis.
Following the resolution of DTs and d/c of CIWA, patient's antibiotics were discontinued after a full course of treatment for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Patient's fevers resolved shortly thereafter with all cultures negative.
Likely fevers [**2-24**] DTs or from antibiotics which were started to treat aspiration PNA on intial presentation, and had completely resolved prior to discharge.
4) Acute renal failure - Pt was admitted with elevated creatinine, which improved upon receiving IVF.
5) Mental Status - Patient was initially sedated on a vent, but was weaned off vent and sedation following cardiac catheterization.
