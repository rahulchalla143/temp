History of Present Illness: 44-year-old man, s/p AVR in [**1-28**] secondary to staph aureus endocarditis, transferred from [**Hospital1 34**] at patient's request after presenting with 1 day of shaking chills, sweats, shortness of breath, and [**2123-9-3**] chest pain.
He describes the chest pain as "heaviness, so heavy it was painful."
He reports that he felt "sort of feverish" with a general sense of malaise but denies any distict CP, fevers, chills, or SOB until Monday night.
That night, the patient tried to self-treat with ibuprofen which decreased the chest pain but the symptoms were severe enough and peristed long enough that he became frightened and called 911.
ECG at [**Hospital 34**] hospital revealed a new LBBB and patient's troponins were elavated elevated wwith flat CK.
Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2117-1-24**] for acute methicillin-sensitive S. aureus endocarditis of the aortic and tricuspid valves complicated by splenic, pulmonary and cerebral infarcts.
ROS: poor appetite and weight loss over past two weeks per report, following an episode of "food poisoning" which the patient attributes to eating undercooked [**Country 1073**].
He also says that since his admission for endocarditis, he has had episodes intermittent episodes of a veil descending over his vision with complete loss of vision, lasting only 1-2 seconds, spontaneously resolving, and usually coming on when he's working.
Past Medical History: 1. staph aureus endocarditis complicated by cerebral, pulmonary, and splenic infarcts 2.
Left knee effusion culture + for Staph aureus 3.
Degenerative joint disease.
Physical Exam: VS: stable GEN: middle-aged man in NAD HEENT: AT, NC, PERRLA, EOMI, OP clear, upper front gum with dental apparatus for bridge but no bridge in mouth, MMM CV: RRR, [**1-30**] diastolic murmur loudest at LLSB, no lifts/heaves, JVP 6 cm PULM: CTAB no w/r/r ABD: firm, flat, non-tender, non-distended, + BS, no HSM EXT: no c/c/e, + 2 DP, MM, radial, femoral, abdominal, carotid pulses NEURO: alert, oriented, CN II-XII intact, cerebellar exam wnl   Pertinent Results: LABS (from [**Hospital1 34**]): WBC: 14.3, Hct: 36.7, MCV:88, PLT: 205, Sed rate: 40 BUN: 22, Crea: 1.2, Na: 132, K: 4.5, Cl: 101, CO2: 19, Ca: 9.2, Bili: 0.6, Alk Phos: 87, ALT: 45, AST: 38, CK: 96, TP: 6.3, Alb: 3.4, CKMB: 3.4, Trop T: 0.33 (0.0-0.10), U/A: negative, Tox screen: negative, Inlfuenza A & B: negative .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
A 1 cm, aortic annular abscess (starting at 5 o'clock going around counterclockwise to 7 o'clock) with a dynamic flap is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation (perivalvular leak near the right and left coronary cusps) is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
3.The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
6.Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
TEE ([**2117-2-8**]): Aortic valve endocarditis/vegetation with malcoapatation and severe aortic regurgitation.
No aortic root abscess seen.
Tricuspid valve endocarditis/vegetation with tricuspid regurgitation present, but difficult to quantiate severity.
Suggest TTE to better assess the degree of tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild non-obstructive coronary artery disease.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no flow-limiting disease in any vessel (though mild luminal irregularities were present throughout).
Left ventriculography was not performed because the patient was known to have aortic valve vegetations with a flail leaflet.
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 26171**] ([**2117-2-19**]):IMPRESSION: Bilateral cerebral and right cerebellar foci of signal abnormalities with the predominant lesion with surrounding edema and blood products in the left occipital region.
There is no area of restricted diffusion.
Although the appearances are not typicaL, given the patient's clinical history of endocarditis, septic emboli are the first diagnostic consideration.
Lack of restricted diffusion in the left occipital region lesion could be secondary to hemorrhage.
Additionally absence of restricted diffusion in other lesions could be secondary to the lesions being subacute in origin.
Although metastatic disease could have similar appearance, given the patient's clinical history this is less likely.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2118-11-22**] for further management of his fevers and chest pain.
An echocardiogram was obtained which revealed an aortic root abscess, 3+ aortic insufficiency and 4+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed right shoulder pain and an orthopedic consult was obtained.
No evidence of a septic joint were identified.
Settings were made to a DDD 80-130 with an underlying complete heart block.
