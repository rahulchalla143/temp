History of Present Illness: This is an 83 year old gentleman with CAD s/p stent x 2 (LAD, RCA), s/p pacemaker for LBBB/syncope, HTN, h.o.
MI ([**2070**]) presented to the ED from his cardiologist's office with worsening shortness of breath.
He was feeling in his usual state of health until two weeks ago when he noted progressive dyspnea on exertion that was apparent at rest.
He has had no symptoms of chest pain recently and has not required use of his SL NTG.
His symptoms have been associated with exacerbation of an underlying cough that is worse at night and associated w/ clear phlegm and chronic blood streaking.
