Admission Date:  [**2142-7-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-8-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Shellfish Derived  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: acute cholecystitis in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o lady with a-fib on Coumadin, and diastolic HF, who is admitted to the MICU with acute cholecystitis in the setting of rapid atrial fibrillation.
She initially presented to an OSH ([**Hospital3 **]) on [**7-20**] due to elevated INR of 12 on labs drawn at home, and upon arrival was found to have abdominal pain, RR 22, and O2 sat of 95% on RA in the setting of an INR of 9.8, WBC 13.1, and T Bili 2.2.
Abd CT revealed cholelithiasis with external biliary duct dilatation (unchanged from CT on [**2142-7-3**]).
HIDA scan was positive for acute cholecystitis.
She was in atrial fibrillation with RVR, and due to her age/comorbidities, she was considered to not be a surgical candidate so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] today for ERCP and percutaneous cholecystostomy.
Her WBC were 21.5, and her LFTs were significant for elevated T Bili and Alk Phos.
She was evaluated with US (which showed acute cholecystitis) and abdomen CT to rule out gangrenous cholecysttis.

Images: [**2142-7-31**] RUQ US wet read: Acute cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.
[**2142-7-31**] CT Abdomen wet read: Moderate b/l pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.
Moderate intra-abdominal ascites and diffuse body wall edema.
GB wall not well evaluated on the current study but no evidence of gas within the gallbadder wall or lumen.
Mild biliary dilitation.
Multiple compression fractures in lumbar and lower thoracic spine of unclear chronicity.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o lady who was admitted to the ICU with acute cholecystitis and a-fib with RVR.
Large gallstone and RUQ pain: likely chronic cholecystitis.
Her exam was concerning for acute cholecystitis, and her leukocytosis and OSH HIDA scan was suggestive of this as well.
The gall bladder was not distended, and there appeared to be no duct obsruction.
; there was no obstructing stone to be cleared by ERCP.
The patient and her family elected for DNR/DNI, CMO status and efforts were focused on pain control.
Her pain subsided throughout the hospital stay, and by the time of discharge she had some RUQ pain to deep palpation, which was relieved by Dilaudid.
At baseline she has dyspnea on exertion and she has been hospitalized multiple times for CHF exacerbations.
Her urine output did not seem to respond and she remained extremely edematous.
Discussions with family centered around the irreversible nature of her CHF, and her seemingly refractory edema was another reason that they decided to make her CMO.
She will need daily Basic Metabolic Panels to monitor her renal function and electrolytes.
Atrial Fibrillation: since arriving in the ICU, she was not in RVR.
Her Coumadin was held during her stay because of supratherapeutic INR, and at the time of discharge her INR was 2.0, so the Coumadin was still held.
New O2 requirement since reaching OSH: likely due to pulmonary volume overload.
Patient was satting well, but on 4L NC with no O2 requirement at home.
Her CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, so she likely had an element of volume overload.
Also, PNA was considered given her leukocytosis, but she had no cough.
Decreased urine output: FENa was <1%; her decreased output is likely due to decreased intravascular volume as described above, from cardiac cause.
Her CT abdomen showed ascites; she likely has an element of liver disease contributing to her coagulopathy.
Given that her diabetes seems under control, this was not treated.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] alliance  Discharge Diagnosis: gallstone congestive heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a large stone in your gall bladder, which was causing your abdominal pain.
In addition, you have been found to have fluid overload due to your CHF.
The risks of surgery or an Interventional Radiology procedure or an endoscopic procedure outweighed the benefits, and so you are being discharged with plans for antibiotics to treat any infection that might exist in your gallbladder, as well as plans for pain control.
Changes to your medications: -please stop Coumadin for now -start Tylenol three times daily -start oral Dilaudid as needed for pain -Zosyn (IV antibiotic) for a total of 10-day course -increased dose of diuretic (Lasix)  Followup Instructions: You will be seen by a physicial after admission to the skilled nursing facility                                [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD [**MD Number(1) 292**]
