The patient was transferred here and CT was repeated without an interval change in the left chest hematoma or the appearance of the aorta.

Small amount of subcutaneous air in the right chest wall is stable.
There is no change in small right pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of failure  [**2156-1-9**] 11:04 AM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Since the examination of [**2156-1-6**], there has been placement of an endovascular aortic stent graft with its proximal end at the level of the distal aspect of the left subclavian artery, terminating in the distal descending aorta.
There is no evidence of contrast extravasation beyond the margins of the graft.
The mediastinal hematoma has decreased slightly in size since [**1-6**].
A small right-sided hydropneumothorax with apical/anterior and posteromedial component is present.
A right-sided pleural effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis have decreased.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The aorta is normal in caliber and contour with mural calcification consistent with atheromatous disease.
The branch vessels, including the celiac, superior mesenteric, renal, and inferior mesenteric arteries, are patent.
There is an accessory left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery.
Two hypodense lesions in the liver (segment IVB, 3:109 and segment I, 3:97) are unchanged and likely represent cysts.
Contrast in the gallbladder is consistent with vicarious excretion.
In the pancreatic head, a 7-mm oval hyperenhancing nodule appears unchanged from the contrast-enhanced examination performed at the outside hospital on [**1-6**].
Multiple parapelvic cysts are present on the left.
A 3.5 x 6.5 cm fat and soft tissue density lesion which is continuous with the medial limb of the left adrenal gland, is consistent with a myelolipoma.
A second smaller fat density lesion in the upper portion of the left adrenal gland (3:87), is consistent with a smaller adrenal myelolipoma.
There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon with contrast retained in multiple diverticulae.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The bladder, distal ureters, prostate and seminal vesicles, rectum appear unremarkable.
There is sigmoid colonic diverticulosis without evidence of inflammatory change.
There are no pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: No lesions worrisome for osseous metastatic disease are identified.
There is subcutaneous emphysema within the tissues of the left chest wall near the site of insertion of the chest tube.
Status post placement of descending aortic endovascular stent graft without evidence of leak.
Left-sided hydropneumothorax with marked decrease in hemothorax since [**1-6**], and with interval placement of a chest tube.
Decreased simple right pleural effusion and atelectasis.
7 mm enhancing nodule in the pancreatic head most likely represents a hyperenhancing pancreatic mass such as a neuroendocrine tumor.
Two fat and soft tissue density containing left adrenal lesions consistent with myelolipoma.
Unchanged hypodense hepatic lesions consistent with cysts.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a woman who presented with anemia and CT scan showing left chest full of blood and a bedside MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] indicative of ulceration of the aorta with intramural hematoma just past the subclavian takeoff.
The patient was transferred here and CT was repeated without an interval change in the left chest hematoma or the appearance of the aorta.
Pt did recieve transfusion x 3 / HCT stable  CT placed - left chest hematoma  Pt tolerated the procedure well.
No complications.
Pt worked with patient  CTA performe post - placement of descending aortic endovascular stent graft without evidence of leak.
CT DC'd  CXR showed - post removal of a right central line, a left chest drainage tube with no pneumothorax.
Small post-operative pneumomediastinum seen along the left heart border.
Prominent aorta; ascending aorta and arch secondary to previous surgery with graft placement.
Slight increase in the left pleural effusion.
