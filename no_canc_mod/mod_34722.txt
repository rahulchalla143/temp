Distended gallbladder with wall edema, containing multiple stones.
However, the appearance of the gallbladder could also be secondary to inflammatory changes from the patient's pancreatitis.
Radiology Report [**Date Range **] BILIARY&PANCREAS BY GI UNIT Study Date of [**2123-11-21**] 2:01 PM FINDINGS: 16 intraprocedural spot radiographs of the right upper quadrant from an [**Date Range **] show cannulation and opacification of the common bile duct and its proximal branches.
There was no stricture and no dilatation.
Scattered irregular filling defects may be due to incomplete opacification as they are not seen on subsequent images.
Impression: Diffuse continuous erythema, edema and congestion of the mucosa were noted in the area of the papilla and second part of the duodenum.
Congestion of the mucosa with edematous duodenal folds was noted in the area of the major papilla making localization of the papilla difficult.
The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts, biliary radicles and cystic duct were filled with contrast and well visualized.
The course and caliber of the structures are normal with no evidence of extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities, and no filling defects.
Complete sphincterotomy could not be performed because of severe periampullary edema obscuring the landmarks A 10FR by 7 cm Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully.
Copious amounts of sludge and bile was seen draining from the CBD through the stent.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
There is no significant pericholecystic fluid collection.
There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
IMPRESSION: No intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
There is no evidence of pericholecystic or perihepatic abscess or fluid collection.
Small bilateral (left greater than right) effusions are simple appearing.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidations with air bronchograms may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
Patchy left upper lobe opacities likely represent pneumonia, but repeat imaging after 8 -12 weeks is recommended to document resolution.
Incompletely 11.6 x 5.6 cm peripancreatic fluid collection displaces the stomach upward.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2123-12-5**] 4:55 AM A single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Large peripancreatic fluid collection measuring 14.7 x 7.6 and 9.5 cm in size, which likely represents a developing pseudocyst.
Minimal amount of abdominal ascites.
Small left pleural effusion and lower lobe atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 74M w/ gallstone pancreatitis and u/s e/o cholecystitis s/p [**Date Range **] & biliary stent placement ([**11-20**]), rpt [**Month/Year (2) **] ([**11-21**]) s/p Cholecystomy drain placement .

U/S GB:No intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.

[**12-6**]: Speech and swallow evaluation; implemented recommendations to start patient on puree and nectar thickened fluids with 1:1 supervision.
