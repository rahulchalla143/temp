Admission Date:  [**2123-1-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-1-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-2-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Penicillins / Tetracycline / Cephalosporins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac cath s/p 3 drug-eluding stents to her RCA  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 58825**] is a 74 yo woman who presents with chest pain.
For five days prior to admission, she was having intermittent chest pain in a band like pattern with SOB.
The pain rose in intensity to 10 out of 10 the night of admission and was not related with activity.
She also c/o a second type of chest pain with was pleuritic in nature (worse with inspiration), which was worse when supine but improve when upright.
She was taken to an OSH ED and found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
She was given IV lopressor and noted to have 1-2mm ST elevations in her inferior leads when her heart rate decreased.
Cath revealed a totally occluded RCA that was stented with 3 Cypher stents.
Past Medical History: Hyperlipidemia Colon Cancer s/p resection in [**2117**]  Social History: Lives with husband who has [**Name (NI) 11964**].
No pulmonary embolus.
Biapical scarring, and additional scarring and architectural distortion at the superior segement of the left lower lobe.
Calcified lymph nodes and nodal mass.
Patchy opacities at the right lower lobe posteriorly could represent infectious process 4.
Multiple right-sided rib fractures, with osseous callus indicating a subacute state.
Two vessel coronary artery disease 2.
Moderate ventricular dysfunction.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes with diffuse ST segment elevation.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypetension.
No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous communication.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 58825**] is a 74yo woman with PMH of hypercholesterolemia who presents with chest pain and atrial fibrillation.
By history and EKG, she had pericarditis which was likely related to her recent flu-like syndrome.
It is probable that her pericarditis precipitated her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
The nature of her RCA occlusion, which was stented with 3 drug eluding stents, appeared chronic by history and by cath, which her RCA territory being fed by collatorals.
By stressing her heart, her atrial fibrillation with RVR likely caused her chest pain to manifest because of this chronic RCA occlusion.
Pericarditis: Pt's EKG and history of positional chest pain in the setting of flu-like symptoms supported the diagnosis of pericarditis.
A pulmonary emboli was ruled out with a negative CTA, despite a positive D-Dimer.
Chronic RCA occlusion s/p 3 drug eluding stents: Pt remained chest pain free after cath and after her pericarditis improved.
An ultrasound confirmed her small hematoma and ruled out fistula.
Her ecchymosis should resolve over several weeks.
Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response 3.
RCA occlusion s/p placement of three drug eluding stents  Discharge Condition: Pt was in good condition with stable vital signs and hematocrit (33.8).
