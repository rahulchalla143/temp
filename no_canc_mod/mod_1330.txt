Admission Date:  [**2186-12-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2187-1-2**]   Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred for respiratory failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] ([**2186-11-11**] through [**2186-11-27**]) with left sided pneumonia requiring intubation for airway protection and bronchoscopy for aspiration of a mucus plug and re-expansion of a collapsed lobe.
Her hospital course then was also complicated by myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 0.83 and the development of hematuria while receiving Heparin.
She also had acute renal failure during that hospital stay attributed to receiving intravenous dye as well as decompensation of her congestive heart failure requiring nesiritide and furosemide infusions.
Finally, her hospital stay was complicated by MRSA urinary tract infection for which she had a percutaneous inserted central catheter and received a course of Vancomycin intravenously.
Pneumonia with recent admission one month ago as well as one year ago.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2185-10-28**] initially when she refused intervention at that time, she was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit due to systolic congestive heart failure requiring intubation.
Severe aortic insufficiency.
Acute on chronic renal failure.
Thoracic aortic aneurysm.
She does not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol.
There is a well-documented history of poor compliance with regimens of medications.
ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to penicillin.
There is a history of poor compliance, however, she is prescribed the following cardiac regimen: 1.
She shakes her head no to pain and nods that she is breathing adequately.
There is a 2/6 systolic murmur as well as a 1/6 systolic murmur at the base.
There is a well-healed midline scar.
There is no rash, clubbing, or cyanosis.
There is mild lower extremity edema.
ECG showed unchanged, sinus rhythm at 76 beats per minute and a presence of a left bundle branch block.
Decompensated congestive heart failure:  The patient was subjected to diuresis with furosemide over the first two days; approximately 3 kg of fluid were removed.
Left atrial enlargement.
Large stable pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
As shown in the laboratory evaluation summarized above and in the OMR, the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction by elevated troponin.
Serial CKs showed rapid clearance of cardiac markers.
Chronic renal failure:  The patient tolerated diuresis adequately.
There was no interval rise in her BUN or creatinine, although she did have a stable metabolic alkalosis after achieving her dry weight.
Serial hematocrits did not show evidence of acute blood loss and her INR was normal as was her platelets.
