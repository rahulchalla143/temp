He used nebs without relief, did have a productive cough and was hypertensive to 190s.
CXR showed L sided PTX.
CT was placed by ED, then was c/b kinking and SQ emphysema, the pt developed extensive subcutaneous air over his chest, neck, and down into his scrotum.
Intubation was difficult and c/b hypotension with sedation.
IP replaced chest tube.
Patient quickly weaned off the vent with tx for COPD exacerbation and was extubated.
Hypotension resolved.
L sided chest pain was controlled with lidocaine patches and fentanyl.
He maintained to have a small amount of hemoptysis that was attributed to traumatic intubation.
Abx were continued empirically as well as theophylline and inhalers as part of tx for COPD exacerbation.
H/O treated TB Hypertension Glomerular nephritis Hyperchol   Social History: Positive tobacco history; he quit 15 years ago.
No alcohol or IV drug abuse.
Family History: nc  Physical Exam: Gen: comfortable, not tanchypneic Skin: crepitus on L side from neck to scrotum HEENT: NC in place, PERRLA, EOMI, no cervical LAD Lungs: coarse [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**] sounds bilaterally, decreased BS and bases.
CV: RRR, no m/r/g Abd: soft, nt/nd, +bs Ext: no edema +scrotal edema/SQ emphysema.
A massive amount of subcutaneous emphysema now covers both sides of the chest wall and the neck, obscuring evaluation of the underlying lung fields.
No residual pneumothorax is seen.
Volume loss on the left is slightly less in degree than the previous exam; there is residual opacity over the left mid lung and left lower lobe, which can represent consolidation, atelectasis, or asymmetric edema.
Bilateral subcutaneous emphysema is still present.

After transfer to the floor the patient steadily improved, chest tube was removed without complication, pt had significant hemoptysis and underwent bronchoscopy for suctioning and diagnostic purposes, revealing bronchomalacea.
1) Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to pneumothorax from ruptured bleb.
Pt's subcutaneous emphysema steadily improved over the course of the admission.
2) Pneumothorax: Likely secondary to ruptured bleb, complicated by chest tube placement and subcutaneous emphysema (large amount).
Tube was removed by interventional pulmonary [**2152-5-9**] without event.
Interval chest xray revealed resolution of pnemothrax with persistent LLL collapse and volume loss.
Pt went for bronchoscopy as below for deep suction and diagnostic purposes.
3) hemoptysis: likely secondary to intubation trauma vs multiple rupture blebs in COPD.
Bronchoscopy during this admission revealed bronchomalacia, follow up noncontrast Chest CT should be performed in [**1-8**] weeks for further elucidation of pt's lung disease.
5) Cardiovascular- Tachycardia as above.
Lasix was held in the setting of transient rise in Creatinine clearance.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for difficulty breathing and found to have a pneumothorax.
You underwent bronchoscopy to help clear thick secretions and were found to have bronchomalacia (thin airways).
