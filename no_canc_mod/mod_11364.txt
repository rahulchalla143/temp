Admission Date:  [**2154-9-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2154-9-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2095-12-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year old gentleman with a prior history of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction times four, who was initially seen in an outside Emergency Room the day prior to admission with complaint of pre-syncope and was sent home.
He represented to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room with crushing substernal chest pain.
At the outside hospital he had evidence of an inferior myocardial infarction with ST elevations in leads II, III and F.  He was treated with 100 mg bolus of TPA and initially had symptom improvement, however, soon afterwards, his ST elevations returned and the patient became hypotensive to pressure of 50 systolic.
Presenting to the catheterization laboratory, catheterization revealed a very small right coronary artery with good collaterals to left anterior descending, chronically occluded left anterior descending and evidence of circumflex disease.
The patient underwent angioplasty of his left circumflex artery which he tolerated well, although he did have ST elevations during the procedure, they resolved after angioplasty.
The patient did have profuse bleeding from his right groin site and his oropharynx during the procedure.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction times four by outside hospital report.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home O2 with a baseline O2 requirement of 3 liters.
ALLERGIES:   The patient had no known drug allergies.
Generally, he was sedated and intubated and minimally responsive.
HEENT revealed gross bleeding out of his oropharynx.
Extremities showed a large expanding right groin hematoma with no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse on the right but palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on the left lower extremity.
Cool extremities bilaterally.
In short, this is a 58 year old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease status post previous myocardial infarction times three, presenting with acute inferior myocardial infarction at outside hospital and then to [**Hospital1 1444**] Catheterization Laboratory status post failed TPA therapy.
The patient is hypertensive on pressors and required intubation and newly developed coagulopathy.
Cardiovascular: Coronary artery disease; The patient is status post angioplasty to distal circumflex lesion with no stent placement.
The patient's ST elevations resolved after angioplasty and the patient remained chest pain free throughout the course of his stay.
The patient had no acute rhythm issues during the course of his hospital stay.
The patient was bleeding profusely from his groin site during catheterization, from an INR of 9.8 and PTT of 89.7.
Infectious Disease:  While intubated, the patient spiked fevers to as high as 101.4 F.  He was pan-cultured.
Sputum culture grew out coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
The patient was treated for Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus originally with Vancomycin and then once the sensitivities were known, switched over to Oxacillin.
The patient was afebrile with decreasing white blood cell count at the time of discharge.
Mental status:  The patient was confused and agitated while on the ventilator as sedation was weaned.
The patient does have a history of heavy alcohol use, thus, it was thought that some of his agitation may be likely due to withdrawal.
In short, this is a 58 year old gentleman admitted from an outside hospital with an acute inferior myocardial infarction status post failed thrombolytic therapy, treated successfully here with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
Coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Coagulopathy likely secondary to Integrilin.
