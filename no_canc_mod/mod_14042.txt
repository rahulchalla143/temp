Admission Date:  [**2199-9-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-9-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-9-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: cardiac arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotraceal intubation on [**2199-9-3**] Central line placement Cardiac catheterization with no intervention   History of Present Illness: 65M w/PMHx CAD s/p 5v CABG, aortic valve replacement, aortic arch graft, DM, HLD, HTN was transferred to the CCU s/p cardiac arrest.
Per family he was having problems with GI upset and breathing after returning from a trip to CVS.
He was dyspneic which turned to lethargy, cold clammy skin, diaphoretic, pale, and finally unresponsiveness.
Given setting of high K (6.7) and old LBBB and possible respiratory arrest, cardiology decided to not take patient to cath lab.
EF mildly depressed about 40% with possible apical hypokinesis.
However, patient was bradycardic to 40s during bedside Echo and received 0.5 g atropine which increased his rate to the mid 60s transiently.
Also given 2L and put out about 1 L  The patient's intial hyperkalemia was treated with 2g of calcium gluconate for membrane stabilization, as well as 10U of insulin with concomittant D50 administration.
CT head obtained and neg for acute intracrainal process per wet read.
CTA also obtained for concern of PE and found no PE but bilateral groundglass opacities and widespread consolidation.
Did have a nuc that was abnl in [**2197**] that showed moderate lateral ischemia- looked like his OM graft went down.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted Neck: Reduced ROM, no carotid bruits appreciated.
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally with decreased breath sounds both bases.
no ESM with prosthetic S2.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-9-3**], no clear change.
[**9-3**]: Head CT w/o Contrast 1.There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema or acute territorial infarction.
2.There are multiple areas of hypoattenuation that likely represent encephalomalacia from prior chronic infarctions.
3.The left maxillary sinus is completely opacified with high-density material that could be due to inspissated secretions or possibly due to fungual nfection.
Clinical correlation is recommended to exclude a fungal infection.
[**9-3**]: CT Chest with and without contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2.Status post aortic valve replacement and ascending aorta graft placement for aneurysm repair, with no evidence of graft failure.
3.Dependent patchy pulmonary consolidations likely represent aspiration and or evolving pneumonia, in the appropriate setting.
Upper lung ground glass opacities could reflect additional component of pulmonary edema.
[**9-5**]: [**Doctor First Name **] Duplex upper extermity: Normal appearance of the bilateral internal jugular and subclavian veins.
There is mild heterogenous plaque bilaterally in the internal carotid arteries.
The peak systolic velocity in the left common carotid artery was 124 cm/sec.
The peak systolic velocity in the left ICA proximally was 140 cm/sec, in the mid portion 121 cm/sec and distally 99 cm/sec yielding an ICA/CCA ratio of 1.1, within normal limits.
[**9-6**]: EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study because the background activity is continuous diffuse polymorphic delta and occasional [**5-17**] Hz theta activity.
This is suggestive of moderate diffuse encephalopathy of nonspecific etiology.
With history of cardiac arrest, hypoxic brain injury is one of the possibilities along with sedative medication, as the patient is still on a midazolam infusion.
There are no epileptifrom discharges or electrographic seizures.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated severe three vessel native coronary artery disease.
The RCA had a new appearing total occlusion distally and an 80% AM stenosis similar to cath in [**2190**].
Selective venous conduit angiography revealed a patent SVG-LAD.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertension with central aortic pressure of 156/68 mmHg.
Systemic arterial hypertension.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic stenosis is seen.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
No evidence of an accessory pathway 3.
No evidence of conduction system abnormalities  Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o male with PMHx of 5 v CABG, aortic valve replacement, and asc aortic aneurysm repair with CVA, was admitted to the CCU s/p "cardiac arrest" of unclear etiology.
The patient presented initially with unresponsiveness and with presumed conduction delays given his prolonged QRS and bradycardia.
The chest CT suggested a pulmonary process, but greatly improved on the second day, suggesting aspiration pneumonitis.
Patient was initially also started on broad spectrum antibiotics which were discontinued on subsequent days as he remained afebrile with normal urine and blood cultures and without any source of infection.
The patient received 0.5mg of atropine in the emergency department for bradycardia and was admitted to the cardiac care unit.
During his CCU stay he had an episode of bradycardia with complete heart block in the setting of severe GERD symptoms.
Based on this episode, it was felt that his initiall presenting symptom may have also been vagally mediated due to severe GERD.
He was started on PPI and ranitidine with no further episode of arrhythmias on telemetry.
He also had a cath which showed severe three vessel disease with new occlusion in the RCA and attempt at opening CTO of RCA was unsuccessful.
Subsequently he han EP study which did not reveal any inducible tachyarrhythmia or any new conduction abnormalities.
# Delirium: After coming off of sedation and being extubated patient was agitated and delirious.
No infectious or neurologic etiologies were identified.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient will follow up with PCP for further management of his severe GERD - Patient will follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] for further evaluation for his CAD.
Lisinopril 5 mg PO DAILY RX *lisinopril 5 mg one tablet(s) by mouth daily Disp #*30 Tablet Refills:*2   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Vagal response with sinus arrest Hypotension Delerium Coronary artery disease Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were on a breathing machine with low blood pressure and underwent a cooling protocol.
A cardiac catheterization showed blockages in your arteries but the physician was unable to open any artery.
You did not have a heart attack and your heart function is strong according to the echocardiogram.
An electrophysiology study to assess your conduction system did not show any abnormalities besides a known mild type of heart block (left buncle branch block).
You had delerium that was caused by your illness and sedatives that was exacerbated by lack of sleep.
It is unclear if lack of oxygen to your brain has been a factor in your confusion as well.
Your voice is hoarse after the breathing tube and you have an appt with an ear, nose and throat doctor on [**9-26**].
