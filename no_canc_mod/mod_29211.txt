He was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] from [**2138-5-18**] for COPD exacerbation and treated with azithro, steroids, nebs and discharged to [**Hospital1 **] pulmonary rehab.
At [**Hospital1 **] today, pt was noted to be in respiratory distress with desat in O2 saturation to 70-80s with poor air movement.
He was placed on CPAP without improvement.

tachycardia (sinus vs. MAT), nl axis/int, poor R wave progression .
Imaging: CXR1: There is marked pulmonary hyperinflation and "simplification" with diaphragm flattening, indicative of underlying emphysema, with suggestion of large bulla.
The residual lung parenchyma is unremarkable, and no pneumothorax is identified.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and there is no pleural effusion.
There is a triangular lucency projected over the central aspect of the lower thorax, which may represent air in stomach or bowel loops in the upper abdomen.
IMPRESSION: Severe underlying emphysema, with no focal consolidation or evidence of CHF.
Chest CT: Extensive blebs in lung apex; diffuse emphysematous disease.
Scattered tiny nodules in right upper and middle lobe.
Scattered calcified granulomas bilaterally.
Echo: IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild right ventricular cavity enlargement but preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 64 yo male with PMH severe COPD (FEV1 0.68, 20% predicted) on chronic steroids, HTN, recent vertebral fractures presents with respiratory failure and shock.
Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with a COPD exacerbation, most likely after not having a full recovery from his last exacerbation 3 weeks prior to admission.
He had no evidence of pulmonary embolus on CT angiogram.
Blood cultures and sputum cultures did not grow microbes and he had negative viral serology studies, negative legionella antigen, and negative sputum studies for pneumocystis.
He was llater transitioned to vancomycin/aztreonam to cover any resistant gram negative organisms and also had a 5 day course of azithromycin for atypical pathogens during his stay.
He had a significant degree of "auto-PEEP" devoloping while on the ventilator, and failed attempts to transition from assist control to pressure support settings due to PEEP buildup leading to hypotension.
However, he quickly tired, despite the use of non-invasive positive pressure, and could not maintain adequate ventilation.
He was extubated and expired on [**6-10**] at 21:30 due to respiratory failure.
Hypotension: The patient was admitted with hypotension which was thought most likely related to his high levels of auto-PEEP compromising his cardiac output.
