AD[**Last Name (STitle) **]N HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year-old woman who presently with known residual of ventricular septal defect and double chamber right ventricle.
She previously had had a repair and resection of the infundibulum in [**2160**] but has been having increasingly limited amounts of physical activity and increasing dyspnea.
She was seen by the [**Location (un) 86**] Adult Congenital Heart Service and on her preoperative work up was found to have a double chambered right ventricle with a 50 to 55 mmHg gradient between the infundibular region of the right ventricle and the remainder of the right ventricle and also a membranous ventricular septal defect which communicated between the body of the right ventricle and beneath the aortic valve.
She is otherwise not in any distress and appeared generally healthy.
She had no rashes, ecchymosis or jaundice.
She had a palpable thrill with a IV/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating throughout the precordium.
There was no right ventricular heave.
She had no edema and her pulses were normal throughout.
Her preoperative cardiac catheterization showed no significant coronary disease and her preoperative MRI showed likely obstruction of the distal infundibulum and normal left ventricular global systolic function.
Upon admission she was noted to have a diffuse erythematous rash.
They felt that this was likely secondary to either contact allergy or a drug allergy and recommended oral antihistamines but otherwise did not feel this was an infectious process.
At this time she underwent closure of her ventricular septal defect with a pericardial patch.
She had repair and reconstruction of her right ventricular outflow tract with pericardial patch and also pulmonic valve replacement with a 25 mm Thermofit aortic valve.
There were no intraoperative complications.
She remained somewhat sedated but hemodynamically stable on postoperative day zero and therefore remained intubated until the morning of postoperative day #1 at which time she was extubated without difficulty.
Notably in the initial postoperative period she had frequent premature ventricular contractions and premature atrial contractions.
She otherwise did quite well postoperatively as noted, was extubated on postoperative day #1 at which time she started a clear liquid diet which was advanced without difficulty.
The echocardiogram was notable for an ejection fraction of 30% with depressed left ventricular systolic function but otherwise no significant abnormality.
Her chest x-ray showed no evidence of significant effusion.
once daily, Darvocet 100 - 650 mg tablets take one tablet every four hours as needed for pain with a note to limit acetaminophen intake to less than 2 grams per day, Percocet 1 tablet as needed p.r.n.
