Admission Date:  [**2134-11-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2134-11-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-4-19**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45-year-old female with a complex past medical history notable for renal transplant x3 following development of end stage renal disease secondary to glomerulonephritis, hepatitis C, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%, status post gastric bypass and cholecystectomy in [**2133-8-2**] who was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13797**] in Plastic Surgery clinic for management of excessive skin in the arms bilaterally secondary to significant weight loss.
Status post diabetes mellitus secondary to medications which the patient reports resolved spontaneously in [**2132-11-2**].
Status post bypass and cholecystectomy in [**2133-7-3**] which was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome and bacteremia.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40% 6.
Hypertension  HOME MEDICATIONS: 1.
In the Recovery Room, the patient was noted to be afebrile with stable vital signs but demonstrated decreased urine output on the order of 10 to 15 cc per hour for seven to eight hours.
The patient was subsequently administered one 500 cc normal saline bolus and two 250 cc one half normal saline boluses with little effect on urine output.
Of note, the patient was also noted in the Recovery Area to be in sinus bradycardia consistent with past electrocardiograms with an average heart rate ranging in the low 40s.
Also of note, renal function studies obtained in the Recovery Area demonstrated no evidence of renal failure, but did suggest a prerenal picture consistent with diminished renal perfusion.
Cardiac enzyme studies were negative for evidence for myocardial ischemia and electrocardiogram studies were negative for any signs of acute ischemic changes, but were notable for sinus bradycardia.
While on the floor, the patient remained independently productive of adequate amounts of urine with no further need for additional fluid boluses and was able to have her Foley catheter discontinued on postoperative day #3 without complication.
She remained bradycardic with a heart rate in the 40s to 50s the duration of her stay.
On postoperative day #4, [**2134-11-8**], the patient was noted to be afebrile with stable vital signs.
Her incisions were noted to be clear of erythema or drainage with intact sutures.
The patient continued, however, to complain of pain not well controlled via Vicodin.
An acute pain service consult was therefore obtained given the patient's reported history of severe itching in response to opioid medications.
The acute pain service recommended pain control via Ultram 50 mg q 4 to 6 hours prn in conjunction with acetaminophen 500 mg q 4 to 6 hours prn.
Ultram and Tylenol for pain as needed.
