He was intubated in the field and brought to an OSH where he had a PEA arrest with return of spontaneous circulation after epinephrine.
The patient reportedly had ICD which was though to be due to low EF, but was reportedly removed for a pocket infection.
The cause of the VT/VF was unclear, but thought possibility secondary to an MI given STE on EKG (see below).
Initiation of artic sun therapeutic cooling protocol for neuroprotection s/p arrest on started in the ED.
He was monitored for hypokalemia and hyperglycemia during cooling and hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia during rewarming.
He was started on an insulin gtt for initial hyperglycemia during the initial 24 hours of cooling.
Neuro was consulted to monitor for seizure activity.
The patient was monitor with video EEG, and was found to have seizure activity requiring antiseizure medications for suppression, as advised by neurology.
The patient was in sinus with runs of atrial tachycardia on admission.
He would range from hypotension requiring   norepinephrine to maintain a MAP>65 to 200/110 requiring nitro gtt for BP reduction.
His exam was significant for corneal reflexes but no other brainstem activity.
# STEMI- The patient presented an EKG concern for STE in III>II and AvF with STD in I, aVL, V2-V5 with q-waves in the inferior leads.
Likely RCA/posterior territory.
drug overdose among other factors, it was thought that risks of c. cath could potentially outweight benefits of urgent cardiac cath.
# [**Last Name (un) **]:  The patient presents with oliguria and hyperkalemia in the setting of presumed [**Last Name (un) **] from hypoperfusion during his cardiac arrest.
Given that he was hyperkalemic in the setting of oliguria and [**Last Name (un) **], a temp dialysis line was placed and HD was initiated.
# Leukocytosis- The patient presented with a leukocytosis in the setting of cardiac arrest, which is likely secondary a stress response.
