Initial CXR showed LUL cavitary lesion decreasing in size, parenchymal RUL/LUL changes, increased vascularity and bronchial cuffing; no effusion.
He has no known cardiac disease.
The patient became acutely agitated with worsening shortness of breath.
He did not respond to further nebulizer treatments and was intubated in the ED for concern of flash pulmonary edema.
He then received 5mg iv metoprol and became hypotensive with BP 78/50.

Brief Hospital Course: Brief Overview:  60 yo patient presented to ED with SOB and developed flash pulmon edema in ED.
Echo showed EF 15-20%, stress showed no reversible changes.
# Systolic heart failure: EF of 15-20%, no LV enlargement on echo, but dilation seen on stress MIBI.
Stress MIBI showed no reversible defects but showed an enlarged ventricle.
In addition, the pt ruled out for MI by enzymes.
His breathing improved, his lungs remained clear, and he had no further problems as a result of his CHF.
The cause of the systolic CHF is unknown, however it could be due to longstanding HTN/DM2.
# DMII: Held oral agents because metformin is contraindicated prior to cath and it was unclear if cath would be needed.
