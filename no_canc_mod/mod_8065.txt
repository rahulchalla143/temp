Radiographic Studies: Renal Ultrasound ([**2131-3-12**]) INDICATION: Patient is an 83-year-old male with recent TURP for benign prostatic hypertrophy now admitted with hematuria and obstruction secondary to hematoma within the bladder.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
No internal vascularity is demonstrated.
There is extensive amount of heterogeneous echogenicity demonstrated within the bladder most compatible with known history of blood clot.
There is prostatic hypertrophy with the prostate measuring up to 6.8 x 6.2 x 5.5 cm for a calculated prostatic volume of 121 cc.
IMPRESSION: 1) Multiple simple cysts seen within both kidneys, otherwise unremarkable appearance of the kidneys with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
2) Extensive heterogeneity seen within the bladder compatible with known history of blood clot within the bladder.
3) Prostatic hypertrophy measuring up to 121 cc.
CXR ([**2131-3-13**]) HISTORY: Aortic stenosis, to evaluate for pulmonary edema.
No definite pleural effusions or vascular congestion at this time.
No acute focal pneumonia.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ([**2131-3-14**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5cm2).
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate mitral stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has moderate mitral stenosis.
Based on [**2126**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**12-9**] years.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: 83M h/o AFIB, on coumadin, s/p recent TURP, admitted with hematuria, hypotension.
# hypotension - admitted to floor initially, but transferred to ICU for hypotension, most consistent with acute blood loss aneima.
# hematuria - s/p TURP 3 weeks prior to admission, with significant bleeding requiring ICU stay, no pressors, but 11U PRBC transfusion as below.
This usually could be resolved with simple irrigation, but did require his foley catheter to be changed out twice.
When his foley would occlude, his bladder would become distended with irrigant fluid and would cause the patient significant discomfort.
# acute blood loss anemia - during his intensive care unit stay, the patient required 11 units of pRBCs to be transfused, last transfusion on [**2131-3-15**].
#  paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - pt was continued on amiodarone, digoxin.
# acute kidney injury - creatinine increased to 2.2 on admission, felt most likely [**1-9**] hypovolemia vs. obstruction.
renal ultrasound was performed and did not show obstruction but did show blood in the bladder.
# CAD s/p PCI - initially, aspirin and metoprolol were held given acute bleeding.
# chronic diastolic congestive heart failure - pt denied h/o CHF, but was on lasix at admission.
he underwent TTE which revealed preserved EF (60%), E/A,<1, consistent with diastolic CHF.
Moderate mitral stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
# hyperlipidemia - continued on statin.
# BPH - pt admitted on tamsulosin, which was continued.
# access - a RUE PICC was placed in ICU, and removed prior to discharge.
# code - pt was DNR/DNI.
# comm - daughter, [**Name (NI) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 29319**].
Outpatient Lab Work please have lab work drawn on your visit with your primary care doctor, no later than [**2131-3-23**], including BUN/CREATININE, and CBC.

you received 11 units of blood, and underewnt cystoscopy, at which time friable bleeding tissue was addressed by urology.
you are being dishcarged home, off of coumadin, aspirin, and lasix, with a foley catheter in place.
