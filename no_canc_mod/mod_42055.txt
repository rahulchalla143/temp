EGD Report ([**2107-5-6**]): Findings: Esophagus:  Lumen: A sliding small size hiatal hernia was seen.
Stomach: Excavated Lesions A few linear non-bleeding ulcers were found in the stomach body.
Duodenum: Excavated Lesions There was active bleeding with bright red blood seen upon entering the duodenum.
There was no further bleeding.
Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus Small hiatal hernia Ulcers in the stomach body and erosions in the duodenum which appeared ischemic in nature Ulcer in the D1/D2 Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: =================================== Ms. [**Known lastname 26438**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of cardiomyopathy and dementia who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after an excedrin overdose, with hospital course complicated by upper GI Bleed, worsened renal function and elevated liver enzymes.
She was found to have duodenal and stomach ulcers on EGD, was on IV PPI drip for 72 hours transitioned to oral pantoprazole twice daily.
Active Diagnoses: #[**Hospital1 **] overdose - Patient with baseline dementia and does not recall event.
Found in bed complaining of headache and malaise, taken to OSH where she was started on bicarb drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt not complaining of nausea/vomiting/tinnitus/respiratory distress, although noted to have rapid respiratory rate in ED.
#Acetamenophen overdose - pt did not have nausea/vomiting/jaundice/abdominal pain/hypotension.
She did have metabolic acidosis and dramatic elevations in AST/ALT up to 6,000 range on presentation.
This can be restarted once her liver enzymes recover.
# Upper GI Bleed-  A few hours after admission to the ICU the patient developed melena with HCT drop.
The patient was take for urgent bedside EGD which revealed active ulcer with bleeding vessel at D1D2 which was treated with epinephrine & clip placement.
She did not have further bleeding episodes and her Hct remained relatively stable at range of 22-26 over the last 48 hour of her stay.
# Acute Kidney Injury ??????
Likely secondary to salicylate toxicity with element of prerenal physiology as well.
Element of ATN was present as well on Urine analsysis.
# Dementia/AMS -  Mental status improving to baseline with resolution of overdose and GI bleed.
Short term memory extremely impaired.
An underlying possible depression might have contributed to her worsening of dementia.
# CHF/cardiomyopathy - unclear ill-defined history.
No evidence of volume overload during this admission.
Has bilateral basal inspiratory crackles on exam.
# Goals of care - spoke with daughter HCP who stated the pt wants to be DNR/DNI, no ICU procedures, would not want dialysis.
- Consider restarting statin once liver enzymes further improve - Consider psychiatry consult for possible underlying depression  Medications on Admission: Lisinopril 20mg daily Procardia XL 30mg daily Lovastatin 20mg daily Seroquel 50mg qhs RinaRelief pills?
