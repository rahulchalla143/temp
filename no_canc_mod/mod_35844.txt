Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation and at least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Calcific aortic valve disease with mild stenosis and mild regurgitation.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Increased vascular markings and interstitial edema suggestive of congestive heart failure.
- CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2147-4-12**] 7:43 PM - Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.
Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has increased.

There is normal triphasic flow in the brachial arteries bilaterally without evidence of calcifications.
Patent bilateral cephalic, basilic, and subclavian veins.
Of note, there are significant calcifications in the bilateral radial arteries.
Duodenal bulb ulcer status post clipping without evidence of active extravasation.
Mucosal hyperemia likely reactive.
No colonic active extravasation.
Pancreatic IPMN and pancreatic head ill defined hypoattenuating region, more dense than subjacent cystic IPMN lesions, which could be further assessed by MRCP on follow-up in 6 months.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 3228**] is an 85 year old woman with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, chronic diastolic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (stage V) who was initially admitted for volume overload, and hyperkalemia requiring initation of hemodialysis and pneumonia.
Hospital course was complicated by worsening hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation and upper GI bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer.
Most recent TTE was notable for severe diastolic heart failure as well as mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
Patient responded only mildly to high dose diuretics and required ultrafiltration for volume removal and dialysis for electrolyte disarray.
She underwent tunneled right IJ catheter placement on [**2147-4-11**] urgently without complications.
#Pneumonia/Hypoxemic and Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented wtih pneumonia and was intubated for hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure due to lung collapse in the setting of pneumonia as well as volume overload from pulmonary edema.
In the MICU, antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and zosyn; she completed a course for HCAP and respiratory symptoms improved.
Given that there was significant atelectasis and intermittent lung collapse, patient was encouraged to use incentive spirometery every hour.
She also has chronic RML and RLL collapse which may be worked up for a potential obstructive lesion.
#Hypertension/Atrial fibrillation: She had one episode of presumed flash pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension during this hospitalization.
She was also felt to have worsening pulmonary edema when in rapid atrial fibrillation which occcurred paroxysmally during this admission.
She was initially continued on home labetalol as her beta blocker but it was discontinued in the setting of GI bleed and then restarted upon discharge.
GI was consulted and performed upper endoscopy, which visualized a bleeding duodenal ulcer, which was then clipped.
Patient was provided with phenotypically appropriate blood, which was cleared by a Heme/Onc consultant to prevent hemolytic anemia.
(The patient has a history of antibodies to transfused blood and resultant hemolytic anemia.)
GI re-scoped the upper GI tract and saw no new ulcers and a well-healing duodenal ulcer with clips still in place.
Given the significant bleed anticoagulation and aspirin were held.
In 2 weeks, aspirin 81mg daily can be restarted with the decision to increase aspirin to 325 or start therapeutic anticoagulation to be determined by the patient's PCP and GI depending on ulcer healing.
#Low grade fever: Pt had Tmax 100.6 on the day before discharge, however there was no clear infectious source, pt clinically appeared very well, and afebrile thereafter until discharge off antibiotics (>24 hrs).
However, would consider UA/UCx at rehab to assess for UTI as cause of low grade fever and relatively elevated wbc count in the absence of other symptoms.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - patient to discuss potential switch to peritoneal dialysis with her outpatient providers - possible workup of RML and RLL chronic collapse - monitor HD catheter insertion site, which has had some intermittent bleeding requiring pressure dressings.
- Patient will need follow-up for pancreatic IPMNs and adnexal cyst seen on CTA torso.
- Pt should have PCP follow up made when discharged from rehab -- she will need to have a hematocrit drawn within [**2-6**] wks of discharge and if stable (last value stable at 29.6) then PCP should consider restart ASA 81 for AFib, if appropriate, with decision for full dose aspirin or Coumadin to be decided in conjunction with GI depending on ulcer healing and persistent risk of GI bleeding -Gastroenterology follow up appointment is being worked on and patient should follow up within 2 wks.
8. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Nursing & Therapy Center - [**Location 1268**] ([**Location (un) 86**] Center for Rehabilitation and Sub-Acute Care)  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary- GI bleed          Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease          Chronic diastolic heart failure  Secondary- End-Stage Renal Disease            Hyperkalemia            Uremia            Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation            Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 3228**], You were admitted to the hospital because you were having increased difficulty breathing and worsening cough and leg swelling.
You were found to have a very elevated potassium level because your kidney function had worsened quickly.
You were also found to have worsening heart failure, which caused a lot of extra fluid buildup in your body.
You developed difficulty breathing requiring you to be transferred to the ICU where you were put on the breathing machine.
While there, you developed a GI bleed, likely from a duodenal ulcer.
STOP Calcitriol -- this was held while you were admitted but this should be discussed with your Nephrologist on follow up, whether you should restart this or not  No other changes were made to your medications.
