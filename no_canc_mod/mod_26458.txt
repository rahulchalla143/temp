AT DISCHARGE: VITALS: 98.7  97.5  106/62  96  20  96% 1L NC  (-1.5L LOS from MICU) WEIGHT: 83.5 kg   BG: 198-485 mg/dL I/Os: 2070 | 1625 + BRP GENERAL: Appears in no acute distress.
NECK: supple without lymphadenopathy.
CVS: Regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur at RLSB, no rubs or gallops.
RESP: Diffusely coarse breath sounds, worse at bases (R > L) bilaterally.
No wheezing; but faint inspiratory crackles.
No palpable masses or peritoneal signs.
IMAGING: [**2196-1-16**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Diffuse bilateral severe parenchymal opacities, similar to that seen previously in [**2195-11-19**] with multifocal pneumonia.
These findings are more consistent with multifocal pneumonia, supperimposed pulmonary edema is possible.
[**2196-1-16**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, predominantly of ground-glass pattern, with areas of more confluent consolidations.
The distribution of disease is nearly identical to the prior CT; however, it is noted that there was interval resolution of these abnormalities (see chest radiograph [**2195-12-30**]).
Based on these findings, the pulmonary parenchymal abnormality is felt likely to reflect re-exposure an [**Doctor Last Name 360**] causing a reactive hypersensitivity pneumonitis or possibly an eosinophilic pneumonitis.
Pulmonary edema is not considered likely given the distribution.
Bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy is unchanged when compared to the prior study and is likely reactive.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, similar in appearance to the prior study.
Small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 52M with a PMH significant for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 30%-35%), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C infection, HTN, HLD, schizophrenia and depression who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory distress found to have bilaterally diffuse airspace opacities with ground-glass appearance on CT chest imaging with suspected component of CHF exacerbation, in the setting of recent illicit substance use.
# DIFFUSE, BILATERAL LUNG OPACIFICATION AND ACUTE RESPIRATORY DECOMPENSATION - His initial presentation was concerning for pulmonary edema vs. multifocal pneumonia vs. hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
He had a similar presentation in [**2195-11-19**] thought to be secondary to multifocal pneumonia, although rapid radiographic resolution in less than 2-weeks at that time was more consistent with crack lung.
Per the ED, he improved symptomatically on BiPAP, Nitroglycerin gtt and a Lasix gtt which made a component of decompensated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy a likely superimposed diagnosis.
A CT chest was obtained showing diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, predominantly of ground-glass pattern, with areas of more confluent consolidations.
The pulmonary parenchymal abnormality was felt likely to reflect re-exposure to an [**Doctor Last Name 360**] causing a reactive hypersensitivity pneumonitis or possibly an eosinophilic pneumonitis, although no peripheral eosinophilia was noted.
Antibiotics were also deferred given his rapid clinical improvement.
# INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS - Patient previously managed with Lantus dosing (taking 40 units at home, 15 units per previous discharge paperwork) - intermittently checks his glucose at home, has been under the 200 mg/dL range per the patient.
No evidence of retinopathy, renal failure (baseline creatinine 0.9-1.1) or neuropathy.
Did receive pulse steroids for hypersensitivity pneumonitis concerns (as noted above), with resulting hyperglycemia, requiring an insulin gtt briefly.
He was quickly weaned to his home Lantus regimen without concern.
# NON-ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY - Patient with known moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35%), LVD 6.4-cm, mild RV dilation, borderline function, 1+ MR on 2D-Echo from 12/[**2194**].
Admitted with some chest discomfort, EKG changes with non-specific ST changes and Troponin elevation to 0.05-0.06 with flat CK-MBs x 2.
He was admitted to the CCU initially and started on a Nitroglycerin gtt with Lasix gtt for presumed volume overload in the setting of dietary indiscretion and poor compliance with diuretics, leading to CHF exacerbation component (as noted above).
# HYPERTENSION - managed as an outpatient with ACEI, beta-blocker - requiring Nitro gtt on admission briefly.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - We continued Atorvastatin 20 mg PO QHS.
# HEPATITIS C INFECTION - He has a history of positive HCV antibody documented in [**2188**].
No evidence of sequelae of chronic liver disease.
Will need follow-up as outpatient for AFP, serial ultrasounds, candidacy for possible anti-viral therapy (likely poor candidate) given his hepatitis C infection.
No culture data, radiologic studies or laboratory studies pending at discharge.
Will need follow-up as outpatient for AFP, serial ultrasounds, candidacy for possible anti-viral therapy (likely poor candidate) given his hepatitis C infection.

You were admitted to the Internal Medicine service at [**Hospital1 1535**] on CC7 regarding management of your acute respiratory issues.
