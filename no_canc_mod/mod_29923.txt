Cannot exclude possibility of pneumonia or pleural effusions on the basis of these films.
If indicated, PA and lateral views should be obtained.
Some persistent features of volume overload.

Chest pain: several times on the floor the patient complained of chest pain.
His home medical management of coronary disease was continued.
His chest pain responded well to nebulizer treatments and minimally to sublingual nitroglycerin.
