He was intubated in the [**Hospital1 **] ED, and a thoracostomy tube was placed in the left chest for decreased breath sounds.
He gradually improved with respect to his CV & respiratory status.
Neuro: At initial presentation, a neurology consult was obtained to evaluate for anoxic brain injury & the possibility of brain death.
Neuroimaging did not reveal any ischemic injury to the brain & an EEG was not consistent with brain death, although he was heavily sedated at this time.
Early attempts to wean sedation were met with hypertension & tachcardia, which have been controlled with beta blockade & hydralazine.
Resp: His respiratory acidosis improved in the first few days of this admission.
On [**9-19**], a bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed significant mucosal burning & carbonaceous secretions.
Because of his severe smoke inhalation injuries, it was decided that he would require a tracheostomy to wean from the vent.
A chest CT showed bilateral effusions & intrinsic lung injury, and espohageal balloon manometry revealed that he required additional PEEP.
With diuresis & 1 week of antibiotics, his resp status improved.
ID: He was treated for a urinary tract infection on admission.
He had ventilator associated xanthomonas pneumonia, which was treated.
MSK: His first degree burns on his lower back were treated with topical bacitracin.
His initial rise in CK & troponin was secondary to muscle breakdown and resolved spontaneously.
There were no sequelae.
