Pt presented with CP in 3/99 and had angioplasty of 80% stenosed RCA (vessel too small for stents) and states 6 months afterwards he had the same vessel angioplastied again.
States the pain only lasts a few minutes and accompanied by SOB but no N/V/diaphoresis.
States he does not take SL Nitro b/c the pain resolves on its own.
He had a stress test [**2200-5-27**] which showed mild to moderate, partially reversible myocardial perfusion defects involving the anterior wall, apex, and septum, with transient ischemic dilatation of the LV and global hypokinesis (LVEF 30%).
Pt states approx 25 years ago he took an aspirin and shortly after developed hives and profuse vomiting.
Past Medical History: CAD - s/p cath [**2-/2195**] with RCA 80% stenosed - angioplasty but too small for stent.

No wheezes or crackles Abd: obese, S/NT/ND.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The LAD had a 50% lesion after the takeoff of D1.
The D1 had a 60% lesion proximally.
The LCX had a 50% lesion after the high OM1 (which bifurcates).
Limited hemodynamics on entry show mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures (LVEDP 20 mm Hg).
Left ventriculography showed a globally hypokinetic ventricle with a LVEF of 26%.
There was no gradient across the LV on pullback.
Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: 58 yo M with h/o CAD s/p angioplasty in '[**94**] who now returns for repeat cath and aspirin desentization.
CV: A. CAD - Continue Plavix, Lipitor, Metoprolol, Lisinopril.
H/o aspirin allergy - pt underwent aspirin desensitization the night before his catheterization.
He tolerated the protocol well with no complications.
Similarly, his catheterization was tolerated well with no complications and it was felt that the pt has diffusely mild disease that did not require intervention at this time.
B. HTN - continue Imdur, Norvasc, Metoprolol, Lisinopril.
