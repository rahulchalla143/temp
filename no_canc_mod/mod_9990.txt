Admission Date:  [**2107-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-5-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2027-6-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Zocor  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath and cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with no intervention   History of Present Illness: 79-year-old with a history of CAD, with 2VD not candidate for CABG s/p PCI with stent to ostial LAD [**1-/2107**] with residual known proximal 80% Lcx in addition to a history of systolic CHF, COPD and OSA who was transferred from the OSH after admission for NSTEMI complicated by VT/VF which resolved with shock on the day of transfer.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 40800**] presented to OSH yesterday ([**5-18**]) due to worsening SOB, cough productive of whote phlegm and parasternal chest pain which was related to cough and deep breathing but not to exertion or rest without coughing.
This was also associated with some fatigue and chills but not with fever or night sweats.
She denied nasal congestion, sinus pain, ear pain, throat pain, heartburn, diarrhea or urinary symptoms.
She reported orthopnea X 2 pillows, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, nocturia X [**1-5**].
On review of systems, she complained of chronic arthritic pains.
Otherwise, she denied any nausea or vomiting, diaphoresis, fevers, prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, bloody stools and fevers.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
She exhibited signs of florid heart failure (CXR findings and a BNP 1300) and had positive cardiac enzymes (Trop 4.96).
As there was suspicion of a GI bleed (Blood on per-rectal examination, guaiac positive), all anticoagulants and antiplatelets were stopped and she was admitted to the ICU.
Today ([**5-19**]) In the early PM, after eating lunch she was found to be unresponsive and in VTach/VFib.

The DLCO is reduced out of proportion to the reduction in TLC which suggests an interstitial process.
per pulmonary note: has severe COPD with superimposed restriction, severe emphysema by CT scan, obesity, probably OSA.

[**Hospital1 **]-basilar crackles.
ABDOMEN: Soft, mild tenderness in left lower quadrant but no rebound tenderness, no palpable masses.
No cyanosis / clubbing.
SKIN: No rash or eruptions.
NEURO: No focal deficits.
No trauma to head.
Sclera anicteric.
No change in oropharynx.
No carotid bruits.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended no palpable masses.

ECG ([**2107-5-19**] 5:37:24 PM) Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
ST-T wave abnormalities are more marked.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
ST-T wave abnormalities persist.
Anteroapical T wave inversions suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
ECG ([**2107-5-23**] 9:07:36 AM) Sinus rhythm with an atrial premature beat.
Low lateral precordial T wave amplitudes and minor ST-T wave abnormalities in the lateral limb leads.
Since the previous tracing of [**2107-5-22**] ST-T wave abnormalities are now less prominent in the lateral precordial leads and more prominent in the lateral limb leads at a faster rate.
IMAGING: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2107-5-19**] 6:11 PM) FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**1-16**], there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion.
Retrocardiac opacification most likely represents atelectasis with small effusion, though the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
There is pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral diffuse opacifications, which likely represents a combination of pulmonary edema and pleural effusion, but infectious process cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
No pneumothorax is noted.
Unchanged pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema, but pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
Bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged from prior study.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to mild hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls (the anterior septum and anterior free wall are hyeprdynamic).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2107-1-7**], mild posterior and lateral hypokinesis is now present.
Cardiac Cath ([**2107-5-20**]) Coronary angiography showed right dominant system.
LMCA- Short, normal LAD- Stent widely patent, no significant disease LCX- Mild proximal disease, no significant other disease on limited views.
RCA- Mild diffuse disease only.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 40800**], a 79-year-old with a history of CAD, with 2VD not candidate for CABG, s/p PCI with stent to ostial LAD ([**1-/2107**]) with residual known proximal 80% Lcx in addition to a history of systolic CHF, COPD and OSA who was transferred from an OSH after admission for NSTEMI + CHF exacerbation complicated by VT/VF which resolved with shock on the day of transfer.
Patient has a history of CAD with 2VD per cath in [**2107-1-1**]; patient is not a candidate for CABG due to high surgical risk in the setting of severe COPD.
Patient presented to OSH [**5-18**] with lateral and inferior EKG changes and raised troponins suggestive of a new NSTEMI compatible with LCx distribution.
Patient underwent cardiac cath on [**5-23**] which demonstrated widely patent LAD stent, mild non-significant CAD and no culprit for NSTEMI.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to mild hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls (the anterior septum and anterior free wall are hyperdynamic).
Patient remained chest pain free throughout remainder of her stay.
# Acute decompensated sytolic CHF (NYHA Class III): On presentation to OSH CXR showed florid pulmonary congestion.
# RHYTHM.
She developed an episode of VTach/VFib possibly as a complication of her recent NSTEMI.
# COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease on home oxygen therapy (2L/min) and chronic respiratory failure.
Last PFT's Moderate restrictive ventilatory defect with a marked gas exchange defect.
Per pulmonary note: has severe COPD with superimposed restriction, severe emphysema by CT scan, obesity, probably OSA.
Now presenting with worsening cough of 14 days productive of sputum.
Has leukocytosis to 12.5.
No clear infiltrates on CXR except possible small infiltrate at left heart border.
Given her prolonged cough with increased sputum in the setting of risk factors including chronic prednison, severe underlyting lung disease, diabetes, CHF and her age would tend to cover her with Abx for CAP organisms.
# Anemia: Has baseline macrocytic anemia, with Hct ~ 30-31.
In OSH noted to have PR bleeding per-rectal examination and was guiaic positive.
# Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage III).
Patient has history of fatty liver with recent CT demonstrating nodular liver.
Has chronic macrocytosis, low albumin, borderline elevated INR and mild chronic thrombocytopenia.
All suggesting chronic liver disease.
# HTN: Converted to Metoprolol succinate from tartrate and started on Lisinopril for her CHF instead of felodipine.
# Gout: She has some minor joint pain that was treated with Tramadol prn, No evidence of acute flare.
# Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Hydroxychloroquine was held in the context of recent arrythmias as well as ABx treatment with levofloxacin to avoid excess QT prolongation.
