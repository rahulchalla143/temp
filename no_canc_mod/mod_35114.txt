Admission Date:  [**2133-12-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-12-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: AMS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 84 M w/ pmh of known SDH, h/o DVT's, prostate cancer, dementia who presented with ARF, fevers, and hypernatremia (Na 159), found also to have recurrent bilateral lower extremity DVT's.
He was taken down to CT for CT ab/pelvis and CT head which did not show RP or new head bleed.
During a routine check, he was noted to be in respiratory distress and his O2 sats dropped to the 40s.
Past Medical History: - coronary artery disease s/p MI and CABG [**44**] yrs ago - subdural hematoma in [**10/2133**], now s/p emergent burrhole placement x2 on [**2133-11-23**] for acute worsening of hematoma - lower extremity DVT in [**8-/2133**] (now off anticoagulation due to SDH; bliateral LENIs earlier this month show no clot) - colon cancer (stage, therapy, status otherwise unknown) - hyperlipidemia - hypertension - chronic kidney disease, stage II with baseline creatinine 1.2   Social History: lives alone, retired, son either lives with him or nearby, no smoking, no illicit drug use   Family History: Non-Contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 95.9 BP: 129/100 P: 95 R: 23 O2: 100% on 2L NC General: Lethargic, lying on his R side, does not follow commands or give verbal responses HEENT: pinpoint pupils, dry MM Neck: supple, JVP not elevated Lungs: decreased breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: distant heart sounds, regular rate, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2133-12-9**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
Left subdural collection with hyperdense focus anteriorly that is not significantly changed in comparison to [**2133-12-1**], with mass effect upon the cerebral sulci and lateral ventricle.
Small hypodense right subdural collection.
6mm rightward shift of midline structures.
Head CT [**2133-12-11**]:  IMPRESSION: Overall no significant interval change in the extent and size of the left sided subdural with minimal mass effect on the sulci and the ventricle and minimal midline shift as described previously.
No evidence of herniation identified.
Head CT [**2133-12-16**]:  IMPRESSION: Unchanged extent and size of chronic bilateral subdural hematomas and their minimal mass effect and shift of midline structures.
The acute component in the anterior left frontal subdural compartment is unchanged.
No retroperitoneal hematoma or intra-abdominal free gas.
Bilateral atelectasis.
CXR [**2133-12-22**]:   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-21**], there is continued  opacification just above the minor fissure consistent with right upper lobe pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 84 M w/ pmh of recent SDH s/p boreholes X 2, also w/ recurrent DVTs s/p IVC filter, here w/ persistently altered mental status, now s/p hypoxia in the setting of large mucus plugs.
# Hypoxia/Pneumonia: The initial event was thought to be secondary to very large mucus plugs (X 3) as evidenced by suctioning.
Initially his hypoxia resolved, however the patient then developed a large right sided pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.
After discussion with the family, the decision was made to make the patient DNR/DNI as the pneumonia was worsening and his pressor requirement was increasing.
# AMS:  Most likely thought to be secondary to antiseizure medications.
EEG did not show evidence of seizure.
# Recurrent DVTs: stopped coumadin and heparin in the setting of recurrent SDH and unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] loss.
# Recurrent SDH: Likley was the underlying cause of his poor overall functional and mental status.
Per CT head he had no acute bleed.
Speech and swallow would not even evaluate him secondary to his mental status, the patient was maintained on tube feeds.
