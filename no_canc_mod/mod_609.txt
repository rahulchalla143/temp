Family History: Great Aunt with Parkinson's Disease.
Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, masked facies HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Irregularly irRegular rhythm, tachycardic normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema bruising on right lateral calf Neuro: A+OX3   Pertinent Results: CXR [**2197-6-25**]: FINDINGS: Bilateral neural stimulators project over the lower chest.
The lungs are clear of masses or consolidations.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
NCHCT [**2197-6-25**]: FINDINGS: Bilateral deep brain stimulation leads, terminating within a subthalamic region, are unchanged in position or appearance from [**2196-11-21**].
Associated streak artifact limits evaluation.
No intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial infarction is identified.
Minimal periventricular white matter low attenuation is most compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Ventricles and sulci are prominent, likely reflective of age-related atrophy.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
Osseous structures reveal no evidence of fracture.
No acute intracranial process.

# Hypotension: With floridly positive UA and leukocytosis could have urosepsis although other etiologies including cardiac more likely given that lactate was negative and he was hypotensive in the setting of AF with RVR.
Also, hypotension resolved with resolution of RVR.
He was monitored overnight in the ICU and given metoprolol for rate control.
His lisinopril was held in the setting of hypotension and restarted prior to discharge.
# AFib with RVR: His RVR responded to metoprolol and his BP stabilized.
# UTI: UA returned positive and  UCx grew quinolone sensitive ecoli, sensitivities pending.
# RBBB: Likely age-related conduction delay in setting of tachycardia.
PE very unlikely given not hypoxic with no acute respiratory complaints.
Possibly [**3-7**] parkinson's disease with poor balance at baseline per notes in OMR and patient history with new UTI and possibly af with RVR at home.
His celexa was held as a possible contributing factor.
# Chronic LBP: Continued on home regimen of gabapentin and motrin.
Additionally, he was started on a lidocaine patch with improved pain control.
# h/o HTN: As patient initially hypotensive, his lisinopril was held.
After transfer out of the ICU, the patient became hypertensive and his beta blocker was titrated up to 50 mg TID and lisinopril was restarted with improved BP control.
