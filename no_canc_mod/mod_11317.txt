Therefore, it is expected that she will have a short wean period before she can remain off mechanical ventilatory systems permanently.
She had copious secretions, which became even more of a problem with spontaneous breathing trials.
This antibiotic was chosen because a bronchial washing sample was positive for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus precautions were instituted.
The urine sediment was positive for leukocytes and [**Month/Year (2) 23087**], and the urine dipstick showed leukocytes but was nitrite negative.
One other potential source of her fevers could also be sinusitis, as her head MRI showed sinus disease.
Hematology:  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 34 to 25 due to a gastrointestinal bleed, as described below.
Gastrointestinal:  Given the patient's drop in hematocrit, her stool was tested and found to be guaiac positive.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed was confirmed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed erosive gastritis and a non-bleeding ulcer at the pyloric outlet.
In addition to these measures, we also held subcutaneous heparin and instead used Venodynes for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Neurology:  The patient was seen by the Neurology service for a question of mental status change and weakness.
Her weakness was assumed to be multifactorial, with both a neurologic and muscular component.
Electromyogram revealed diffuse axonal neuropathy, but this finding was though to be nonspecific, and no treatment recommendations were offered.
