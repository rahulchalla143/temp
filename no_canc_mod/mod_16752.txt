#GI Bleed: This was most likely a re-bleed from his Dieulafoy's' lesion that was banded last admission.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy did not demonstrate any further bleeding from his previously banded lesion.
Since transfer from the MICU, the patient has not had any further episodes of GI bleeding.
His Plavix was stopped, per cardiology recs, and aspirin is being held for another week in the setting of recent bleeding.
#CAD: The patient has been chest pain free since his admission.
He was ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes.
In the MICU, he was noted to have some lateral ST depressions/TWF, but V4 was suspected to be due to lead placement changes.
His Foley catheter was changed on [**10-23**] without difficulty, and Flomax was restarted.
Secondary to pseudomonas on wound culture, the patient was started on Zosyn to complete a course until [**2146-11-2**].
#AFib: The patient carries a history of atrial fibrillation, status post ablation.
We continued to hold his coumadin in light of his GI bleeding.
Based on thyroid studies from previous admission (high TSH, low T4), the patient may require titration of his medications when not in an acute setting.
# HTN: In the setting of acute bleeding, antihypertensives were initially held, prior to discharge the patients home dose of Imdur and metoprolol.
