Possible developing infarction in the left lower lobe (superior segment).

Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 53899**] is a 65yoF with h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI [**2108**], STEMI [**2113-9-16**] with proximal LAD occlusion treated with BMS, systolic CHF w/ EF 20%, and LLE DVT and multiple pulmonary embolisms.
She had a recent admission for multiple syncopal episodes, complicated by cardiogenic/septic shock with Strep pneumo pneumonia, PE, DVT, and right-sided penumothorax.
# RECURRANT PNEUMOTHORAX - An IJ placed for her original MICU stay was the cause of her initial pneumothorax.
She was discharged to rehab for a short stay but returned with hypoxia and was found to have a recurrent pneumo.
Followup CXRs showed lung reexpansion and the tube was removed on [**10-19**].
CXR on [**10-20**] prior to d/c showed an expanded right lung.
She continued to have slight bleeding from the chest tube site due to her anti-coagulation.
# AIR EMBOLISM - On [**2113-10-17**], her right IJ was removed.
About 1 minute after tube removal, she became acutely hypoxic and tachypneic, with O2 saturation down to 45%.
Presumptive diagnosis of air embolism.
# PULMONARY EMBOLISMS - Diagnosed on prior admission.
# DELIRIUM - She was intermittently delirious throughout her hospital stay, often A+Ox1.
Psychiatry was called for concerns of delirium vs. psych disorder.
If symptoms of depression return, can consider restarting anti-depressants.
# CARDIOGENIC SHOCK - From her previous admission, likely in the setting of PEs and poor LVEF.
Recommendation from cardiology was placement of an ICD for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death, but due to her acute illness, this was deferred.
# COPD - Chronic from many years of smoking, with no indication of worsening status at this time.
No need for plavix anymore.
Statin was held due to elevated LFTs.
# sCHF: LVEF = 25% on TTE from [**2113-10-6**].
No evidence for acute exacerbation at this time.
Repeat TTE around [**2113-10-26**]  # DEPRESSION - Stopped fluoxetine and wellbutrin to minimize polypharmacy and reduce delirium.
Can restart as outpatient if necessary.
# CHRONIC BACK PAIN: Decreased gabapentin to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].
# GERD: Stopped pantoprazole.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS Pneumothorax Air embolism  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS Cardiogenic shock  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Your stay was also complicated by an air embolism caused by the removal of that line that caused difficulty with your breathing.
Medication changes: STOP buproprion, fluoxetine, fexofenadine and fluconazole, since these may have contributed to some confusion  DECREASE gabapentin to 200mg twice a day for pain  STOP pantoprazole START ranitidine 150mg twice a day for heartburn  START albuterol four times a day as needed for shortness of breath START tiotropium daily for COPD START Advair inhalation twice a day for COPD   Followup Instructions: Please contact your primary care physician to schedule [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] after you leave rehab.
