Atrial mechanism is uncertain.
Since the previous tracing of [**2180-5-7**] no significant change.
Increasing alveolar opacities, most consistent with severe pulmonary edema.
Persistent small bilateral effusions.
New left PICC at the level of the mid SVC.
No pneumothorax.
Increasing left lower lobe atelectasis.
- LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) Study Date of [**2180-5-23**] 3:59 PM IMPRESSION: 1.
Mild gallbladder edema and sludge.
No signs of acute cholecystitis.
Dilated hepatic veins and right atrium consistent with right-sided heart failure.
No evidence of obstruction, ileus, or megacolon.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated left and right sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 26mmHg and RVEDP of 12mmHg.
There was moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures with a PASP of 60mmHg.
There was a moderately reduced cardiac index at baseline of 1.79L/min/m2 with significant response to milrinone to 2.16mmHg.
Dilated cardiomyopathy.
Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained six hours earlier during the same day.
The findings are unchanged and characterized by severe pulmonary congestion with perivascular haze and central edema densities.
The catheter is still in an unusual peripheral position and withdrawal was not effective.
No pneumothorax has developed.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 64 yo male PMHx significant for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, s/p ICD placement [**2175**] (v paced), mild-mod MR/TR, DM, ICD, Afib on coumadin, gout, hypothyroidism, CKD p/w vtach and ICD firing, recently admitted for ICD firing, CHF w/ EF 20-25%% who presents from heart failure clinic w/hypotension.
Pt has ?Cdiff w/ continued diarrhea, vomitting and decreased PO intake w/associated dehydration and lethargy after recently being d/c'ed to [**Hospital 100**] rehab facility ~1wk ago.
A discussion was held with both the wife and the patient spelling out the patient's very poor prognosis; cardiac transplant was off the table secondary both to the patient's wishes in addition to his poor compliance in the past.
The patient expired on [**2180-5-27**] at 945 PM  # Hypotension/diarrhea/vomiting/?C diff: Pt reportedly had ?c diff associated diarrhea, nausea/vomiting and decreased PO intake over the last week.
CXR showed significant pulmonary edema but atypical PNA could not be ruled out.
A Swan-Ganz was floated, which showed moderately elevated left and right sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 26mmHg and RVEDP of 12mmHg.
There was moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures with a PASP of 60mmHg.
There was a moderately reduced cardiac index at baseline of 1.79L/min/m2 with significant response to milrinone to 2.16mmHg.
The patient was noted to have nausea controlled with Zofran and Prochlorperazine; nausea was attributed to hepatic congestion secondary to heart failure.
# Pancreatitis: Pt found to have elevated lipase in ED, nause, vomitting.
RUQ US did not show stones or dilation.
# CHF:  Pt has hx of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, s/p ICD placement [**2175**] (v paced), mild-mod MR/TR.
Was recently admitted for CHF exacerbation and ICD firing in setting of running out of meds and non-adherence to low salt diet.
In ED, CXR now showed ?pulm edema vs atypical PNA (started on vanco, flagyl and cefipime on day of admission [**2180-5-23**]).
Pt also has been vomiting so possible aspiration was also complicating the picture.
Pt was given very gentle fluids which improved renal function but pt reported worsening respiratory status and O2 sats began to decline, required sup O2.
# Pulmonary Edema vs ?PNA: pt found to have signs of pulmonary edema but per read can't r/o atypical PNA.
Chest xray was significant for cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema vs ?atypical PNA or both.
These medications were subsequently DC'ed after the patient was found to be C. Diff negative and was not displaying any other signs of infection such as fever or WBC count.
# Hyponatremia: tends to run low, baseline around low 130s.
[**Month (only) 116**] be worse in setting of dehydration.
# Gout: Has a history of severe gout; did not require colchine on this admission.
