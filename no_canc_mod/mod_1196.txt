Admission Date:  [**2154-9-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2154-9-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2112-9-15**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 41 year-old man previously admitted on [**2151-10-22**] for alcoholic pancreatitis leading to adult respiratory distress syndrome and tracheostomy complicated by Pseudomonas pneumonia, pancreatic necrosis, C-diff colitis, line sepsis, left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis, Haldol induced thrombocytopenia and decubitus ulcer.
He was readmitted [**2154-2-22**] for subacute renal failure with creatinine increase to 11.8 and was dialyzed and discharged with an improving creatinine.
The course of events began two days prior to presentation when he had approximately six fried clams while on [**Location (un) **].
Within approximately one hour he began having nausea and vomiting of nonbloody material.
He also had left sided abdominal pain without radiation.
One day prior to presentation he developed fever and chills with increasing weakness and was advised by his primary care physician to come to the Emergency Department.
He was also noted to have an elevated creatinine to 4.2.
CT scan of the abdomen was performed while in the Emergency Department, which showed multiple abnormalities of the pancrease with calcifications in head, hypodense lesion within the body consistent with pseudocyst versus neoplasm.
He was also noted to have left renal stone in pelvis with right renal stone and proximal ureter causing hydronephrosis and perinephric stranding.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring, diabetic ketoacidosis, possible urosepsis secondary to nephrolithiasis.
History of acute pancreatitis [**2151-10-22**].
History of acute renal failure in [**2152-2-22**].
History of adult respiratory distress syndrome in [**2151-10-22**].
Obstructive sleep apnea on home BiPAP.
Diabetic foot ulcers.
Peripheral neuropathy.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for diabetes.
No history of elicit drug use.
In general, the patient is a mildly obese man in no acute distress.
He had no scleral icterus.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.
He had no costovertebral angle tenderness.
He had no appreciable bladder distention.
Rectal examination he had hemorrhoids with enlarged firm prostate guaiac positive stools.
A perianal sinus tract was noted with small furuncles.
There was no edema.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 41 year-old man with a history of type 1 diabetes, history of acute pancreatitis and chronic renal insufficiency presenting with fever, bandemia, hydronephrosis and hypotension.
He was noted to have a urinalysis consistent with infection and was found to have three or four blood cultures bottles positive for E-coli.
He was treated for pyelonephritis and urosepsis with Rocephin.
DIC panel was performed, which showed elevated coags, FDP and D-dimer, but elevated fibrinogen and unremarkable hemolysis studies.
It was thought that the DIC picture was likely secondary to bacteremia.
An MRI was performed, which showed pancreatic pseudocyst and obstructed right collecting system with hydronephrosis.
Gram positive coxae were noted by gram stain and the patient was started on Vancomycin.
Nephrology was consulted and felt that the acidemia was multifactorial with diarrhea, renal failure and sepsis playing a predominant role.
A renal ultrasound was performed, which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis at that point.
Once acute issues stabilized general surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] for evaluation of pancreatic pseudocyst.
Surgery felt appropriate evaluation would include outpatient endoscopic ultrasound to be performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8871**].
No etiology was identified and it was thought that low platelets were most likely secondary to malnutrition.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Bilateral nephrolithiasis with right hydronephrosis.
Acute on chronic renal failure.
Diabetes type 2.
Acute tubular necrosis.
Pancreatic pseudocyst.
Thrombocytopenia resolved.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
