Right middle and lower lobe opacity and right pleural effusion.
Correlation with any possible history of instrumentation in this region is also recommended.
[**2183-11-20**]:  Thyroid US The right thyroid lobe measures 1.7 x 2.1 cm at the level of the isthmus and no nodules are seen within it.
The nodule has a hypoechoic rim, however also demonstrates increased color flow.
IMPRESSION: Dominant nodule in the left lobe as described above.
She was continued on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community pneumonia coverage and was kept on supplemental O2 to keep her O2 sat > 94%.
The pt's hypotension improved w/ aggressive IV hydration and she did not require pressors.
Per ID recs, a repeat set of blood cultures were drawn, a sputum gram stain and culture, legionella urine antigen , and mycoplasma serologies were sent.
The legionella urinary antigen was negative and gram stain of the sputum showed no organisms.
Her central line was removed on HD#4 without difficulty and a midline was placed for continuing antibiotics.
However, her maximum temperature within the past 24 hours was 100.6F.
Given the pt's ongoing intermittent low-grade fevers as well as the serious nature of her pneumonia, she was counseled regarding staying in the hospital for another 1-2 days for further monitoring by both Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Doctor Last Name 13675**]) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (Infectious Disease).
