He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative except patient has had nasal congestion and mild cough with URI for past week and a half.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Stress echo: 1. average exercise tolerance for age 2.Normal HR and BP response to exercise 3.ST depression of 1.5mm however, baseline EKG had nonspecific T wave changes, thus decreasing the specificity of the EKG 4.Echo images reported separately.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had diffuse disease with an intra-myocardial portion.
There is a large D1 with a mid-segment tubular 90% lesion and a 90% proximal lesion.
The dominant RCA had a focal 90% proximal lesion.
There was no transaortic gradient on pullback of catheter from LV to aorta.
Left ventriculogram demonstrated no significant mitral or aortic regurgitation.
Calculated LVEF was 56% without wall motion abnormalities.
[**2118-9-5**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound No stenosis of the carotid arteries bilaterally.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is myomatous degeneration of the mitral valve.
Moderate prolapse of the posterior mitral valve leaflet.
Mild prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed severe multi-vessel disease.
Given the severity of her disease the cardiac surgical  service was consulted for surgical management.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which was negative for stenosis of the carotid arteries bilaterally.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed mild symmetric LVH with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function and mild prolapse of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with trivial mitral regurgitation.
During her post-operative course she developed numerous bouts of paroxysmal rapid atrial fibrillation.
