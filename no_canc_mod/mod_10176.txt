Admission Date:  [**2157-7-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2157-7-14**]   Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 82-year-old man with history of borderline hypertension recently discharged from an outside hospital approximately two weeks ago with a new diagnosis of CHF.
The patient denied nausea or vomiting.
Cardiology consultation:  Echocardiogram revealed biventricular failure.
The patient did have slightly elevated troponin of 0.6.
The ICU course was complicated by periods of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
On the medical floor, the patient complained of mild exertional shortness of breath, denied chest pain, nausea or vomiting.
The patient denied any history of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, or recent immobility prior to this admission.
The patient did report one episode of right upper quadrant pain the prior day in the MICU, which lasted ten minutes and it was now resolved.
Congestive heart failure.
There was no family history of MI, sudden death, or coagulopathy.
1/6 systolic ejection murmur at LUSB.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with slight crackles at bases.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema, no calf tenderness.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended, active bowel sounds, no organomegaly.
Chest x-ray:  [**7-5**], no evidence of failure or pneumonia.
EKG: [**2157-7-6**]:  Sinus rhythm at 84, normal axis, LVH with 4 mm to [**Street Address(2) 1755**] depression laterally.
PE/PULMONARY:  The patient had high probability PE on VQ scan likely leading to right heart failure, congestion.
The patient's oxygen saturations gradually improved to about 95% to 96% on two liters with slight desaturation on room air to approximately 94%.
PSA screen for malignancy as a possible cause for the coagulopathy revealed PSA of 3.6.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has biventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram associated with acute PE.
The patient's LV dysfunction likely secondary to a combination of severe RV dysfunction on inherent changes in the left ventricular associated with CAD/ischemia and hypertension.
The patient was monitored on telemetry for episodes of PVCs and short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had episode of right upper quadrant pain associated with elevation in LFTs.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed large amounts of sludge within the gallbladder without evidence of cholecystitis, and normal appearance of the liver.
The patient was encouraged to follow a low-fat diet and followup with PCP for possible future cholecystectomy.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient initially had elevated WBCs, which gradually resolved, likely secondary to stress response.
Congestive heart failure 3.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Due to elevated INR of 3.9, Coumadin was held until the follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
