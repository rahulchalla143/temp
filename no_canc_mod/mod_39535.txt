He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 346**] with a recent admission for gastroparesis and upper gastrointestinal bleed.
He now returns with nausea, vomiting but no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no melena, no bright red blood per rectum, no coffee ground emesis.
His electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department showed ST elevations in V2 and V3 which were unchanged from previous electrocardiogram.
He continued to be greatly hypertensive in the Emergency Department with additional complaints of light-headedness which necessitated direct admission to the CCU.
Diabetes mellitus type 1.
Severe gastroparesis requiring multiple admissions in the past, gastric emptying study in [**2181-7-14**], reveals severe gastroparesis.
Gastritis with negative H. pylori.
Esophageal ulcer.
Coronary artery disease.
Hypertension which has been exceptionally difficult to control.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient is somewhat somnolent.
Cardiovascular - tachycardia, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally with poor respiratory effort.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
No liver edge.
Extremities no edema, good 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
Chest x-ray revealed no acute process.
Head CT revealed no acute bleed or mass lesion.
At this point, autonomous testing was arranged and the patient was found to have severe autonomic dysfunction.
On the medical floor, his blood pressure was well controlled and although a little bit elevated around 140 to 160 systolic, it showed no fluctuation which has been so troubling to him in the past.
Gastrointestinal - The patient had little to no complaints of gastrointestinal upset, nausea or vomiting.
Renal - He remained relatively stable from the renal standpoint with no fluctuation in creatinine.
Endocrine - The patient was seen by the [**Last Name (un) **] consult service who felt he might have a flat [**Last Name (un) **] type I B diabetes mellitus.
Apparently historically, he has responded somewhat to oral hypoglycemics in the past suggesting that he might not have typical type 1 picture.
Autonomic dysfunction.
Hypertensive urgency.
