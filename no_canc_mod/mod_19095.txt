No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Conclusions Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened, with servere focal calicification at the commisures.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Post Bypass: Patient is in sinus rhythm, requiring no ionotropes.
There is a small paravalvular leak at interface with anterior leaflet of mitral valve (seen best on mid esophageal AV short axis view).

Discharge Instructions: 1)  Monitor wounds for signs of infection.
These include redness, drainage or increased pain.
In the event that you have drainage from your sternal wound, please contact the [**Name2 (NI) 5059**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1504**].
4)  No lotions, creams or powders to incision until it has healed.
Gently pat the wound dry.
8) Coumadin for mechanical aortic valve - Check INR [**10-3**] results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 75950**]@ [**Numeric Identifier 75951**].
