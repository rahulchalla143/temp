She initially presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 11560**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**4-30**] after she experienced diapheresis, chest tightness, headache, shortness  of breath, and hypotension (80s) during a dialysis session.
These symptoms at dialysis have been progressive with each dialysis session.
A "few weeks ago," she began to develop nausea during HD.
Last week, she developed nausea with chest tightness, diaphoresis, dizziness within 30-40 min into HD.
On subsequent HD sessions, these symptoms progressively began earlier in the sessions.
Thus, it was felt that she may be having an allergic reaction to something during HD.
On Monday, they switched her dialyzer to non-polysulfone, however as soon as the HD started she developed diaphoresis, dropped her SBP to 90s, became nauseous with chest tightness.
She had a hematology consult done prior to transfer for hypereosinophilia; recommendations included solumedrol to supress Eos and consideration of BM bx if no improvement.
When questioned, the patient states that she has been on and off antibiotics since [**Month (only) **] for "bacteria in her blood."
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

# Hypereosinophilia: It was initially felt that her hypereosinophilia was a result of hypersenitivity to the ethylene oxide dialyzer membrane or tubing.
Additionally, the patient was pre-medicated prior to dialysis with famotidine, singulair, hydroxyzine and IV solumedrol to prevent further reactions.
Baseline lab data from her PCP indicated eosinophilia lasting at least 3 years.
On the floor, she had three additional dialysis runs with premedication that showed no evidence of allergic reaction to the dialysis.
# DM II: Consultants from the [**Hospital **] clinic helped managed her blood sugars throughout her hospitalization, which flucutuated significantly due to the intermitted steroids required for dialysis.
The patient has follow-up scheduled at [**Last Name (un) **] for further work-up.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with an allergic-like reaction to dialysis.
We treated this reaction by giving you medications prior to dialysis.
During your hospitalization, we discovered you had elevated levels of blood cells commonly responsible for allergic types of reactions, called eosinophils.
ESRD/Dialysis--She will need to continue her premedication regimen of famotidine, singulair, and hydroxyzine 1 hour prior to each dialysis run to prevent allergic reactions in the future.
Hypereosinophilia work-up--she will need to arrange for follow-up on her hypereosinophilia to continue to evaluate the cause of her baseline elevated eosinophil levels.
