There is no significant midline shift.
There is bilateral frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage (series 2, images 9, 11).
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is also seen in the right temporal area (series 2, image 5; series 401b, images 15, 20, 44).
There are non-depressed and non-displaced fractures of the left frontal bone (series 3, image 41) and right occipital bone (series 3A, image 22), with the latter extending to the skull base (series 3A, image 4).
There is pneumocephalus about the occiput (series 3A, image 19).
Pneumocephalus is also seen posterior and anterior to the right temporal bone (series 3A image 10) with a non- displaced horizontal fracture of the right temporal bone (series 401b, image 54) identified.
There partial opacification of the mastoid and epitympanum of the right.
In the soft tissues overlying the left occiput there is an 8 x 10-mm heterogeneous lesion containing calcifications (series 2, image 7).
Similarly, there is a 1.2 x 1.8-cm heterogeneous soft tissue lesion containing punctate calcifications in the right frontal scalp towards the vertex (series 2, image 24).
Soft tissue swelling is seen overlying the left frontal area.
Non-depressed, non-displaced fractures of the left frontal, right occipital and right temporal bones with pneumocephalus.
Extension of the occipital bone fracture to the skull base is noted.
Left inferior frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage without associated shift and bifrontal, left parietal, and right temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine.
Skull fractures with one extending to the base, and horizontal fracture of the right temporal bone and pneumocephalus, please refer to the head CT from earlier today.
No evidence for new hemorrhage.
There is increased edema surrounding the left inferior frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, but again no significant mass effect is present.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is also unchanged.
Multiple nondisplaced skull fractures are redemonstrated, better appreciated on initial head CT. 3.
Multiple soft tissue lesions, consistent with sebaceous or epidermoid cysts.
As seen on the CT, there is hemorrhagic contusion identified involving both inferior frontal lobes, left greater than right side.
There are bilateral small subdurals identified at the parietal occipital region measuring not more than 3 mm in width and are not seen on the previous CT in retrospect.
There is increased signal identified on FLAIR images along the convexity sulci indicative of subarachnoid blood.
Small areas of increased signal in the occipital horns bilaterally on FLAIR images indicate a small amount of blood products in the ventricles.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
Probable sebaceous cysts are seen in the right parietal region.
IMPRESSION: Findings indicative of bilateral inferior frontal hemorrhagic contusions.
Subarachnoid blood and intraventricular blood.
No midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Tiny bilateral parietal occipital subdural hematomas.
Soft tissue swelling over the skull.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 77	138	92	372/401	66	0	20  EEG [**3-15**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of focal slow transients involving the left anterior to mid-temporal region; this abnormality typically correlates with an area of subcortical dysfunction.
The background slowing could be related to a number of conditions including: mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, traumatic, or anoxic etiology, diffuse lesions of deep white matter or midline structures, or excessive drowsiness.
No evidence of ongoing or potential epileptogenesis was seen at the time of this recording.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
On the right there is mild homogenous plaque in the ICA.
On the left there is mild heterogenous plaque in the ICA.
Impression: Right ICA stenosis less than 40%.
Left ICA stenosis less than 40%.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 74F admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] neurosurgery following a syncopal event on [**2193-3-14**].
She sustained ICH and non-depressed skull fracture in the event.
Bilateral carotid duplex, and TTE were performed and found to be negative in causation of syncopal event.
During chart review and history, it was determined that the patient's PCP had recently made changes to her antihypertiensive medications, and this is presumed to be the likely cause of the event.
EEG was also performed to rule out any occult seizure activity, which was also benign.
