He had experienced this symptom intermittently over the past year.
Pain then began to shoot down left arm and was associated with numbness over the next two days.
There were no alleviating or exacerbating factors; pain was intermittent and not associated with movement.
Pain usually began at work, and he was able to work through it.
Upon further questioning, patient endorsed chest pressure, especially with exertion at work as a chef, for past few days.
An ECG showed sinus bradycardia in the 50s and Q waves in II, III, aVF, V5-6 with 0.5mm STEs.
Patient reports having chest pain over the last 2-3 days that he worked through.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - peroneal tenosynovitis - hepatitis C   Social History: Works as a chef at seafood restaurant in [**Location (un) 745**].
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Positive Spurling's maneuver and positive shoulder abduction relief test.
There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Q waves in the inferolateral leads.
Inferolateral myocardial infarctionk, age indeterminate.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

No progressive arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study.
He did note [**4-10**] left shoulder and elbow discomfort in recovery that lasted for a minute.
No other ST segment changes were observed throughout the study.
IMPRESSION: Atypical symptoms in recovery only in the absence of significant ST segment changes.
The test was stopped because of fatigue.
In response to stress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see exercise report for details).
These demonstrated normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Doppler demonstrated no aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant mitral regurgitation or resting LVOT gradient.
These demonstrated appropriate augmentation of all left ventricular segments.
There was augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion.
No ECG or 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved workload.
Brief Hospital Course: 51M with PMH significant for DM2 and HLD who presents with chest/neck pain, left arm numbness, found to have Qwaves and STE in inferior and lateral leads.
# Chest pain: Patient was initially admitted with chest and neck pain radiating down his left arm along with ST elevations and Q waves in the inferior leads with concern for STEMI and was started on ASA, plavix, integrillin gtt, nitro gtt with minimal improvement.
Upon further investigation, his pain was noted to be reproducible by physical exam, namely by pressing down on his head and turning his neck to the left.
He also complained of numbness and tingling of his left fingers.
His pain was relieved by placing his hand above his head.
These maneuvers were classic for the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy (Spurling's maneuver and shoulder abduction relief test).
Nonetheless, due to the EKG changes, atypical chest pain, and diabetes, he still underwent an exercise stress echo.
He achieved good functional capacity (9 mets) with a RPP >25,000 and the stress and imaging results were negative for a myocardial ischemic syndrome.
# Cervical radiculopathy: This was felt to be the true cause of his original chest/neck pain.
He denied any recent trauma, falls, increase in exertion, fevers, chills, weight loss, injection drug use, cancer history, HIV history, bowel/bladder or any other concerning symptoms.
We gave him specific instructions to return to the hospital immediately with any worsening of his pain, numbness, tingling, or especially if he had new weakness.
# Hepatitis C: Last followed up in liver clinic and biopsy in [**2175**] showed grade [**3-5**] inflammation, moderate steatosis without hyalin and stage 2-3 fibrosis.
)(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Cervical Radiculopathy Type II Diabetes Hepatitis C   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We were able to rule out dangerous causes such as a heart attack with blood tests.
We think your chest arm and neck pain are secondary to a condition called cervical radiculopathy, and we arranged to have you seen Monday in neurology clinic for this.
