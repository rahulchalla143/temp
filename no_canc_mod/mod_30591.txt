Admission Date:  [**2138-2-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-2-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Keflex / Clindamycin / Vancomycin / Lipitor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**] Chief Complaint: Cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 88F h/o CHF, Afib on coumadin, AAA s/p repair p/w worsening productive cough x 4 weeks associated with mild dyspnea over the past 24 hours.
Her cough has been persistent with yellow-white sputum.
No fevers or chills reported.
The patient has chronic LE swelling that is unchanged.
Exam notable for rales and poor air movement.
CXR consistent with RLL PNA and minimal CHF and started on levaquin for presumed CAP.
Also noted to have diffuse fine maculopapular rash (?allergic reaction) although no new meds, foods, or skin irritants and was given 60mg prednisone.
Her ABG at that time was consistent with chronic CO2 retention (7.42/72/175 w/ HCO3 38 taken earlier in day).
Neuro called to evaluate known myopathy and possible contribution to chronic hypoventilation.
Of note, no h/o smoking or asthma.
The patient has chronic LE swelling that is unchanged.
History of breast cancer status post ressection in [**2124**].
She  has had no further issues.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic venous stasis.
Recurrent cellulitis 10.
Chronic LE skin ulcers 11.
Generallized myopathy with chronic generalized axonal neuropathy (proximal muscle weakness and difficulty ambulating).
EMG [**2137-7-17**] showed chronic, generalized myopathy affecting upper greater than lower extremities as well as evidence for a mild, chronic, generalized axonal polyneuropathy affecting large diameter sensory fibers.
Family History: There is an extensive history of cardiac disease.
SKIN: Diffuse erythematous rash on neck, back, thighs HEENT: op clear, mmm, no lad.
CV: Irregularly irregular, tachycardic, nl S1/S2, no m/r/g.
EXT: Warm, 2+ pitting edema to knees bilaterally.
CXR ([**2-21**]): Since most recent film, there is new opacification involving a large segment of the right lower lobe containing air bronchograms and probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is slight prominence to the right main pulmonary artery as noted on prior CT, which may be reflective of underlying pulmonary hypertension.
Left lung remains clear, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Heart size is enlarged but unchanged as is calcification within the tortuous thoracic aorta and a large hiatus hernia.
Cardiomegaly with no evidence of failure.
LENIs, bilateral ([**2-21**]): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
There is an echodensity seen posterior to left atrium in some views that may represent an extracardiac mass.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 88F h/o CHF, AFib, s/p AAA repair p/w RLL pneumonia.
# PNA: Hypoxic with RLL opacity on CXR at presentation.
Started on levoquin in ED for CAP, but given patient coming from recent rehab setting and multiple recent hospital admissions there was concern for hospital-acquired pathogens.
ABG consistent with metabolic alkalosis and chronic respiratory acidosis without known prior h/o lung disease (no known COPD or smoking history).
However, the patient is s/p XRT for breast CA and has evidence of post-XRT changes by chest CT as well as a proximal myopathy of unknown significance and borderline NIF (max effort -24), raising a question of neuropathic or muscular contribution for which Neurology was consulted (see below).
Continued to have elevated bicarb possibly due to metabolic compensation as well as volume contraction.
Started on prednisone in MICU for wheezing on examination which has since resolved and will complete a short taper.
# Proximal muscle weakness: Evaluated in [**2137**], currently of unclear etiology.
EMG ([**7-18**]) consistent with chronic, generalized myopathy.
She has never had a muscle biopsy and has normal CKs.
Neurology was consulted and believes primary myopathy most significant contributor, but also noted to have underlying polyneuropathy.
Statin was discontinued as could possibly be contributing but no evidence of myositis on labs.
# Ischemia: CP free.
Chronic b/l edema with venous stasis changes, and negative LENIs in ED.
# Anemia: Normocytic and chronic.
Prior iron studies c/w Anemia of chronic inflamation.
No new meds or other known precipitants.
Suspect drug rash based on appearance and history notable for rashes to multiple medications.
# Coagulopathy: On coumadin at home.
# Hypertension: SBP 100's.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
Atrial fibrillation 2.
History of breast cancer status post ressection 6.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic venous stasis 8.
Chronic LE skin ulcers 9.
Generalized myopathy with chronic generalized axonal neuropathy  Discharge Condition: Good.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with cough productive of sputum and a rash of approximately 3 weeks in duration.
