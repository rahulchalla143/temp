[**2172-10-21**] Cardiac Catheterization  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 4223**] is a 65 year old female who underwent bare metal stenting to her diagonal artery in [**2172-4-9**], presented to [**Hospital1 9191**] with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Subsequent stress testing revealed 2mm ST depressions.
Past Medical History: Coronary artery disease s/p bare metal stent to diagonal [**4-16**], Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, Thoracic outlet syndrome s/p bilateral removal of 1st rib, s/p Hysterectomy and bladder resuspension, s/p left knee surgery, s/p Tonsillectomy, s/p TMJ surgery, s/p Appendectomy  Social History: Denies tobacco history.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: [**2172-10-21**] Cardiac Cath: Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel disease.
The LMCA was a small vessel but free of significant stenoses.
The LAD had a complex 90% in-stent restenosis of the diagonal branch and a 90% long LAD stenosis after D1.
The LCx and RCA had mild luminal irregularities but no angiographically significant stenoses.
[**2172-10-21**] Carotid Ultrasound: Normal carotid study [**2172-10-26**] Intraop TEE: PRE BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild septal and apical hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST BYPASS:Normal right ventricular systolic function.
The left ventricle now displays moderate to severe hypokinesis of the mid and distal septal, inferoseptal, anteroseptal and apical walls.
The mitral regurgitation is slightly worse, now bordering on mild to moderate.
The tricuspid regurgitation is also worsened, now at least moderate.
[**10-30**] CXR: Right pleural effusion is small, left pleural effusion is small to moderate.
There is mild fluid overload.
There are bibasilar atelectasis.
The following day she underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe single vessel coronary artery disease.
She continued to recover without any post-op complication and worked with physical therapy for strength and mobility.
