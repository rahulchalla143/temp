Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 26172**] is a 79 year-old woman with a history of COPD who returns to ICU after one day at rehab with dyspnea and hemoptysis vs. GIB.
# Pneumonia / Dyspnea: Patient was recently admitted for dyspnea and found to have severe left side pneumonia in addition to end-stage COPD.
Underlying malignancy was also considered given recurrent pneumonias since [**2111**], but this was not worked up further given that patient did not want escalation of care on previous admission.
She was readmitted with hypoxemia and hemoptysis.
During her MICU course, palliatve care was reconsulted and we continued zyprexa, ativan, clonazepam and dilaudid as needed to control her symptoms of dyspnea.
She came to the floor and did well for a few days, but then started to develop severe symptomatic air hunger.
She was transitioned to dilaudid drip for intermittent bouts of anxiety and awareness with severe air hunger.
# Hemoptysis / anemia: Patient has had ongoing hemoptysis likely in the setting of her pneumonia, COPD and possible underlying malignancy.
She had scant hemoptysis and no melenic stool while in MICU.
Patient was previously treated for COPD exacerbation with prednisone 60 mg daily for 5 days during last admission.
