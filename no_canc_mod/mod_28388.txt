Admission Date:  [**2124-7-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-7-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-3-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Generalized convulsion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation, EEG with sphenoid electrodes  History of Present Illness: 19 year-old right-handed gentleman without significant past medical history who presented with seizure.
At some point, he told his friend that he did not feel well, and shortly thereafter he had what was described as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
He routinely uses this polish with a mask and goggles; yesterday, he removed his goggles only very briefly.
Just before the seizure, he reported seeing flashing lights on the right and he felt like somebody was behind him, associated with a scarry feeling.
He had no focal twitching, weakness and reports no abdominal sensations or odors.
He has no h/o seizures, febrile or otherwise.
He has no h/o LOC or concussions or other head trauma.
He has been in his USOH until this episode, with the exception of an ear infection 2 weeks ago, for which he took an unknown antibiotic.
Per the pt's father, there is no history of seizure in the past, including febrile seizures during childhood.
He has never sustained a head injury or loss of consciousness.
He did note that one week ago, the pt complained of an ear ache.
He also intermittently had fever and chills.
Past Medical History: None (prior ear infection 2 weeks ago)  Social History: Social Hx: He cleans airplanes for a living and is also going to school.
Family History: Family Hx: No history of seizure or other neurologic disease.
Many maternal family members with diabetes mellitus.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 99.5F 87 141/56 100% 26 General: Lying in bed HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Cervical collar in place Pulmonary: Lungs with transmitted sounds bilaterally Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Language normal and fluent with no paraphasias or difficulty naming.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
EOM full, no nystagmus.
He had no further seizures and was extubated without event.
On awakening, the patient gave a history of a focal onset, with a fear sensation, visual hallucinations of bright flashing lights on the right, and a feeling that somebody was behind him.
EEG showed L frontal slowing that was occasionally bilateral, but no epileptiform discharges.
It also showed a HR of 48, but there were no events on telemetry and HR ranged in the 50-60's in sinus rhythm.
He should avoid operating heavy machinery and unsupervised swimming, or any other activity where it would be very dangerous for him to have a seizure.
After discussion with the patient, it was decided that although this is his first seizure, the prior episodes argue for a partial focus.
Lumbar puncture on admission showed only 5 WBCs, no poly's and negative gram stain.
