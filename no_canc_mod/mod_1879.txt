No hydronephrosis or perinephric fludi collection.
Elevated post-void bladder residual of 234 cc.
Recommend clinical correlation and consider nonurgent urology consult if concern for bladder outlet obstruction.

[**2140-3-3**], EGD: friability and erythema in esophagus c/w esophagitis, but no varices.
Small hiatal hernia.
Brief Hospital Course: 60M with ESRD s/p renal transplant [**2135**], DM2, HTN, and chronic pancreatitis admitted with N/V, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hyperglycemia and acute on chronic renal failure.
Hematemesis: Given history of antecedent vomiting, most likely secondary to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear but differential diagnosis also included PUD, gastritis, AVM, Dielafeuoy's, variceal bleed.
Has h/o ETOH use and HCV but no known history of varices or cirrhosis/portal HTN.
Pt eventually had EGD on [**2140-3-3**] that revealed esophagitis, no varices.
Pt had no further hematemesis during admission, and although stool remained guaiac positive, HCT remained stable.
N/V/abdominal pain: Likely secondary to acute on chronic pancreatitis given prior history and elevated lipase 190 but unclear trigger if no recent ETOH intake.
Received vanco and zosyn in ED, but no evidence of cholecystitis on U/S, so defered further antibiotics.
Remained afebrile during admission.
Abd pain resolved upon arrival to the ICU.
Acute on chronic renal failure s/p renal transplant: Patient presenting with acute on chronic renal failure, Cr 3.5 from previous baseline 1.8-2.0 s/p prior renal transplant.
Clinical history of N/V and BUN/Cr ratio 40 consistent with prerenal etiology.
DM2/Hyperglycemia: Patient has h/o Type 2DM on insulin at home.
He presented with elevated blood sugars in the days prior to admission, likely in the setting of pancreatitis +/- infection.
Tachycardia: Initial tachycardia was likely secondary to hypovolemia from blood loss as well as N/V.
Resolved with fluid repletion.
No events on telemetry.
Once beta-blocker was re-initiated, tachycardia resolved.
Altered mental status/Delirium: Altered mental status on admission likely secondary to uremic encephalopathy and GIB given asterixis on exam.
Differential also included infection, ETOH withdrawal.
Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: AG 19 on arrival with low bicarb, likely secondary to elevated lactate and renal failure +/- DKA.
9. h/o hepatitis C: No acute issues; has no h/o cirrhosis.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Tear versus esophagitis -Hyperglycemia -Acute renal failure  Secondary: -End-Stage Renal Disease s/p Renal Transplant [**6-/2135**] (baseline Cre 1.8-2.5) -Pancreatitis -h/o Hepatitis C -Hypertension -Osteoarthritis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You didn't have any further vomiting while you were in the hospital, but you continued to have stool that tested positive for blood.
You had an endoscopic procedure (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) that showed some inflammation of the esophagus, but no other serious findings.
These medications can cause further bleeding in the intestinal tract.
