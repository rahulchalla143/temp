Right wrist: Two views show distal radius fracture with approximately 4-mm stepoff at the articular surface of the radius.
There is also ulnar styloid fracture.
Left wrist: Two views show no evidence of a distal radius fracture.
No comparison studies.
CT HEAD NON-CONTRAST:  No definite intracranial hemorrhage is seen.
There is no evidence of mass effect.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Along the right temporal and frontal aspect of the skull, there is a large extracranial soft tissue density likely representing hematoma and swelling.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
No comparison studies.
Lung windows demonstrate partial collapse of the right greater than left upper lobes.
Within the left middle lung field, there is a focal linear area of opacity, which may represent a small contusion.
There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion of high attenuation likely representing hematoma.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax, or pericardial effusion.
No active extravasation is seen within the liver--Grade III.
Within the spleen, there are multiple areas of low attenuation that are linear likely representing laceration.
Adjacent to the spleen, there is a large hematoma with an area of high attenuation very concerning for active extravasation.
On delayed images, this area is more diffusely spread consistent with active extravasation.
On delayed images, there also appears to be increased volume of hematoma within the pericolic gutters.
No gross small or large bowel abnormalities are noted.
There is a small amount of free fluid seen within the mesentery.
BONES: At the level of T7, there is a fracture through the the vertebral body extending through the pedicles, left and right lamina the right transverse process and the spinous process.
Included within this fracture plane are a fracture through the superior end plate of T8.
There is also an avulsion fracture of the spinous process of T6.
This distribution is unstable and is consistent with a hyperflexion injury.
No fragments are seen within the spinal canal.
There are also small right transverse process fractures seen in T8 and T9.
Moderate right hemothorax.
Small left middle lung field contusion.
Right greater than left upper lobe partial collapse.
Moderate-sized liver laceration in segment 7 and segment 8 with no evidence of active extravasation.
Moderate perihepatic hematoma.
Moderate-sized splenic laceration.
Moderate perisplenic hematoma with marked active extravasation.
Also avulsion fracture of T6 spinous process.
These likely were due to hyperflexion injury.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 28 year old woman with MVC and difficulty clearing clinically.
INDICATION: 28-year-old woman with status post MVC with difficulty clearing secretions, evaluate for ligamentous injury.
There is no evidence of acute fracture.
No evidence of reduced listhesis or instability on the flexion or extension views.
Thoracic paravertebral stabilization rods noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of ligamentous injury; C1 through the superior endplate of C6 evaluated.
Plastic surgery consulted for chin/lip laceration which was sutured.
Orthopedic surgery consulted because of her wrist injuries, she was taken to the OR on [**5-6**] for ORIF of her wrist fracture.
Vascular surgery consulted to rule out any vascular injury to RUE; angiogram not indicated given stable exam.
Orthopedic Spine surgery consulted because of the thoracic fractures, no operative intervention.
Patient was custom fitted for a TLSO brace which she will need to wear when ambulating.
Pain control was an issue early during her hospital course, she was eventually transitioned from PCA to oral Dilaudid which has been effective in relieving her pain.
Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted early during her hospitalization and have recommended short rehab stay.
Social work was consulted because of her psychiatric and substance abuse history, her home meds, Seroquel and Methadone were restarted.
