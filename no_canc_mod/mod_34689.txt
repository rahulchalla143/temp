Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 23 year old man with a longstanding seizure history, presenting in status epilepticus.
The increase in frequency of his seizures could be multifactorial, such as alcohol dependence or metabolic/infectious exacerbation but most likely poor compliance with his medications given report per Mom and past hx.
Upon arrive, patient was already extubated and without any respiratory distress but given report of 13 seizures prior to admission at [**Hospital3 **], he was admitted to the ICU initially.
He remained intermittently combative overnight but had no observed seizure events.
Head CT was repeated without any acute issues.
His EEG telemetry started in the morning while in the ICU showing no seizure activity.
Several seizures were captured, which seemed to have a right frontal onset.
Prior to removal on one occasion he was found to have a lot of increased seizure activity which was felt to cause or contribute to his agitation.
He had a presurgical evaluation with ictal SPECT and interictal SPECT with increased uptake in the deep right temporal region ictally.
He was treated with standing ativan while tapering AEDs for seizure control, but he still required prn ativan for increased seizures or agitation on occasion.
During admission he was evaluated by psychiatry and not concidered to have the capacity to leave AMA.
He expressed continued desire to go home despite poor seizure control.
We also discussed the importance of not stopping his medications without supervision by his epileptologist and that this would put him at high risk of seizures and status epilepticus.
