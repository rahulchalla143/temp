PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease - [**2177**] with a proximal LAD stent and in [**2183-6-15**] with a PTCA of her ramus and OM1.
Echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 205**] showed a new ejection fraction of 55 to 60 percent with mild left atrial enlargement and a stress test in [**Month (only) 205**] showed normal perfusion after three minutes of exercise and was stopped secondary to angina.
3) Increased cholesterol.
4) Question of transient ischemic attack.
5) Peptic ulcer disease.
However, the patient went into a supraventricular tachycardia on the morning of [**2183-8-21**].
Approximately three to four hours later in the afternoon the patient was apparently found unresponsive and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 60 and a heart rate of 40.
A code was called at that time and the patient had her ventilation assisted with bag mask as well as a dose of .2 mg of atropine and 100 mcg of epinephrine.
