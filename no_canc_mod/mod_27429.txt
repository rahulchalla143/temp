He is also c/o shortness of breath and PND.
Patient was diursed and underwent cardiac cath which was consistent with preicardial constriction.
Past Medical History: Constrictive Pericarditis, Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Obesity, Left Eye blindness  Social History: Homeless, Quit smoking 2 months ago.
venous stasis LE HEENT: Poor Dentition, right eye opacity, lef eye fixed pupil Neck: Supple, FROM, +JVD, -Carotid bruit Chest: CTAB -w/r/r Heart: RRR, [**3-31**] murmur Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS, obese Ext: Warm, 4+ bilat.
LE edema, -varicosities Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, non-focal  Pertinent Results: [**2105-5-22**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There appears to be focal left and right ventricular apical hypokinesis but poor apical windows prevent complete evaluation.
There is abnormal septal motion suggestive of pericardial constriction.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is a strand-like echodensity on the left ventricular outflow tract side of either the left or non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve that likely represents a degredative process but an aortic valve vegetation mass cannot be excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is a very large left pleual effusion as well as a right pleural effusion and ascites.
After stripping of the pericardium there were no major changes.
The pleural effusions were drained.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-22**] and 30:  Left pleural drain has been removed.
Small left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion are stable.
Very small right apical pneumothorax has decreased.
Left basal atelectasis is improved.
ID consulted on Mr. [**Known lastname **] to help determine plan and to determine reason for constrictive pericarditis (r/o TB as cause).
