HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 26-year-old woman with a history of IV drug abuse, who initially presented to an outside hospital on [**2143-3-2**] from a drug and detoxification facility with a chief complaint of headache, abdominal pain, and fever.
At the outside hospital, the patient was found to be febrile to 104.6 degrees F, and she subsequently developed hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
During this initial evaluation, the patient was confused and only intermittently answering questions.
There was concern for possible headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia, so given the concern for meningitis, a spinal tap was done.
Given these findings and concern for meningitis, the patient received Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and gentamicin at the outside hospital.
On arrival to the Emergency Department at the [**Hospital1 346**], the patient was found to have icteric sclerae, a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, abdominal guarding, and right upper quadrant tenderness.
In the Emergency Department, she had an abdominal ultrasound that was negative for the presence of gallbladder or ductal dilatation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
She appeared to be a well dressed well-nourished female in moderate distress from "not feeling well", lying in bed, and subsequently having emesis x1.
There was mild scleral icterus.
Mild conjunctival edema.
There were small conjunctival hemorrhages on the right greater than on the left.
Her neck was stiff with pain with flexion half-way down towards the chest.
A small posterior cervical lymph node is palpable.
Her oropharyngeal examination was remarkable for upper dentures with eroded mucosa and white plaques consistent with thrush underneath.
Her tongue was coated with a whitish film, and she had a few petechiae on her upper palate.
Her heart was regular, rate, and rhythm, and there was a [**3-28**] holosystolic murmur throughout the precordium that radiated to the axilla.
Her abdomen was soft, there were normoactive bowel sounds, she had bilateral upper quadrant guarding, and mild abdominal distention.
The patient notes that her abdominal discomfort has been present for the past five months.
She had bilateral upper extremity tract marks in her right forearm and in her bilateral antecubital fossa that were clean.
Scattered dark macules were seen on her palms bilaterally.
One out of two blood culture bottles were growing gram-positive cocci in clusters initially.
Her electrocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 112 beats per minute, normal axis, and normal intervals.
An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated increased echotexture to the bilateral kidneys, and no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Her abdominal ultrasound demonstrated minimal new intrahepatic ductal dilatation and small pneumobilia.
She also informed her caretakers that she had multiple HIV tests in the past, all of which had been negative.
No yeast or fungal organisms grew out the culture of her CSF, and a CSF Gram stain was repeated twice at the outside hospital and found to be negative both times.
Given the finding of this bacteremia and her alarming concert of symptoms on admission, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on hospital day two.
This study demonstrated a thickened posterior mitral leaflet with a question of prolapse and at least mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation consistent with possible endocarditis.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was seen.
This study demonstrated a moderate sized mitral valve vegetation consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.
Given this finding, it was felt that all of the patient's initial signs and symptoms were consistent with bacterial endocarditis.
Given that the finding of yeast in the CSF was found to be a false-positive, and given that all subsequent Gram stain and culture data from the CSF remained negative, the patient was not felt to have had bacterial meningitis at any point (of note, two colonies of gram-positive cocci in clusters were isolated from the patient's CSF culture; however, these colonies were subsequently speciated as coag-negative Staph, and were therefore thought to be a contaminate.
Given the patient's LFTs abnormalities on admission, an abdominal CT scan was done on hospital day two.
This study demonstrated a focal area of low attenuation in the contrast enhanced right kidney, that was ultimately attributed to a septic embolus to the right kidney.
Also seen were large bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, ascites, and free abdominal fluid, and a large amount of pelvic fluid.
These fluid collections were all thought to be secondary to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome secondary to the patient's underlying bacterial endocarditis.
In order to rule out the possibility of an epidural abscess, a spinal MRI was done on hospital day four.
This study demonstrated no evidence of epidural abscess.
This study did not demonstrate any definite evidence of a focal lesion in the third ventricle or a focal mass within the brain.
The Department of Rheumatology was consulted given these reactive arthridities and recommended supportive care to the area.
Of note, however, the patient did develop mild elevations in her alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase following the initiation of oxacillin therapy.
Given these normalizations, and given that the patient's hematocrit had been remaining stable (thus indicating that there was no significant myelosuppression as a result of oxacillin therapy), the patient was discharged with a plan for six weeks of continued oxacillin therapy.
In order to rule out the possibility of mycotic aneurysm in the brain, a MRI of the head was obtained on hospital day seven.
This study demonstrated no evidence of acute infarct from septic emboli, and a subtle increased signal in the right temporal region that could be within the sulcus.
A similar, but less apparent abnormality was also seen along the sulcus of the left occipital region.
These abnormalities were nonspecific in nature, but were thought to possibly have been due to a high protein content of the CSF.
Also of note, the patient had a cervical chlamydia probe return positive during this hospitalization.
Given that the patient did not have clinically significant congestive heart failure or valvular dysfunction with persistent infection after 7-10 days of appropriate antibiotics, the patient was deemed not to be a surgical candidate.
She subsequently developed no significant congestive heart failure, and she had no further embolic phenomena following the septic embolus sheath to her right kidney.
Given her bilateral pleural effusions and mitral regurgitation, the patient was transiently on furosemide during this hospitalization, but had no signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure at the time of her discharge from the hospital.
Rheumatology:  As noted above, the patient initially developed a left ankle reactive arthritis on hospital day six.
Given the asymmetric edema in her left ankle, a Rheumatology consult was obtained.
The patient subsequently developed left hand swelling later in her hospitalization, at which point the Rheumatology service was reconsulted.
They again felt that the swelling in the patient's left hand was due to a reactive arthritis that would be best managed with supportive care.
Hematology:  Soonafter admission, the patient manifested a significant anemia with a hematocrit in the low 20s.
The etiology of this anemia was ultimately thought to be multifactorial due to a combination of anemia of chronic disease, recurrent phlebotomy, menstruation, and oxacillin induced myelosuppression.
There was no evidence of hemolysis either by laboratory evaluation or by direct evaluation of the peripheral smear.
Psychiatry:  By hospital day eight, the patient began threatening to leave the hospital against medical advice due to inadequate pain control.
The Psychiatry service felt that the patient had poor coping mechanisms given the severity of her illness, and recommended initiation of an atypical antipsychotic.
Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis complicated by right renal septic embolus.
