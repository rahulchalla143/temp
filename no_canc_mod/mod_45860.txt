PANCREATITIS ISSUES:  The patient continued to do quite well, and her pancreatitis gradually resolved.
The patient had persistent elevated LD and alkaline phosphatase but normalization of liver function tests.
The patient had an abdominal computed tomography on [**2121-2-5**] that showed an enlarged pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collections with focal under-perfusion of the pancreatic head which has now resolved when compared to prior abdominal computed tomography.
Persistent peripancreatic stranding and fluid collection, consistent with pancreatitis.
Given the patient's subjective improvement and resolution of abdominal pain and ability to tolerate full oral intake, these changes were thought to be consistent with her clinical course and resolving pancreatitis.
The abdominal computed tomography on [**2-5**] also revealed evidence of portal vein thrombosis which was new and not seen on prior computed tomography.
There was a filling defect in the main portal vein; consistent with a recent diagnosis of pancreatitis.
An abdominal ultrasound with Doppler studies was performed to assess the degree of portal vein thrombosis and flow.
The intrahepatic portal venous system demonstrated normal hepatopetal flow without evidence of intrahepatic thrombosis.
The left and right hepatic veins demonstrated normal hepatofugal flow without evidence of thrombosis with a normal triphasic wave form.
These changes were consistent with the nonocclusive extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis found on the abdominal computed tomography.
Current data suggests that anticoagulation for this would be warranted, given that we do not known whether it is acute or chronic.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient initially was found to have bilateral pleural effusions as well as congestive heart failure after initial volume resuscitation for her pancreatitis.
The patient did continue to have mild low-grade temperatures as well as a cough and a persistently elevated white blood cell count.
Given these findings, a chest x-ray was repeated which revealed a moderate sized right pleural effusion that was new compared to a prior pleural effusion.
It was also on the right side; which was inconsistent with changes that would be expected from spread of pancreatic fluid, which would normally appear on the left.
This fluid was sent for analysis and was found to have 1+ gram-positive cocci with negative cultures.
The cytology was negative for malignant cells and showed only reactive mesothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils.
A chest computed tomography was performed to evaluate for loculated fluid collection, consolidation, and size of right pleural effusion after her pleural tap.
This revealed an interval reduction in the size of the right pleural effusion, partial re-expansion of the right lower lobe, with discoid atelectasis, and patchy ground-glass opacities that persisted in the right lower lobe, likely representing evolving re-expansion; however, a right lower lobe infiltrate cannot be excluded.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was still completing her course of Flagyl for her Clostridium difficile infection.
The patient has had a gradual decrease in her white blood cell count; however, it was elevated at 16 at the time of discharge.
