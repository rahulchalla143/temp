Admission Date:  [**2114-6-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-6-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-1-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: adhesive / Pravastatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**] Chief Complaint: Cold left foot  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2114-6-1**] Left groin exploration   History of Present Illness: HPI: 69F with a longstanding history of PVD who in [**2103**] underwent left fem to above knee popliteal bypass and has subsequently had multiple vascular interventions.
She was recently diagnosed with stenosis of the left CFA with blunted graft velocities.
She states that she still has motor function but does not have sensation in the foot.
She denies fevers or chills at this time.
Past Medical History: HTN / CVA x2 ([**2096**]) / DM / depression / PVD / eczema / L fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] ([**2103**])/ L CEA [**2097**] / bilateral carotid stents / L TKR / choly / Left Lower Extremity Angiography w/ iliac stent placement / left common femoral artery angioplasty ([**2111**])   Social History: Smoker.
Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: T98.6 HR80 BP106/56 RR16 Sat98% on 2L NC Gen: AOx3 intermittently but does have audiovisual hallucinations CV: RRR s1s2 Resp:  decreased breath sounds throughout, no focal abnormalities, no w/r/r abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended  extremities:  LLE with extensive dry gangrene on the foot beginning to extend up close to the lower leg and spreading in the foot.
RLE with patchy areas of necrosis but no overt gangrene.
She has no detectable pulses or signals below her left femoral artery.
Pulses:  Fem   [**Doctor Last Name **]  dp   pt        R  P     P    d    d        L  d     -   -     -   Pertinent Results: [**2114-6-1**] CTA ABD:CT OF THE PELVIS AND EXTREMITIES WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder is mildly distended.
No adnexal masses are detected.
There is no intrapelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
Included views of the intrapelvic small and large bowel are normal.
There are no bony lesions concerning for malignancy or infection.
No acute fracture is detected.
The patient is post bilateral total knee arthroplasties, with no evidence of hardware loosening or failure.
Moderate soft tissue edema extends throughout the subcutaneous tissues of both lower extremities.
No focal fluid collections are identified.
CT ANGIOGRAM: Severe atherosclerotic calcifications are again seen throughout the abdominal aorta and iliac branches.
LEFT VESSELS: Compared to the [**2114-2-18**] examination, there is now new occlusion of the left common iliac artery (3A:30) and left external iliac artery.
Severe atherosclerotic calcifications of the left CFA limits evaluation for patency, but no internal flow is seen.
A femoropopliteal (above-knee) bypass is again seen, with unchanged moderate narrowing at the common femoral takeoff (3A:91), but demonstrating wide patency otherwise.
The native superficial femoral artery is heavily calcified and no internal flow is detected.
Extensive calcifications are seen throughout the popliteal artery, with the lower segment not visualized due to extensive streak artifacts from the left knee prosthesis.
Three-vessel runoff is demonstrated (3A:293), however, there is marked attenuation of the left anterior tibial artery in comparison to the prior CT examination (3A:345), and diminutive flow is seen at the dorsalis pedis.
In comparison to the [**2-23**] examination, there appears to be overall diminished flow of the peroneal and posterior tibial arteries, however, patency remains preserved.
RIGHT VESSELS: Severe atherosclerotic calcifications and stenosis of the right iliac artery, particularly at the distal portion and external segment, appears minimally changed since [**2114-2-18**].
However, there is again complete occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery.
Evaluation for the right popliteal artery is impossible due to the degree of extensive calcifications and streak artifacts from the right knee prosthesis.
A three-vessel runoff is demonstrated at the right calf, with irregular attenuation throughout the right posterior tibial artery, all unchanged since [**2114-2-23**].
Occlusion of the left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral artery is new since [**2114-2-23**].
Unchanged moderate stenosis at the takeoff of the left femoropopliteal bypass (above-knee).
Three-vessel runoff demonstrated at the left calf, however, there is overall decreased vascular flow, in particular the left anterior tibial artery, in comparison to the [**2114-2-23**] examination, likely from poor iliac and femoral inflow.
Unchanged occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery.
Right three-vessel runoff is again seen, with mild irregular attenuation of the posterior tibial artery.
Low oxygen saturation.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly elongated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic valve stenosis.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
[**2114-6-6**]  CXR PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY  INDICATION:  Evaluation for infiltrate or effusion.
FINDINGS:  Moderate pulmonary edema is slightly improved.
Right-sided jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
Cardiac contour is slightly enlarged and unchanged.
CONCLUSION:  There is a slight improvement of moderate pulmonary edema.
Her foot was cool to touch with pallor distal to ankle, delayed cap refill, diminished sensation throughout but she had preserved motor function.
She was placed on a heparin gtt and brought to the Endovascular Hybrid room for left groin cut down and possible intervention.
The wound was closed loosely as to not compress the graft and a VAC dressing was placed.
She refused most care and intervention and a psych consult was obtained for competancy.

Because of the damage to the blood vessels you are unable to have any bypass or stenting to improve the blood flow.
You did not wish to have this procedure.
You are being discharged to hospice care  Please use caution with fentanyl patch in the setting of fever  Please do not hesitate to contact the hospital if you change your mind or with any other questions.
Call the hospital or surgery department at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**] if you have any further questions.
