There is no hydronephrosis, solid mass, or stone.
No ascites is demonstrated.
The liver shows no focal or textural abnormality.
The LMCA had a mid 20% stenosis and a distal eccentric 40-50% lesion.
The LAD was heavily calcified; the proximal LAD had a 30% lesion with diffuse plaquing.
The mid LAD had a tubular calcified 80% lesion involving the origin of D1 to 70%.
The mid to distal LAD was diffusely diseased with a subtotally occluded major D2.
The LCx was moderately to heavily calcified and diffusely diseased with a 65% stenosis at the origin.
The mid LAD had a 65% stenosis after a high OM1 branch.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP and LVEDP of 34 mm Hg.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was severely elevated with PASP of 75 mm Hg.
Cardiac index was mildly depressed at 2.37 l/min/m2.
Valve area cannot be fully and accurately calculated in the setting of aortic and mitral regurgitation (calculated value is an underestimate of true value).
A heavily calcified aortic valve with some movement of the aortic valve leaflets was appreciated.
Severe aortic stenosis.
Severe biventricular diastolic heart failure.
Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior (inferolateral) walls.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.

There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Suboptimal image quality - poor suprasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to position.
Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Image quality was suboptimald - poor esophageal contact.
Suboptimal image quality.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:      N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= XX %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.

Interpretation assigned to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6506**] [**Name8 (MD) 6507**], MD, Interpreting physician   Brief Hospital Course: 52yo man w/ AIDS, hepatitis C, CAD s/p MI, bicuspid AV w/ severe AR & MR, w/ h/o CHF (EF unkown) who presents w/ escalating chest pain.
His pre-op evaluation entailed undergoing cardiac catheterization which demonstrated severe AS (area 0.6 cm2), wedge of 27 mm Hg, 3vd, distal LM 40-50% stenosis, LAD 70-80% stenosis, Lcx 60% stenosis and RCA diffuse disease to 80% stenosis.
Hepatology was also consulted regarding his surgical risks associated with his liver disease.
Preoperatively while awaiting surgery he developed on and off chest pain which was relieved with nitroglycerine.
Early morning of [**1-14**], at 1:30am, the patient developed chest pain, accompanied by hypotension and ST elevations on ekg.
he was transferred to the CCU where he became unresponsive and sufferred a cardiac arrest was resuscitated with chest compreessions for about 45 minutes with no response.
# Hep C: The patient has never received therapy for his hepatitis C. Outside records of a liver biopsy in [**5-30**] demonstrated steatosis, lymphocytic infiltration of portal triads with piecemeal necrosis and lobular inflammation.
trichrome stain with expansion of portal triads with portal-to-portal and portal-to-central vein bridging and fibrosis surrounding single cells.
No regenerative nodules.
Diagnosis: chronic hepatitis, grade 3, stage 2 consistent with HCV infection.
As described above patient developed chest pain and sufferd an anterior MI followed by cardiac arrest He was brought emergently to the operating room on ECMO for AVR/MVR/Asc Ao repair/CABG.
Post cardiopulmonary bypass he had difficulty maintaining oxygen saturation and was placed on a venovenous ECMO.
On the night of surgery he sustained a cardiac arrest again and underwent open chest cardiac massage and was succesfully resuscitated.
the next day he again sustained another cardiac arrest and this time could not be resuscitated by internal cardiac massage and was placed on arteriovenous ecmo as a last option.
He developed bilatereal lower limb ischemia in the meantime and was in acute renal failure on hemofiltration on multiple high doses of inotropes.
Given the futility of the situation after discussion with the family the ECMO support was stopped and the patient died soon after.
