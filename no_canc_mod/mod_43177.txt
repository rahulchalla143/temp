[**6-13**] CXR: Persistent cardiomegaly.
Worsening pulmonary vascular congestion  accompanied by diffuse interstitial edema as well as more confluent perihilar and basilar opacities likely representing alveolar edema as well.
Small to moderate pleural effusions are unchanged.
New opacity in right mid lung adjacent to the minor fissure may reflect loculated fluid in the fissure with adjacent atelectasis, but attention to this region on followup radiographs would be helpful to exclude a developing pneumonia or other acute process in this region.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global systolic function.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-7-12**], the severity of aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary artery hypertension have increased.
Bilateral pleural effusions are now present.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis.
Based on [**2195**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is symptomatic (angina, syncope, CHF) and a surgical candidate, surgical intervention has been shown to improve survival.
Mild to moderate plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis, unchanged from [**2196-2-24**].
Complete thrombosis of the left external jugular vein.
The deep veins are patent without evidence of thrombosis.
Known aortic valve calcifications consistent with known aortic stenosis.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusions, most likely layering.
Evidence of minimal interstitial pulmonary edema, significantly improved since [**2201-6-13**].
Essential sparing of ascending aorta from coarse calcifications but evidence of minimal may be intimal calcifications present.
No left kidney seen in orthotopic location, resected ?.
Brief Hospital Course: Presented to emergency room in pulmonary edema treated with intravenous lasix and morphine with improvement.
Additionally she had echocardiogram that revealed severe aortic stenosis and surgery was consulted to evaluated for surgical intervention.
Her preoperative urine revealed ecsherichia coli treated with nitrofurantoin and repeat urine culture [**6-17**] had no growth.
On [**2201-6-19**] she was taken to the operating room for aortic valve replacement and aortic endarectomy.
On post operative day one she was weaned from sedation, was slow to wake and was extubated that evening without complications.
She continued to slowly progress on post operative day two she had atrial fibrillation treated with amiodarone and betablockers.
Amiodarone drip was completed due to intermittent burst of atrial fibrillation and transitioned to oral amiodarone.
She was not started on coumadin due to limit time frame of atrial fibrillation.
