Admission Date:  [**2143-1-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-2-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-4-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Edema, fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The pt is a 68 yo M with a h/o hemochromatosis and DM2 recently admitted to this hospital with a MSSA bacteremia, PNA, ARF with creat 3.4, hyperK 6.0 and lactic acidosis with AG of 25.
On that admission, EKG showed right heart strain and possible lateral ischemic changes.
He was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and a PNA and then sent to the floor, finished course Oxacillin for bacteremia while in house.
Other issues during that hospitalization included: -CTA [**1-16**] showed an enlarged left-sided pleural effusion (fluid density) and a R-sided pleural effusion that was determined to be solid on thorocentesis (Path result is pending) -HIV, [**Doctor First Name **] and RF were sent and found to be negative; scleroderma ab neg -[**1-8**] TTE was obtained and showed a dilated RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal movement; moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension consistent with a primary pulmonary process.
3mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe.
2. hypodense oval lesion approx 8mm at the liver dome.
Pt returned to [**Location **] [**2143-1-29**] with c/o increased fatigue and marked increase in peripheral edema.
Admits cough with small amt white sputum occasionally.
CCU Course: Pt was started on Viagra for Primary Pulmonary HTN, and aggressively diuresed with Lasix gtt and diuril for several days with net [**Location 10226**]7.4L with symptomatic improvement in SOB on 5LNC, also started on anticoagulation with Lovenox for several days however switched to Hep gtt and will transition to coumadin.
Thoracentesis on [**2-7**] removed ~800 cc serosanguinous fluid which was negative for malignant cells.
Past Medical History: PMH: * Hemochromatosis with monthly phlebotomy; dx 15 yrs ago * Cardiac involvement from hemochromatosis * DM * hx of colon polyps * gallstones (asx) * Hypothyroidism * ARF in setting of NSAID use 13 years ago, requiring 5 months of HD.
crackles at L base Abd: Soft, NT/ND; eccymoses (fading) from previous heparin subQ injections Ext: 3+ pitting edema to knees bilat, +sacral edema Neuro: A&Ox3, CN intact, strength 5/5 prox & distal, no pronator drift, no asterixis Skin: bronze color .
Allowing for low lung volumes, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
There is a persistent right lower lobe opacity, probably some atelectasis in addition to effusion.
There is also a left-sided effusion with parenchymal opacity obscuring the medial hemidiaphragm, which may represent atelectasis.
Right apical thickening is unchanged since a prior study from [**2138**].
IMPRESSION: Moderate bibasilar effusions and opacities, which are likely to represent atelectasis.
Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded however.
There are bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with possible partial posterior loculation.
I doubt the presence of vascular congestion although appearances suggest possible underlying chronic lung disease with stranding in the right lung.
The effusions are associated with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
No change in effusions.
Vasodilator challenge in this patient with pulmonary hypertension revealed baseline severe pulmonary hypertension with pressures of 82/43.
The RA pressure was slightly elevated at mean of 14mmHG with a relatively normal left sided filling pressure with PCWP of 11mmHG.
With 100% oxygen and then nitric oxide there was no decrease in pulmonary pressures.
Severe pulmonary hypertension with normal left sided filling pressures, not responsive to vasodilators.
[**2143-2-4**] ECHO Bubble Study: Conclusions: No definite right-to-left passage of microbubbles identified at rest or with  maneuvers (cough, post-Valsalva).
The right ventricle is dilated with prominent free wall hypokinesis.
[**2143-2-4**] CXR: INDICATION: CHF versus developing pneumonia.
There is partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe with inferomedial displacement of the right major fissure.
An area of increased opacity is noted within the left retrocardiac region, with interval improvement since the recent study.
This is probably due to a combination of effusion and atelectasis.
[**2143-2-6**] CHEST CT: Bilateral pleural effusion, moderate and low density on the left, and small with high density contents and perimeter enhancement is unchanged in both hemithoraces.
Bibasilar consolidation is more pronounced in comparison to the previous studies and may represent pneumonia or secondary atelectasis.
Prominence of the interlobular septa as well as some engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature represent congestive heart failure.
Imaged part of the upper abdomen demonstrate several gallstones in othewise normal gallbladder, calcified liver granuloma and nodularity of the liver margin (the patient has a known history of cirrhosis ).
The spleen, adrenals, kidneys and pancreas are unremarkable except for left renal cortical atrophy.
No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions within the bones were shown.
Prominent gynecomastia is due to cirrhosis.
IMPRESSION: 1) Increased, moderate left pleural effusion.
Smaller high density right pleural fluid collection is unchanged.
2) Increased bibasilar pulmonary consolidations, which may represent secondary atelectasis or pneumonia.
3) Mild congestive heart failure.
Prominent coronary artery calcifications and cardiomegaly are unchanged.
4) Gallstones without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
[**2143-2-7**] Thoracentesis fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2143-2-8**] ECHO TTE: Conclusions: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of perihepatic ascites.
Stable appearance of hepatofugal portal venous flow.
Limited examination secondary to cirrhotic heterogeneously echogenic liver.
Although no focal liver lesions are identified, given the technical difficulties of this ultrasound surveillance, CT or MRI surveillance for lesions could be performed for future examinations.
[**2143-2-17**] CXR: FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of the left IJ line.
There is hazy bilateral increased vasculature and increased bilateral pleural effusion suggesting CHF.
[**2143-2-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V block.
Since the previous tracing of [**2143-2-10**] the rhythm has reverted from atrial fibrillation to no significant change and the rate has slowed.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities persist.
--- MICRO:   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the Medical ICU in critical condition in setting of severe pulmonary HTN.
Also c/b hepatic encephalopathy.
