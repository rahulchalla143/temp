Admission Date:  [**2192-2-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2192-3-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2125-6-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **] MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 38466**] is a 66 year old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, restricted lung disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea and ventricular tachycardia status post pacemaker defibrillator, who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2-6**], ten days before admission to [**Hospital1 69**] for severe leg pain and bilateral necrotic leg ulcers.
The outside hospital felt that these leg ulcers were secondary to either ischemic vasculitis or diabetes mellitus.
His white blood cell count was noted elevated on admission and continued to increase but this was felt to be too large for a steroid dose.
At the outside hospital, he was afebrile with negative blood cultures and skin cultures.
Skin biopsies were performed which did not support the diagnosis of vasculitis per report, although no specific details of the biopsy were available.
Ultrasound showed no deep vein thromboses, no specific arterial stenosis.
On admission, he noted that he had had no ulcers until ten days prior to admission here; at that time, he had the onset of small black ulcers and increased pain.
He had no other complaints at that time.
He had no fevers, chills, nausea, headache, neck pain, shortness of breath, or cough.
He does have two-pillow orthopnea but he had no abdominal pain.
Chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
Morbid obesity.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 3.0 to 3.5.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
History of ventricular tachycardia status post pacer and defibrillator.
History of lower extremity skin lesions.
History of right rotator cuff tear.
Umbilical hernia repair.
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and VRE.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Father died at 54 of an myocardial infarction and also had Hodgkin's Disease.
Mother died at 81 of a myocardial infarction.
No history of intravenous drug abuse; no history of blood transfusions.
Neck was supple; no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs are clear to auscultation except for some decreased breath sounds at the right base.
Cardiovascular examination had distant heart sounds; regular rate and rhythm, a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border radiating into the axilla.
Skin:  Severe large up to 10 by 10 centimeter necrotic superficial ulcerations on lower extremities, more on the left than the right, with surrounding erythema.
Multiple areas of top layers with epidermis denuded.
Multiple small whitish lesions on buttocks approximately 3 to 4 centimeters in size.
Lower extremity ulcers:  The patient had lower extremity ulcers of which the exact etiology was never determined, but the most likely cause was ultimately ischemic vasculitis.
The patient had a biopsy which showed evidence of changes from ischemic vasculitis, but possibly a component of calciphylaxis.
He did have a significantly elevated calcium phosphate product on admission.
The Dermatology Team was involved and they thought that possibly he had predisposing ischemic leg ulcers and some calciphylaxis which "tipped him over".
The patient went to the Operating Room on [**2-23**], for radical debridement of the left leg and debridement of the right leg.
He then went back again on the 25th for a left above the knee amputation due to the severe nature of the ischemia and the ulcers that were being caused.
He then went back on [**3-5**], for a debridement of the left above the knee amputation.
Most likely the wound would be allowed to simply heal by secondary intention but if necessary, it would be closed.
At discharge, the wounds looked good, had no signs of infection present and the Vascular Team thought that the patient was safe for discharge from this perspective.
Cardiovascular:  The patient's postoperative and inpatient course was complicated by runs of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in which his ICD pacer fired.
He was evaluated by the Electrophysiology Service for this and his Betapace was stopped due to his renal failure, but he was started on Amiodarone.
Approximately ten days before discharge, it was deemed that because of his ophthalmologic problems (see details below), that Amiodarone was a possible cause since one of its side effects is optic neuritis.
The patient also reported that Amiodarone in the past had caused optic neuritis.
During the remainder of his hospital course, he remained paced; had one or two runs of four or five-beat monomorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
The EP Service did state that they would like to change his pacemaker but that this was not an urgent issue.
At the time of discharge, he had been hemodynamically stable for many days.
He had significant nausea and vomiting.
We deemed that he had symptomatic uremia and the Renal Team decided to dialyze him.
This seemed to completely relieve his symptoms of nausea and vomiting and his flap resolved.
The cause of his renal failure was believed to be ATN, possibly due to hypotension at some point during his stay, since muddy brown casts were seen on a urine sediment examination.
He had initially been treated with Remegel to avoid constipation, but once his calcium phosphate product got so high and calciphylaxis was considered in the differential, it was decided to put him on Amphojel.
It was feared that the patient had a significant bleed and he was transferred to the Unit for this.
Iron studies were done and he was slightly iron deficient so he was given iron supplementation.
We suspected that the patient may have some bleeding that we had not detected due to having uremic platelets.
They recommended checking a sedimentation rate which was high at 127 but the patient had known infection of his stump at this time and was on antibiotics, and it was deemed that this was not a reliable marker.
The Ophthalmology Team was very concerned about the possibility of giant cell arteritis.
We considered this to essentially rule out giant cell arteritis.
The most likely diagnosis per the Ophthalmology Team was anterior ischemic optic neuropathy likely from atherosclerotic disease of the vessels in his eye.
We suspect he may have had an episode of hypotension which is what made his vision so poor.
Infectious Disease:  With the patient's elevated white count at presentation and his leg ulcers, there was significant concern for the patient to have Infectious Disease issues.
Multiple cultures of his blood and his wounds were done.
Tissue biopsy from one of his wounds revealed Serratia and coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
On [**2-19**], the patient had a catheter tip from one of his lines come back positive for Enterococcus, resistant to Vancomycin.
Pain:  The patient had episodes of intense lower extremity pain especially in his right leg.
It was not believed to be phantom pain since this was not the leg that had been amputated.
The pain seemed to resolve on its own.
However, during several points in his stay when he had received significant amounts of opioid analgesics, he did have some episodes of hallucination and confusion.
He seems to do well with small amounts but too much seems to tip him over the edge.
This is likely confounded by his problems with vision making it hard for him to make people out.
Ischemic lower extremity ulcers status post left above the knee amputation, status post right skin graft.
Acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis.
Loss of vision in right eye likely due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
Anemia of unclear etiology.
Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia status post ventricular tachycardia ablation.
