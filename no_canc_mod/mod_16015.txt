Maternal history was significant for pregnancy-induced hypertension on [**2174-7-20**] and was admitted to [**Hospital6 256**].

However, he developed acidosis and increased work of breathing on day of life number one and two due to his patent ductus arteriosus.
With the persistence of right lungs findings, increasing ventilatory support, and a respiratory culture revealing staph aureus, he was treated for presumptive pneumonia.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  [**Known lastname **] developed clinical signs and symptoms consistent with PDA on day of life number one with persistent acidosis, pulse pressures and a new murmur.
