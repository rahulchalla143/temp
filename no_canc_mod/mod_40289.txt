The abscess was first noted as a small pimple 5 days prior to presentation ([**10-19**]) and has progressively enlarged and become more painful.
He had severals days of fevers and chills and started experiencing pleuritic chest pain, worse with inspiration.
He also complained of cough prior to presentation.
The day he presented, he noted an area of induration and erythema on left shin.
Patient underwent I&D of abscess on [**2112-10-24**].
Pustular sinus tracts with necrotizing soft tissue wre found and debrided.
Pt had CXR which showed hypodensities, concerning for septic emboli.
On CT chest he was found to have numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules, all concerning for septic embolic, infarcts, and disseminated infection felt secondary to abscess.
TTE was negative for vegatations.
ID was consulted and felt that the source of the bacteremia and septic emboli was likely his scrotal abscess.
Patient was noted to have increased work of breathing.
He was transitioned to NRB and oxygen saturation improved to low 90s, but patient continued to have increased WOB.
He was transitioned to BIPAP mask and his breathing symptoms improved.
Given worsening respiratory status and persistent tachycardia, patient underwent CTA to assess for PE, which showed no PE, but does show worsening right sided non-hemorrhagic pleural effusion.
Scrotal pain is well controlled with current regimen.
Patient reports having fevers and chills overnight.
(-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.

Regions of low attenuation within bilateral atelectasis, concerning for pneumonia.
[**10-26**] LLE U/S: IMPRESSION: Serpiginous-appearing hypoechoic structure left anterior shin, possibly representing a fluid collection or alternatively superficial thrombophlebitis of a markedly distended venous structure.
There is more focal patchy nodular opacity at the left apex as well as in the right upper to mid lung which appears somewhat cavitary and may reflect known septic emboli which are now radiographically visible.
More focal patchy opacity at the right lung base is also present and could represent a combination of compressive atelectasis, pneumonia and/or evolving septic embolic areas.
The more rounded appearance to the right costophrenic angle is slightly less apparent on the current examination but still could represent loculated pleural fluid.
The heart remains enlarged but unchanged which may reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion.
Interval improvement in aeration at the left lung base with no definite left pleural effusion identified on the current examination.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.

The perineal wound was drained and showed no necrotizing fasciitis.
He required a brief ICU stay for respiratory distress but was never intubated.
His fever and shortness of breath resolved and patient went to teh floor.
TEE showed no vegetations and patient was discharged to complete a 6-week course of vancomycin.
ACUTE CARE: .
MRSA bacteremia: Patient had a perineal and buttock wound that grew MRSA in culture and blood cultures that grew MRSA as well.
He was found to have radiographic evidence of septic emboli and was febrile with shortness of breath as well.
Patient received a TEE which showed no vegetations.
Perineal wound and other buttock and shin wound: Patient's initial complaint was a tender, erythemetous wound involving the scrotum and perineum.
It started off as a pimple-sized lesion and grew to involve a large area.
Surgery evaluated and debrided the wound because of concern for necrotizing fasciitis, which was not present.
The wound grew MRSA and patient recieved vancomycin and wet-to-dry dressing changes.
The additional wounds on the left anterior shin and left buttock were incised and drained and had daily dressing changes as well.
He was dishcarged with instructions for antibiotics and dressing changes to continue.
Lung Septic Emboli: Patient had septic emboli to the lung as evidenced by chest CT.
He showed no neurologic signs suggesting brain lesions.
Because of the lung lesions, patient had a period of respiratory distress requiring Bipap in the unit.
He was weaned to room air and previous pain experienced with respiration was greatly decreased.
IP evaluated patient for a small loculated pleural effusion associated with the involved lung, and it was found to be too small to drain.
CTPA showed no PE on this admission as well .
CHRONIC CARE: .
IVDU history: Patient was informed about the possibility of infection with IVDU and he was made aware that the current damage to his veins from this history interferes with vascular access.
5. hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain: hold for sedation or RR<10.
7. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for dyspnea.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 82864**],  You were admitted to the hospital because you developed a large abscess on your scrotum.
We also found wounds on your left shin and left buttock and areas of infection in the lungs as well.
The cultures from the wound grew a bacteria called MRSA, and you were found to have this growing in your blood stream as well.
The bacteria spread from one the above-mentioned skin wounds to the blood and went to the lungs and other wounds from there.
We did an ultrasound of your heart that showed no infection in the heart itself.
MRSA is a bacteria that is very resistant to most antibiotic treatment, which is why you are being given vancomycin intravenously, which does work agaist this bacteria.
START Dilaudid 2mg 1-2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain ** This medication can cause sedation and drowsiness 3.
START Docusate 100mg by mouth twice daily for constipation 4.
START Ipratropium nebulizer as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing 6.
START Tylenol as needed for pain (do not exceed 4g in one day)  Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with the doctors [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
