Admission Date:  [**2159-4-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2159-4-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-8-15**]     Sex:  M  Service:  F-ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 44 year old male with a past medical history for aortic valve endocarditis status post aortic valve replacement with debridement and repair, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, chronic ventilator dependent secondary to Intensive Care Unit myopathy and neuropathy, chronic Pseudomonal colonization, and hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.
He was discharged from the [**Hospital1 69**] Intensive Care Unit on [**3-27**], after a six month hospitalization for Pseudomonas pneumonia, recurrent aspiration, TJ tube placement, pancreatitis, and hypercalcemia.
One day later, the patient presented to [**Hospital6 3874**] with explosive vomiting.
His sputum was positive for Pseudomonas.
Upper endoscopy was done by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7640**], showing a polyp in the stomach, and otherwise normal.
An abdominal CT scan was done, showing gallstones and small ascites.
Diastolic congestive heart failure, valvular disease secondary to aortic valve endocarditis with abscess.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2158-10-29**] ( saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery ).
History of embolic stroke with episodes of endocarditis.
History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting of endocarditis.
Chronic ventilator dependence.
Chronic Pseudomonal colonization.
A bone scan was done showing increased uptake in the left shoulder, where on x-ray the patient was noted to have a calcified appearing mass.
Subsequent CT scan guided biopsy of this calcified mass in the left shoulder revealed evidence of heterotopic calcification.
Seizure disorder since age of 12.
Chronic malnutrition.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
History of right hemicolectomy.
History of Pseudomonal urinary tract infection.
History of diabetes mellitus.
History of type 1 renal tubular acidosis.
History of gastric outlet obstruction by GJ tube abutting pylorus.
History of anoxic encephalopathy.
Chronic intermittent chemical pancreatitis.
History of multiple pneumonias.
History of severe esophagitis.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Our impression is that this a 44 year old male with multiple medical problems presenting with explosive vomiting.
The patient had been previously evaluated for his vomiting being secondary to a mechanical problem with difficulties with his [**Name (NI) **] tube.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Recurrent vomiting:  The initial differential diagnoses for this patient's recurrent nausea and vomiting included GJ tube dysfunction contributing to gastric outlet obstruction, other structural causes of obstruction, for example stricture or ulcer, ischemia or adhesions at his gastric outlet, versus a functional motility disorder (for example gastroparesis, gastric dysmotility).
Review of those records revealed an enteral polyp (hyperplastic inflammatory pathology) with no evidence of gastric outlet obstruction.
These findings were reassuring for ruling out gastric outlet obstruction, and indicated a functional motility disorder as a cause for the patient's recurrent nausea and vomiting.
Copious amounts of bilious material were suctioned from the G-tube during the initial parts of his hospital stay, which diminished, but persisted throughout the hospital stay.
Tube feeds were initiated and slowly advanced to a goal of 85 cc per hour, with initiation of Reglan 5 mg intravenously three times a day, with no recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting.
At this time, all the appropriate work-up for this patient's recurrent nausea and vomiting have been pursued and no further work-up is needed.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was not in overt congestive heart failure on admission.
The patient also has a history of chronic Pseudomonal colonization.
Repeat sputum culture done on [**2159-4-10**], revealed two different colonies of Pseudomonas as well as Enterobacter species.
Although the patient continued to have copious secretions through his tracheostomy tube, he was afebrile with normal white blood cell count throughout his hospital stay; therefore, antibiotics were not initiated.
CHRONIC PANCREATITIS:  The patient was noted to have pancreatitis of unclear etiology on his prior stay.
The patient tolerated tube feeds well with no abdominal pain.
ENDOCRINE:  a) Hypercalcemia - the patient was diagnosed with hypercalcemia of unclear etiology on his recent hospital stay.
A osteocalcin level was normal and bone specific alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated, possibly suggestive of Paget's Disease.
A biopsy of a soft tissue mass in the left glenohumeral joint was done, which was suspect for malignancy.
Vitamin D levels checked on [**3-24**] were noted to be low (less than 7.0), so the patient was redosed with high dose Vitamin D, 10,000 Units, and was to then continue taking Calcitriol 0.125 micrograms per J-tube q. day.
b) Diabetes mellitus type 2:  The patient had excellent glycemic control, with fingersticks ranging from 80 to 120 during hospital stay.
NUTRITION:  The patient was placed on total parenteral nutrition while tube feeds were being held for various radiographic procedures and while tube feeds were being advanced to goal.
The patient has now been advanced to goal tube feeds at 85 cc per hour which he is tolerating well without nausea or vomiting and the total parenteral nutrition has been discontinued.
