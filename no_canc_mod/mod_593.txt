HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 68-year-old ophthalmologist with no significant past medical history, who presents today with diffuse muscle pain and dyspnea on exertion times six days.
Symptoms started when patient awoke six days prior to admission with lumbar lower back pain.
Patient states that initially the pain was similar to lumbar back pain in the past, however, he usually notices this type of pain at the end of the day rather than first thing in the morning.
Throughout the day his lower back pain worsened and patient began to note diffuse myalgias.
Upon getting home from work that evening, he reports that the pain and myalgias were so severe that he was unable to walk.
The weakness has worsened throughout the course of the week, and patient has been nonambulatory.
His dyspnea on exertion began around the same time as the muscle weakness and prior to being unable to walk, he was only able to do three steps before he became tachypneic.
He does not report any PND or orthopnea.
While he was in [**State 108**], he had an acute diarrheal illness, which was described as watery and nonbloody.
Five days prior to admission, he again had recurrence of symptoms and his diarrhea in addition to above symptoms of myalgias and weakness.
His original episode of diarrhea was thought to be secondary to eating out at a restaurant with Cuban cuisine and possible beef exposure.
He does not believe he had any fresh water exposure and he was not swimming in any pools.
On presentation to the Emergency Department, he was noted to be in moderate respiratory distress with respiratory rates in the 30s and tachycardic with heart rates in the 100s.
He received 2 liters of  intravenous normal saline while in the Emergency Department and had development of bibasilar rales.
He did not have any change in his oxygen saturation while lying supine.
On review of systems, patient complains of mild oliguria, which he reports usually going 10 times per day, which decreased to one time per day over the last six days.
He has not had any dysuria or hematuria as far as he knows.
He also reports a sore throat with a question of dysarthria at the onset of symptoms five to six days ago.
He has had a headache and some blurry vision.
The blurry vision was approximately two days prior to admission and lasted about 24 hours.
One day prior to admission he believes he also had an episode of diplopia, which lasted approximately six hours.
He has not had any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or palpitations.
Status post inguinal hernia repair.
prn, however, patient has been    taking approximately four tablets per day since the onset    of symptoms six days ago.
Mice dander causes anaphylactic reaction.
Father died at age 89 years old of prostate cancer.
In general, patient was in mild respiratory distress, however, he was able to speak in full sentences.
There was no accessory muscle use.
Neck was supple without any jugular venous distention or thyromegaly.
Chest demonstrated bilateral basilar rales without any wheezes.
There was no splenomegaly.
On back exam, he had no midline spinal tenderness to palpation.
He had no CVA tenderness bilaterally.
There is trace bilateral edema.
Skin exam:  He had no rashes, however, there is evidence of livido reticularis on bilateral thighs.
Motor strength was effort dependent, however, he had 3-4/5 weakness in his bilateral hip flexors, knee extensors, knee flexion with intact strength bilateral plantar flexion, dorsiflexion.
His sensation was intact to light touch bilateral upper and lower extremities.
Sodium was 140, potassium 3.5, chloride 97, bicarb 13, BUN 72, creatinine 4.0, which is up from a baseline of 1.0, glucose 200, anion gap was elevated at 30.
Chest x-ray showed linear atelectasis at the left base    with a right lower lobe nodule.
CT head was negative for acute pathology.
No hydronephrosis and no ascites were    present.
IMPRESSION:  A 68-year-old gentleman with no significant past medical history, who presents with six days of lower back pain, myalgias with remote history of diarrheal illness and possible fevers at home.
While in the Emergency Department, identified to have mild respiratory distress, which improved without significant intervention as well as acute renal failure and elevated CK.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit given his acute renal failure and respiratory distress.
Over the next two hours, the patient exhibited worsening tachypnea and altered mental status.
He was noted to have worsening slurring of his speech as well.
Neurology evaluated the patient approximately one hour after being admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and although was not able to provide a coherent history at that point, provided a good exam, which was felt to be nonfocal except for mild tongue weakness.
Around 8 p.m., patient's condition had deteriorated enough that he was extremely delirious and his respiratory rate had increased to approximately 40, and he was taking short and shallow breaths.
He was intubated at that point without any complications.
Given his worsening clinical condition, he was started on empiric antibiotics at that point for presumed blood-born infection.
Followup chest x-ray after central line placement showed a moderate sized pneumothorax on the left, which was decompressed with a chest tube placed by Cardiothoracic Surgery.
Serial blood gases showed progressive worsening of his acidosis, and by 10 a.m. the next morning, 16 hours after admission, his blood gas showed a pH of 6.92 and a lactate of 11.8.
The Nephrology team, which had been following him from the night before given his acute renal failure, were contact[**Name (NI) **] early in the morning and a CVVH was initiated.
Around the time of initiation of CVVH, patient was noted to have a wide complex  tachycardia and was eventually found to have evidence of complete heart block.
A discussion was had with his wife, who felt that resuscitation would not be consistent with patient's wishes, and he expired at 2:30 p.m. secondary to cardiac arrest.
Blood cultures drawn from time of admission in the Emergency Department later grew out methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus in four blood culture bottles.
Further investigation and discussion with wife revealed that patient had a dental procedure approximately three weeks prior to admission.
It is unclear this was the source of his bacteremia or whether there was some infectious process, which was acquired while he was on [**State 108**] a week and a half prior to admission.
After discussion with his wife, an autopsy was performed (which report is not available at this time), which was consistent with septic emboli to multiple organs including his kidneys.
This was the most likely cause of his acute renal failure.
There is also evidence of mitral valve involvement/endocarditis.
Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus high grade    bacteremia.
Septic embolic involvement of bilateral kidneys.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Hyperkalemia secondary to acute renal failure.
Respiratory failure requiring intubation.
Left tension pneumothorax.
