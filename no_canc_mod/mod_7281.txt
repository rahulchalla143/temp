He had tachycardia to 170 and received adenosine x 2 with no response.
Cardiology was consulted but felt rhythm was c/w sinus tach.
En route, he was shaking and was given 9mg IV ativan for concern for seizure which was later felt to be secondary to chills and improved with removal of cool blanket.
ECG revealed sinus tach at 105.
He was given fentanyl and versed for sedation and he was given 4L NS for hypotension to 90s.
Family History: Mother died of multiple myeloma.

Cr elevation was likely secondary to mild rhabdo and hypovolemia vs ATN.
Hyperthermia/Heat stroke: Most likely patient had exertional heat stroke related to running on hot day in context of nortriptyline which can predispose toward heat stroke and may interfere w/ perspiration due to anticholinergic effects.
No clear endocrinologic or toxic insults.
Hypoxia: Patient states that his breathing has improved and denies any shortness of breath.
We monitored him for symptoms of fluid overload and there was no need for diuresis.
No reason to suspect acute viral hepatitis or toxic or medication mediated injury.
INR and PTT were elevated with low PLT, low fibrinogen and elevated FDP consistent with early DIC.
Was likely secondary to acute illness and mild DIC; possibly with an element of sequestration given likely acute hepatitis.
Smear neg for schistocytes.
Likely secondary to multisystem dysfunction due to heat injury at presentation as well as vascular leak and likely hypovolemia.
Pt's lowest recorded SBP in the 90s although it is likely that he dropped lower at some point given the extent of the systematic dysfunction.
Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis and bandemia resolved.
Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] bandemia early in course with other premature forms likely due to leukemoid reaction.
No signs of acute infection.
