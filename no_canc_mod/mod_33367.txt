She did not experience any acute surgical complications; she received 800 cc of intraoperative crystalloid fluid and 150 cc of estimated blood loss.
She was also noted to be hypertensive with SBPs as high as the 190s, though these readings were taken on her right radial arterial line in the setting of her thrashing around; she was given standing IV metoprolol and a dose of IV labetalol for BP control.
The PACU was unable to arrange for the patient to have a sitter on the floor and, particularly in the setting of her oliguria and hypertension, was transferred to the MICU for further management.
Delirium: Since admission here, her course has been notable for significant delirium.
Pre-operatively, she received numerous boluses of 0.25 mg IV lorazepam for agitation as well as haloperidol 0.5 mg IV once last night.
She does have dementia at baseline with apparent disorientation, though she usually does recognize familiar faces and post-op did appear to be worse than baseline.
Subdural Hematoma: The patient was reportedly found on the floor of her bathroom complaining of low back pain and was brought to [**Hospital6 **] in [**Location (un) 1110**] for evaluation.
There, she was found to have a subcapital left femoral neck fracture as well as a subdural hematoma along the falx and left tentorium; this was stable on a repeat head CT later the same day.
She was seen by neurosurgery who felt that her small subdural hematoma was stable on serial head CT scans and did not feel this was a contraindication to surgery.
# Acute Renal Failure:  Cr 1.4 on admission with unknown baseline.
NeuroSurgery advised no systemic Anticoagulation at this time given head bleed.
# Hypertension: Has at baseline, was treated with iv metoprolol while not taking po's.
