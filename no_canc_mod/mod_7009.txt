HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old female, nursing home resident status post a fall on [**10-23**] with left hip and left knee pain.
The patient has had a left hip replacement and revision in the past, is now here with a left acetabular shell loosening.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG in [**2097**], status post aortic valve replacement in [**2097**], status post TAH BSO, history of DVT, history of increased INR on Coumadin with a history of a left leg hematoma, history of lymph node cancer in the abdomen, diverticulitis, falls, possible hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Patient with no apparent distress.
X-ray upon presentation showed a loose acetabular shell with a question of a loose femoral head.
During the waiting period for this, patient suddenly started complaining of right lower quadrant abdominal pain with slight nausea but no vomiting.
The patient also began to have some guaiac positive diarrhea.
On exam the patient had newly noted right lower quadrant mass 6 by 6 cm.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for evaluation for decreased hematocrit, decreased blood pressure.
The patient at that point in time also had an NG tube that elicited approximately 200 cc of coffee ground emesis that cleared with 200 cc of saline.
It was found upon further evaluation that patient was having a brisk lumbar artery bleed secondary to her fall.
Ortho:  The patient is status post fall on [**2104-10-23**] with an acetabular shell slippage and a question of a fem loosening.
Upon discharge from hospital patient's orthopedic issues still were not treated due to patient's need for continued rehabilitation secondary to hypovolemic shock.
The patient was started on Dopamine 4 mcg/kg/minute while patient was fluid resuscitated.
Respiratory:  Patient went into respiratory failure after patient went into hypovolemic shock secondary to lumbar artery bleed.
GI:  The patient had guaiac positive stool with her right lower quadrant pain and her hypovolemic shock due to lumbar artery bleed.
The patient had an acute increase in LFTs during her hypovolemic shock.
This acute increase in liver function tests were most likely secondary to shock liver due to hypoperfusion.
After patient became hemodynamically stable, adequately fluid resuscitated, patient's liver function tests improved dramatically.
The patient was complaining of some right upper quadrant pain the last week of her [**Hospital 12876**].
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was done which showed cholelithiasis and no evidence of cholecystitis.
Renal:  Acute renal failure.
Patient went into acute renal failure secondary to hypoperfusion due to hypovolemic shock.
After hypovolemic shock patient did have inadequate urine output secondary to decreased blood pressure.
As patient lives adequately fluid resuscitated and improved during the hospital stay, patient's urine output became adequate and patient's creatinine began to creep downward slowly and on hospital day #16, [**11-7**], patient's creatinine reached a nadir of 1.6.
Patient was started on Captopril on [**11-1**], a low dose of 6.25, po tid which was increased slowly to 25 mg po tid to help patient's renal function.
ID:  The patient has remained afebrile during [**Hospital 228**] hospital course.
The patient actually was hypothermic during patient's hypovolemic shock with a temperature nadir of 94 degrees.
The patient was empirically started on Ceftriaxone, Flagyl and Vancomycin on [**10-30**] for a question of bowel sepsis vs pneumonia seen as an infiltrate on chest x-ray.
The patient did have an increase in white cell count during [**Month/Day (2) 12876**] with a max of 28.9 with an unclear source of why the white cell count went up.
There is question of acute phase vs pneumonia.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed no evidence of cholecystitis.
There is a question of sinusitis with NG tube placement and tube feeds.
Sinus films were not done.
Patient's white cell count most likely due to pneumonia.
Neuro:  The patient had a slow return to consciousness after hypovolemic shock, probably secondary to sedation in MICU stay, hypotension, metabolic derangement.
There was a question of a stroke but a head CT was negative for evidence of stroke.
Patient continued to improve and improved dramatically from [**11-1**] until discharge, going from being mildly sedated to being able to answer questions intelligently, being alert and oriented times three and able to follow commands.
Due to patient's hypovolemic shock and metabolic derangement and slow return to base function, there was a question of whether patient was an aspiration risk.
Speech therapy began to see patient on [**11-4**] and on [**11-4**] and [**11-5**] patient was felt to be an aspiration risk and the NG tube and tube feeds were continued.
Video swallowing study was done on [**11-7**] which showed that the patient still had risk of aspiration, thus speech pathology recommended that patient continue on tube feeds with NG tube for one week and then retry with an other video swallow to see whether patient is less of an aspiration risk.
The patient became hypernatremic during hospital stay with sodium in the max of 150.
On [**11-5**] after patient became lucid and was able to answer questions for herself, the patient wanted to be full code so thus patient is full code at this point in time.
Status post fall with acetabular head dislocation, complicated by lumbar artery bleed, status post embolization for hypovolemic shock.
