Admission Date:  [**2189-7-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-7-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-8-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**] Chief Complaint: Diarrhea, thrombocytopenia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 65 yo F with chronic anemia, hypothyroidism and recent C Diff admitted with recurrent GI symptoms, hypotension and thrombocytopenia.
The patient had brown watery diarrhea 3-4 times per day in mid [**Month (only) 205**] after taking a course of Augmentin for otitis media.
Her GI symptoms had resolved at the conclusion of this treatment.
Six days ago, she began to develop recurrent vomiting, diarrhea and weakness.
Past Medical History: Thalassemia trait with chronic anemia Hypothyroidism Impingement syndrome of shoulder  Social History: Former smoker.
Anicteric sclera.
Neck: No masses or asymmetry.
No thyromegaly.
Abd: Soft, nontender, no masses or organomegaly.
Skin: No rashes, ulcers or lesions.
Imaging: Head CT ([**7-19**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
There is thumbprinting and haustral thickening throughout the colon consistent with C. diff colitis.
There is no evidence for free air.
IMPRESSION: Significant wall thickening in the transverse and descending colon consistent with history of C. diff.
Discharge Labs:  Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo F with thallesemia trait, bipolar disease, with an episode of diarrheal illness one month ago following a course of amoxicillin that was presumed to be cdiff and treated with flagyl for two weeks.
She developed 4 days of increasing watery diarrhea prior to admission and was initialy admitted to the floor on [**7-19**] with hypotension, but despite multiple liters of NS, she remained hypotensive and developed an SVT to the 170s.
She was emperically started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl and PO vanco on the floor but was then transferred to the ICU for persistent hypotension.
After receiving additional fluid, her BPs improved and she has had slight decrease in the frequency of her diarrhea.
Hematology was consulted for thrombocytopenia without active bleeding that was felt most likely due to her acute infectious diease vs possible underlying ITP.
# Diarrhea:  The patient has a known history of C.diff and there is documentation of a recent +C.diff at PCP's office, therefore, this is the most likely diagnosis.
The patient was treated with PO vancomycin and IV Flagyl for C difficile infection.
The treatment course is planned for 14 of PO vancomycin beginning from [**7-21**]  #Hypotension: On presentation, the patient was hypotensive and met the criteria for sepsis given her tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis.
Her hypotension was determined to be secondary to severe volume depletion in the setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake.
#Atrial flutter:  On presentation, the patient was tachycardic and to be in atrial flutter.
This improved resolved with fluid resuscitation but she had another episode of afib on arrival to the medical floor.
#Lower extremity edema: Pitting edema present on [**7-23**] and [**7-24**].
Suspected cause is fluid resuscitation in ICU.
Heme was consulted and they did not find on any evidence of destruction on workup and they considered possible ITP, but given some improvement at discharge we did not keep her for a bone marrow biopsy as she was nervous about the procedure.
#Thalassemia with chronic anemia.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
She should f/u with PCP to recheck CBC and discuss colon cancer screening.
Repeat Iron studies after treated for cdiff.
#Stable issues: Bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism.
