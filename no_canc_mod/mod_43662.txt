Admission Date:  [**2124-3-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-3-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2049-2-9**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, aortic valve replacement times 2, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and benign prostatic hypertrophy with indwelling Foley who presented to the hospital on [**2124-3-13**] with blood in his Foley catheter.
The patient was ill-feeling with increased lower abdominal pain and pressure.
He also reported a fever, shortness of breath as well as chest pain.
The patient was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation at 150 beats per minute in acute respiratory distress with a fever up to 104.
Additionally, the patient had a bladder scan which showed a markedly distended bladder.
The chest pain resolved and his heart rate was controlled with a Cardizem drip.
Urinalysis in the hospital showed the urine to be red, opaque with moderate leukocytes, positive nitrates, large blood, greater than 300 protein.
CBC on arrival showed a significantly increased white blood cell count at 23.2 with a bandemia, 64 polys, 36 bands as well as UA consistent with urinary tract infection.
The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation and was weight controlled on a Diltiazem drip.
While in the MICU, the patient significantly improved with no chest pain and decreased shortness of breath and, therefore, was called out to the medical service on [**2124-3-15**].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 2 liters of home O2.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
Atrial fibrillation.
Type II diabetes mellitus.
Chronic gastrointestinal bleed with small bowel AVM's.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy with indwelling Foley in place.
In general, the patient is a pleasant elderly man in no apparent distress.
Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat: Anicteric, moist mucus membranes, extraocular movements are intact, pupils, equal, regular, and react to light and accommodation, difficult to assess jugular venous distention secondary to tremor.
Chest: With a diffuse rhonchi at lower lobes bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border with mechanical valve opening and closing appreciated secondary to the patient's mechanical aortic valve with a rate in the 80's.
Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
No calf tenderness.
Blood culture from [**2124-3-14**] grew gram positive cocci in pairs and chains and the urine culture from [**2124-3-13**] grew enterococcus and the sensitivities were pending.
PERTINENT STUDIES:  On [**2124-3-13**], a chest x-ray showed bibasilar opacities, significant for aspiration versus infection.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 75-year-old male with type II diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and benign prostatic hypertrophy presenting with urosepsis.
Both the urine culture and the blood cultures from [**3-14**] and 5th grew out enterococcus which was resistant to Levaquin, therefore, due to the fact that the patient is allergic to penicillin, he was unable to be started on ampicillin and vancomycin was the drug of choice.
The patient remained afebrile and his white blood cell count trended down throughout his stay.
Cardiovascular:  The patient did have multiple brief episodes of chest pain during his stay.
As previously mentioned, both PTE and PEE were performed revealing no evidence of any vegetation on the mechanical aortic valve.
PEE did reveal a small paravalvular leak, normal left ventricular size and function, normal right ventricular size was functioned moderately decreased.
The mitral valve was found to be calcified with 2+ mitral regurgitation and the prosthetic aortic valve with mechanical leaflet was found to have a 1 to 2+ paraprosthetic leak and tricuspid regurg of 1+.
Throughout the remainder of his stay, the patient's heart rate remained well controlled and was in sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial contractions.
He occasionally became short of breath along with blood transfusions which resolved after giving Lasix.
His volume status was monitored closely for any signs of congestive heart failure.
Gastrointestinal:   The patient has a history of a chronic gastrointestinal bleed.
There were no significant gastrointestinal issues throughout his stay.
Genitourinary:   Urology was consulted regarding the patient's benign prostatic hypertrophy and urosepsis secondary to his urinary obstruction.
Initially, they suggested transurethral resection of prostate in conjunction with suprapubic catheter placement for benign prostatic hypertrophy.
This is a middle of the road level of anticoagulation balancing the need for anticoagulation based on his history of atrial fibrillation and mechanical aortic valve with his history of chronic gastrointestinal bleed secondary to small bowel AVM.
On [**3-24**], the patient's INR was found to be significantly elevated at 3.8.
Additionally, he noticed bruise on his right lower extremity which had evolved into a painful mass on his right shin.
This looked to be a hematoma which the patient that has been present, but worsening over one week's time.
This is likely secondary to his increased INR in the face of trauma.
Endocrine: Type II diabetes mellitus, the patient was continued on Avandia and glipizide as well as the regular insulin sliding scale throughout his stay.
Musculoskeletal:  Due to the significant discomfort the patient was having related to the right lower extremity hematoma and subsequent swelling of the right ankle, ankle and tibia/fibula plain x-ray films were performed.
This showed no evidence of a stress fracture.
It was significant for soft tissue swelling.
Furthermore, the patient was continued on Fentanyl patch for pain secondary to vertebral compression fractures.
Tubes, lines and drains:  Again, the patient has a PIC line in place for long term antibiotics and he also has an indwelling Foley catheter.
Urosepsis with enterococcus bacteremia.
Right lower extremity hematoma secondary to subtherapeutic INR.> 3.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
History of atrial fibrillation.
Type II diabetes mellitus.
Chronic gastrointestinal bleed with small bowel AVM's.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy with indwelling Foley.
Maalox for constipation 15 to 30 milliliters p.o.
chest pain q.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**], urology as an outpatient regarding benign prostatic hypertrophy and further management (i.e.
transurethral resection of prostate versus PID-straight catheter, versus continuous Foley.
