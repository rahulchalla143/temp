He developed pain in his neck with radiation to his shoulder following his cracked tooth incident.
He describes the pain as throbbing.
This pain continued for a few days however he states he has a high tolerance for pain and he ignored it.
After dinner he was resting in bed and developed diaphoresis and anxiety.
Following discharge he underwent an exercise thallium where he developed ST depression and imaging revealed antero-apical and inferoseptal ischemia.
LVEF of 44% with inferior and septal hypokinesis.
He was found to have left main disease upon catheterization and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The apex, apical and mid portions of the inferior, inferolateral and inferoseptal walls are hypokinetic.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Mitral regurgitation is trace.
Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal     mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary     artery; reversed saphenous vein single graft from the     aorta to the ramus intermedius coronary artery; reversed     saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the     posterior descending coronary artery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Glyburide was resumed for Diabetes management.
