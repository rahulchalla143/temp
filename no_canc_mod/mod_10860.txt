Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cerebral angiography with attempted stent placement Endotracheal intubation (for procedure)   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 70 year old woman with a history of a coiled basilar artery aneurysm s/p coiling and VPS, AF, CAD (s/p stents), HTN, HL, DM2 who reportedly has had ataxia for one month.
There was no head injury or loss of consciousness.
She does endorse some mild periorbital (right predominant) headache without nausea or vomiting.
She has felt dizzy and "light on the legs"; today it started when she woke up and was persistent.
At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], she reportedly said that her symptoms had acutely worsened over about four hours.
She received a NCHCT which revealed a left cerebellar hypodensity of unknown chronicity (likely subacute).
She was also found to be hyperglycemia and hypertensive.

The right costophrenic angle is now clear and there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
CT/CTA Head/neck [**2138-3-16**]: No change in the left cerebellar infarct compared with the previous CT of the [**Hospital3 628**].
No acute hemorrhage seen.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates approximately 50-60% stenosis at the right carotid bifurcation with exuberant calcification.
Other arteries of the neck demonstrate no evidence of high-grade stenosis.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of occlusion or  stenosis or filling defect in the posterior circulation arteries.
In the anterior circulation, no occlusion or stenosis seen.
MRI [**2138-3-17**]: Subacute infarction involving the left cerebellar hemisphere and left superior cerebellar peduncle.
Questionable 7-mm enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere posteriorly of unknown significance, which may represent an old infarction.
EKG: [**2138-3-18**]: Sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes.
Possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Delayed R wave progression.
Non-specific ST segment flattening in the high lateral leads.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 89 154 90 376/426 58 -27 126  Cerebral angiogram [**2138-3-19**]:  Left vertebral artery arteriogram shows widely patent left vertebral artery.
At the basilar artery there is a giant thrombosed aneurysm in the basilar apex with a small portion filling measuring about 2 x 3 mm.
GROIN U/S [**2138-3-19**]: 2.5 cm right groin hematoma without evidence of pseudoaneurysm or fistula.
CXR [**2138-3-20**]: Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and accompanied by mild pulmonary [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] engorgement, new perihilar haziness and more confluent opacities at the bases, accompanied by small effusions.
Findings are likely due to perihilar and basilar edema, but superimposed process such as aspiration at the lung bases is also possible.
There was no head injury or loss of consciousness.
At this OSH, she received a NCHCT which revealed a left cerebellar hypodensity of unknown chronicity.
She was seen by our ED Neurology resident and was found to be dysmetric on the left, few beats of right beating nystagmus and was quite inattentive.
Her CTA on admission showed the presence of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis which was expected given her history of [**Hospital1 1106**] risk factors.
Initial labs showed the presence of a urinary tract infection, later speciated as E coli.
The MRI showed evidence of restricted diffusion in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
It also showed her basilar aneurysm with evidence of prior coils (both from [**Hospital1 **] and from [**Hospital1 112**]).
There was no evidence of underlying mass or [**Hospital1 1106**] malformation.
Her examination remained largely stable; her level of awareness would often fluctuate in a manner that was consistent with her history of anoxic brain damage (at the time of prior AAA repair).
Her blood sugars as expected were difficult to control, and in conjunction with the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes service, we were able to obtain better control of her blood sugars using sliding scale and scheduled insulin.
In the setting of her stroke while on atrial fibrillation, we initially considered coumadin.
They scheduled her for a repeat angiogram with possible stent/coiling on [**2138-3-19**] and she was loaded with plavix.
This showed a small amount of recanalized area for the aneurysm.
2. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
9. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cerebellar stroke Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Atrial fibrillation History of AAA repair Basilar artery tip aneurysm   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Inattentive, often poorly oriented.
Level of Consciousness: Alert to somnolent at times, depending upon the quality of sleep she receives at night Activity Status: Ambulatory with one assist  Discharge Neurological examination: Slight dysmetria on left, normal eye movements, generally symmetric strength and sensation.
This likely occurred due to your irregular heart rate (atrial fibrillation).
We also measured various laboratory tests and we found that your diabetes and elevated cholesterol were elevated to dangerous levels.
This will reduce the risk of future strokes.
