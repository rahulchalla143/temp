Admission Date:  [**2129-1-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2129-1-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2129-1-11**]       Sex:  F  Service: NEONATOLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS;  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 6359**] delivered at 36 and 6/7 weeks gestation, weighing 2260 grams, and was admitted to the Intensive Care Nursery from Labor and Delivery for evaluation and management of a prenatal diagnosis of Dandy Walker variant.
[**Hospital 37544**] medical history is notable for thalassemia trait.
Obstetrical history notable for uterine didelphys, a previous full term infant in [**2125**], and a preterm infant delivered at 32 weeks gestation in [**2126**], requiring treatment for respiratory distress syndrome at [**Hospital3 1810**].
This pregnancy was uncomplicated until an ultrasound at 29 weeks gestation revealed posterior fossa enlargement, fourth ventricle dilatation, and general growth restriction.
A fetal magnetic resonance scan on [**2128-12-2**], showed absent corpus callosum, vermian hypoplasia, colpocephaly, posterior fossa enlargement, and fourth ventricle dilatation.
This infant was delivered by cesarean section due to prior cesarean section and uterine anomaly.
Breath sounds clear and equal, regular rate and rhythm, soft I/VI systolic ejection murmur with 2+ femoral pulses.
This was thought due to nasal edema as the nose was flattened and slightly deviated to the left due to positioning in utero.
Initially, the infant would desaturate with feedings due to poor pacing and probably due to nasal congestion which has resolved by discharge.
The patient has not had any oxygen desaturations since [**2129-1-15**], and at discharge is breathing comfortably in the 30s to 40s with some mild nasal noise at times.
No history of apnea.
On discharge examination, a soft systolic ejection murmur audible at the left sternal border with normal brachial and femoral pulses.
The infant was initially maintained on D10W by peripheral intravenous and enteral feeds were started on day of life one and intravenous fluids were stopped.
The first several days of life, the infant had some feeding discoordination with poor pacing of suck, swallow and breathe which has improved greatly by discharge.
Infectious disease - No infectious disease issues.
A prenatal magnetic resonance scan suggested Dandy Walker variant.
It is too early to determine whether there are any other associated migrational abnormalities.
Will need to be followed clinically for developmental delay or any other signs of migrational problems such as seizures.
Genetics - The infant was seen by genetics on admission for dysmorphic features that included low set posteriorly rotated ears, long filtrum, and high palate.
Ophthalmology - The patient was seen by ophthalmology from [**Hospital3 1810**] to rule out Aicardi syndrome.
The ophthalmologist saw the same crescent of tissue at lateral limbus and said this was of no visual significance and expected that it would disappear in one to two weeks.
Appropriate gestational age, mildly premature, female.
Cerebellar hypoplasia.
Dysmorphic features.
