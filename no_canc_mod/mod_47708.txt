The impression of the magnetic resonance scan was degenerative changes of the lumbosacral spine and there are postoperative changes.
There is a mild spinal canal narrowing at L4-L5.
There is a soft tissue structure in the pelvis which is incomplete at this time on my examination and might be further investigated with CT imaging.
