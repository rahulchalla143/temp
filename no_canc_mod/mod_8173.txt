Panischemic colitis.
Renal failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old female who presented to [**Hospital1 69**] emergency room with diffuse diarrhea and hypotension.
Patient has a complicated past medical history including most recently an admission for a pedestrian versus car accident where she suffered bilateral lower extremity fractures as well as a C-2 fracture which required immobilization.
Patient was eventually discharged to rehabilitation after having fasciotomy for compartment syndrome of her lower extremities.
She was being treated for multiple infections including urinary tract infection and pneumonia.
Patient presented to [**Hospital1 69**] emergency room with a two day history of first constipation and then diffuse diarrhea.
t.i.d., Fleet enema p.r.n., milk of magnesia p.r.n., Tylenol p.r.n., Dulcolax p.r.n., Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
Patient appeared generally cachectic in severe distress with a healing scar over the right eye and was in an immobilizing [**Location (un) 5622**] collar.
Abdomen was distended with diffuse tenderness most markedly in the upper quadrants.
Extremities were immobilized in knee immobilizers and had 2+ pitting edema in the upper and lower extremities.
UA was positive for white cells and nitrites.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with right bundle branch block with nonspecific ST depressions in V1 and aVL.
KUB showed dilated loops of small bowel without evidence of obstruction.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions with right lower lobe atelectasis.
CT which was performed showed diffuse swelling and edema of her entire colon as well as her rectum with ascites, but no free air, consistent with either toxic C.diff or ischemic colitis.
At the time of surgery there were large amounts of ascites and a very edematous, but not perforated, colon.
Patient was relatively stable during the operative course, but postoperatively in the intensive care unit she remained intubated and became fluid requiring and hypoxic.
Final diagnoses as above including ischemic colitis with sepsis and multisystem organ failure.
