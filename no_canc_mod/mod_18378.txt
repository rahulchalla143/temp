There was concern that he had progression of his bleed and CT scan was repeated which showed evolution of hemorrhage with stable edema, no midline shift and no new intra or extra- axial hemorrhage or infarct.
Neurosurg was initially consulted but given no new changes on CT did not feel it was necessary to admit him to neuro ICU.
He therefore is admitted to medicine with headache and hypertension with sbps in the 180s.
In addition, in the ED, he had periods of apnea with desats to low 90s and high 80s and per family may have sleep apnea which has never been diagnosed.
In a discussion with he and his family, patient eats well, no aspiration events, no cough or fever.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2126-10-10**]: A large left parietotemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is unchanged in size and slightly less hyperdense compared to a few days prior consistent with evolution of hemorrhagic components with stable surrounding edema and mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
A tiny amount of dependent blood is noted within the occipital horns bilaterally, less compared to [**10-5**].

Non-diagnostic small Q waves in the inferior leads.
Non-specific anterior ST-T wave changes.
Compared to tracing of [**2126-10-4**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
TRACING #1  Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2126-10-10**]  10:12:42 PM   Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response.
Compared to tracing #1 there is no significant diagnostic change.
Mild-to-moderate large cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
There are no lung consolidations or overt pulmonary edema.
No mass lesions are identified.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
No renal masses, calculi, or hydronephrosis is identified.
Unremarkable liver without evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Ectatic, aneurysmal atherosclerotic abdominal aorta measuring 4.2 x 3.9 cm at the mid-portion of the abdomen, with anterior thrombosed component.
[**2126-10-21**]: MDCT-acquired contiguous axial slices are obtained through the brain without administration of intravenous contrast.
FINDINGS: Areas of low attenuation in the periventricular white matter suggestive of chronic microangiopathic ischemic disease are noted.
There is no evidence of new bleed or masses.
The previously demonstrated left parietotemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is again visualized and demonstrates decrease in attenuation consistent with evolution of hemorrhage.
There is evidence of low attenuation surrounding the hemorrhage, suggestive of parenchymal edema which causes compression of the left posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle and adjacent sulci, causing a minimal 2.4 mm midline shift to the right.
Overall the ventricles appear mildly dilated and the sulci appear prominent.
There is evidence of left mastoid air cell opacification.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the cavernous portions of bilateral carotid arteries.
IMPRESSION: Changes consistent with hemorrhagic evolution of the left parietotemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage as described above.
No new areas of hemorrhage are identified.
ECHO (TTE): Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: Initialy confusion and somnolence was likely from the low Na levels and narcotic use at rehab.
With fluid restriction the Na levels normalized and no narcotics or sedatives were used.
The patient may have an element of obstructive as well as centaal sleep apnea (from the CVA) and is advised to follow up in sleep clinic for a formal evaluation.
Had intermittent headaches with resolution with Tylenol.
CT head repeated and again no new events were seen.
Dilantin subsequently stopped based on neurology recommendation due to hepatitis (see below)  HTN- Patient hypertensive in the ED.
No ekg changes or head CT changes to suggest hypertensive emergency.
Hyponatremia- Likely due to SIADH.
Ultiimately, his sodium corrected with fluid restriction.
Patient did not report any abdominal symptoms.
Abdominal U/S was done and was negative for hepatobiliary process as above.
He should be placed on a lipid lowering [**Doctor Last Name 360**] once his transaminitis resolves with very close monitoring of LFT's.
Hyperkalemia - transiently noted upto 5.3. resolved with stopping lisinopril.
Hematuria - transiently noted.
repeat UA with no RBCs.
Evaluated by PT and OT and recommend acute rehab.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Medical Center - [**Hospital1 3597**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hyponatremia / Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH secretion Stroke with residual deficits hepatitis, likely drug induced / pancreatitis Inracranial hemorrhage Atrial fibrillation Hypertension Orthostatic hypotension Hyperkalemia Hypoxia, Apnea - resolved Gout Hematuria Abdominal aortic aneurysm   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: As you know, you recently had an intracerebral hemorrhage after a stroke.
You also had a decrease in your sodium and a condition called SIADH.
You were found to have elevated liver and pancreas enzymes.
Weekly liver tests are recommended till they return to normal.
You were started on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
You will need the INR levels to be closely monitored while at rehab and thereafter to follow up with your doctor to have your blood level monitored.
Being on the warfarin or coumadin you are at an increased risk of bleeding.
These may be signs of a stroke or a bleed in your head.
if you notice any new symptoms of concern to you, contact your doctor.
You should return to the emergency room for any significant bleeding or signs of a stroke.
You should also discuss further management of your abdominal aortic aneurysm and blood in urine.
