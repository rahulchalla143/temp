Pertinent Results: OSH CT read [**2199-9-20**] Small left frontal ICH without associated mass effect.
Curvilinear parietal extra-axial high attenuation is presumably related to motion artifact, although given the additional ICH, a follow-up CT should be performed to more definitvely exclude a small amount of extra axial blood.
No hydrocephalus or midline shift.
No mass effect.
Mild diffuse cerebral atrophy, with midl chronic white matter heterogeneity.
No visualized skull fracture.
Tiny focus of high attenuation in teh right posterior parietal scalp, probable foreign body.
Repeat CT head [**2199-9-21**] Prelim read Small focus of left frontal SAH is unchanged from the OSH CT a few hours earlier.
Moderate to severe degenerative changes at C6/7 with posterior disc protrusion narrowing the spinal canal.
He received dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
