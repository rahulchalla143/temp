Based on previous cardiac MRI, there seems to be disease within the coronaries, and possibly evidence of scar of the myocardium.
He is being evaluated for ischemic cardiomyopathy.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
he denies chest pain, DOE, PND, Orthopnea, palpitations or presyncope.
(+) include postnasal drop with resultant intermittent cough.
He is also active at home, taking care of his horses, carrying heavy hay bales, and ascending the [**Doctor Last Name **] to his barn without chest discomfort, dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, lightheadedness, or any palpitations."
Postoperative atrial fibrillation status post tracheoplasty.
Severe global cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology diagnosed on [**2187-5-16**] with CTA revealing probable nonobstructive coronary disease.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli found incidentally on CTA.
Diffuse tracheobronchomalacia, status post tracheobronchial stent on [**3-8**], removed on [**3-26**].
Severe persistent asthma.
Recurrent pneumonia for 30 years.
Chronic sinusitis status post three sinus surgeries.
Family History: Parents are both deceased, father in his 80s from COPD and throat cancer, mother in her 80s of congestive heart failure.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No angioedema, some post nasal drip.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 4 cm, no carotid bruits.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
2D-[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2187-5-16**]: The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate left ventricular dilatation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with preserved right ventricular systolic function.
Mildly increased left ventricular cavity size with mild global hypokinesis and more pronounced hypokinesis of the basal to mid portion of the septum.
The LVEF was mildly decreased at 41%.
Mild pulmonic regurgitation.
The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were mildly increased and normal, respectively.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
There were lesions noted in the proximal LAD, proximal LCx, and mid RCA.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling presures with a RVEDP of 9mm Hg and slightly low left sided filling pressures with a LVEDP of 9mm Hg.
Pericardial calcifications were noted.
Patient had a severe vagal reaction during the procedure, requiring atropine (2m IV) and transient dopamine support.
Low filling pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo male with h/o h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, PE, tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheobronchoplasty, who presents for aspirin desensitization and RHC/LHC to evaluate for ischemic cardiomyopathy  # CORONARIES:  Based on CMR, it seems there are lesions noted in the proximal LAD, prox LCX and mid RCA with enhancement of the basal to mid portion of septum which could be c/w scar.
Given these findings, and previous ECHO with EF 25%, there is a concern for ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Patient admitted for ASA desensitization with eventual goal of LHC/RHC to evaluate coronaries and cardiac pressures.
# PUMP: The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy 25% on echo, then following CMR with EF 41%.
Query ischemic cardiomyopathy.
ECG NSR w/ LAD, LVH and nonspecific repolarization anl.
Aspirin desensitization: The patient was desensitized to ASA per protocol without event.
# Asthma: Severe persistent.
No wheezing on exam.
Last exacerbation > 1year.
# Allergic rhinitis: Currently stable.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease Cardiomyopathy Aspirin Desensitization   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
You were admitted to the cardiac ICU, and were monitored overnight and tolerated the aspirin well without complications.
You then had a cardiac catheterization which showed one blockage of an artery but was not felt to need intervention.
If you develop any of the following symptoms, please call your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**], or go to the ED: chest pains, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, bleeding or oozing from the groin site, or loss of sensation in your foot or leg.
