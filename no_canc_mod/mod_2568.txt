HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 69 year old Caucasian male admitted with multiple episodes of congestive heart failure with prior multiple admissions, all of which have been medically managed.
The patient had first episode of congestive heart failure approximately three years ago requiring hospitalization.
The patient noted recent increased chest pain and increased dyspnea and lightheadedness.
An echocardiogram done at that time demonstrated findings of severe aortic stenosis, and 80 millimeter aortic valve gradient and also moderate aortic regurgitation.
The catheterization revealed significant two vessel coronary artery disease, significant aortic and mitral valve disease.
There was 60% distal left anterior descending stenosis.
There was a 70% stenosis of the non-dominant right coronary artery.
There is evidence of one over two severe aortic stenosis and moderate aortic regurgitation.
There was evidence of moderate mitral valve regurgitation.
Significant for congestive heart failure times two years, 2.
Aortic stenosis.
Mitral valve regurgitation.
Status post myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Status post partial gastrectomy.
Status post repair of umbilical hernia in [**11-22**].
Status post repair of ventral hernia.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
In general, he was well appearing, slightly anxious but in no apparent distress.
Neck examination was supple; no masses were palpated.
Lung examination clear to auscultation bilaterally; no wheezes or rhonchi noted.
Cardiac examination is regular rate and rhythm with III-IV/VI systolic ejection murmur noted at the left lower sternal border.
Abdominal examination:  The patient is obese with midline surgical scar, well healed.
Extremity examination with no edema.
There were no carotid bruits noted.
On [**2165-12-3**], the patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times one / aortic valve repair / mitral valve repair.
The mitral valve ring angioplasty was done using a #28 [**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty band and the coronary artery bypass grafting was done with a reverse saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the left anterior descending coronary artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications during the case.
The patient did have an episode of bradycardia requiring pacing.
He had an underlying junctional rhythm of approximately 44 to 48 beats per minute and he was able to maintain his blood pressure with this rate without the need for further pressors.
The patient was doing quite well clinically, denying any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or weakness.
The patient continued to have bradycardia with a junctional rhythm.
The patient was determined to have a sinus node dysfunction but remained asymptomatic with a stable junctional escape rhythm.
The patient was placed on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts Event Monitor.
The patient's pain was well controlled with oral medication and he had been out of bed and ambulating with Physical Therapy.
On [**2165-12-13**], which is postoperative day number four, the patient had his wires pulled and there were no complications associated with this procedure.
The pain was well tolerated on oral pain medications.
There were no events recorded by the [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts Monitors.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Aortic stenosis.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Myocardial infarction.
Status post prostate surgery.
Status post umbilical hernia repair.
Status post ventral hernia repair.
Status post subdural hematoma approximately four years ago.
Status post lipoma removal.
