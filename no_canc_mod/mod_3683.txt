Admission Date:  [**2118-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-10-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-6-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Imdur / Haldol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 66 F c CAD/CHF, diabetes, hypertension, [**First Name3 (LF) 20440**] [**First Name3 (LF) 20441**], schizoaffective disorder, who presents with shortness of breath.
The pt recalls that she started to have trouble breathing this morning.
It was initally associated with non-radiating chest pain over her left chest and sternum, which was pressure like, pleuritic and positional as well as intermittent and resolved completed already when "the paramedics started working on me".
On further questioning the patient reports shortness of breath already overnight as well as 3-pillow orthopnea.
She also has had about a 20lb weight loss over the last months since her hospitalization.
Also positive for constipation for three months, mild "abdominal cramping".
No recent sedentary episodes but at baseline not very mobile.
CXR was done and showed mild pulmonary edema.
CHF (diastolic dysfunction w/ EF >55%, 1+ AR and 2+MR) H/o rheumatic heart disease w/ mild AR [**Month/Year (2) **] [**Month/Year (2) 20441**] DM 2, diet controlled HTN Schizoaffectie disorder Hypercholesteronemia ?
COPD Restricitve pattern on Spirometry in [**2113**] History of pulmonary embolus in [**2080**], while taking oral contraceptives, s/p IVC "interruption procedure") H/o thyroiditis H/o seizure disorder from infancy to age of 17 .
Has home nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] her regularly for daily acitivity as well; Tobacco abuse: 30 pyrs, quit in [**2118-4-14**], social drinker; no illicit drugs  Family History: CAD in mother at age 68.
No history of coagulation problems in her family.
PAST STUDIES: Stress Mibi [**5-24**]: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
No reversible myocardial perfusion defect is identified.
[**Month/Year (2) **]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers (however images suboptimal; cannot exclude).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Spirometry in [**2113**]: mild restricitve pattern .
CT chest [**9-26**]: Interval increase in size of the dominant right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
The interval growth and CT morphology are highly suspicious for malignancy.
Tiny lingular and left lower lobe nodules were previously obscured by atelectasis on the study of [**2118-5-12**].
3) Stable, ectatic thoracic aorta.
[**9-28**] EKG: SR, HR 67, NA, NI, no ST/TW changes .
[**2118-9-28**] CHEST XR (PORTABLE AP): There is vascular pedicles engorgement.
The pulmonary vessels are indistinct with mild cephalization.
These findings are consistent with hydrostatic edema.
There is a tortuous aorta.
No definite blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen to suggest large effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiogenic hydrostatic edema.
Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old Female with CAD/CHF, diabetes, hypertension, [**Month/Day/Year 20440**] [**Month/Day/Year 20441**], schizoaffective disorder, and lung nodule who presents with shortness of breath, most likely due to CHF with component of mild COPD exacerbation.
Hypoxia: likely due to CHF with component of mild COPD exacerbation.
MICU team's suspicion for PE was low given the clinical context, no recent sedentary episodes, and no clinical concern for DVT.
However they did consider that she might be at increased risk for coagulation as her recent CT findings were suspicious for malignancy.
Repeat CXR in the morning showed minimal change in pulmonary edema.
Felt secondary to heart failure and possibly underlying COPD.
Heart Failure, diastolic: no clear precipitating factor for exacerbation, however most likely dietary indiscretion and possibly hypertension.
TSH was checked given history of thyroiditis and was normal.
Florinef was held, as it could contribute to CHF symptoms and there was no clear indication in past notes for its continued use.
Could consider repeat stress testing although given severe debilitation and [**Hospital1 20440**] [**Hospital1 20441**], would need chemical stress.
Coronary Artery Disease: History of PCI in [**2115**].
Ruled out for MI here.
Hypertension: BP elevated on admission, unclear if causitive of heart failure or in response to heart failure, extremis.
Short acting isordil changed to imdur on [**9-30**].
Consider adding ace inhibition as outpatient as indications include chf, cad and ckd.
COPD exacerbation: mild, no clear precipitating factor, no evidence of infection.
6 Pulmonary nodule: Recent outpatient CT demonstrated suspicious pulmonary nodule in RUL.
Likely due to HTN and Diabetes.
9 Diabetes mellitus: The patient has managed her diabetes with diet.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Pulmonary Nodule 3.
Hypertension 4.
COPD Secondary: 1.
Chronic kidney disease, stage II 2.
Coronary Artery Disease 3.
Type II Diabetes mellitus, controlled 4.
If you have return of your shortness of breath or develop any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills or any other new concerning symptoms, contact your doctor or go to the emergency room.
