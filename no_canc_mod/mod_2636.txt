Admission Date:  [**2201-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2201-2-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2137-4-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ketorolac / Nalbuphine / Simvastatin / Atorvastatin / Crestor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Persistent RLL obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubatation Arterial Line placed IJ line placed at OSH removed PICC line placed Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 15036**] is a 63 year-old woman with a history of sarcoidosis who presents on transfer for evaluation of persistent cough/fever and RLL obstruction.
Over the next few weeks she continued to have coughing spells without improvement.
PFTs showed FVC 66%, FEV1 60%, FEV/FVC 76% predicted with no change with bronchodilators.
Symptoms initially improved with steroids though RLL infiltrate persisted.
Bronchoscopy was done on [**2200-12-26**] and showed segmental material partially obstructing the posterior segment of the RLL with marked friability and edema.
Biopsy showed chronic inflammation with focal acute inflammation superimposed.
Immunostains showed crushed material positive for CD-45 and negative for pancytokeratin.
CT showed RLL consolidation with stenotic areas.
Seen in pulm follow-up and underwent rigid bronchoscopy ([**2201-1-27**]) with removal of foreign body/vegetable material along opening of stenotic bronchis of RLL.
Per the family, the patient continued to have symptoms of cough and fevers in the days after the procedure.
Readmitted to OSH on [**2-5**] with fever, malaise and SOB.
Course was complicated by episodes of tachypnea to 40s.
Subsequent echo showed EF of 30% and anterior spetal wall motion abnormality.
Diabetes 3.
Hypertension 4.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
Pancreatic disease - s/p cholecystectomy, [**2177**] - s/p sphincterotomy, [**2177**] - numerous ERCP 6.
Chronic abdominal/back pain with history of detox 7.
Osteoporosis with compression fractures 9.
Peptic ulcer disease 10.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 11.
Depression  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1.
Rib fracture, thought secondary to coughing ([**1-5**]) 6.
Family History: Father: died of CVA Mother: died of MI/COPD Brother: died of MI (age 65)   Physical Exam: GEN: Obese.
Left-sided tenderness with small anterior hematoma.
Trace edema bilaterally.
Hypoxia/Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing a foreign object.
IP performed a flexible bronchoscopy which showed diffuse airway edema and friability, small partial RLL obstructing lesion, and a black lesion in the RUL consistent with invasive aspergillis.
Endobronchial biopsies were performed which eventually showed inflammatory changes and negative fungal stains.
Steroids were weaned and she was extubated briefly with episodes of decompensation (?acute pulmonary edema) requiring BiPAP, eventually requiring reintubation the following day for progressive respiratory distress.
CTA chest was negative for PE but revealed bilateral apical and perihilar ground glass opacities with septal thickening (edema vs. infection), RLL opacity, bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), and densely calcified lymph nodes suggesting prior granulomatous exposure.
She was continued on vancomycin and zosyn for multi-lobar pneumonia to complete a two week course (she completed zosyn prior to discharge).
Her respiratory distress, while likely multifactorial, may have been more related to volume overload than pneumonitis.
ECG showed antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations.
Cardiology was consulted, who thought the initial EF estimate was due to poor echo windows and the NSTEMI due to demand ischemia from intercurrent illness.
Beta blocker was held given her tenuous respiratory status and wheezing.
In the acute setting she was hypertensive in the ICU, which was treated with labetalol and enalapril.
She is currently on lasix mainly for her pulmonary edema (which has largely resolved) and peripheral edema.
Metabolic alkalosis: the patient was actively diuresed in the ICU which may have exacerbated an underlying metabolic alkalosis.
Chronic pain: the patient was treated with percocet q4h prn initially but required intermittent IV morphine 2-4mg for breakthrough pain.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: multifocal pneumonia troponin leak secondary to demand ischemia chronic back pain   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable and afebrile on room air   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for treatment of your respiratory failure, pneumonia and concern for heart attack.
You were treated with antibiotics, fluids, steroids, intubation for a short period of time, and lasix (water pill) for diuresis.
You also had a cardiac catheterization which showed no blockage of your coronary arteries, indicating it was likely you had a stress response and not a heart attack.
If you experience worsening shortness of breath, fevers or chills, chest pains, palpitations or any other concerning symptoms please call your doctor or return to the emergency room.
