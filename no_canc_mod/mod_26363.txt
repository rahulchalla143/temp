Admission Date:  [**2173-3-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-4-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-2-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**] Chief Complaint: Transient ischemic attack, critical left carotid artery stenosis.
Abdominal aortogram with right lower extremity run-off.
Right common femoral to proximal anterior tibial artery bypass with a lateral superficial tunnel using non reversed saphenous vein graft, intraoperative angioscopy and valve lysis.
History of Present Illness: 57yo F with prior CVA with residual right sided numbness s/p right CEA on ASA, Plavix as well as DM Type II, HTN, h/o PVD, who was found down at home with dysarthria, and R sided weakness.
The daughter found her lying on the bathroom floor with difficulty moving her right side as well as speaking in short sentences and she called 911 and the pt was BIBA to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
She slowly lowered herself to the floor as she felt her legs get weak.
The pt denied any frank LOC, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, rigors, night sweats, weight loss, abdominal pain, n/v/d, LH, dizziness, urinary incontinence, bowel incontinence, or confusion.
During transport, the pt had one episode of emesis and two more while in the ED.
The pt also had 4 episodes of "diarrhea" which were new.
She also denies any exotic food intake during this trip.
No one else on the trip has gotten ill as far as she is aware.
She has had difficulty with pain in he right leg, however this is known and she is scheduled for a fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass.
Initially Code stroke was called due to the history of acute dysarthria and right sided weakness.
Neuro consult found the pt to have right pronator drift and right facial and some comprehension problems (which essentially resolved with treatment of hypotension.
Given her hypotension, fever, as well as elevated WBC 19.4 and elevated lactate 5.4 this was thought to be sepsis and a Code Sepsis was called.
IVF (total 4L of NS) and pressors (DA then levophed, both off at time of transfer from ED) were given for hypotension and cultures were drawn.
CXR was read as infrahilar opacities concerning for infiltrates.
A head CT was neg for bleed, CTA was neg for PE and without frank consolidation, mild bibasilar atelectasis.
An Abdominal/Pelvic CT demonstrated wall thickening of transverse-sigmoid colon and scattered diverticuli.
The neurologic signs were thought to be due to hypotension from sepsis bringing out old neurologic findings.
Noted to have small external hemorrhoids on DRE with BRB in rectal vault.
Per GI consult, etiology most likely ischemic bowel [**3-4**] episode of hypotension, but also consider [**Month/Day (2) 1083**] etiology and started on cipro/flagyl.
Deferred [**Last Name (un) **] for outpt and follow serial hct and manage with supportive care.
Pt was bolused w/fluids and HR decreased to 120s-130s, low dose BB re-initiated as tachycardia thought to be [**3-4**] holding her BB in setting of initial hypotension.
Type II Diabetes 3.
Hypertension 4.
Peripheral vascular disease, for right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass  Social History: Pt livers with two daughters at home.
Pt is conversing fluently in full sentences, no dysarthria or word finding difficulties.
HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, anicteric, mm dry, op clear, bilateral elevation of posterior palate CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, ?1/6 SEM best heard at LUSB CHEST: crackles at bases bilaterally ABD: obese, soft, NT, ND, BS+ bilaterally EXT: wwp, no c/c/e, minor abrasions of heels bilaterally, linear scabbing extending from heel to ankle (pt denies hx of trauma).
sensation to RLE > LLE Strength: grossly intact [**6-4**] in UE and LE but slight weakness of right compared to left.
Pertinent Results: STUDIES: CXR [**2173-3-28**]: infrahilar patchy opacities concerning for developing infiltrate vs. aspiration.
ECG [**2173-3-30**] Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-3-30**] the rhythm is now sinus rather than atrial fibrillation.
Intermittent left bundle-branch block persist.
ST segment depressions in lead II and V4-V6 are consistent with ischemia.
There are frequent atrial premature beats with aberrant conduction.
Head CT (non-contrast) [**2173-3-28**] IMPRESSION: No mass effect or hemorrhage.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
This could represent an [**Month/Day/Year 1083**], inflammatory or less likely an ischemic insult due to the extent of involvement.
The pattern of wall thickening can also be seen in pseudomembranous colitis.
Is there a history of recent antibiotic usage?
Small 2-mm nodule in the right middle lobe.
In the absence of a malignancy a one-year followup is recommended to ensure stability.
In the presence of a known malignancy or a high risk a three to six-month followup is recommended.
Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes.
MICRO: [**2173-3-28**] 4:05 pm STOOL     CONSISTENCY: SOFT     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2173-3-29**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
OVA + PARASITES (Final [**2173-3-30**]):       NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
FECAL CULTURE (Pending):     CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2173-3-30**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
Lactate [**2173-3-29**] 04:16AM    1.5 [**2173-3-28**] 10:33PM    2.1* [**2173-3-28**] 08:09PM    2.6* [**2173-3-28**] 06:54PM    3.8* [**2173-3-28**] 05:08PM    2.2* [**2173-3-28**] 04:05PM    2.5* [**2173-3-28**] 02:28PM    5.4   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 57yo F with hx of CVA with residual right sided numbness s/p right CEA on ASA, Plavix as well as DM Type II, HTN, h/o PVD, who was found down at home with dysarthria and R sided weakness in setting of SIRS.
SIRS/Sepsis: The pt was initially hypothermic with tachycardia, hypoxia and elevated WBC count.
In addition, the pt was found to be hypotensive confirming severe SIRS.
However at this point, a source of infection is not clear and the pt does not appear toxic making Sepsis less likely.
The more likely explanation involves possible transient bacteremia resulting in SIRS and hypotension which elicited sx of prior CVA.
The source of the bacteremia is most likely GI in origin given the sx of n/v and diarrhea.
In addition, the CT scan demonstrated some diffuse wall thickening between the transverse colon and sigmoid colon.
The findings of scattered diverticuli are also suspicious as this may also be the source of seeding.
In addition, the pt has a very high WBC count and some history of possible diarrhea making c.diff a possibility.
Other etiology including possible cellulitis from the heel wounds is possible but given its age (from appearance) it is less likely.
MRI/MRA of head was positive for a new lesion in L coronaradiata on [**2173-3-31**].
Pt was restarted on her ASA and plavix, ok'd per GI in setting of no further BRBPR.
GIB: Night of admission, the pt developed GIB with what appeared to be frank blood in her rectal vault.
Undoubtedly there is some component of hemodilution in this pt, however this [**Month (only) **] seems excessive even for dilution.
Pt only had 1 episode of BRBPR and per GI deferred scoping at this admission.
Neuro: The pt initially presented with sx of right sided weakness and dysarthria which is thought to be due to unmasking of old defecits in the setting of hypotension/sepsis especially with possible carotid disease.
Pt no longer had any neuro signs or symptoms at time of MRI/MRA.
Pt also started on low dose ACE-I per Neuro rec to prevent furhter ischemic brain damage with good BP control.
While on the floor pt also had episode of NSVT HR to 130s again asymptomatic.
Etiology thought to be rebound tachycardia in setting of holding all antihypertensive medications while pt was initially hypotensive.
HTN: Pt initially presented with hypotension and all antihypertensive medications were held.
On [**2173-3-31**] pt was persistently hypertensive and was restarted on her Cardizem at a lower dose.
CV: A.  Coronaries: Given the known significant PVD as well as DM in this pt, she most likely has some element of CAD.
ASA, Plavix initially held due to complication of GIB.
She was r/o'd for MI x3 (1st set neg in ED).
Rhythm: NSR but pt became tachycardic intermittently over night with what appears to be a rate related LBBB.
