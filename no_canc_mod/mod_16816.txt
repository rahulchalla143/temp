Admission Date:  [**2157-5-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-6-2**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**] Chief Complaint: right lower leg ischemia with 1st toe ulcer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2157-5-19**] diagnostic RLE angiogram [**2157-5-25**] R Fem to PT bypass with NRSVG   History of Present Illness: 88M presents with 3 days of red discoloration of forefoot and increased intermittent foot pain at night.
He was brought in to his PCP who noted an absence of pulses and signals in the distal foot and sent him to the ED.
He still is able to walk 100ft without stopping and denies any pain with ambulation, although at night he notes increased discomfort.
Past Medical History: PMH: prostate Ca, melanoma back s/p excision and lymphadenectomy, Waldernstroms macroglobulenemia, Diabetes, third degree heart block, paroxsymal atrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated, Skin cancer nose  PSH: Pacer placement, Cryo surgery for the prostate, Melanoma excision with flap, Right axillary lymphadenopathy.
Sensory-motor intact, but no Doppler signals.
1 cm dry eschar on tip of first digit, no evidence of drainage or cellulitis LLE with Doppler signals.
Doppler signal was absent in the right posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries.
IMPRESSION: Severe inflow arterial insufficiency to the lower extremities, worse on the right.
[**5-20**]: IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or objective EKG evidence of myocardial ischemia.
Findings consistent with right 60-69% stenosis.
Findings consistent with left 60-69% stenosis.
Diminished diastolic flow in the right vertebral artery waveform suggests downstream stenosis/occlusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
The other ulcer had no obvious visible vessel and did not show any evidence of bleeding throughout the procedure.
It was unclear if this ulcer was the sole source of bleeding or if there were other ulcers more proximally in the stomach, as this area was obscured by blood during the procedure.
[**5-30**] EGD: Two non-bleeding ulcers in the stomach body, with two previously-placed clips on one of them Two ulcers at the gastroesophageal junction, with stigmata of recent bleeding A single small ulcer in the pre-pyloric region No active bleeding or old blood No duodenual ulcers Small hiatal hernia Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service for right leg ischemia, started on a heparin drip, and scheduled for vein mapping/noninvasives/angiography in preparation for possible intervention.
On [**5-19**] patient underwent a diagnostic angiogram, which demonstrated flow-limiting R CFA calcifications, flush occlusion of R SFA, no visible AK popliteal w/ BK popliteal recon, complete occlusion of R AT with distal recon, complete occlusion of R peroneal, and complete occlusion of R PT with recon at midcalf.
Refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1720**] operative note for further details.
Preoperative cardiac workup consisting of stress testing and echocardiography was negative.
Carotid ultrasound was performed for evaluation of bruits and revealed 60-69% bilateral stenosis.
On [**5-27**] patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which responded to IV metoprolol.
On [**5-28**] patient had an upper GI bleed, requiring transfusion of 3 units of pRBCs for an HCT of 18.
He was transferred to the SICU and started on a Protonix drip, where he underwent endoscopy, during which a bleeding ulcer was clipped.
Repeat endoscopy was performed demonstrating additional ulcers not previously visualized but no active bleeding.
On [**6-2**] patient was tolerating a regular diet, had good pain control, and was working with PT to improve mobility.
