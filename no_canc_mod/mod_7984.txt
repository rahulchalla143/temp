Admission Date:  [**2150-7-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2150-8-13**]   Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2150-7-14**] in congestive heart failure and severe aortic stenosis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was significant for hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, breast cancer status post lumpectomy times three, psoriasis and glaucoma.
In general, the patient was a pleasant, comfortable female in no apparent distress.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, the patient had a slight droop of her left eyelid noted.
The coronary examination revealed a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur.
On pulmonary examination, the patient had bibasilar crackles.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, obese and nondistended.
The groin was without ecchymosis or bruit.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on [**2150-7-21**], where she was found to have severe aortic stenosis, severe mitral regurgitation, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% and three vessel coronary artery disease.
The patient remained in the intensive care unit over the next three days, on mechanical ventilation due to tachypnea and marginal hypoxia with attempted ventilator weaning.
On [**2150-7-29**], the patient was noted to have significant pleural effusions by x-ray and a right chest tube was placed.
Approximately 500 cc of serosanguinous fluid were obtained.
The patient was restless and agitated requiring intravenous Haldol at times.
She was begun on amiodarone for the atrial fibrillation and had been maintained on tube feedings during her intensive care unit stay.
The patient had remained somewhat agitated and disoriented during this time.
On [**2150-8-4**], postoperative day #11, the patient was noted to have a drop in her hematocrit over the previous 24 hours.
A chest x-ray was obtained and it was noted that the patient had a significant left sided pleural effusion, thought to be a hemothorax.
A chest tube was placed in the left pleural space and 1400 cc of dark blood were obtained.
She did not have positive sputum cultures; however, she clinically improved from a pulmonary standpoint after the levofloxacin was initiated.
On postoperative day #13, the patient remained in atrial fibrillation.
it was felt that her chest tube should stay in until she was again therapeutically anticoagulated to be sure that she did not have any increased bleeding associated with her anticoagulation.
On [**2150-8-8**], the chest tube was discontinued when her INR had reached 2.1 and there was no evidence of bleeding.
In the evening of [**2150-8-9**], the patient had a telemetry strip with what appeared to be ventricular tachycardia and an electrophysiology consultation was obtained.
On the following day, [**2150-8-10**], it was noted that the patient had a significant inflammation of the right lower extremity in the area of the wound, thought to be a cellulitis.
A culture of that wound was sent and the result of that was sparse growth of E. coli.
However, since the patient clinically improved over the next few days on the vancomycin, it was felt judicious to leave her on the vancomycin despite not having specific bacteria to be treated with it.
The patient is to continue on her antibiotic course of levofloxacin for tracheobronchitis as well as vancomycin for cellulitis of her right lower extremity, which is improving.
The patient is ready to be discharged today, [**2150-8-13**], to a rehabilitation facility to progress with cardiac rehabilitation for increased strength and endurance.
The patient's most recent chest x-ray is from [**2150-8-10**], which showed cardiomegaly and some degree of congestive heart failure with bilateral atelectasis, left greater than right, which was essentially unchanged from her previous film.
Her target INR should be 2 to 2.5 for treatment of postoperative paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented with no apparent deficits.
The abdomen is obese and slightly distended with positive bowel sounds.
Her sternal incision is clean, dry and intact with Steri-Strips in place.
Her right lower extremity has a large cellulitic area; however, this has significantly improved over the past 48 hours since she has been on the vancomycin.
ANTICOAGULATION:  The patient's Coumadin dose for today has not yet been determined, pending prothrombin time results; her target INR should be 2.0 to 2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease.
Diabetes mellitus.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
