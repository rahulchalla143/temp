He represented this morning with worsening pain and was found, on workup, to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.6.
He was taken for CT scan which revealed severe pneumatosis and portal venous air throughout the liver, SMA and splenic vein.
He vomited bloody fluid in the ED bay and an NGT was placed.
Both he and his famiyl were told that there was a high chance of death with or without an operation, but that without an aoperation he was likely to die very soon, and his best chance of living was an operation.

No previous tracing available for comparison.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
[**2109-6-8**]:  EKG:    Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2109-6-7**] atrial fibrillation is present and ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.
There is now poor R wave progression in leads V1-V3 consistent with possible interim anteroseptal myocardial infarction, although this may be related to lead positioning.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, associated with atelectasis are stable.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
[**2109-6-12**]: x-ray abdomen:   Additional findings; there is a single loop of dilated bowel in the right abdomen.
Degenerative changes are also seen along the spine.
[**2109-6-15**]:  EKG:   Likely atrial flutter with variable conduction.
Possible prior septal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
There are non-specific ST-T wave changes on the current tracing, although these are difficult to differentiate from the P waves of the atrial flutter.
There has been significant interval improvement in the appearance of the small bowel; however, mild small bowel dilatation of the mid ileum is present and thickening of the distal ileum.
No intra-abdominal collection.
Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Gallbladder has high density material within it, possible sludge.
Resolving changes at right base with persistent opacity, question loculated pleural fluid.
Persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, possibly slightly improved.
Bilateral effusions seen posteriorly.
[**2109-6-19**]: chest x-ray:   The right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC.
There is slight interval progression of bilateral pleural effusions with no change in bibasilar atelectasis.
Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is slightly more pronounced on the current study as compared to prior radiograph.
No pneumothorax is seen.
He was found to have a perforated appendix causing a closed loop obstruction.
An appendectomy was performed and he was taken to the SICU postoperatively intubated with an open abdomen for continued resuscitation.
On POD 1, the patient did have transient hypotension and was bolused with albumin.
He also had an episode of atrial fibrillation associated with hypotension.
Aspirin was started and he was transfused 1 uprbc given the elevated troponins and hct of 27.
On POD 2, cardiology was consulted re: elevated troponins--they believed it was secondary to demand ischemia and recommended a TTE.
On POD [**5-3**] he was started on a lasix drip  briefly to facilitate diuresis and abdominal closure.
On POD [**6-3**], he was taken back to the OR for a definitive abdominal closure.
ON POD 7/4/2 he was afebrile but had a persistently elevated leukocytosis.
He had a speech and swallow eval and they rec'd thin liquids, ground solids.
He was started on ciprofloxacin for empiric coverage of c. diff.
He resumed his pre-hospital medication except for his hydrocholorthiazide which was held related to his creatinine and hemodynamic status.
He was evaluated by physical therapy and recommendations have been made for additional rehabilitation because of his deconditioning.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay Skilled Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: perforated appendix pneumotosis portal venous gas abdominal distention   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had imaging studies of your abdomen done which showed you had a perforated appendix and which caused the intestinal obstruction.
You are recovering from your surgery and you are now preparing for discharge to an extended care facility with the following instructions:  Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the Emergency Department for any of the following:  *You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
Incision Care:  *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
