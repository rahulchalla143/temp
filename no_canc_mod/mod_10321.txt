Admission Date:  [**2127-9-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-10-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2055-8-31**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old male with a prior medical history significant for a myocardial infarction in [**2121**].
He was originally treated at an outside hospital in [**2121**] with a successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of an occluded obtuse marginal I.
He was also found to have a 50% mid-left anterior descending lesion at the time.
The patient reports that he also underwent coronary stenting for this lesion, but no report was available.
The patient did well until recently, when he began to complain of progressive exertional chest discomfort and shortness of breath.
He now gets short of breath after walking approximately one-half block.
On [**2127-9-17**], the patient underwent a stress test which was stopped due to severe shortness of breath and fatigue after 3 minutes 30 seconds.
He also complained of chest discomfort at the time, with minimal electrocardiogram changes.
A MIBI at the time revealed a moderate lateral wall and apical reversible defect in addition to a fixed inferior defect.
Left systolic ejection fraction was approximately 54%.
The patient denied any symptoms of claudication, orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lightheadedness.
On [**2127-9-22**], the patient underwent cardiac catheterization given the symptoms of exertional chest pain and a positive MIBI.
Cardiac catheterization showed three vessel coronary artery disease with mild systolic ventricular dysfunction and moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Coronary artery disease status post stenting 2.
History of myocardial infarction in [**2121**] 3.
Hyperlipidemia  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1.
Remote history of hernia repair as a child 3.
Melanoma resection from head and back  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Urinalysis negative.
The left anterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis in the proximal vessel, a 90% stenosis in the mid-vessel.
The first diagonal branch had a 70% stenosis proximally.
The left circumflex artery had a mild luminal irregularity.
The left posterior descending artery had a discrete 90% stenosis at its origin.
Left ventriculography revealed hypokinesis of the inferior wall and a calculated ejection fraction of approximately 52%.
There were no complications.
The patient remained intubated, and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
On postoperative day two, the patient had a very short run of what appeared to be atrial fibrillation, which lasted several seconds, and then he spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm.
In addition, the patient complained of decreased appetite.
