Per patient report, on day of admission to [**Hospital1 34**], she developed acute onset L arm pain in the setting of doing her morning stretches, described as "severe", exertional, without associated chest pain, shortness of breath.
This prompted cardiac catherization that demonstrated 3VD w mild RCA and LAD disease, as well as critical mid LCx lesion.
At [**Hospital1 18**] patient underwent cardiac cath via L radial, underwent placement of DES to mid-Cx without complication.
Given history of reported ASA allergy (1 year ago [**Male First Name (un) **] worsening wheezing / asthma symptoms in past after 3d aspirin, with symptom improvement after ASA cessation), patient was transferred to CCU for post-cath  for ASA desensitization protocol.
On arrival to the floor, patient was without complaint, denied shortness of breath, chest pain, arm pain.
Denied dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course: 57yo F PMHx morbid obesity, DM, HTN, HLD, asthma, history of ASA allergy (induced cough, worsened asthma symptoms) transfered for critical Lcx lesion, now s/p [**Hospital **] transferred to ICU for ASA desensitization protocol.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
# 3 Vessel Coronary Artery Disease s/p PCI with Stent: She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of critical stenosis of her mid left circumflex coronary artery.
On catheterization she was found to have significant 3-vessel disease (please see report for full details) and had placements of DES to mid LCx lesion.
# Aspirin Allergy/Desensitization: This patient with significant history of allergies and atopy had a reported history of reactive airways secondary to aspirin in the past.
Following stent placement, treatment with aspirin became a priority and in consultation with the allergy and immunology team, she underwent a 6 hour desensitization protocol involving montelukast prior to initiation and frequent, escalating doses of aspirin with serial peak flow measurements and close monitoring on tele for possibility of developing a severe reaction.
She was quite anxious during this testing but tolerated the protocol well without complications.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: .
# HTN: Stable.
# Asthma / Chronic Cough: Stable.
# Seasonal Allergies: Stable.
# DM: Stable.
# GERD: Stable.
She was instructed to seek care from her PCP for minor symptoms or a local ED if her symptoms are more concerning with the possbility of transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**] if warranted.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease, Aspirin Desensitization, Asthma Secondary Diagnosis: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Left arm pain free.
Given your history of wheezing and worsening of your asthma after prior aspirin therapy, you were admitted to the CCU after the procedure for aspirin densensitization.
Your asthma was monitored with peak flow measurements and was stable throughout the desensitization.
