of dementia, diverticulosis, and CRI who presents with hypoxia and hypotension with RLL infiltrate on CXR concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
#  ASPIRATION PNA:  Patient with signs/symptoms concerning for pneumonia including fever, hypoxia, and CXR with new infiltrate.
Given elderly state, dementia, and residency in nursing home resident, likely healthcare associated aspiration pneumonia as well as for aspiration event.
She improved over the course of admission, with resolution of her oxygen requirement.
#  Sepsis due to PNA/HYPOTENSION:  Ms. [**Known lastname 92691**] had SBPs in the 80s at her nursing home and now has SBPs in the low 90s upon administration of 1500cc of fluid.
Likely etiology of hypotension is SIRS/sepsis picture from pneumonia or dehydration/insensible losses from poor PO intake and fever.
# Presumed UTI: Urine culture with sensitive E. coli.
BUN/cr ratio suggestive of pre-renal etiology.
# Nutrition: Given patient's severe delirium with dementia, she failed her swallowing evaluation multiple times.
# CODE STATUS:  DNR/DNI  NOTE - while in the hospital her daughter raised the possiblity that she may have had lyme disease exposure nearly 30 years ago, and asked if her arthritides and or cognitive impairments could be at least in part from late lyme disease.
I explained to Mrs.[**Known lastname 92692**] daughter that I felt that this is extremely unlikely as late lyme disease only very rarely leads to mild cognitive impairment.
