Denied CP, SOB, abd pain, N/V, though his son had noted some increased confusion during the previous few days.
ECG demonstrated NSR at 96bpm, LAD, incomplete RBBB, poor r-wave progression.
Later that month, he re-presented to [**Hospital1 **] with bloody stools, hypotensive, and anemic to hct 14.7.
EGD demonstrated bleeding duodenal ulcer, but epi was not attempted [**2-14**] inability to visualize clot.
He was taken for angio and embolization, with subsequent rebleeding requiring ex lap, duodenotomy, oversewn ulcer, j-tube placement and biopsy of liver mass.
He failed various swallow evaluations and was fed through his J-tube.
Course was complicated by difficulty weaning from vent and MRSA PNA and pseudomonas UTI and bacteremia.
Also found to have superficial femoral vein clots, and IVC filter was placed.
Also with 06/06 admission for J-tube replacement, with Klebsiella UTI sensitive only to Bactrim, Unasyn, Zosyn, and carbapenems.
Given 1L NS over 1 hour, which raised SBP to 100s-110s.

Posterior calcaneal edema.
Given the close proximity to the soft tissue ulcer, findings are highly suspicious for osteomyelitis.
(it is not clear whether the cortical loss seen on the xray is secondary to infection or post- surgical.
The marrow edema seen in the calcaneus likely reflects a combination of osteomyelitis (closer to the ulcer) and surorunding reactive edema, but the precise demarcation between these two areas cannot be assessed by imaging.
Edema of the quadratus plantae muscle -- the ddx includes both infeciton and reactive edema.
No bone or soft tissue abcess identified.
Soft tissue deformity with subcutaneous emphysema and corresponding bony destruction of the posterior right calcaneus consistent with diagnosis of osteomyelitis.
Extensive [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcifications and diffuse osteopenia.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Melena: EGD ([**8-14**]) showed 2 duodenal ulcers without visible vessel, adherent clot or active bleeding.
2) Hypotension: Was likely due to combination of GIB and sepsis from UTI.
3) UTI: Urine Cx with Klebsiella (ESBL) sensitive only to Bactrim, carbapenems, Zosyn, and Unasyn.
4) Right Heel ulcer: pressure ulcer of right heel necrotic with evidence of underlying osteo on XR, on Vanco 1 gm IV q12 for gram + coverage as well as zosyn.
Was discussed and felt that only definitive treatment would be AKA, but given age and comorbidities and risk of surgery sons opted for conservative course of antibiotics and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
