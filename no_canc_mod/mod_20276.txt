Chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema.
Stat echo performed: LVH, hypokinesis-akinesis of basal to mid portion of inferior wall.
EF 15-20%, apical septal akinesis.
Patient had ETT [**10/2183**] showing small area of inferior ischemia.
Transferred on ASA, Lovenox, beta-blocker, amiodarone (later stopped b/o hypotension and bradycardia), ACE inhibitor, statin.

Likely bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded in both lower lobes.
CATH [**2187-8-8**] The LMCA, LAD, and LCX were without angiographically-apparent, flow-limiting disease.
It was otherwise without apparent disease.
Elevated left sided filling pressures.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 20-25%).
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to CCU due to CHF/pulmonary edema in context of hyperentsion.
Pulm Edema - Patient was treated with diuresis with IV Lasix.
She was then placed on spironolactone, low-dose Carvedilol, and lasix 20 mg po a day for decompensated heart failure.
The work up for the etiology of cardiolmyopathy in this patient included iron studies, TSH and free T4, [**Doctor First Name **], and HIV all of which were unrevealing.
Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be secondary to diabetes.
CAD - The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**8-8**] after her respiratory status had improved and she was able to lye flat.
She had a mild elevation of ALT thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis.
Rhythm - Rhythm strips were obtained from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for review and confirmed that she had an episode of v fib at OSH.
Asthma - The patient was continued on nebulizers while she was admitted.
She had no wheezing during her hospital stay.
Microcytosis with hypochromasia - Iron studies were not suggestive of iron deficiency.
Thalassemia minor is also on a differential for this asymptomatic patient of African descent with microcytosis.
Blood smear was sent for hemepath review and revealed no target cells.
She will follow up with her primary care physician and hemoglobin electrophoresis could be indicated to rule out thalassemia.
Diabetes - newly diagnosed - The Hemoglobin A1C was checked and came back at 11.9 %.
The patient was initialy covered with ISS and was given diabetic diet.
She was instructed to record her glucose values and to bring those to her PCP's and [**Last Name (un) 9718**] follow up appointments.
