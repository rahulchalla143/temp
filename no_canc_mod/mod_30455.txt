CXR was conistent with pulmonary edema.
CT scan of chest was performed which revealed bilateral pleural effusions and likely atelectasis, but possible PNA at right lower lobe.
The night of admission, he had several small episodes of coffee ground emesis.
In the early morning prior to transfer to MICU, he was hypertensive with SBPs to the 200s.
He had a head CT that showed a new hypodensity along the left periventricular white matter.
Risk factors included unprotected heterosexual sex as well as intravenous drug use.
His nadir CD4 count is 91 and he has no known opportunistic infections.
Cryoglobulinemia 4.
Chronic renal insufficiency - MPGN by biopsy in [**2123**] and hypertensive nephrosclerosis 5.
A subacute infarct in the right caudate head seen on MRI in [**1-30**] 13.
Depression 16.
Social History: History of incarceration for 4 yrs.
Reports marijuana use daily, denies tobacco or cocaine.
There is also a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
No family history of sudden death and premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 99.0 BP: 164/89 P: 81 R: 22 O2: 95% RA I: 1.7L, O: 1L, balance +700ccs General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP at 10cm, no LAD Lungs: clear to ausculation bilaterally CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, 3/6 systolic murmur loudest at apex, no rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, ttp in epigastric region, small well-healed scar above umbilicus with diasthasis, mildly distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding.
2+ L>R pitting edema bilaterally, no clubbing or cyanosis.
[**2128-4-21**] LENI: No DVT in the left lower extremity.
An enlarged upper and lower lobe arteries with signs of blood flow redistribution and cardiomegaly.
Minimal left pleural effusion.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
No lung nodules or masses.
[**2128-4-19**] MRI w/o: Encephalomalacia within the left corona radiata with associated hemosiderin staining, new since [**2126**], without any acute infarct component.
The findings likely represent a chronic infarction with hemorrhagic transformation or sequela of a previous hypertensive hemorrhage.
While evaluation for intracranial infection is limited in the absence of intravenous contrast, there are no findings to suggest an infection.
No thrombosis identified.
No liver lesions identified.
Thickened gallbladder wall is likely due to underlying disease.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Tiny rounded hypodensity in the right caudate head is unchanged, previously thought to represent subacute or chronic infarct (MRI [**2126-1-30**]).
Since [**2126-11-14**], there is new hypodensity along the left periventricular white matter.
Given what appears to be ex vacuo dilatation along the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, findings may represent old insult such as old infarct.
However, given the history of HIV, headache and fever, active process would be difficult to exclude.
MRI is recommended for more sensitive evaluation for subtle process.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage seen [**2128-4-17**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with probable adjacent dependent atelectasis.
Small amount of ascites with anasarca and pericholecystic fluid indicating volume overload with third spacing.
No evidence of bowel obstruction, hernia, or focal fluid collection.
Brief Hospital Course: 41 y/o M with hx of HIV, CKD, HTN and CHF who presents to the ED with worsening pedal edema, SOB and possible PNA.
The second day of admission was transferred to the ICU with hypertensive urgency with worsening symptoms of heart failure and headache.
No acute pathology seen on imaging.

# Coffee Ground Emesis: Patient had coffee ground emesis in MICU.
He was continued on his ranitidine with no further episodes.
# Nausea/abdominal pain: Initially on narcotics for symptomatic control.
Thought most likely [**2-24**] gut edema and uremia.
# Pericardial Effusion: Small pericardial effusion on echo.
# Elevated INR: Patient's INR was elevated but this improved with vitamin K suggesting nutrtional deficiency.
# Pseudomonas UTI: Patient was pseudomona UTI that is resistant to Cipro.
