HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2118**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with an right coronary artery stent in [**2134-3-15**], status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four (SVG to OM1, SVG to OM2, SVG to diagonal, and LIMA to LAD), who presented with 5 out of 10 substernal chest pain after a short walk associated with diaphoresis.
The patient denied any shortness of breath but noted that his symptoms persisted with rest.
He called EMS and was given Nitroglycerin and Aspirin with no change in his chest pain.
He was given Nitroglycerin, Heparin, Integrilin, Lopressor, Morphine, with a decrease in his pain to [**12-16**] out of 10.
Electrocardiogram there was read as inferior ST elevations with no change on right-sided leads.
Catheterization revealed 100% right coronary artery occlusion at the stent and underwent Angioject with stent times two proximal and distal to the original stent.
An echocardiogram done at that time to evaluate for tamponade revealed a small effusion without any signs of tamponade physiology.
Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2118**], the patient percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to his right coronary artery in [**2134-3-15**], status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four in [**2134-3-15**].
Diverticulosis status post GI bleed.
Ulcerative colitis.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
q.d., Milk of Magnesia p.r.n., Tylenol p.r.n., Asacol 800 mg p.o.
General:  The patient was a fairly well-appearing man in no apparent distress.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities:  No edema.
There were 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
Outside electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, left atrial abnormalities in Q, II, III, and AVF, with ST elevations of 2 mm in II, III, and AVF.
There were reciprocal ST depressions in I and AVL.
Electrocardiogram done at [**Hospital6 1760**] revealed ST elevations improved in II, and III, and AVF, as well as reversal of T-wave inversions in I and AVL.
Chest x-ray revealed slight cardiomegaly and sternal wires.
Echocardiogram revealed mild depression of the left ventricle, posterior hypokinesis, trace mitral regurgitation, ejection fraction of 50-55%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2118**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2134-3-15**], for inferior myocardial infarction, with right coronary artery stent, status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four in [**2134-3-15**], who presented with inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular extension status post right coronary artery stent.
Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with an inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular extension.
From a myocardial standpoint, the patient had severe right ventricular hypokinesis.
He was initially hypotensive requiring Dopamine likely secondary to decreased preload state.
The patient had a second echocardiogram performed on the evening of admission which revealed no change in the pericardial effusion which was thought to be likely secondary to his surgery.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of GI bleed in the setting of ulcerative colitis and diverticular disease.
He was followed closely for upper GI bleed and had a hematocrit drop to about 26 the day after his procedure.
Inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular extension with right coronary artery total occlusion status post Angioject and stenting times two.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times four.
History of gastrointestinal bleed with diverticulosis.
Ulcerative colitis.
History of Barrett's esophagus.
Small pericardial effusion.
