Admission Date: [**2192-9-6**]        Discharge Date:[**2193-1-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-6-17**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 49 year old man transferred from [**Hospital6 33180**] after a transesophageal echocardiogram showed aortic valve endocarditis with aortic insufficiency and a cath done at that time immediately following showed no flow limiting coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 3872**] with a working diagnosis of pericarditis after the emergency room evaluation for fever and shaking chills associated with shortness of breath.
The patient was then found to have positive blood cultures without recent dental work or surgery except for the removal of several warts from his right hand.
His father had cardiomyopathy as well as lymphoma.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with his wife and 2 sons who are early teenagers.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.4, no chloride or CO2, BUN 83, creatinine 4.3, glucose 180.
Chest x-ray done on admission showed bilateral pleural effusions without pneumothorax or infiltrates and endotracheal tube in good position.
Respiratory: Coarse rhonchi throughout.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm with III to IV/VI systolic ejection murmur.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
It was planned to place a Swan-Ganz catheter and then send the patient to CAT scan for an abdominal and a chest CT to look for septic sources and to rule out PE, however, upon arrival in the CSIU, the patient had a VT arrest.
The patient was treated in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit for the next several days in order to stabilize him, and on the [**12-14**], he was brought to the operating room at which time he had a debridement of an aortic aneurysm as well as patch of that aneurysm and resuspension of his aortic valve.
His postoperative course was extremely unstable and on the [**12-19**], he had a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe aortic regurgitation with a vegetation of the aortic valve and 2+ mitral regurgitation without vegetations on the mitral valve.
Ultimately the patient had a prolonged hospital course with several return trips to the operating room, each associated with short periods of paralysis, followed by slow vent weans.
A summary of those events include the initial operation on the 25th for the aortic patch and resuspension of the valve, hematoma evacuation on the [**11-20**], return trip to the operating room on the [**11-25**] where he had a #27 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] pericardial aortic valve placed following which he had a postoperative pneumonia with pseudomonas.
He did well on the initial postoperative course and was ultimately extubated on the [**12-2**], however, he suffered a cardiac and respiratory arrest on the [**12-7**] during which he was reintubated and brought back to the operating room for exploration.
At that time, it was found that he had dehisced his aortic valve and he underwent aortic root replacement with a #23 homograft as well as a mediastinal washout.
He also had exploratory laparotomy at that time that showed mesenteric ischemia and abdominal hematoma was also evacuated at that time.
Culture material sent from the operating room ultimately grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] from the pericardial tissue as well as from the chest wound and aortic tissue.
The patient returned to the operating room again on the [**12-17**] for a planned closure of his abdomen, however, that was aborted when it was found that the chest wound had active infection and the thoracic service as well as the plastic surgery service were consulted at that time.
The patient had a limited sternal debridement as well as a chest washout during that trip to the operating room.
He tolerated that operation well and was returned to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit where he remained hemodynamically stable for about a week and subsequently on the [**11-29**], he had an episode of bleeding which returned him to the operating room for a mediastinal exploration during which they found a dehiscence of suture line and an infected initial homograft.
Therefore, he underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with a homograft and a patch of the pulmonary artery aneurysm that was also found at that time.
Additionally, the patient had further sternal debridement as well as an omental flap brought up to the sternal space at that time.
The patient did well following this surgery and on the [**12-2**], he was found to have a DVT of his left upper extremity including the common femoral vein to the popliteal vein.
On the [**12-3**], the patient again returned to the operating room where he underwent further washout of his thoracic cavity, additional sternal debridement and a redo of his omental flap.
The patient again arrested on [**11-4**], following acute exsanguination from his chest which was open at the time, however, the omental flap was taken down, was placed on ECMO in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit, then brought to the operating room where he was put on bypass and he had a repair of his aortic homograft where it was found that he had dehisced 1 of his suture line.
On the [**11-19**], he was again brought to the operating room for an attempt at sternal closure with a pectoral flap advancement, however, the closure was aborted due to the size of the sternal wound and a VAX dressing was placed at that time.
Additionally, during that trip to the operating room, the patient had an abdominal wound debridement and reclosure of the skin.
The patient again did well in the postoperative period, however, on the [**11-26**], it was noted that the patient had diffuse open lesions and dermatology consult was obtained at which time the patient was diagnosed with a disseminated zoster which was treated with acyclovir.
On a systems basis, the patient's status is as follows: Neurologically, the patient has had periods of metabolic encephalopathy during which he was unresponsive.
His most recent chest x-ray shows no infiltrates with a small right effusion.
Cardiac status, status post multiple aortic surgeries with the last surgery being an attempt at sternal closure and that was done on [**11-19**], following which his sternal wound was left with an omental flap and a VAX dressing to allow for secondary closure.
The patient has an aortic homograft which was finally implanted on [**10-29**].
He also had several abdominal washouts and ultimately had his abdomen closed on [**10-19**] with additional debridement and skin closure on [**11-19**].
He has no sutures remaining in place.
Renal status, the patient remains hemodialysis dependent on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule.
From the [**12-28**] is positive for pseudomonas sensitive to Colistin.
From extremities and skin perspective, the patient continues to have 2+ edema bilaterally.
He has pneumo boots for DVT prophylaxis.
He has a sacral decubitus which is being treated with Accuzyme and DuoDerm.
He has a chest wound that continues to have a VAX dressing to it which is changed q.3days.
General: Chronically ill appearing man in no acute distress.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds and G tube in place with no erythema or drainage from G tube site.
Aortic valve endocarditis, status post homograft with an     aortic valve replacement and repair of pulmonary artery     aneurysm, status post sternal debridement with an omental     flap and VAX dressing placement.
Left lower lobe extremity deep venous thrombosis, status     post inferior vena cava filter placement, 4.
Acute renal failure, status post placement of tunnel line     hemodialysis catheter.
Status post episode of disseminated zoster.
