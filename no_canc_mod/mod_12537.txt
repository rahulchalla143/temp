EKG at [**Location (un) 620**] was nondiagnostic per report, but troponin returned at 0.2 and he was given lovenox 90mg (0600) for NSTEMI and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible PCI.
He was initially seen to have resp distress, but was continued on Bipap 8/5, received ativan 2mg, and started on a nitro gtt with improvement in SOB and resolution of chest pain.
CXR showed moderate alveolar pulmonary edema as well as moderate cardiomegaly with ?small pleural effusions.
On review of systems, he denies states he has gotten bleeding at the site of his psoriasis when taking plavix, and so he stopped it without notifying his cardiologist a few years ago.
He denies any deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..
MODERATE GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system demonstrated severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a long segment of subtotal disease extending into the moderate D1 (unchanged).
The LCx was noted to have a patent stent in the large major OM2 with 50% disease proximal to the stent, as well as moderate disease distally.
The LCx also had an 80% lesion distally in the very small PDA.
The occluded OM fills via graft with moderate disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic systolic arterial hypertension, with central aortic pressure of 148/85, mean 111 mmHg.
Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease unchanged since coronary angiography in [**2205**].
Mild systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2205-11-23**], mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now more prominent.
