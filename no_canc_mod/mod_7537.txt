Admission Date:  [**2176-8-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2176-9-6**]   Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 33508**] is a 83 year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with chest pain that radiated to both shoulders.
He had taken aspirin and nitroglycerin and had no relief.
He did complain of some shortness of breath during this episodic chest pain.
At [**Hospital3 **] he did rule in for an myocardial infarction with a troponin of 2.3 and he was started on a heparin protocol with Integrilin and given sublingual nitroglycerin.
On admission to the hospital he did have a slight dorp in his blood pressure to a systolic of 60 and was given fluid boluses.
While on the heparin drip he did develop coffee ground emesis.
Upon admission he was taken to the catheterization laboratory and found to have multivessel coronary artery disease.
He was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and stabilized and aloud to recover slightly from his myocardial infarction before being brought to the Operating Room for coronary artery bypass grafting.
The patient had received a hematology consult prior to surgery secondary to an elevated INR and this was thought to be per hematology to be secondary to his heparin drip.
Once the heparin drip had been discontinued his PTT and INR did decrease to within normal limits with doses of vitamin K.  The patient continued to progress until postoperative day number three when in the early morning hours he was noted to have a temperature spike to 102.9.
When the patient was examined he was noted to have an acute abdomen and cultures were sent.
As the morning progressed the patient became hypotensive and a white blood cell count was noted to be elevated to 23,000.
He did obtain an abdominal CT scan, which showed appendicitis and later that day was taken to the Operating Room for an open appendectomy.
The findings during this procedure were a gangrenous appendix with perforation and abscess containing pus, stool and phegmons.
It was noted again on [**8-20**] that his coagulation studies were elevated despite not receiving any type of anticoagulation treatment and it was felt again that this was secondary to diminished vitamin K level and poor nutrition.
On the following day [**2176-8-21**] the patient was noted to be confused and combative.
By [**2176-8-30**] his abdominal wound had minimal drainage and his JP was discontinued.
There was some concern, because his white blood cell count had increased again and he did receive a follow up abdominal CT scan, which showed no signs of abscess and normal post surgical changes.
Because of poor calorie count and poor po intake he did have a Dobbhoff tube placed and was started on tube feeds of ProMod with fiber.
With the increase in his nutrition status his blood sugars were noted to be elevated and therefore his Glyburide was increased to 10 mg po a day.
His abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended and his wound is healing well.
His sternal wound is also healing well and is stable.
He does have 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilateral lower extremities and his neurological status is stable.
His chest x-ray on discharge shows very small bilateral effusions with the left greater then right.
Status post non Q wave myocardial infarction.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Herpes zoster of the scalp with post herpetic neuralgia.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
History of hepatitis B.
He is to have the vacuum to his abdominal wound changed twice a week.
