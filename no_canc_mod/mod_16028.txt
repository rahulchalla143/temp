There, a CT scan demonstrated a right temporal occipital contusion with small subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general:  Stable, in no acute distress.
Right eyebrow with a small laceration.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
No step offs.
Back:  No step offs.
Genitourinary:  No blood at the meatus.
X-rays demonstrate head CT which showed several high attenuation foci in the cortical parenchyma, the right frontal lobe, anterior and bilateral frontal lobes, more posterior along the vertex and along the right parietal cortex as well.
The findings are consistent with multi-focal petechial hemorrhages in the cortical parenchyma/subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No shift or mass effect.
Chronic subdural collections, anterior along the frontal lobes.
A soft tissue mass within the right parotid gland and a heterogeneous appearing thyroid, likely due to goiter.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no evidence of intra-abdominal solid organ injury.
There is a right superior and inferior pubic rami fractures with surrounding hematoma.
Right humerus shows a comminuted fracture of the right humeral head and neck with slight impaction of the fracture fragments.
Thoracic and lumbar spine x-rays show severe compression fracture of T12 at approximately the 60 to 70% muscle height.
Also moderate to severe compression fractures of L3 and L4.
Mild loss of height at T6.
No malalignment appreciated.
A repeat CAT scan on [**2194-2-8**] showed no significant changes from the original CT.  A repeat abdominal CT on [**2194-2-8**] showed no changes.
A magnetic resonance scan of the brain showed a punctate area of elevated signal metal fusion weighted images in the left hypocanthus which read as an acute area of ischemia could be present.
There are also patchy areas of elevated signal on the flare images within both parietal lobes.
These could represent areas of infarction or sequela of recent trauma.
The abnormalities are consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhages.
No spinal cord compression was noted.
The Neurosurgery consult service was asked to see her regarding her subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as the findings on her spine radiographs.
She has a history of compression fractures and the fractures are stable.
A magnetic resonance scan was obtained of her brain which showed a possible area of ischemia in the hypocanthus as well as evidence of traumatic injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There was no spinal cord compression.
She was extubated on [**2194-2-8**] without any problems and has remained stable from a respiratory standpoint throughout her hospital stay.
The orthopedic service was consulted regarding her pelvic fractures and right upper extremity fractures, regarding her right humerus fracture.
Regarding her pelvic fractures, there is no operative intervention.
They feel that she is in need of a short term neurologic rehabilitation stay and she will be discharged as such.
Ms. [**Known lastname 47059**] has remained afebrile throughout her hospital stay and there have been no infectious disease issues.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  To short term rehabilitation.
Right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Right distal radius fracture.
Right humerus fracture.
Right superior pubic rami fracture.
Right inferior pubic rami fracture.
