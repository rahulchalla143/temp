Large hiatal hernia containing at least stomach.
CT Chest [**8-19**]- INDICATION:  80-year-old with hypoxia after fall (hip fracture).
TECHNIQUE:  CT angiography of the chest was obtained with arterial phase imaging.
FINDINGS: CTA OF THE CHEST: There is no pneumomediastinum, mediastinal hemorrhage, pericardial or large pleural effusion.
There is no pulmonary embolism.
There are moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta and the coronary arteries.
Moderate-to-severe centrilobular emphysema is seen most pronounced in the upper lobes.
There is a right azygos lobe (incidental finding).
There is a large Bochdalek hernia containing fat, stomach (upside down stomach), and colon (with diverticula) without evidence of bowel obstruction or gastric strangulation.
This large hernia causes streak-like atelectasis of the right lower lobe.
The partially visualized abdomen demonstrates a left liver lobe cystic lesion, likely a simple cyst or hemangioma.
BONES:  There is moderate to severe osteopenia.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
Large hiatal hernia containing fat, stomach (upside down stomach), and colon (with diverticula) - no obstruction or acute findings.
No pulmonary embolism.
Severe atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries.
Severe centrilobular emphysema.
Left liver lobe cystic lesion, likely cyst or hemangioma.
Moderate to severe osteoporosis.
FINDINGS:  There is a fracture of the right femoral neck fracture with varus angulation.
There are mild degenerative changes of the right knee joint with joint space narrowing.
Atherosclerotic calcification are seen at the superifical femoral and popliteal arteries.
IMPRESSION:  Right femoral neck fracture with varus angulation.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 17562**] is an 80 year old female with a history of previously undiagnosed emphysema (no pulmonary function tests on record), transferred from an outside hospital after a right femoral neck fracture status post mechanical fall, who had an uncomplicated right hip hemiarthroplasty on [**8-19**], with post-operative course complicated by hypoxemia.
No complications during the surgery, EBL 200 cc.
She was monitored in the MICU afterwards due to hypoxemia (below).
No evidence of vascular compromise or compartment syndrome while in house.
Her pain was controlled with oxycodone 5-15 mg PRN as well as acetaminophen.
She has a large hiatal hernia, splinting from pain, as well as underlying emphysema.
CTA chest demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary embolism or fat embolism.
She never required any noninvasive or invasive respiratory support and had no evidence of hypercarbia on an ABG.
She was given albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers and incentive spirometry.
ABG prior to discharge showed improved oxygenation, as well as no evidence of carbon dioxide retention.
#TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Patient should have outpatient PFTs and ECHO to eval for pulmonary hypertension as an outpatient.
