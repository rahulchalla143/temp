[**2137-5-10**]:Evacuation of right chest wall hematoma.
History of Present Illness:  88 M ,DNR, w/ extensive vascular history transferred from [**Location (un) **], NH with an infected right ax-[**Hospital1 **] fem graft.
Pt was transferred from his nursing home to OSH w/ chest pain [**2137-4-30**].
He r/o'd for MI and PE, but was found to have an infected graft and staph aureus bacteremia.
He was noted to have had 2 episodes of bilious vomiting at the nursing home.
He denies pain at this time, though the right chest is sore over the graft.

He was started on IV Vanc, Zosyn as well as IVF for his renal insufficiency.
A CTA showed  Multiple small fluid pockets along the course of the right ax-[**Hospital1 **]-fem graft.
Before removal, and ultrasound showed patent right ex-fem bypass graft with no evidence of stenosis.
He developed an anterior chestwall hematoma which needed to go to the OR emergently for evacuation.
His WBC count remained high post-operatively, and a new infectious w/u showed a UTI.
Pre-operatively, an ECHO was obtained per anesthesia, which showed LVEF>55%, and probable normal left ventricle function, though a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded, and showed Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
A stat cardiology consult was obtained for an ECHO which  RV is more clearly visualized and appears dilated and hypokinetic compared to the previous study.
He had a troponin leak during this time, but it was likely due to repeated chest compressions, and after evaluation by cardiology a cardiac cath was not indicated.
RESP: He had some pleural effusions on his admission CTA (not picked up on CXR), though he was not symptomatic from this so it was watched.
He tolerated extubation without difficulty.
GI: There was a question of ileus on admission, an AXR showed small dilated loops without air-fluid levels, and he was monitored clinically.
RENAL: Acute on chronic renal insufficiency/anuria.
Pt was admitted with chronic renal insufficiency coming in at a creat of 2.5.
Post-operatively, he became anuiric, and a renal consult was obtained.
He went for multiple treatments on a T TH Sa schedule, though after discussing with the legal guardian and the patient himself, Mr. [**Known lastname **] decided he did not want further diaylsis and wanted his right IJ removed.
He was aware of his kidney failure.
HEME/ONC: pt did have elevated WBC, which was worked up extensively for infectious etiology, which was positive.
He did require multiple transfusions of pRBCs, FFP, and platelets post-operatively for low hct, platelets.
NEURO: He has baseline confusion and dementia, though is altered and somewhat  oriented.
His pain was controlled throughout his course, he required IV fentanyl while in the ICU, though is now controlled on PO dilaudid 2-4mg Q3:PRN.
He has declined further intervention for his renal failure (diaylsis, etc).
