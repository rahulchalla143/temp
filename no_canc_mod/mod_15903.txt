MAJOR PROCEDURES:  Magnetic resonance imaging scan of brain, angiogram of head and neck.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 46636**] was an 82 year old woman with hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and osteoarthritis who developed left-sided weakness and progressive nasal quality to her voice.
She was evaluated initially at an outside hospital two days prior to admission with similar symptoms.
She was then seen at [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Room on [**2116-12-6**], where she was presented with weakness, decreased palatal movements, and left hemiparesis.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a right paramedian basis pontis and upper medulla stroke as well as basilar artery stenosis.
Conventional angiogram showed multifocal stenosis of the left vertebral artery and a 5 mm aneurysm arising from the anterior communicating artery was incidentally found.
In the course of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit, Mr. [**Known lastname 46636**] developed progressive weakness which involved the right as well as the left side.
Follow up magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed extension with brain stem stroke attributed to basilar stenosis.
Her quadriparesis was associated with profound palatal weakness and inability to clear secretions.
In a family meeting Ms [**Known lastname 46636**] wishes about intubation were discussed and it was clear that she did not wish to be intubated or resuscitated.
Because of her extensive brainstem damage, she gradually decreased her respiratory rate.
