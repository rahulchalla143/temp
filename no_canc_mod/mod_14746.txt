HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 64-year-old male with diabetes type 2, borderline hypertension, and 100 pack year smoking history status post endovascular AAA repair in [**2119**] at [**Hospital6 1129**], who is complaining of right foot pain and numbness for the past week.
He had an arteriogram at [**Location (un) 1459**], which showed occluded abdominal ileac endovascular stent graft.
It showed 100% patent left external ileac artery and a left common femoral artery which was reconstituted.
Diabetes type 2.
Umbilical hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He has bilateral basilar crackles heard in the lung fields.
He has no bruits or masses.
The right foot is dusky and modeled to the mid calf.
Dopplerable femoral pulse on the right and a 2+ femoral pulse on the left.
He has no signals in the DP or PT arteries on the right, and the DP and PT arteries are dopplerable on the left.
His EKG showed no acute ischemic changes and his chest x-ray showed signs of COPD.
Postoperatively, on postoperative day one, the right foot remained cyanotic and cool to the touch.
As mentioned, his right foot remained cool, and cyanotic, and painful with no DP or PT signals appreciated on the right.
On postoperative day one, the patient was transferred to the Surgical ICU for management of worsening renal function and worsening metabolic acidosis.
It was felt that his worsening renal function was due to acute tubular necrosis, possibly due to hypovolemia.
He was given 4 mg of Haldol b.i.d., to control these symptoms, Ativan was also given, but the patient had worsening confusion with response to Ativan.
A MRA of the right lower extremity was obtained at this time, which showed proximal occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery, which was reconstituted after the anterior tibial artery.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and was then taken to the OR for femoral distal bypass graft.
On postoperative days seven and four, the patient's abdominal wound was open over about 7 cm just inferior to the umbilicus.
This wound was packed with wet-to-dry dressings, no pus or exudate was noted.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair with dopplerable signals on the right, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries with improving color of the right foot.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home with VNA for wound care, 3x weekly INR checks, and Physical Therapy.
Ischemic right foot.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Clotted endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm stent.
