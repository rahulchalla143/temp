History of Present Illness: This is a 59 year old male with known coronary artery disease and prior silent myocardial infarction.
Cardiac catheterization revealed 3 vessel CAD and his Dobutamine stress test showed ainferior hypokinesis at rest with recruitment indicating viablmyocardium.
Currently, he reports no exertional or rest angina.
He complains of occasional leg pain with walking about [**3-26**] blocks.
He can climb one flight of stairs without symptoms.
There is no history of lightheadedness, palpitations, syncope, orthopnea, PND or increasing lower extremity edema.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p remote silent myocardial infarction likely [**2124**] - Diabetes mellitus Type II - Dyslipidemia - History of stroke [**2125**], s/p ?thrombolytics, no residual symptoms - Hypertension - Prostatism - ?Intermittent claudication?
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.

Selective coronary angiography in this right domiinant system  demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically-apparent disease.
The LAD had moderate diffuse disease with a proximal 80% stenosis.
The LCx had moderate diffuse disease with a 40-50% proximal stenosis, there was a 60% stenosis of OM1 and 80% proximal stenosis of OM2.
There was an 80% stenosis of the ramus intermedius proximally.
There was a 90% stenosis in the mid-RCA and a 70% stenosis proximal to the PDA/PL bifurcation.
[**2133-9-11**] ECHO Pre bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
LV function unchanged or slightly improved motion in inferior basal wall, LVEF 50-55%.
RV function unchanged with basal free wall hypokinesis after bypass.
TR unchanged mild to moderate.
Aortic contorus intact.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 85034**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-9-10**] for surgical management of his coronary artery disease.
He underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
He remained intubated due to severe aggitation and inability to follow commands.
Extubation was attempted on [**2133-9-14**] but he was reintubated shortly after due to tachypnea, hypertension and agitation.
A head CT scan revealed evidence of prior infarctions but no acute process was identified.
Mr. [**Known lastname 85034**] spiked a fever and was found to have gram positive cocci and gram negative rods in his sputum.
Neurology followed the pt as thought he had a metabolic encephalopathy.
distress and anesthesia came immediately to bedside.
