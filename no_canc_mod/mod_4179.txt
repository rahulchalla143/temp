History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 22204**] is a 65 yo female with h/o TypeI DM w/ insulin pump, who brought herself to the ED for elevated blood glucose.
She c/o general malaise, but otherwise has no specific complaints.
She denies CP, SOB, abd pain, fevers, chills, vomiting, increased urinary frequency and dysuria.
Past Medical History: - Type I DM-- for over 40 years, on insulin pump, followed at [**Last Name (un) **] - Diabetic retinopathy - Diabetic neuropathy with Charcot joints - Multiple sclerosis-- dx [**2169**]; c/b neurogenic bladder; no longer ambulates (uses wheelchair) - Peripheral vascular disease - Depression -- weaning off celexa and titrating effexor.
- s/p right [**Doctor Last Name **]-pedal bypass [**2174**] - Essential tremor - History of syncope - Hypertension.
- Status post PTCA [**2166-3-3**] for coronary artery disease - Status post bladder suspension surgery for stress incontinence - Chronic anemia.
Family History: Counsin with MS; mother died of MI at age 80; Father had epilepsy  Physical Exam: VS: T 99.0 BP 123/52 HR 80 RR 18 O2 97% RA General:thin woman, NAD with mild resting tremor affecting face & hands.
HEENT:sclera white, 0.5cm raised area of erythema below left eye and involving left lower eyelid.
another 0.5cm area of erythema with eschar on left cheek.
Lungs: CTAB Card: RRR, 2/6 SEM @ USB Abd: soft, NT, ND, no masses or organomegaly Extremities: warm, dry, right foot with charcot deformity.
mild bilat LE edema.
Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed two vessel coronary artery disease with diffuse atherosclerosis with a patent prior RCA stent.
The LAD was heavily calcified proximally and had a proximal 40-50% stenosis and diffuse plaquing to 50% in the mid-distal vessel.
There was mild diffuse plaquing throughout to 30-40% with tortouous terminal branches of a single major OM.
The RCA had diffuse plaquing throughout with mild in-stent restenosis of the mid-distal RCA [**Doctor First Name 10788**] stent with a 35% distal edge restnosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension (SBP 189 mm Hg) and moderately elevated LV filling pressure(LVEDP 19 mm Hg).
Two vessel coronary artery disease with diffuse atherosclerosis.
Severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
Moderate LV diastolic heart failure.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo Female with Type I DM who presented with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state after her insulin pump malfunctioned.
Since then no cardiac cath.
Stress (P MIBI) in [**6-7**] and Echo in [**6-7**] were normal (with the exception of focal calcifications of the aortic arch).
The patient has been chest pain free and on this admission but was found to have EKG changes in V5/V6 TWI / ST depressions and mildly elevated troponins.
Given the high risk and STE in aVR leading to ?
She received a cardiac catheterization on [**2175-8-7**] which did show diffuse disease (see report) but nothing that was deemed intervenable.
Given her MS and difficulty ambulating (she currently uses a wheelchair), she requested transfer to rehab and was evaulated by PT/OT.
#hyperglycemia: She has had DM typeI from age 18.
#burn - The patient had sustained superficial skin burns to her back in an accident about one week prior to admission.
#Multiple sclerosis - The patient was maintained on outpatient meds including meds for neurogenic bladder.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for heartburn.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
chest pain free.
Your were found to have a Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
There were no intervenable lesions found.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
