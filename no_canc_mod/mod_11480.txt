Study revealed inducible ventricular tachycardia and the patient underwent an internal cardiac defibrillator and pacemaker placement on [**2196-7-28**].
Following recovery from his coronary artery bypass graft, the patient is admitted for elective repair of his 3.0 centimeter right common iliac artery aneurysm as well as an aorto bifemoral bypass graft for bilateral claudication.
Coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction [**2187**], myocardial infarction [**7-10**]; coronary artery bypass graft times two [**7-10**], at [**Hospital1 69**].
