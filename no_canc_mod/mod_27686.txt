He noted her speech was slowed, more deliberate & slightly slurred.
She c/o "dizziness" & shooting pain in neck.
She had increased confusion & followed by LOC/episode of unresponsiveness (while sitting).

RRR S1/S2, no m/r/g Resp: Coarse breath sounds B Abdomen: Soft, NTND, BS+ Ext: BL and BUE edematous.
Neuro: Intubated and sedated, moving all extremities spontaneously Skin: Pink, cool, dry, scattered ecchymoses and hematomas at blood draw sites.
[**12-27**] Urine cx: >100K E coli, pan-sensitive [**1-7**] Urine cx: no growth .
[**1-8**] C diff toxin: positive .
Consolidation in the left lower lobe with effusion, suspicious for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
CT Head w/o contrast:  No bleed.
Chronic small vessel ischemia and atrophy.
ST depressions in V3-6.
TTE [**12-28**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior septum and inferior wall.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**12-28**] bilateral LENIs: no DVT .
[**12-28**] pelvis xray: No acute fracture.
[**1-7**] CT abdomen/pelvis: Small right-sided retroperitoneal and intramuscular hematoma, with diffuse soft tissue anasarca and bilateral pleural effusions.
Small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year-old female admitted with bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, and altered mental status, most likely secondary to septic shock from E-coli UTI.
Septic shock:  The patient was admitted with bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, and hypotension, all felt to be manifestations of septic shock secondary to her E. coli UTI.
Her urine culture revealed a pan-sensitive E coli and thus azithromycin was discontinued.
Respiratory failure: She was initially intubated for airway protection secondary to unstable mental status.
She was diuresed to minimize pulmonary vascular congestion.
She was extubated on [**2171-1-1**] without complication.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, felt secondary to her CHF.
On discharge, she is sat'ing well on 3L NC however she continues to complain of shortness of breath and dyspnea with even minor movement.
UTI: The patient was admitted with septic shock secondary to E. coli UTI.
Clostridium dificile: The patient developed c diff infection with positive stool toxin noted on [**1-8**].
Question of beta-blocker toxicity with acute on chronic renal failure.
To assess cardiac function, a TTE was obtained demonstrating EF 45-50%, mild regional L ventricular dysfunction, probable diastolic dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary HTN.
EKG also demonstrated old RBBB, old LAFB, and ST depressions in inferior and lateral precordial leads.
Likely etiology was hypotension leading to underperfusion of coronary artery and possible conduction system abnormalities.
Acute renal failure: In the setting of septic shock and hypotension, she developed acute renal failure.
Her creatinine was elevated to 2.3 on admission, felt likely to represent pre-renal renal failure.
?Myocardial ischemia: There was concern initially for ACS/ischemia in the setting of hypotension and EKG revealing ST depressions.
However, she had not complained of CP (per family) & 2 sets of cardiac enzymes were negative.
She was continued on ASA with no BB given conduction disease.
CHF: Her home regimen of furosemide 80mg PO daily was initially held because of hypotension and transient need for pressors.
Repeat CXR showed no change in her bilateral pleural effusions, likely secondary to CHF.
She continued to have hypoxia (requiring She will continue to receive PO lasix at hospice.
Mental status change:  Likely [**3-9**] hypotension & possible sepsis.
Medications on Admission: # Furosemide 80 mg daily # Metoprolol ER 25 mg daily # Levothyroxine 75 mcg daily # Aspirin 81 mg daily # Ibuprofen PRN pain # Guaifenesin PRN cough .
