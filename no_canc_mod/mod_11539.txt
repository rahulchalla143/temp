No CT evidence of duodenal perforation.
Gallstones and a distended gallbladder.
Small amount of fluid in the right colic gutter.
Severe atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and its main branches with a small left kidney secondary to renal artery stenosis.
There is also severe atherosclerotic disease at the origin of the SMA and celiac.
Large cystic mass within the right ovary.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[**5-26**] UGI: No evidence of extravasation of contrast on this study which visualizes through to the second portion of the duodenum  [**5-26**] KUB: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Sigmoid diverticulosis is also present.
Small exophytic cyst in the interpolar region of the right kidney which measures 27 Hounsfield units.
This should be further evaluated with ultrasound or MR since it does not show typical characteristics of a simple cyst.
Distended gallbladder with a small calcified stone in the neck.
Atrophic left kidney likely secondary to renal artery stenosis.
Severe atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and its main abdominal branches  [**5-29**] CT Guided Drainage-Approximately 20 cc of bloody pus-like fluid was aspirated and sent to the lab for Gram stain and culture.
No evidence of free intraperitoneal air at this time.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Hypodensity in the right kidney is not clearly a simple fluid attenuation and could be followed up with ultrasound.
Extensive atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and its branches  [**6-5**] CT A/P:Relatively unchanged size of complex right pelvic collection intimately associated with small bowel, the right ovary, and the rectum.
Decrease size of pleural effusions with only minimal lung base atelectasis  [**6-8**]: Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections using a 6 French JL4 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast injections.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted to surgical service on [**2158-5-22**] following PE findings of distended mildly tender abdomen that demonstrated rebound but no guarding and radiological studies showing findings of free air.
Remained afebrile until low grade fever of 101 on HD4, and fever of 101.7 on HD5 for which she was pan-cultured.
Patient transferred to regular surgical floor on HD4 following ICU stabilization and resolution of tachypnea on [**5-24**].
NEURO: Patient had dilaudid pain control on admission, but had at home fentanyl patch resumed while hospitalized.
The patient was converted to PO lopressor on HD9 and remained in sinus rhythm but with cardiology recommendations was started on amiodarone; patient did not desaturate or drop pressure during these episodes, and did not rule in for another MI.
Patient did not have catheter stent placed but was notable for severe bilateral iliac artery stenosis.
Patient noted to be tachypneic into RR of 30's on [**5-24**] and was maintained in ICU for overnight observation, but was stable after this isolated episode for the remainder of her hospitalization  GI: Patient placed NPO with IVF hydration, NGT placement to wall sxn.
Patient abdominal tenderness improved gradually with each hospital day and was noted to be nontender on PE on HD5.
Patient had UGI performed on HD5 which showed no duodenal ulcer and normal gastric filling/emptying without extravasation through second part of duodenum.
With negative UGI series, patient had NGT d/c'd but had resumption of abdominal pain later in the day of HD5 with development of nausea.
NGT was replaced with immediate return of 100cc of bilious fluid.
Because of questionable second fluid collection in pelvis, we contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41683**] from radiology with regards to the size of the second intrabdominal fluid collection.
He did not feel any interval increase in size had taken place, therefore no additional instrumentation was pursued and th patient's original pigtail catheter was removed on HD16  GU: Patient had foley placed on admission for accurate UOP msmts, but had it removed on HD5 with good UOP following d/c.
Patient was discharged to ECF on HD19 with good ambulation, appropriate PO intake, and good pain control.
Clotrimazole 10 mg Troche Sig: One (1) Troche Mucous membrane  QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.

Please call the "purple" surgery resident on call, or come to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency room for fevers greater than 101.4, worsening abdominal pain or shortness of breath, development of nausea/vomiting.
