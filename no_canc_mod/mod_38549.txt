Admission Date:  [**2151-4-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-4-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-5-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Pneumovax 23 / Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Levofloxacin / Influenza Virus Vaccine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CVL insertion Intubation   History of Present Illness: 73 year old female with history of cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy (and portal hypertension, hypersplenism) with multiple recent admissions ([**Date range (1) **]/[**2151**]) who presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] with fatigue, shortness of breath, wheezing, pruritis on [**2151-4-6**].
She denied any nausea or vomiting, sick contacts.
Her Rifaximin was initially discontinued given concern it was causing her pruritis but then resumed.
Renal was consulted for her acute on chronic renal failure, which was felt due to hypervolemia from liver cirrhosis extravascularly, hypovolemia from furosemide intravascularly.
The patient was noted to have mild facial asymmetry on [**2151-4-11**] and then swallowing dyskinesia [**2151-4-13**].
CT head showed advanced periventricular subcortical white matter changes unchanged from CT head [**2151-3-22**].
MRI was attempted for ?CVA but patient could not cooperate with the exam; suboptimal MRI imaging suggested no definite acute ischemic event.
Neurology was consulted, who felt the patient's oral lingual dyskinesia was most likely metabolic +/- central pontine myelinolysis.
EEG showed moderate-to-severe generalized cortical dysfunction.
Speech and swallow felt the patient had moderate-to-severe pharyngeal dysphagia, with impaired respiratory swallow coordination, premature spillage into pharynx.
NGT was not placed given concern for esophageal varices.
Of note, family recounts that her liver disease was first noticed ~4 years ago.
The patient had been sent to Hematology/Oncology for lab abnormalities (?anemia/thrombocytopenia).
Eventually (~one year later), ultrasound showed liver disease (?nodular liver w/ cirrhosis).
She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 89845**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], whom she saw ~twice a year for management of her liver disease.
The family, however, did not feel anything had been done aside from diagnosis of "cryptogenic cirrhosis."
Approximately one year ago, the patient started decompensating from her liver disease, with encephalopathy.
She has been hospitalized multiple times since Spring [**2150**] for this and was noted since ~ [**2150-8-7**] to have worsening renal function (baseline 1.3-1.5).
In the last 2-3 weeks, the patient was found for the first time to have hyponatremia (not a problem before).
ROS: Positive per HPI; patient unable to answer rest of ROS   Past Medical History: * Hypertension * Hyperlipidemia * Hypothyroidism * Anemia * GERD * Diastolic CHF * Depression/anxiety * Chronic kidney disease (baseline 1.5) * Cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites/lower extremity edema and varices (diagnosed at [**Hospital1 2025**], no biopsy done, reportedly negative hepatitis serologies), has been on low protein/low sodium diet since [**2150**] and diuretics have been standing since then).
Mother with COPD, hypertension and died in old age after fracture   Physical Exam: Admission: VS: T98.3, BP147/46, HR73, RR18, 97% on RA XXXXXXXX GENERAL: comfortable, but uncooperative and non-interactive, Jaundiced HEENT: Sclera icteric.
NGT in place, no JVD CARDIAC: RRR with II/VI systolic ejection murmur LUNGS: CTA b/l with no wheezing, rales, or rhonchi.
decreased breath sounds in bases ABDOMEN: Distended but Soft, non-tender to palpation.
Dullness to percussion over dependent areas but tympanic anteriorly.
No HSM or tenderness appreciated.
Warm and well perfused, no clubbing or cyanosis.
Mild facial droop on right.

Floor course: # Altered Mental Status: Originally the differential diagnosis included hepatic encephalopathy, central pontine myelinolysis, CVA, hyponatremia, steroid induced psychosis, and hospital induced/ICU delirium.
Hepatic encephalopathy was thought to be likely contributing as worsening mental status decline mirrored lactulose cessation at the OSH (due to poor PO intake)and family reports that the facility initially gave the patient less lactulose than worked at home (30mL TID vs 60mL TID).
Hyponatremia was also likely playing a role, but correction at the outside facility did not seem to improve her mentation.
Central pontine myelinolysis was initially thought to be a possibility given her peculiar tongue movements, but there was no clear evidence of rapid sodium rise and no evidence on head CT. MRI was limited by motion and neither ruled in or ruled out such a finding.
Lactulose was started at 30mL q2h with copious stool production (~10 BM/day) which did nothing to clear her mental status over her first 3 days of admission.
# Cirrhosis: Diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis is a diagnosis of exclusion.
Upon the third day of her hospital stay, Ms. [**Known lastname **]' sodium was found to be 152 likely secondary to copious stool production in the setting of lactulose administration.
Likely secondary to decreased effective circulating volume as above.
Also question of hepatorenal syndrome.
# Asthma: Ms. [**Known lastname **]' initial reason for admission to the OSH was shortness of breath which has been treated with steroids and albuterol.
She is currently without respiratory distress on room air, and no focal infiltrates on exam or CXR, until her fourth day of admission, when she became hypoxic with SpO2 85% on RA.
Due to concern for fluid overload and wet appearance on CXR, lasix was started.
Unfortunately, Ms. [**Known lastname **] became progressively more hypoxemic and was found to have a large diffuse infiltrates on CXR.
ICU course: Patient was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure requiring urgent intubation and mechanical ventillation.
She became hypotensive and levophed was started.
There was concern that she developed septic shock initially thought to be due to a pneumonia and she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Urine output diminished and O2 saturation remained poor despite maximal ventillation settings.
Echocardiogram was repeated without acute findings and abdominal ultasouhnd did not show cholecystitis.
