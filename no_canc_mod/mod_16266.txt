History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old male with history of HLD, Hypertension, and MI (medically managed 15 years ago), who presented to an outside hospital with chest discomfort.
At that time he thought it was secondary to indigestion and describes a substernal pain rated at [**2136-3-22**].
Pt denies any radiation of that pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, or shortness of breath.
Pt went to work and while driving developed some dizziness which reguired him to pull over.
Throughout this entire time pt states pain increased in severity.
EKG showed sinus with rate of 73, ST elevation in II, III, aVF with TWI in V5,V6.
With resolution of his chest pain with no nausea/vomiting, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or diaphoresis.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Arthritis COPD GOUT Asthmatic bronchitis Chronic Kidney disease RBBB Back pain 3.5cm AAA Colon polyps diverticulosis GERD Iron deficiency Vitamin D deficiency peripheral neuropathy benign prostatic hypertropy right shoulder fracture/pain (7 months ago) s/p CCY s/p sinus surgery   Social History: Patient lives in [**Hospital1 392**] with wife.
NECK: Supple, without JVD CARDIAC: Distant heart sounds, RR, normal S1, S2.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Sucessful thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of a thrombotic occlusion at the mid RCA with two overlapping DESs.
Unsuccessful POBA to the mid-distal RPDA for an embolic occlusion.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old male with history of HLD, Hypertension, and MI (medically managed 15 years ago), who presented to OSH after 6 hours of chest discomfort.
He had evidence of an inferior STEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have complete occlusion of the mid RCA treated with 2 overlapping DES.
1) RCA STEMI - treated with two drug eluting stents.
He was transferred directly to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have 100% MID occlusion of the RCA sp successful overlapping DES x2 to mid RCA with possible embolization of thrombus in distal RPDA.
At the end of the catheterization he had persistent occlusion of the RPDA despite multiple meds/ptca.
He did well post catheterization with no complications.
His post PCA echocardiogram showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
He also has [**1-21**]+ MR felt to be likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction post MI.
Hypertension - his outpatient hypertension regimen was changed during his admission.
History of 3.5cm Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: unclear current status, no acute issues during this admission.
Lower extremity swelling - recently started on furosemide as an outpatient.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for dyspnea, wheezing.
Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST elevation Myocardial Infarction EF 50% Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Asthma Ventricular Tachycardia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for a cardiac catheterization and a successful thrombectomy and stenting of an occlusion at the mid right coronary artery with two overlapping Drug Eluting stents.
Your echocardiogram showed that you have some mild weakness in the motion of your heart.
You will have another echocardiogram in about 1 month to assess for changes.
Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2912**] if you have any chest pain, trouble breathing, nausea, fevers, bleeding, vomiting or dizziness.
Call the cathterization lab if you have increasing swelling, bruising, tenderness or bleeding from you right groin site.
