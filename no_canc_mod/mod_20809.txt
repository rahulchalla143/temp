Pertinent Results: [**2153-12-2**] 10:05PM   WBC-7.2 RBC-3.61* HGB-11.1* HCT-32.6* MCV-90 MCH-30.8 MCHC-34.1 RDW-11.9 [**2153-12-2**] 10:05PM   PLT COUNT-301 [**2153-12-2**] 10:05PM   PT-12.3 PTT-19.9* INR(PT)-1.0 [**2153-12-2**] 10:05PM   GLUCOSE-121* UREA N-16 CREAT-0.6 SODIUM-144 POTASSIUM-2.7* CHLORIDE-105 TOTAL CO2-30* ANION GAP-12 ----- CT head without contrast [**2153-12-2**]: There is a large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the left thalamus.
High attenuation material is seen within the ventricles consistent with intraventricular extension of hemorrhage.
There is mass effect with displacement of the third ventricle to the right by approximately 1 cm., and anterolateral displacement of the left caudate and putamen.
Periventricular white matter foci of low attenuation are present, likely consistent with chronic microvascular infarctions.
IMPRESSION: Large left thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and hydrocephalus.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 70 year old  woman with known history of hypertension who presented with elevated blood pressure right-sided weakness and vomiting.
On later exam, she had fixed and dilated pupils, absence of oculocephalic and gag reflexes and bilateral decerebrate posturing, all consistent with brainstem compression.
Head CT revealed a large left basal ganglia bleed with right-sided shift, intraventricular hemorrhage with blood in fourth ventricle and obstructive hydrocephalus.
