This morning, his wife called him who felt that he sounded like he was having difficulty breathing on the phone.
CXR showed pulm edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
His recent relevant history is as follows: He was recently electiely admitted for cardiac and periferal cath on [**12-7**] for noctural angina and claudication.
During P cath, he underwent cryoplasty of left superficial femoral artery and left internal iliac artery.
On further questioning of his wife, she denies that he has been having fevers, cough, sorthness of breath, or chest pain in the last week.
He did have an episode of CP 2 weeks ago which resoved with NTG.

- [**2152**] - CABG: SVG -> OM, SVG-> D1 & SVG-> D2 - [**2153**] - PTCA to SVG->D1 in [**5-26**], PTCA w/ brachy therapy to SVG->D2 in [**10-26**] - [**5-29**] - PTCA to SVG-D1 with 4 Cypher DES - [**4-28**] - PTCA showed LAD had a 80% distal lesion.
Distal LAD stented.
5. severe symptomatic PVD s/p mult peripheral stents - [**2155**] - 3 left SFA Dynalink stents to the left superficial femoral artery - [**4-28**] - Successful Atherectomy to the right EIA, CFA and SFA - [**5-/2157**] - Successful atherectomy of the [**Female First Name (un) 7195**] and CFA.
Atherectomy of the LSFA complicated by distal embolization to the AT and PT - [**9-28**] - Successful atherectomy of the right SFA and CFA.
Systolic dysfunction: TEE in [**5-29**] showed no masses, vegatatation.
TTE in [**5-29**] showed EF 45%, Mild global LV hypokinesis, trivial MR 6. depression 7.
Denies alcohol or other drug use   Family History: No family history of CAD  Physical Exam: vitals: 99 rectally,  98/50, HR 77, Sat 100%, settings:AC 700/18/60%/5 PEEP.
Neck: no LAD Heart: RRR, S1, S2, no m/r/g Lungs: decreased BS at bases.
ST depressions in V3.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar plate-like and patchy opacities most likely represent atelectasis.
Less likely could represent pneumonia or aspiration.
Likely bilateral pleural effusions.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Lateral and inferior hypokinesis to akinesis is present.
3 The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-5-30**], LV function has decreased, and the lateral and inferior motion abnormality is new.

Patient also with possible community acquired vs nosocomial pneumonia.
Chest X-ray read was bibasilar atelectasis, but patient with temperatures to 102 degrees the first 2 days of admission and WBC count elevated at 17 on admission and decreased with antibiotics.
Heparin/integrilin started on admission for acute coronary syndrome and d/c'ed on [**12-27**], cardiac enzymes were trending down.
Started Imdur for afterload reduction and increased from 90 to 120 on [**12-29**].
A couple more episodes of "agitation," shortness of breath followed by [**3-3**] chest pressure on [**12-28**] resolved by Alprazolam, sl NTG, no EKG changes and cardiac enzymes continued to decrease.
Patient stated he felt anxious being in the hospital and it's possible this may have contributed to his symptoms.
Extubation on [**12-26**] without complications.
Patient appeared volume overloaded for a couple of days after admission and diuresed 500cc negative/day, breathing improved.
# Pulm: S/P intubation and extubation the following day.
Patient's breathing improved and was no longer requiring oxygen on [**12-30**].
