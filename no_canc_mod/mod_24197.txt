Admission Date:  [**2183-2-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-2-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-3-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Allergies/ADRs on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Cardiac Arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation/extubation Central venous line placement Arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: 70 M with hx of Afib, "leaky valve" presents with cardiac arrest.
Mr. [**Known lastname 88052**] is an active man who has been in his usual state of health with the exception of [**3-13**] weeks of 'difficulty finishing sentences'.
His wife was making dinner and went to ask him a question and found him with his head tilted back on the chair.
A CT PE found no PE but did find mediastinal LAD.
On review of systems per wife, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - A "leaky valve" evaluated by Macgillvary at [**Hospital1 2025**] who reccommended follow up in 2 years - Atrial Fibrillation  Social History: - Tobacco history: former smoker - ETOH:  history of alcoholism about 40 years - Illicit drugs:  none Lives with his wife.
Family History: - Brother died of MI at 60 years old - Sister has [**Name (NI) 19721**] - Another brother died of cancer, as did mother - no history of clots in extended family   Physical Exam: GENERAL: Sedated, intubated HEENT: Unreactive 2mm pupils bilaterally.
No corneal reflex.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No murmurs appreciated through arctic sun.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
IO sites c/d/i SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Microbiology:    RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2183-2-8**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Suboptimal evaluation of subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches due to patient respiratory motion.
No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
No acute aortic dissection.
Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis or aspiration.
Indeterminate 12 mm left adrenal nodule; further workup with an MRI or dedicated adrenal CT is recommended if clinically warranted.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ~50 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
EEG: IMPRESSION: This EEG done continuously over 24 hours shows a severe encephalopathy manifest by marked suppression with intermittent bursting pattern compatible with the cooling protocol itself and sedative  medication.
No significant seizure discharges were identified.
EKG on admission: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Increased QRS voltage but does not meet criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy in precordial leads.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
EKG during admission: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and increase in rate as compared with previous tracing of [**2183-2-4**].
The T waves are now biphasic in leads V3-V6 and there is diffuse ST-T wave flattening in the limb leads.
The anterolateral ST-T change may represent active ischemia.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old male M with hx of Afib, "leaky valve" presents with cardiac arrest.
# Cardiac Arrest: He was likely pulseless for 45-55 minutes with CPR for 20-30 minutes; he may have had a shockable rhythm but degenerated into PEA for the bulk of his arrest.
The cause of his arrest was most likely ischemic, given the wall motion abnormalities found on echocardiogram and the rising troponins.
The patient was cooled, as described below, and continued to be in atrial fibrillation while sedated and intubated.
# Neuroprotection s/p arrest: Interval between arrest and initiation of cooling was ~3-4 hours.
# Atrial fibrillation:  The patient's rhythm was controlled with high-doses of diltiazem QID, after B-blockers were not sufficient to control his tachycardia.
Warfarin was held due to supratherapeutic levels after cooling and re-warming.
His rapid ventricular rate may have also been due to an infective process as described below.
Staph aureus pneumonia:  As the patient was re-warmed, he began to show signs of rigoring and he spiked fevers to above 38 degrees celsius.
The sputum grew large amounts of MSSA and the other cultures did not grow anything at the time of this summary.
