We do not think this has any relation to the catheter site over the right femoral as the patient has excellent pulses throughout and no evidence of any bruit or any vascular compromise to the foot.
She has been noted to be guaiac positive on several occasions, but she has not had any episodes of gross melena or bright red blood per rectum.
Anemia work up revealed iron deficiency anemia.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable and chest pain free on the current cardiac regimen.
