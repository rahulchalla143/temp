There are no other foci of hemorrhage or intraventricular extension.
No significant change in the size of the acute hematoma in the right occipital lobe compared to the CT scan done a few hours earlier.
Mild surrounding edema, unchanged.
Peripheral enhancement noted in the margins of the hematoma; a few vessels are identified within the periphery on the TOF angiogram, which is somewhat technically limited.
It is unclear if these vessels are abnormal or represent normal vessels displaced by the hematoma itself.
A follow study after resolution of the hematoma including the area of interest or a conventional diagnostic angiogram can be performed for better assessment of any vascular lesions.
CTA [**2116-7-28**]: No change in appearance of right occipital parenchymal hemorrhage with a small amount of surrounding vasogenic edema.
A few prominent vessels are seen in the vicinity of the hematoma; however, exact etiology of the lesion remains uncertain as it could be obscured in the setting of acute hematoma.
Differential diagnosis continues to include vascular malformation such as AVM, or cavernoma, hypertensive hemorrhage, as well as underlying mass lesion cannot be excluded.
Followup MRI after resolution of the hematoma is recommended to evaluate its underlying cause.
CT Head [**2116-8-5**]: There is a slight increase in the right occipital parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding area of vasogenic edema.
There is no new midline shift, effacement of the quadrigeminal cistern or hydrocephalus.
There is no acute vascular territorial infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: This 78 yo F was at yoga class when she experienced the sudden onset of headache and then subsequent loss of left sided vision.
The pt underwent formal visual field testing [**2116-8-3**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] where she was found to have a left homonymous hemianopsia.
Her right groin was closely observed and there were no post-embolization complications.
She continues to have a left homonymous hemianopsia.
