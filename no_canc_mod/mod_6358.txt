Admission Date:  [**2163-7-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2163-7-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-11-8**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, restrictive lung disease, kyphoscoliosis, and major depression who was admitted to the Inpatient Psychiatry Service on [**2163-6-25**] for depression and ruminations about her physical condition; mostly because of her recently discovered lung nodule that was believed to be benign.
The patient recently had her antidepressant (desipramine) discontinued and was being considered for electroconvulsive therapy, but ultimately was started on a course of Celexa and Risperdal with methylphenidate be added on [**7-18**].
On the morning of admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit ([**7-18**]), the patient became acutely short of breath with her oxygen saturation decreasing down to 55%.
Therefore, the patient was semi-electively intubated and brought to the Intensive Care Unit for a suspected hypercarbic respiratory failure.
She reports no fevers, chills, or chest pain.
An electrocardiogram at the time of this incident showed ST depressions in the inferolateral leads along with tachycardia.
Congestive heart failure (with a recent echocardiogram in [**2163-1-29**] which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 60%, 3+ mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension).
Asthma; pulmonary function tests in [**2163-5-31**] revealed an FEV1 of 35%, FVC of 34%, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of 101%; consistent with a restrictive lung pattern.
Kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung disease.
Chronic CO2 retention.
Right middle lobe lung nodule 5 mm in diameter that has had no change on serial chest computed tomography scan.
A brain computed tomography was also negative for metastasis.
Neck examination revealed no jugular venous distention.
Lung examination revealed diffuse rales, soft wheezes, and good air movement throughout.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a 4/6 systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the precordium.
A regular rate and rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions noted on the monitor.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ edema at the ankles bilaterally.
Rapid plasma reagin was negative.
Question of a left atrial abnormality.
Downsloping ST depressions of 1 mm to 2 mm in size in leads I, II, aVF, and V3 through V6.
A chest x-ray revealed severe kyphoscoliosis.
No acute infiltrate.
No evidence of congestive heart failure.
RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient presented to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after an episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
A chest x-ray showed minimal evidence of congestive heart failure.
Therefore, a pulmonary embolism was suspected.
However, a chest computerized axial tomography with angiography ruled out this diagnosis.
The patient was found to have no focal wall motion abnormalities, left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%, and severe 4+ mitral regurgitation.
Per the Cardiology consultation, there was no evidence to support a myocardial infarction and that the majority of the electrocardiogram changes were felt to be consistent with prior examinations.
Of note, on her computerized axial tomography two stable pulmonary nodules with some surrounding lymphadenopathy were noted.
All psychiatric medications; including citalopram, Ativan, and Risperdal were continued as previously prescribed to control her anxiety and fluctuating mood.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  To address the patient's history of congestive heart failure, she was continued on Lipitor, a beta blocker, aspirin, Lasix, and digoxin as previously prescribed.
It was thought that her respiratory failure may have been caused by a flash pulmonary edema related to her congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation.
The patient had no oxygen requirement at the time of discharge.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Four, the Inpatient Psychiatry Unit, for ongoing management of her depression and anxiety.
