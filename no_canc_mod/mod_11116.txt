Admission Date:  [**2108-4-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2108-5-15**]   Service:  INT MED CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post left MCA cerebrovascular accident  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 87-year-old male with a complicated past medical history, who presents to and dense right-sided hemiparesis on [**2108-4-29**].
The patient was evaluated by the stroke team, and MRI showed a left inferior MCA cerebrovascular accident with evidence of M2 segmental occlusion.
The  patient was continued on vancomycin for endocarditis (MSSA) diagnosed in [**3-17**].
The patient was then transferred, after stabilization in the Neurology Intensive Care Unit, to the Medicine team for further management of the patient's multiple comorbidities.
On arrival to the medical [**Hospital1 **], the patient notes positive productive cough with mild shortness of breath.
Sick sinus syndrome status post pacer which was removed one month ago secondary to endocarditis 3.
Hypertension 4.
History of diverticulosis 5.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy 6.
Mild peripheral neuropathy 7.
History of abdominal aortic aneurysm 9.
Anxiety disorder 10.
History of atrial fibrillation  ALLERGIES:   Oxacillin, penicillin, codeine  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Colace, amiodarone, Protonix, aspirin, Proscar, vancomycin, Motrin, Lopressor, Megace, Coumadin, Captopril, Atrovent, albuterol, lasix.
Neck:  Soft, supple, no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Heart:  Heart sounds difficult to auscultate secondary to coarse breath sounds.
Lungs:  Coarse breath sounds diffusely bilaterally, no wheezing or rhonchi.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm, dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally.Bilat necrotci heel ulcers- dry wtih eschar.
IMPRESSION:   87-year-old male with extensive past medical history, who presented with aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis and found to have a left MCA cerebrovascular accident on MRI status post intra-arterial TPA treatment and then subsequent monitoring in the Neurology Intensive Care Unit, who is now transferred to the Medical service for further management.
The patient was noted to still be dysarthric as well as aphasic intermittently.
Findings included no definite area of restricted diffusion was identified.
The previously-identified subtle area of restricted diffusion with increased signal in the left parietal temporal lobe is no longer visible.
An old right cerebellar infarct was visualized.
No new infarcts or evidence for hemorrhage were noted.
No evidence of high-grade stenosis or vascular occlusion in the arteries of the anterior and posterior circulation of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
The patient continued to have difficulties handling his secretios with weak cough.
A swallow eval was ordered however was delyaed due to lack of availability of speech/swallow satff.
Finally a video swallow was done and pt found to have aspiration of all consistencies.
neuro felt this could be due to delirium as there were no other focal signs of cva.
The speecha dn swallow service as well as ENT consult did not feel that diffuse weakness was due to delirium however  they were not sure what could cause this.
Repeat eval done [**5-22**] showed noimprovemend so a PEG tube was placed.
Lastly, the patient was noted to have intermittent periods of delirium with marked sundowning, which was treated moderately well with Haldol as needed.
He did not receive haldol for the last 2 weeks ofstay due to concerns of sedation with increased risk of aspiration.
He continued to have occasional hallucinations but overall has greatlyimproved mental status.
Ischemia:  The patient was not noted to have any chest pain while an inpatient at [**Hospital1 188**], however, was intermittently noted to be in respiratory distress, which was thought to be possibly secondary to worsening congestive heart failure of possible ischemic origin.
Electrocardiograms were obtained and showed no ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes were cycled intermittently and showed no elevation.
Pump:  Patient with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with a reported ejection fraction of 25-30% , as well as 3+ mitral regurgitation and severe TR.
The patient's intermittent episodes of dyspnea as well as occasional [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing was thought to be possibly secondary to worsening congestive heart failure.
Congestive heart failure service was consulted and plan on [**2108-5-6**], was to have the patient transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for right heart catheterization and subsequentadjustment of  therapy.
Swan numbers showed that the patient had an elevated wedge as well as pulmonary artery pressure which was attributed to the patient's 3+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient was thought to actually be total body fluid depleted, and was hydrated during his stay in the Coronary Care Unit rather than diuresed.
c.  Rhythm:  Patient with a history of atrial fibrillation, however, on transfer from the Neurology service on [**5-1**], the patient was noted to have an INR of 4.6.
Pulmonary:  The patient was noted to have marked respiratory secretions and associated coarse breath sounds on physical examination.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet with associated deep suctioning were performed daily, however, the patient was still unable to mobilize the majority of his secretions.
In addition, the patient benefited from the use of albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers as needed for dyspnea.
It was thought that the mass-like opacities in the right upper lobe were a septic emboli from the patient's recent endocarditis and, on repeat serial chest x-rays, it was noted that this opacity was improving and resolving gradually.
On hospital day number 17, a Pulmonary consult was obtained in order to better manage the patient's poor mobility of respiratory secretions as well as intermittent periods of dyspnea.
In addition, at the time of transfer to the Coronary Care Unit on [**2108-5-6**], the patient's poor respiratory status and the inability to rule out an infiltrate in the left lower lobe, the patient was empirically started on levofloxacin and Flagyl in spite of no fever spike at that time.
The patient was maintained on those antibiotics, and had the addition of vancomycin when methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus sparse growth was isolated from a sputum obtained in the Coronary Care Unit.
Vancomycin levels were checked, and the patient was noted to have peaks and troughs within the normal limit.He completed 2 weeks of these atibiotics and then they were dc'd.
On the night of [**2108-5-14**], the patient was noted to have a fever spike to 101.4.
In addition, it was noted that the patient had a PICC line in his right upper extremity for the past six weeks, and the decision was made to remove the PICC line with culturing of the tip.The cx was neg and pt did not have further fevers.
Renal:  The patient was noted to have an elevated creatinine to as high as 2.2, up from his baseline of 1.0.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was noted to have a hypernatremia as high as 152.
Hematology:  Patient with a chronic anemia, likely of chronic disease.
The patient's hematocrit has remained relatively stable during his hospital stay, and the patient has been transfused only one unit of packed red blood cells without complication.
