Patient was brought in by [**Location (un) 86**] med flight from [**Hospital6 302**] emergency Department with a history of abdominal pain, hypotensive to 80/P which improved after fluid resusitation with NS (5L) to SBP of 120's, but still had poor urine output.
Patient got fentanyl 100mg IV for pain and zofran for nausea.
Initial workup notable for free fluid in the abdomen seen on CT scan (in [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch), without any free air, positive fast exam.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she is awake alert and oriented, and complaining of abdominal pain, worse on the left lower quadrant.
She denies any trauma preceding the abdominal pain.
Patient was given additional IVF, vanc/zosyn, 4g of mag, 2 calcium, 30 of phos, got fentanyl IV for pain control.
Lab was notable for leukocytosis with bandemia, CT c/w pancreatitis.
On the floor, patient is in mild distress no other complains.

Marked peripancreatic free fluid, which may be secondary to acute pancreatitis.
Marked duodenal edema and mucosal hyperenhancement, could be reactive to the adjacent acute pancreatitis.
Extensive peripancreatic fluid is unchanged since prior study, consistent with history of acute pancreatitis.
Interval development of extensive consolidation and ground-glass opacity in both lungs, most likely due to ARDS or aspiration.
In this patient with acute pancreatitis, the extensive peripancreatic fluid in the anterior pararenal space extending inferiorly into the pelvis, appear similar in size and appearance compared to the prior study.
No vascular complications are seen.
No evidence of pancreatic necrosis.
Mild narrowing of the origin of the celiac trunk, likely due to compression by the median arcuate ligament.
Multiple uterine fibroids.
Stable extensive peripancreatic fluid collections extending inferiorly into the pelvis, which are unchanged in size and appearance compared to the prior study, likely representing pseudocysts.
No evidence of pancreatic necrosis, hemorrhage, or vascular complication.
Improvement in bibasilar opacities within the lung bases.
MODERATE GROWTH.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2141-5-31**]):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
Immunoflourescent test NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..    FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR: NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
DISCHARGE LABS: Na 138, K 3.4, Cl 103, HCO3 22, BUN 3, Cr 0.3 ALT-81* AST-48* AlkPhos-72 TotBili-0.3 Hct 22.8, WBC 22.9, plts 394 Triglycerides 225 Reticulocytes 3.2  Brief Hospital Course: 42 F with Hx of etoh abuse, hypertension, possible seizure disorder presented with findings c/w severe pancreatitis and hypotension.
Her pancreatitis was severe and complicated by ARDS requiring intubation.
She developed a multifocal PNA, fevers, and severe metabolic derangements.
# Pancreatitis, Severe without Necrosis The cause of her pancreatitis was most likely alcohol, although she was noted to have hypertriglyceridemia which may cause pancreatitis as well.
Her course was complicated by ARDS and severe calcium, magnesium and phosphorous derangements requiring aggressive repletion (~20 grams of calcium gluconate in 24 hours).
# Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Multifocal Bacterial Pneumonia On day two of hospitalization, Ms. [**Known lastname 45935**] developed extreme respiratory distress.
A CXR revealed bilateral inifiltrates.
In 2 days, her ARDS improved briskly however intubation was deferred secondary to oversedation.
By day 3, she had developed new infiltrates, fever while growing h. flu and, later, CHRYSEOBACTERIUM INDOLOGENES.
Her antibiosis was complicated by a maculopapular rash that later became confluent on the back and left forearm.
Bactrim was then d/c'd d/t concern of high fevers and worsened rash.
A CT of the abdomen was obtained due to clinical concern of possible hemorrhagic pancreatitis, however the CT remained stable without e/o hemorrhage.
Hct still remained low at discharge, with no evidence of acute bleeding.
Anemia likely due to acute inflammation and illness.
# Severe Malnutrition; Protein-Energy and complex mineral/vitamin deficiencies Hypocalcemia Hypophosphatemia Anemia with very wide RDW; presumed Folate and Iron Deficiency Thrombocytopoenia responsive to etoh abstinence EtOH abuse The patient had refractory hypocalcemia which was partly malnutritional and partly due to pancreatitis and severe refractory hypophosphatemia both which required aggressive repletion.
She had anemia with a normal MCV and RDW > 22 indicating two distinct populations of red cells, presumably related to etoh abuse, folate deficiency and iron deficiency.
She had thrombocytopoenia that improved steadily over admission, presumably with abstinence from etoh.
Pt is at risk for other nutritional deficiencies as well, thus she was also treated with a multivitamin.
# Transaminitis with fatty infiltration on CT Likely Alcoholic Steatohepatis Transaminitis on admission: AST/ALT > 2 (50/22) with normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
She had diffuse fatty infiltration of her liver on CT.
Presumably she had Alcoholic Steatohepatitis vs NASH with fibrosis.
She had a rash develop at that time and the second peak had ALT>AST with values in the 100's.
This was presumed related to medications; her antibiotics were changed at that time, as she also had a rash (see below).
# Anxiety She was maintained on her home regimen of clonazepam and required large doses of versed while intubated.
# Rash During her ICU stay, she developed a severe whole body rash, likely due to medication.
Considering the fact that she had been on multiple new medications, it is difficult to pinpoint which medication caused the reaction, however, I suspect that the initial reaction was due to cefepime.
Her Cefepime and cipro were exchanged for bactrim, however this was subsequently exchanged for levofloxacin after she developed a high fever and worsened rash after a dose of bactrim.
She tolerated the levofloxacin without difficulty, and her rash continued to improve.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a severe episode of pancreatitis due to your alcohol consumption.
You were VERY sick, and developed breathing problems that required intubation, pneumonia, and a urinary tract infection.
