Admission Date:  [**2121-3-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2121-3-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2052-2-14**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, BOOP, pulmonary artery hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease, who presented to the Emergency Room with a complaint of increasing shortness admission.
In the setting of this, the patient had a recent change in her Lasix dose from 160 mg p.o.
without relief of the shortness of breath.
The patient also during that time noted an episode of substernal chest pain which was in her (usual spot) without radiation and without associated symptoms of nausea, diarrhea or diaphoresis.
The patient had one more episode of this chest pain in the Emergency Room which was relieved with one sublingual Nitroglycerin.
No electrocardiogram changes were noted.
The patient denied any recent fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
She did have a little bit of right yellow rhinorrhea but no other symptoms.
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
No change in her baseline lower extremity edema.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was given 80 mg IV Lasix to which she diuresed about 2 L over night with improvement in her symptoms and return of her oxygen saturation to her baseline.
Congestive heart failure.
Last echocardiogram in [**2120-6-5**] showed an ejection fraction of 70%, mild trivial mitral regurgitation, and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, maintained normal sinus rhythm on Dofetilide.
Coronary artery disease status post PCI in [**2118**] to the posterior descending artery, and also shown to have diffuse right coronary artery disease.
Obstructive sleep apnea, not using CPAP.
Chronic venostasis with chronic leg ulcers.
Depression  ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN AND TEGRETOL.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father had an myocardial infarction at age 47.
Mother died secondary to colon cancer.
There was a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Lungs:  There were bibasilar crackles half way up from base.
Extremities:  There was bilateral 2+ pitting edema.
Right leg had two chronic leg ulcers on the dorsum of the leg with granulomatous tissue and one ulcer on the anterior tibia on the left leg.
A KUB showed no evidence of obstruction.
Chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly with an increase in her known right-sided pleural effusion, as well as upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature and worsening congestive heart failure compared to a study from [**2121-2-27**].
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 60, with normal axis, no ST changes, and no T-wave inversions.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with CKs of 51, 35 and 61, and troponins of less than 0.3.
The Heart Failure Service was consulted regarding her congestive heart failure, and she has been followed in the Advanced Heart Failure Clinic for quite some time.
The patient is in [**State 531**] Heart Association Class III-IV heart failure.
She also developed contraction alkalosis.
The patient's Dofedilide was restarted, and over the next two days, the patient switched between normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation several times.
Of note, the patient was completely asymptomatic during these episodes, so it is not known if she is in atrial fibrillation at home ever.
The Electrophysiology Service felt that there was no need for cardioversion, and the patient should be continued on Dofetilide, as well as Lopressor with potassium repletion as needed.
The patient's creatinine was stable with a peak of 1.5 and 1.3 on the day of discharge, and it was felt that there was no need for adjustment of the Dofetilide dosing at this point, as it was maintaining the patient in sinus rhythm and patient's potassium was maintained at 4-4.5.
The patient did complain of occasional dizziness.
As far as studies go, the patient had an echocardiogram on [**2121-3-3**], to assess for changes in heart function as the cause of the heart failure.
She had dilated left and right atrium as previously noted.
The left ventricular cavity size was normal; however, the study was of suboptimal technical quality, as it was done while the patient was in atrial fibrillation and may need to be repeated in the future.
Mild 1+ regurgitation was seen, as well as mild 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient will need periodic checks of her pulmonary function and oxygenation as an outpatient every four months for about 12 months after the last steroid dose.
She had EGD and colonoscopy for anemia in [**9-6**] and [**10-7**] without clinically significant finding.
Ddx of anemia was thought to include small bowel AVM and renal insufficiency.
As for anticoagulation, the patient was felt to be a poor candidate for Coumadin in the past, as she is a fall risk and had had two significant bleeding events in the past year.
It was felt that the patient experienced intermittent periods of depression and tearfulness, as well as occasional vivid nightmares.
Leg ulcers:  The patient has chronic leg ulcers which are secondary to a combination in venous stasis and arterial insufficiency, and followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in vascular surgery.
As far as the patient's pain from the ulcers, she was maintained on her standard OxyContin and Morphine with overall good pain control.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation 3.
Diabetes Mellitus 4.
Azotemia 6.
Anemia                                    [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 4283**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4284**], M.D.
