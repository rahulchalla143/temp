Her first sx began 3 days ago when she experienced a sudden, but not not particularly intense frontal HA (~[**4-7**]).
She denies any other VC, focal weakness, sensory change, ataxia, or difficulty producing or understanding language.
She states her daughter-in-law feels her speech is a bit slower than usual, but without dysarthria.
Past Medical History: osteoporosis HLD appy C/S x 2 sx for deviated septum B/L LE vein stripping   Social History: Former nurse, retired.
Father with fatal aortic aneurysm.
No dysarthria.
Only abnormality in describing Cookie Picture is that she describes a "blanket" hanging over the sink, rather than saying water is overflowing.
No evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Palate elevation symmetrical.

Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe, without evidence of an underlying vascular malformation or aneurysm.
There has mild increase in the size of the intraparenchymal hematoma, with stable appearance of the intraventricular extension.
There is also local mass effect and stable mild rightward midline shift.
Unremarkable CTA of the head and neck, without evidence of an underlying vascular malformation or aneurysm.
There is no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis or dissection.
Periapical lucency involving the left maxillary first molar, for which correlation with dental examination is recommended.
Mucosal sinus disease, predominantly involving the frontal and ethmoid air cells.
Left intraparenchymal hematoma, with intraventricular extension, with mild increase in the degree of rightward midline shift.
There is no evidence of an underlying mass lesion or abnormal enhancement.
No other focus of abnormal enhancement is identified to suggest metastatic disease.
Scattered foci of susceptibility artifact are noted.
Given the distribution and pattern, these may represent microhemorrhage related to hypertension or prior trauam.
Amyloid angiopathy is less likely.
Multiple confluent areas of white matter signal abnormality are a nonspecific finding, but likely represent the sequela of chronic  microangiopathy given the patient's age.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1274**] is a 68 year old woman with history of dyslipidemia and osteoarthritis who presented with a left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
The etiology of the bleed includes amyloid angiopathy vs. underlying AVM or mass.
Given the possibility of AVM (although not seen on CTA) she underwent an angiogram on [**2-19**] which showed no sign of AVM, however she was incidentally noted to have a small (2mm) PComm aneurysm for which she should undergo a repeat MRA in 1 year.
For her frontal hemorrhage she will have a repeat MRI prior to her Neurology follow-up appointment in 6 weeks.
ID; The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection prior to transfer and was started on levofloxacin.
