This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with an extensive past medical history as noted above, who was initially admitted on [**10-5**], with failure to thrive, dehydration and weakness for four days prior to admission.
The patient also had had abdominal pain with eating, diarrhea for four to five days, with three to four bowel movements a day described as watery and nonbloody consistent with multiple past episodes.
The Gastrointestinal Service was consulted and an MRA was performed which showed severe stenosis of the celiac access and superior mesenteric artery, consistent with mesenteric ischemia as well as bilateral renal artery stenosis.
During the procedure, there was difficulty in advancing the catheter into the pulmonary artery.
This caused transient complete heart block, so the patient had a temporary pacing wire inserted with recovery to normal sinus rhythm with a new left bundle branch block.
She went into PEA arrest secondary to the pericardial effusion which was tamponading her heart.
The patient then had a repeat right heart catheterization.
During her Coronary Care Unit admission, her anti-coagulation for her atrial fibrillation was discontinued secondary to her bleeding risk.
On the 18th, she was noted to have decreased mental status and being completely unresponsive to voice and the Neurology Service was consulted.
They felt that the mental status change were secondary to possible anoxic brain injury versus metabolic derangement.
Of note, the patient had been hemodynamically stable but intermittently had episodes of atrial fibrillation.
No rate control was initiated secondary to the history of complete heart block and given the patient's surgical risk, it was unclear whether or not she would be a good candidate for pacemaker placement.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction ten years ago; rule out myocardial infarction.
Left lower quadrant abdominal pain.
History of acute renal failure.
Pancreatic insufficiency.
Status post complete heart block with temporary pacer placement.
Mesenteric ischemia status post stenting of celiac and SMA-arteries.
