On [**4-5**] patient became somnolent and combative repeat ABG showed increased CO2 retention.
Patient was started on CPAP @ night with great improvement in her mental status.
She is to continue her prednisone taper and will follow up with her [**Month/Day (4) 19039**] * ## Confusion - patient became suddenly somnolent on [**4-5**].
The sudden onset of her symptoms was concerning for overmedication however patient had not received anything for 8 hours prior except Tylenol.
ABG showed increasing CO2 retention.

## urinary frequency: She reports increasing urinary frequency and also symptoms that may be consistent with an element of urinary retention.
