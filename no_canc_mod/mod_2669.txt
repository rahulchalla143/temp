RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Mild-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with conduction abnormality/ventricular pacing.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 3mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: # CAD/Ischemia: s/p stent placement in [**2187**].
preference anyway, though this likely represents subendocardial ischemia from CHF exacerbation.
though to have a component of ischemia [**3-1**] stretch from CHF exacerbation.
# Pump: likely combination of acute on chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure.
Unclear why having acute exacerbation, though may relate to either poor BP control, Afib, infection.
h/o hypertension-mediated acute pulmonary edema, though no HTN here.
edema - ECHO showed EF 35%-40% with mild global HK - renal consulted for dialysis for fluid removal, dialyzed 2.2 L on wednesday, as well as 3 liters on day of discharge.
likely should be on ACE-I, as no allergy or known contraindication.
# Rhythm: in afib with rapid ventricular response initially.
- continued digoxin post dialysis - no anticoagulation in past, likely [**3-1**] previous GI bleed, but could not obtain documentation of this.
# ESRD: renal consulted, dialyzed X 2.
# UTI: pyuria on U/A, started cefpodoxime, with plans to treat for 7d, first day [**4-16**], to be dosed after dialysis, urine cx pending on discharge and needs to be followed up as an outpatient to ensure appropriate antibiotic coverage.
# HTN: Continued diltiazem, lopressor, add low dose ACE added as tolerated .
# Anemia: h/o GI bleed [**3-1**] ulcers, unclear if she had f/u EGD to ensure healing of ulcers - PPI - B12, folate, wnl, Fe studies c/w anemia of chronic disease due to renal dysfunction - unclear if she ever had repeat EGD.
speech and swallow consult, when out of acute HF exacerbation .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: End stage renal disease on hemodialysis Coronary artery disease Hypertension atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: All vitals signs stable, afebrile, off oxygen   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath.
This occured from a combination of incomplete dialysis and a rapid heart rate.
You were dialyzed twice to get this fluid off and you were given more medications to slow your heart rate.
You did not have a heart attack although initially your EKG was concerning.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomitting, fevers, chills or any other symptoms that concern you.
