HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 61 year-old female with history of alcohol cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, seizure disorder, status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2155**] who was at [**Hospital 19497**] when by report she developed worsening shortness of breath and nausea and vomiting.
By the time EMT arrived patient was hypoxic and 89 percent on room air.
There were reports of bloody vomitus at the scene.
By the time the patient arrived in the emergency department she was in acute respiratory distress and was intubated on arrival.
There was no preintubation arterial blood gases available.
Head CT done in the emergency department without contrast showed no evidence of acute bleed or mass effect.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema with no focal infiltrate.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   1) Alcoholic liver cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy.
She has had multiple admissions for mental status changes.
2) Pancytopenia in [**2157**].
3) Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gstric ulcer in [**2158-8-13**].
4) Seizure disorder.
7) Status post cerebrovascular accident complicated by intracranial hemorrhage in [**2155**].
8) Asthma/ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
10) History of falls complicated by left clavicular fracture.
11) History of left hip fracture, status post open reduction and internal fixation, complicated by abscess.
12) VRE/MRSA urinary tract infections.
13) History of pneumonia.
14) History of methicillin resistant staphylococcus coag negative bacteremia in 7/[**2158**].
Echocardiogram from [**8-/2158**] shows ejection fraction of 60 percent, mild HK of intraventricular septum.
In general she was obtunded, not responsive to voice, pain and was intubated.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  disks sharp bilaterally, no jugular venous pressure.
Heart normal S1, S2, no murmur, rubs or gallops.
Extremities:  no edema.
Neurologic:  increased muscular tone throughout, not responsive to voice or painful stimuli.
Right lower extremity tone greater than left lower extremity tone, 2+ biceps and patellar reflexes bilaterally, Babinski downgoing on right but upgoing on left.
Head CT:  no acute intracranial bleed.
Chest x-ray:  increeased pulmonary vasculature and congestion.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 61 year-old female with hypoxic respiratory failure in a setting of nausea, vomiting, mental status changes and fever.
1) Fever source still uncertain.
Lumbar puncture was negative for meningitis.
Chest was without infiltrate.
However, patient did have nausea, vomiting and question of developing aspiration pneumonia was entertained.
Urine culture is positive for E. coli and gram positive cocci that is not identified at the time of this dictation.
A renal ultrasound was done to rule out abscess or stone causing a complicated urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis which was negative for abscess.
Also of note there was no ascites on examination or on ultrasound.
Patient was treated with Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia.
She was also given Linazolid for urinary tract infection since previous urinary tract infections were VRE sensitive only to Synercid and Linazolid.
2) In terms of her hypoxic respiratory failure there was question if it was secondary to aspiration in the setting of nausea and vomiting.
3) Mental status changes most likely secondary to urinary tract infection complicated by hepatic encephalopathy in this patient with little reserve.
4) In terms of her nausea and vomiting nasogastric lavage was negative for any active bleeding.
It was thought that it may be due to general ill state and that the bloody vomitus that was documented by emergency medical technicians may have been secondary to traumatic intubation attempt.
5) Thrombocytopenia remained stable during this hospitalization.
