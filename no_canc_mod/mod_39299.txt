No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferoseptal dyskinesis, mid inferoseptal akinesis, and basal to mid inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There is a 4.7 x 3.0 cm hypoechoic mass adjacent to the posterior aspect of the aortic arch which likely represents pseudoaneurysm.
There is systolic flow into the mass by color flow Doppler.
No dissection or thrombus is seen.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Left ventricular function is mildly reduced from pre-bypass exam (EF 30-35%).
Aortic regurgitation is unchanged.
Mitral regurgitation is unchanged.
No ascending aortic dissection is seen post-decannulation.
PA&lat [**11-29**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-25**]:  Moderate right pleural effusion is smaller, previous borderline interstitial edema has resolved.
Small left pleural effusion is probably decreased as well.

A rheumatology consult was obtained to evaluate for large vessel vasculitis causing aortic aneurysm.
No definitive diagnosis of aortitis was found on work-up.
On [**2119-11-21**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent bronchoscopy followed by Replacement of ascending aorta and aortic arch with a 28-mm Medusa graft with implantation of the innominate artery and the left common carotid artery with selective antegrade right cerebral perfusion.
He was initially hypotensive requiring multiple pressors that were slowly weaned off over the next few days.
The infectious disease service was consulted for assistance and recommended ceftriaxone for treatment of mycotic aneurysm.
He developed post-op atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone, presently remains in rate controlled a-fib.
He was noted to have an absent gag reflex and a bedside swallowing exam showed him aspirate thin liquids and thus the recommendation was made to thicken his liquids.
The otolaryngology service was consulted who noted a paralyzed vocal chord which may require surgical treatment in the future if aspiration persists.
The following reccomedations have been made by both ENT and Speah and swallow: -PO diet: regular solids, nectar thick liquids -PO meds whole with puree or nectar as tolerated -TID oral care -Maximize reflux meds, as per ENT recs -ENT f/u on outpt basis with pre/post videoswallow studies if vocal fold injection or other treatments are being considered.
-continue diet per S+S w/ low threshold to reevaluate if any concerning sx for aspiration - maximize anti-reflux regimen to limit vocal fold inflammation - humidified air if oxygen in required - f/u w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 9317**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for further management of vocal fold immobility ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2349**])  On [**2119-11-27**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
The electrophysiology service saw no need for device change at this time and deferred a device change to be performed a [**Hospital1 3278**] (where AICD was placed) when needed.
Free water boluses were started for hypernatremia which has since improved.
He will need to have his metabolic labs followed closely while at rehab.
Coumadin was started for persistent atrial fibrillation it was held on [**11-29**] for rising INR, low dose restarted and will need to be monitored closely.
He remains hypertensive and medications have been adjusted to keep BP <140.
7. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing or SOB.
9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
