Admission Date: [**2154-9-1**]        Discharge Date: [**2154-9-5**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex: F  Service: NSURG   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old woman found on the floor at homoe who was minimally responsive and brought to an outside hospital where her head CT showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with right inferior temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] hemorrhage.
There was no mas effect and no shift.
She was sent to angiogram on [**2154-9-1**] which showed a ruptured right posterior communicating artery aneurysm which she had coiling without complications.
The patient was in the ICU post-op for close neurologic observation.
ON [**2154-9-2**], orthopedics were consulted due to a left ankle fracture that was found at the outside hospital.
The patient was treated with minimal splinting and currently did not require any surgical intervention for this fracture.
Neurological exam remained difficult to assess at times because of agitation from the ET tube with resultant increased ICP and decreased pCO2.
No movement noted with the left upper extremity and lower extremity moved with stimulation only.
The patient had gram negative rods and 3 plus monobacterial and Haemophilus influenzae in her sputum.
Urine was no growth to date and CSF was no growth.
On [**2154-9-4**], the patient became progressively more tachypneic throughout the shift despite adjustments to the ventilator.
The patient was thus taken emergently to the Operating Room and underwent a right frontal craniectomy and duroplasty for intractable edema.
A head CT post- op demonstrated ischemic watershed infarcts consistent with severe diffuse vasospasm.
A angiogram was then performed to determine the source of the infarcts and to rule out emboli from the coil mass.
The angiogram disclosed severe vasospasm with thread- like vascular caliber.
The patient had extensive posturing in the left, minimal movement on the right.
