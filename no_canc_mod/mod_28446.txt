GENERAL: A well-developed preterm female in moderate respiratory distress.
CHEST: Diminished breath sounds, sternal and intercostal retractions.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, no masses, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Her respiratory distress persisted and her oxygen requirement was greater than 40% and she was electively intubated and received 1 dose of surfactant.
She has not had any episodes of spontaneous apnea.
Her chest x- ray was consistent with surfactant deficiency.
No murmurs have been noted.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Due to the unknown etiology of the respiratory distress and unknown group beta strep status of her mother, [**Name (NI) **] was evaluated for sepsis upon admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.
GASTROINTESTINAL: [**Location (un) **] was treated for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
NEUROLOGICAL: [**Location (un) 61172**] initial respiratory and neurological depression at the time of birth rapidly improved and she has maintained a normal neurological exam since that time.
There are no neurological concerns at the time of discharge.
No medications.
[**Location (un) **] was     observed in her car seat for 90 minutes without any     episodes of oxygen desaturation or bradycardia.
