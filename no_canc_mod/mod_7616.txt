He had a mild leukocytosis to 11.7.
He was twice admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for CHF exacerbations this past summer-initially in early [**Month (only) 205**] due to uncontrolled hypertension, and later in mid-[**Month (only) **] for the same.
Of note, he developed a superficial thrombophlebitis during his last hospitalization that led to MSSA bacteremia.

Past Medical History: -Morbid Obesity (BMI>70) -HTN -HLD -OSA on nocturnal bipap -tobacco abuse -heart failure with preserved ejection fraction   Social History: -Tobacco history: active smoker, 25 pack-year -ETOH: was heavy alcohol user, 1 pint hard alcohol/day, quit cold [**Country 1073**] Father's Day this year -Illicit drugs: None -Herbal Medications: None - Patient has no stable home, stays at friends' [**Name2 (NI) **], currently  separated from wife   Family History: Multiple grandparents with DM and MI   Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals:T 102.6, BP126/91, P97, RR27, Sat99 on6LNC General: morbidly obese male, breathing heavily, but in no acute distress, alert HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, could not assess JVD due to habitus Lungs: diminished breath sounds bilaterally without crackles or rhonchi CV: distant heart sounds, but no MRG appreciated Abdomen: obese, soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, could not assess organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: CXR: FINDINGS: The study is markedly limited secondary to massive body habitus and AP portable technique.
The study is nearly nondiagnostic as there is also respiratory motion.
It is difficult to exclude a mild interstitial edema.
There is no large pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Nearly nondiagnostic study due to massive body habitus and AP portable technique.
Unilateral US: IMPRESSION: No DVT of the left upper extremity.
CXR: As compared to the prior radiographs there is interval development of left lower lobe consolidation that potentially might reflect infectious process.
In addition patient is in mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname **] is a morbidly obese 48yoM initially presented with N/V/D and acute renal failure and was admitted to the MICU for labored breathing whose hospital course was complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation and massive fluid diuresis and was found to have aortic valve endocarditis with worsening aortic regurgitation.
Given renal failure (see below), diuretics were initially held.
With resolution of diarrhea/fever and continuous use of BiPAP, patients dyspnea returned to baseline and patient was called out to the general medicine floors.
Additionally pt received several fluid boluses given concern for hypovolemic status.
Cardiology was consulted (given history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) who suggested diuresis despite renal failure as patient's wt was trending upward.
On [**10-9**], patient developed acute onset of dyspnea that resulted on hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
While in MICU, patient was aggressively diuresed under concern for flash pulmonary edema.
2) Aortic Valve Endocarditis with Worsening Aortic Regurgitation: Of note patient completed course of MSSA bacteremia with vancomycin on [**2157-9-29**].
Cardiology suggested a TEE to better evaluate cardiac function given respiratory decompenstion, which revealed a new aortic valve vegetation and worsening aortic regurgitation, which likely caused acute decompensation.
Cardiac surgery was consulted who recommended finishing 6 week course of antibiotics as well as cardiac catheterization prior to evaluation for surgery.
Of note patient complained of muscle spasms with daptomycin infusion.
3) Acute Renal Failure: Patient initially presented with acute renal failure.
Renal was consulted who felt that presentation was consistent with acute interstitial nephritis [**1-26**] nafcillin.
Renal agreed with diuresis given respiratory status and felt that creatinine would slowly improve with time.
5) Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Patient severe obstructive sleep apnea likely [**1-26**] morbid obesity.
Pt initially presented with respiratory complaints (see above) requiring continuous BiPAP.
6) Cardiac Dysfunction with Preserved Function/Hypertension/CAD/Hyperlipidemia: Echo showed preserved EF.
7) FEVERS/NAUSEA/DIARRHEA: Initially presenting symptoms however resolved with definitive etiology.
No further interventions were necessary.
8) Muscle Spasms: Patinet complained of muscle spasms while receiving daptomycin infusion.
6. trazodone 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
9. cyclobenzaprine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for twtching sensation.
10. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing, dyspnea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Highgate Manor  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -acute renal insufficiency (suspected acute interstitial nephritis due to nafcillin) -viral gastroenteritis  Secondary: morbid obesity obstructive sleep apnea congestive heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
When you came to the emergency room, you appeared to have significant difficulty breathing.
While you were on the medicine floors, you developed signficant difficulty with your breathing requiring you to come back to the ICU.
An ultrasound was completed of your heart which should that there was an infection on your heart valve that caused your valve to not work properly.
Because of the long hospital stay, you became deconditioned and you will need intense physical therapy in order to get better.
