Admission Date:  [**2163-2-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-3-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Confusion, shortness of breath, cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 6352**] is an 89 YO male with HTN and mild dementia at baseline, who presented with delirium, shortness of breath, and cough.
He also complained of generalized weakness.
IMAGING: [**2-27**] CT Head: No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage.
[**2-27**] CXR PA and lateral: No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
[**3-2**] CXR Portable:  In comparison with the study of [**2-28**], focal areas of opacification adjacent to the aortic arch, in the left lower lung zone and at the right base.
The possibility of a central source of infection must be considered and echocardiography could be helpful.
There is mild-moderate regional dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the apical half of the septum, anterior, apical and lateral walls.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-7-15**], regional left ventricular hypokinesis is now identified (and the severity of mitral regurgitation is not as well characterized).
No central pulmonary embolism.
Findings suggestive of CHF versus fluid overload.
Extensive peripheral ground-glass opacities, most prominent in the upper lobes with areas of honeycombing.
These findings may be related to chronic interstitial process/pulmonary fibrosis.
However, a more acute superimposed process such as viral or atypical pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Nodular opacities in the right middle lobe which may be infectious in etiology.
Pleural calcifications suggesting asbestos-related pleural disease.
Subacute rib fractures involving multiple posterior ribs.
Additional old healed fractures of several right lateral ribs.
Several thoracic compression fractures of indeterminate age.
Reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins suggestive of right- sided heart failure.
Small pericardial effusion.
EKG:Resting sinus tachycardia.
Left atrial abnormality.
Possible left ventricular hypertrophy.
Borderline intraventricular conduction delay.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
On [**3-2**] a floor trigger was called for SOB, hypoxia and increased work of breathing.
On [**3-3**], he had been improving with stable sats; he was afebrile and had a decreased WBC, so he was transferred out to the floor again.
His influenza course was thought to be superimposed with a bacterial pneumonia, as he had persistent temperatures, respiratory distress and worsening infiltrates on CXR .
He also had worsening secretions, which he had difficulty clearing without aggressive suctioning, causing occasional hypoxia.
At the time of discharge, he was afebrile, but had persistent secretions that needed to be managed with frequent suctioning.
Mr. [**Known lastname 6352**] was noted to have an elevated troponin and BNP in the setting of acute lung injury.
HYPONATREMIA: Mr. [**Known lastname 6352**] was noted to have hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to SIADH given the urine lytes and lung disease (pneumonia).
This may have played a role in his delirium on presentation and throughout the hospital stay.
The hyponatremia resolved with 1.5 L fluid restriction and concurrently with clearance of his delirium.
DELIRIUM: Likely secondary to the influenza and then pneumonia given compromised mental reserve in the setting of mild baseline dementia.
Head CT on admission was negative for an acute process.
He had no meningeal signs on exam or headache/photophia/neck stiffness to suggest meningitis; no LP was performed.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Influenza Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable-- satting in the mid- to upper 90's on 3 - 4 L NC; breathing comfortably; has an NG tube for feeding.
Please call your doctor or return to the ED if you experience any of the following: Fever, chills, difficulty breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or any other symptoms that are worrisome to you.
