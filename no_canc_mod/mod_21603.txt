Patient was initially admitted from home to OSH ([**Location (un) 8117**], NH) [**2103-9-19**] for fatigue, dehydration and several week h/o daily diarrhea and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2103-10-3**].
Patient reports that he has been having a non-productive cough at home associated with worsening shortness of breath.
He denied fevers and chills.
No associated CP/palpitations/N/V/diaphoresis.
CXR and Chest CT at OSH revealed new R pleural effusion, but no evidence of infiltrate suggestive of PNA.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient with no specific complaints.
He felt comfortable, denied chest pain/abdominal pain and baseline appetite.

Recurrent bronchitis 13.
Brother died of an embolic stroke to the brainstem.
Aunt died of colon cancer.
Three children, six grandchildren, and one of his daughters has been recently diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer.
+ronchi throughout, no wheezes, no crackles CV: RR no murmurs/rubs/gallops Abd: NT/ND, +BS ext: no edema.
No ST-T changes.
STUDIES: [**2103-10-5**] P-MIBI: CONCLUSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study, no evidence for ischemia, normalwall motion with a 65% ejection fraction.
[**2103-10-5**] STRESS: IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
[**2103-10-5**] CXR: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There are poor inspiratory lung volumes, with pulmonary vascular crowding.
There is a tortuous aorta.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There is slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which is unchanged from the prior study.
Additionally, there may be minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
There is limited evaluation of the trachea and bronchus, likely due to technical factors.
Trace penetration with no aspiration.
Right lower lobe atelectasis.
[**2103-10-9**] PLEURAL FLUID: 10cc Bloody fluid collected, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
There are bilateral small pleural effusions.
There is also pleural thickening along the lateral chest wall.
There is slight asymmetric aeration of the lungs, which may be due to air-trapping.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater, and narrowing of the distal trachea.
Brief Hospital Course: 69M with severe tracheobronchial malacia here for surgical evaluation.
Stents were followed with serial CXR and chest CT which showed no migration or stents.
However, pt had persistent cough without releif with atrovent nebs, lidocaine IH, and guafenesin.
On [**10-10**] metal stents were removed per IP for symptomatic relief of persistent cough.
[**2103-10-19**]: Patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery service and underwent a tracheoplasty for his tracheobronchial malacia.
He remained stable overnight and was given intermittent fluid for low blood pressures.
Postoperatively, patient was noted to be unresponsive despite weaning of his anesthetics as well as hypoxic to the low 80's despite mechanical ventilation via his tracheostomy.
He experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia treated with amiodarone and lidocaine.
Laboratory values at this time demonstrated the patient to be severely acidemic with a bicarbonate of 16 as well as an arterial pH of 7.12.
At this time, the patient remained unresponsive with unequal pupils on exam.
He continued to deteriorate with decreasing urine output, continuing acidemia, and elevated transaminases to >1000.
A stat echocardiogram was performed at the bedside for a presumed pulmonary embolism which demonstrated a dilated, hypokinetic RV.
General surgery was consulted for question of ischemic bowel as well as renal for a decreasing urine output.
A preliminary read demonstrated a large R sided pulmonary embolism.
The patient was started on TPA and managed supportively for his low blood pressure and acidosis.
Of note, Urine culture was positive for MRSA at OSH.
Given lack of leukocytosis and fever, patient was thought to be colonized and was not initially treated.
On [**10-10**] pt spiked to 102.7 in setting of Levo/Flagyl/Vanc already on board, repeat CXR did not show consolidation, UA [**10-11**] improved from previous UA.
ID was consulted for further evaluation of persistent fevers in setting of ABX coverage.
Levo/Flagyl were d/c'd on [**10-12**] as no clear evidence of Asp PNA/no consolidation noted on imaging studies CXR/CT.
In setting of continual cough and poor PO intake, coumadin was discontinued and started on hep gtt for anticoagulation.
Pleural Effusion- OSH reported moderate sized pleural effusion with question of underlying infiltrate.
Follow-up pleural fluid results showed histiocytes and blood, no malignant cells.
Likely pre-renal; Sent urine lytes.
GU/Foley trauma-pt was noted to have clots in foley bag on [**10-9**], urology was consulted, pt with chronic indwelling foley for BPH changed qmonth per urologist.
During this admission foley was changed on [**10-10**] with Continuous Bladder Irrigation.
Bleeding stopped, urine clear.
Pt did not have diarrhea during this admission.
