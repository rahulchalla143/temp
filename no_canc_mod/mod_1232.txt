White matter hypodense areas can be better evaluated with MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] without and with IV contrast as these are less likely to relate to chronic small vessel occlusive disease given the patient's age.
Prominent plexus of veins in the region of the left pterygoid muscles, with one of the tributaries having a varicose appearance with a maximum dimension of 6mm but patent.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo W with no significant PMH presents with hypertensive emergency and acute pulmonary edema  CV/HTN: - Pt initially had evidence of cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on physical exam and cxr as well as LVH on EKG.
Cr was elevated at 1.1-1.3.
TTE showed moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild mitral regurgitation, elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
Workup for causes of secondary hypertension, including MRI/MRA abdomen (preliminarily negative for RAS, Pheo, other tumors), plasma metanephrines and renin/[**Male First Name (un) 2083**] levels was negative or pending at time of discharge.
Neuro: - Pt complained of vertigo, nausea and vomiting shortly after admission (immediately after begining CPAP), associated with any movement.
Physical exam was negative for any cerebellar, vestibular or proprioceptive signs.
CT head showed white matter hypodensities and prominent venous plexus in the pterygoid muscle, and follow up MRI showed no infarct, moderate small vessel disease, and no signs of hypertensive encephalopathy; MRA normal.
Neuro consult found no neurologic cause for vertigo.
