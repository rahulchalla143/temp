He had no evident dysmetria or diplopia, no dysphagia.
He took ibuprofen 800 mg with mild response.
He does not have a history of previous headaches.
His wife recalls that his headache did not improve after his emesis episodes.
He was "decorticating" with the RIGHT arm and had a LEFT facial droop.
Eventually, he developed a symptomatic bradycardia with decreased mental status (HR<40).
Once at [**Hospital1 46**], he required endotracheal intubation (received Etomidate 20 mg iv, succinylcholine 100 mg iv, versed 2 mg iv and was started on a propofol drip), given his depressed mental status.
ROS: no sick contacts, no recent trips.
He has had no fevers.
Family History: No seizures, strokes or CNS tumors.
Physical Exam: VS: 100.0F, 62 bpm, 141/ 82, on Vent: CMV FIO2 50%, RR 18, TV 500 cc, PPeak 18, PEEP 5  Gen: No evidence suggesting endocarditis or iv drug use (see below).
HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: supple, no carotid or vertebral bruitBack: No point tenderness or erythema CV: Nl S1 and S2.
Importantly, there are NO murmurs.
No masses or megalies.
Ext: no edema, no DVT data.
No splinter hemorrhages.
No lesions suggesting iv drug use.
No meningismus.
There is No gaze deviation.
No bobbing or Robbing.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
IMAGING: CT Head ([**5-15**]): IMPRESSION: Relative hypodensity with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the left occipital region and right cerebellum concerning for infarcts of indeterminate age, acute versus subacute.
Given multiple foci, embolic etiologies are included on the differential diagnosis.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Markedly abnormal appearance to the proximal V1 segment of the right vertebral artery, which demonstrates crescentic and calcified plaque at its origin and central thrombus extending over an approximately 1.5-cm segment involving the proximal vessel, with no tandem thrombus identified.
There is no specific finding to suggest dissection at this site.
This is a markedly dominant right vertebral vessel, largely supplying the basilar artery, likely accounting for the acute infarcts involving the right cerebellar hemisphere in ipsilateral PICA, and left occipital lobe in contralateral left PCA distribution.
No other significant abnormality involving the cervical vessels or those of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
MRI/MRA Brain ([**5-16**]): IMPRESSION: Extensive foci of acute infarction in posterior circulation distribution, involving bilateral thalami, occipital lobes, cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem.
Etiology likely secondary to "embolic shower" from known thrombus within the proximal V1 segment of the dominant right vertebral artery.
No hemorrhage.
Infrahilar consolidation, left greater than right, has increased since [**5-15**], could be aspiration or atelectasis.
No pleural abnormality.
CXR ([**5-18**]): The ET tube tip is relatively low, approximately 3 cm above the carina, but the patient's neck is in mild flexion, thus the position of the ET tube is at the lower limits of accepted.
There is interval significant worsening of the left upper lobe predominantly perihilar consolidation containing air bronchogram, but given its rapid progression, is consistent with aspiration.
Right basal opacity has improved since the most recent prior study consistent with partial resolution of aspiration with still present minimal atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
No overt pneumothorax is demonstrated.
Expected evolution of multiple areas of infarction involving the bilateral occipital, cerebella, thalami, right pons, and midbrain.
No areas of acute hemorrhage or hemorrhagic transformation identified.
Ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinus opacification.
MRI/MRA Brain ([**5-19**]): FINDINGS: There are multiple areas of slow diffusion which have increased in size within the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, right medial temporal lobe, bilateral thalami, and pons.
Findings are secondary to embolic phenomenon from known clot within the proximal V1 segment of the right vertebral artery.
There is a right frontal ventricular shunt with its distal end in the region of the inferior right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is persistent effacement of the fourth ventricle.
There is a left maxillary sinus air-fluid level.
There is mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.
MRA BRAIN: There is a dominant right vertebral artery.
The anterior and posterior circulations appear patent without evidence of focal stenosis or aneurysm.
There is no arteriovenous malformation.
CT Head ([**5-25**]): IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of acute intracranial process compared to prior study.
Status post removal of right frontal ventriculostomy catheter without new intracranial hemorrhage.
No significant interval change in appearance of multifocal bilateral evolving infarcts.
TEE ([**5-26**]): No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: There were no echocardiographic evidence of valvular vegetations, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect, or intracardiac thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 45 year old right handed man with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension who presented with headache and mumbling speech, and was found to have right vertebral thrombus and multiple bilateral posterior circulation strokes likely from artery to artery embolization.
He was initially taken to an outside hospital, where he had bradycardia down to the 50s and required intubation.
MRI/MRA on admission showed extensive foci of acute infarction in posterior circulation distribution, involving bilateral thalami, occipital lobes, cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem, etiology likely secondary to "embolic shower" from known thrombus within the proximal V1 segment of the dominant right vertebral artery.
He was thought to have a left PCA and right SCA infarction.
TTE showed no evidence of thrombus.
ICU COURSE: Pt was extubated on [**2140-5-17**] and was following commands with left side greater than right.
Pt was then noted to have some additional respiratory distress with fever.
On [**5-18**], the patient was found to be lethargic, was not following commands, and had absence of his gag reflex.
Patient was re-intubated, heparin gtt was discontinued, and STAT Head CT was completed which showed severe hydrocephalus secondary to posterior right SCA stroke edematous evolution and compromise of his 4th ventricle, (diameter of 5.9 mm as compared to 13mm) on [**2140-5-15**].
Repeat post-EVD Head CT showed reduced hydrocephalus.
Subsequent TEE did not show any evidence of intracardiac thrombus.

Medication Regular insulin sliding scale   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY Thrombus in right vertebral artery Bilateral posterior circulation strokes, left PCA and right SCA territory Cerebral edema s/p EVD Pneumonia  SECONDARY Hypertension Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Fluent aphasia, does not look completely to the right with either eye, cannot adduct right eye, smile symmetric, does not use the right side as spontaneously as the left but full strength   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with headache and speech changes, and were initially taken to an outside hospital where you were intubated.
You were found to have a blood clot in your right vertebral artery which caused multiple strokes in your posterior brain.
You subsequently became more lethargic and were found to have increased brain swelling, so neurosurgery placed an external ventricular drain.
If you develop headache, weakness/numbness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP or return to the ED.
