Admission Date:  [**2139-12-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-12-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-12-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Imipenem  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**] Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presents for evaluation of persistent pneumonia and the possibility of a bronchoesophageal fistula.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2139-12-15**] - flexible bronchoscopy  [**2139-12-16**] - Flexible bronchoscopy; bronchography to evaluate for a fistula; esophagogastroduodenoscopy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 75989**] is an unfortunate 71-year-old institutionalized patient who several decades ago underwent the distal esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy with reconstruction low in the left chest.
He was recently transferred to this institution for management of what appears to be a mediastinal fluid collection with possible communications with both the airway and GI tract.
Past Medical History: PMH: GERD, chronic aspiration, paraesophageal hernia, hypothyroidism, HTN, Depression, hepatitis, hearing loss, C-diff   PSH: Gastrectomy, partial esophagectomy w/gastric pull through and pyloroplasty, CCY  Social History: non contributory  Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: See physical chart, patient expired while in the hospital  Pertinent Results: CT Chest [**2139-12-12**] - Heterogeneous left thorax fluid collection and air extending laterally to the pleural surface could be compatible with a bronchogastric fistula possibly extending to the pleural space.
[**12-13**] - tube feeds started, transfused one unit of RBC  [**12-15**] - d/c vancomycin, continued mechanical ventilation, abx, tube feeds,  [**12-16**] - underwent the above procedure where the patient began having massive gastrointestinal bleeding from the site of the esophageal ulcer.
At this point, the flexible bronchoscope was withdrawn and attempts were made to control the GI bleeding with ice-cold saline.
The patient became hypotensive on the operating table and required IV fluids and blood products for resuscitation.
Surgical options for control of the GI bleed were discussed, but the opinion was that there were no clear surgical options available at that point.
The patient eventually succombed to the bleeding and expired.
