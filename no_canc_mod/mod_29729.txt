Admission Date:  [**2119-11-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-11-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-7-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Back pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 yo woman with a h/o DM, MS, HTN and frequent UTIs [**2-8**] chronic foley who presented "not feeling well."
She states that three nights prior to admission, she experienced severe back pain which is one of her UTI symptoms.
In the ED, she was found to have an elevated lactate and she was started on the sepsis protocol.
Her recent history is significant for asymptomatic bullae on her B LE and itch papules on her B UE for the past two months.
She felt her lesions improved somewhat with the prednisone but have not resolved completely.
On arrival to the ICU, she denied chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, abd pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, fevers or chills.
She has some back pain and pain in her lower legs.
She denies any pain, dyspnea, nausea, or diarrhea.
Diabetes Type II.
MS, 3 prior episodes of transverse myelitis.
Diabetic sensory motor neuropathy.
Depression and anxiety.
Hypothyroidism 8.
Recent diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid.
Family History: Positive history of diabetes in her parents and sister.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, OP clear Neck: Supple, no LAD, no JVD CV: regular, tachy, 3/6 systolic murmur at RUSB Chest: clear, no wheezes Abd: +BS, soft, tender to deep palpation in bilateral lower quadrants Ext: no edema, 2+ DP, sensation intact bilaterally Skin: Upper extremities: multiple small round erosions with surrounding scale.
Lower extremities (primarily knees, pre-tibial area): multiple 1-3 cm erosions, some with hemorrhagic crusts.
No target lesions, no oral lesions.
Labs at discharge: wbc 6.7, hct 31.1, plt 206 Na 140, K 3.5, Cl 103, HCO3 29, BUN 12, Cr 1.0, glucose 93  Microbiology: [**11-6**] Urine culture: 10-100,000 Klebsiella pneumoniae with the following sensitivity findings: AMPICILLIN/SULBACTAM--  =>32 R CEFAZOLIN-------------  =>64 R CEFEPIME--------------   <=1 S CEFTAZIDIME-----------  =>64 R CEFTRIAXONE-----------     8 S CEFUROXIME------------  =>64 R CIPROFLOXACIN---------   =>4 R GENTAMICIN------------  =>16 R IMIPENEM--------------   <=1 S LEVOFLOXACIN----------   =>8 R MEROPENEM-------------<=0.25 S NITROFURANTOIN--------   128 R PIPERACILLIN/TAZO-----    64 I TOBRAMYCIN------------     8 I TRIMETHOPRIM/SULFA----  =>16 R [**11-8**] Urine culture: No growth.
[**11-6**] Blood culture: No growth.
It is unclear whether this is secondary to artifact or could represent an area of focal pyelonephritis.
There is no evidence of renal abscess.
There is no evidence of intraabdominal abscess.
Atelectatic changes of the lungs.
Hypodense subcentimeter cortical lesions in the left kidney too small to be characterized.
There is no hydronephrosis.
No evidence of acute intracranial pathology including no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or enhancing lesions.
Multiple extra-axial calcified nodules most likely representing calcified meningiomas.
[**11-10**] EEG: This EEG is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.
No evidence of ongoing or potential seizures is seen at this time.
Subepidermal bulla formation with associated papillary dermal lymphohistiocytic and eosinophilic infiltrate and abundant interstitial eosinophils, consistent with bullous pemphigoid, see note.
The overall findings are consistent with a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid; clinical correlation is suggested to exclude a drug-related etiology.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old woman with a history of Multiple sclerosis, DM, HTN, and frequent UTIs due to a chronic indwelling Foley catheter who presented with a presumed urosepsis.
Urosepsis: She has a history of chronic UTIs, up to twice per month that are thought to be due to her indwelling Foley catheter.
On admission she had stable hemodynamics but had an elevated lactate and was admitted to the ICU under the sepsis protocol.
Her urine culture eventually grew positive for a highly resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia.
In addition, abdominal CT scans were performed which did not reveal any anatomic abnormality in the urinary tract or any evidence of pyelonephritis (the suspicion of pyelonephritis seen on the [**11-10**] study was thought to be due to artifact).
She thus completed a 10 day course of IV antibiotics and was not discharged on any antibiotic prophylaxis as she has a history of highly resistant organisms.
She should have her Foley catheter changed weekly under sterile conditions to try to prevent future urinary tract infections.
Delirium: In the middle of her hospitalization she was noted to become agitated and delirious alternating between becoming quite somnolent and delirious with confusion, agitation, and perseveration.
Eventually her mental status cleared and she was again alert and oriented, conversant, and able to follow directions.
Thus it was thought that her delirium was most likely medication induced.
Her metformin was held initially due to an elevated creatinine and was not restarted during her hospitalization.
Bullous pemphigoid: She was seen by the dermatology service while hospitalized and a punch biopsy was consistent with bullous pemphigoid.
On this regimen her blisters and erosions over her bilateral knees slowly began to resolve.
