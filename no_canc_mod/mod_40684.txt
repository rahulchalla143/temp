HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old Russian-speaking gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, status post LAD stent on [**3-2**].
His history is also significant for CHF exacerbation secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, an EF of less than 30% with 2+ mitral regurg.
On admission, he presented through EMS with a complaint of unremitting 10/10 chest pain associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis.
EKG revealed an A-paced rhythm with left bundle branch pattern at a rate of 65.
There were no changes from previous studies.
Prior to this, he required intubation due to worsening dyspnea from pulmonary edema.
CHF with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Coronary artery disease, status post cardiac cath in [**2186**] and [**3-2**].
DDD pacemaker for bradycardia in the [**2187**].
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post aortic bifem bypass.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Cardiac echo from [**2201-7-27**] showed a mildly dilated LA, normal left ventricular wall thickness, mild decreased left ventricular function apically inferior, and inferolateral.
Septal akinesis with midseptal hypokinesis.
Moderately dilated aortic root.
A 2+ mitral regurg.
Cardiac cath results from [**2201-8-21**] - selective coronary angiography with a left dominant system revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had mild in-stent restenosis of approximately 30%.
There was reversal of flow seen in the septal perforating branches and mild diffuse disease in the mid-LAD.
The first diagonal branch had an ostial 95% stenosis which had been seen on a previous catheterization.
The second diagonal branch had midluminal irregularities.
The left circumflex coronary artery had mild plaquing proximally with luminal irregularities extending into the first obtuse marginal branch.
The second obtuse marginal was diffusely diseased with a 90% stenosis in the more basal branch.
The large acute marginal branch had no significant stenosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right-sided filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 25 mmHg and an RV-EDP of 44 mmHg.
Left-sided filling pressures were severely elevated with a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 mmHg.
In the CCU, the patient was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure to the 60s.
2) CARDIAC RHYTHM:  The patient has a questionable history of atrial fibrillation and was continued on amiodarone throughout the admission.
There was a moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
There was a very small pericardial effusion.
4) PULMONARY:  The patient with respiratory impairment secondary to pulmonary edema.
Successfully extubated on [**2201-8-22**] ended well with little to no oxygen requirement.
5) RENAL:  The patient has chronic renal insufficiency.
Also a history of depression and apathy.
The patient had many episodes of agitation during the hospitalization.
Myocardial infarction, status post cardiac catheterization.
Congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Coronary artery disease.
Symptomatic bradycardia with DDD pacer placement.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic back pain.
