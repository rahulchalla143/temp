([**Numeric Identifier 105335**])         Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo woman with PMH of DMII , Mitral valve replacement not on coumadin , HTN , CVA [**2151**] with R sided hemiparesis, admitted for NKHOS, with rapid afib, large [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] clot, hypotension, and RLL PNA.
# NKHOS: Pt with BS over 1000 on admission w/ new diagnosis of diabetes - HA1C was 14.
No metabolic acidosis.
# thrombocytopenia - Pt had a left atrial clot seen on ECHO during this admission and was started on heparin drip.
Had previous exposure to heparin; given time frame and prior exposure, concerning for HIT type 2.
#RLL PNA - infiltrate seen on CXR, and pt had leukocytosis (19.1); pt afebrile.
She is breathing comfortably on room air and denies cough or other discomfort.
# Rapid afib/CV - Pt has a history of this, but now has large [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] clot on echo.
She was also noted to have a severely depressed EF by echo, without previous hx cardiomyopathy.
# Hypotension - likely due to AFib with poor EF - SBP in 90s.
# UTI - Pt has history of recurrent UTIs.
Growing E. coli in urine collected at admission; pan sensitive.
# CVA -Pt has old L CVA w/ R sided deficits.
Pt notes that these findings are consistent w/ previous infarct.
# Acute Renal failure: pt had elevated creatinine 1.5 and GFR of 32 at admission which was attributed to pre-renal process.
# FEN: diabetic diet, repleted lytes, IVF as needed .
# Access- PICC [**1-12**] and peripheral IV .
