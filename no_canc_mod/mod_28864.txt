Irregular triangular-shaped ACOM aneurysm measuring 5 mm at its dome with a narrow neck, likely the source of the subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the occipital horns, likely from redistribution.
Multifocal areas of intracranial arterial narrowing including the left ACA A1 segment, both MCAs, the right posterior communicating artery, and the right PCA.
Enlarged ventricles relative to the [**2107**] baseline, though stable from the recent prior study, compatible with communicating hydrocephalus.

On [**2112-10-30**] after the initial dilantin load the patient had a focal motor seizure.
He was given 1mg of ativan and a second dilantin load with resolution of seizure activity.
The patient had persistent lethargy after 2 hours and STAT head CT demonstrated interval increase in ventricular size.
On [**2112-10-31**] the patient underwent diagnostic cerebral angiogram with coil embolization of anterior communicating artery aneurysm under general anesthesia.
[**2112-11-3**] patient had persistant fevers.
Dopplers of the lower extremities revealed right lower extremity DVT for which he had an IVC filter placed as he was not a candidate for anticoagulation due to SAH and EVD.
On [**11-4**] his EEG showed R temporal slowing which could be consistent with vasospasm; and on exam the patient was noted to be weaker on the LUE.
He underwent a repeat cerebral angiogram on [**11-4**] which showed no evidence of vasospasm.
On [**11-4**] and [**11-7**], pt experienced right UE shaking/tremors and Neurology was consulted for recommendations on antiseizure medications in the setting of possible seizures with a therapeutic dilantin level.
EEG however showed no seizure activity.
At neurology's recommendation he was transitioned to Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
CSF was sent for culture on [**11-7**] for fever to 103.
Central line was exchanged on [**11-7**] for persistent fevers.
Pt underwent Cerebral angiogram on [**2112-11-8**] for worsening mental status and left leg weakness.
Angiogram showed only mild vasospasm and intra-arterial verapamil was injected to bilateral ICAs and the left vertebral artery.
Patient remained intubated postoperatively because of increased secreations.
On [**11-15**] he was started on Zosyn and Vancomycin for suspected aspiration pneumonia noted on his CXR.
[**11-15**] eve his exam worsened, he exhibited increased respiratory effort and he was intubated and underwent a bronch.
