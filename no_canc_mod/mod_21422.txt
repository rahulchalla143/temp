Atrial fibrillation.
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year-old gentleman with a history of rheumatic heart disease, who underwent an AVR, MVR, MAZE procedure on [**2150-3-12**] without significant complication in his postoperative course.
He was found to be hypotensive at the time and in rapid atrial fibrillation.
It was felt that his rapid atrial fibrillation was the cause of his hypotension.
His INR was markedly elevated at 6.0 and his BUN and creatinine were 34 and 1.6.
The patient's initial chest x-ray showed low lung volumes, ill-defined bibasilar opacities, which were thought to represent consolidation and presence of cardiomegaly.
Given his clinical scenario, it was felt prudent to obtain an echocardiogram to rule out tamponade or pericardial effusion, responsible for his hypotension and his acute renal insufficiency.
He did undergo this echocardiogram which revealed presence of significant pericardial effusion, although there was no evidence of pericardial tamponade.
Therefore, he was transferred to the cardiac surgery service and taken to the operating room on [**2150-3-24**] at which time he had a pericardial window created and evacuation of his pericardial effusion.
Notably preoperatively, the patient had markedly elevated transaminases with an ALT of 1139 and an AST of 1415 with a normal total bilirubin and normal alkaline phosphatase, amylase and lipase.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained on our service and didn't show any evidence of biliary tract obstructions.
It was felt that this may have been secondary to cardiogenic etiology and congestion.
He had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation postoperatively which required starting Amiodarone.
By the time he was ready for discharge, though, his rate was controlled with a blood pressure in the 100/60's and rate of 80 to 90 and atrial fibrillation.
To note, the patient developed an increase in oxygen requirement towards the latter part of his hospitalization and chest x-ray showed accumulation of a large right pleural effusion.
A pig-tail drain was placed in this effusion and approximately 2.2 liters of old blood and serous fluid were drained.
By hospital day number 11, as the patient had been afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically normal with rate controlled atrial fibrillation and lungs clear to auscultation on examination, it was felt that he could be discharged to home in stable condition.
His transaminase, as noted, had normalized and his chest x-ray showed the presence of no significant effusion and he only had small apical pneumothoraces which had been stable.
To note, he was treated empirically with Vancomycin and levofloxacin throughout his hospitalization for the question of infection of his pericardial effusion, given that his white blood cell count was elevated.
