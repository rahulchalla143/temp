This is compatible with a small area of ischemia.
There is no evidence of large territorial ischemia or infarction.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
There are areas of increased FLAIR signal in the periventricular and subcortical white matter that likely represent changes from chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy.
The intracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries and their major branches appear normal without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.
IMPRESSION: Subcentimeter diffusion abnormality in the subcortical white matter of the left temporal lobe compatible with a small area of ischemia.
(Transthoracic echocardiography not adequate to assess for atrial appendage thrombus).
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50-55 %).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No cardiac source of embolus identified other than atrial fibrillation.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old right handed man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presents for evaluation following acute speech arrest.
Initial evaluation at [**Hospital1 **] was concerning for aphasia and right sided weakness.
Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] where he had a mild right pronator drift and a brisk patellar reflex, but otherwise his neurologic exam was normal.
CT head was without evidence of prior infarct or small vessle disease.
It is possible that he was acutely hypercoaguable in the setting of this medication change and recent surgery, this may also be considered aspirin failure or due to his atrial fibrillatiojn.
MRI/MRA showed subcentimeter diffusion abnormality in the subcortical white matter of the left temporal lobe compatible with a small area of ischemia and nil on MRA.
Echo showed mildly depressed LC function EF 5-0-55% and mildly dilated ascending aorta, no source of embolus.
Given his altered lipid profile Simvastatin dose was raised to 40 mg qd.
There it was noticed you also had weakness on the right side of your body.
A CT scan was negative for bleeding so you received tPa to disolve the cloat that was causing your stroke.
This was successful since your symptoms resolved in less than 2 hours.
At admission you still presented slight weakness on your right arm but this resolved as well as your other symptoms.
Your MRI showed a small infarct (stroke) on the subcortical area of the left temporal lobe.
It is possible that this stroke was due to your recent medication change and surgery or to your atrial fibrillation.
If you present a similar event, weakness, sensation deficit or any other neurological deficit you should consult at the Emergency Department inmediately.
