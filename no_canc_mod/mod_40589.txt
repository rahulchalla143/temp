She was stated to be in her normal state of health until about 3 weeks ago when after a friends death she was noted to have bouts of confusion and a glossy look.
She has been evaluated at [**Hospital **] hospital for this several times including an inpatient admission for several days.
There were no abnormal movements noted.
Having had her atenolol recently changed she thought it was low blood sugar but her neighbor measure her bP noting SBP in the 140's and a normal blood sugar level.
She also had fecal incontinence.
She had a CT scan and unfortunately we do not have today's images but the read stated a left thalamic bleed with early vasogenic edema measuring 2cm with IV extension.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
MRA/MRI/MRV: Stable foci of hemorrhage in the left thalamus and right frontoparietal lobe.
Abnormal signal in the right thalamus has progressed since the MRI from [**2110-10-4**].
There is poor visualization of the straight sinus and the internal cerebral veins.
Unchanged bilateral thalamic edema with left thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, and right posterior parietal deep white matter hemorrhage likely secondary to venous sinus thrombosis.
Nonocclusive thrombus in the superior sagittal sinus.
CT Torso:  Focal saccular aneurysmal dilatation of the mid descending thoracic aorta measuring 3.2 x 2.3 x 6.0 cm.
Hypoattenuating lesion in the caudate lobe, likely a simple cyst but with mixed attenuation values likely due to its small size.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No evidence of pneumonia.
No pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
Prior to this event, her family describes a course of 3 weeks during which she would have intermittent periods of confusion and a "glossy look".
She had an episode of vomitting and fecal incontinence, and subsequently EMS was called.
- She was seen and staffed by our stroke attending [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1693**] who on his exam, was able to identify skew deviation and small pupils.
She received an MRV and CTV which revealed evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis for which she was initiated on IV heparin therapy (see images below).
Later, she had an episode of hypoxia and tachypnea that did not respond to positive pressure ventilation.
- The cause for reintubation is thought to be [**3-19**] volume overload.
- Following her reintubation, she did receive IV diuresis aggressively, but this was briefly held secondary to an episode of hypotension that occurred over the weekend which was transient and responded quickly to a bolus of fluids.
She remains mildly tachypneic at baseline (25-30) and mildly hypoxic (92-94%) on humidified tent.
- A BAL performed on [**2110-10-25**] subsequently grew out Coag positive Staph Aureus and moraxella catarrhalis.
She did however have an aneurysm discovered on that scan which was not intervened on.
She was kept on Nafcillin+Cipro for her ventilator aquired pneumonia, and completed her course on [**11-3**].
Her fluid status was kept at net negative and she was diuresed with 40 mg Lasix due to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
She remains mildly tachypneic at baseline (25-30) and mildly hypoxic (92-94%) on humidified tent, and is kept on CPAP.
She will also need her creatinine monitored to ensure that it continues to trend down with increased oral intake.
She will need her volume status monitored to ensure that she does not get fluid overloaded, and to determine if she needs lasix.
