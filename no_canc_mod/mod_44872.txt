No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
CT HEAD [**2111-5-17**] FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or large acute territorial infarction.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities likely reflect sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic change.
There are nonspecific foci of air in the right masticator space and surrounding the right pterygoid plate.
No fracture or soft tissue stranding is seen.
No acute intracranial process.
Nonspecific foci of air in the right masticator space and surrounding the right pterygoid plate without adjacent stranding or overlying fracture.
Correlate clinically for trauma to this location or less likely infection.
Ileal loop with wall thickening and vascular engorgement consistent with enteritis (infectious, ischemic or inflammatory).
EKG [**2111-5-19**]: Atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction 117bpm no Q wave in aVF ST-T wave changes.
Aside from atrial flutter unchanged from prior [**2077-10-23**] .
FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2111-5-22**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2111-5-22**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
FECAL CULTURE - R/O VIBRIO (Final [**2111-5-22**]):    NO VIBRIO FOUND.
FECAL CULTURE - R/O YERSINIA (Final [**2111-5-22**]):    NO YERSINIA FOUND.
Brief Hospital Course: A [**Age over 90 **] year old russian speaking female with PMH dementia, collagenous colitis, ITP hypertension admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and hypotension in the setting of acute gastroenteritis.
# Atrial flutter: Patient admitted with tachycardia to 130's EKG showed atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction vs AVNRT.
Tachycardia resumed and EKG showed atrial fibrillation/flutter.
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
ECHO showed LVEF >55% and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
She was increased on her dose of metoprolol and started on digoxin on [**2111-5-21**], both of which she should continue, but her rate did not respond nor did her rhythm get out of atrial flutter.
# Diarrhea and vomiting: Patient admitted with diarrhea x 2 days and reported that there has been an outbreak of diarrhea at [**Hospital 100**] rehab.
She was complaining of lower abdominal pain and CT abdomen is consistent with enteritis.
Differential included norovirus, c. diff, pathogenic e. coli shigella etc.
Comibination of leukocytosis, fever, labiale blood pressure suggested septic physiology.
Though she has a history of colitis, she reported that the symptoms were more severe than previous bouts of colitis.
As of 2 days prior to discharge, her diarrhea resolved, and she is having normal stools.
Related to poor right heart filling pressures in the setting of sepsis and gastrointestinal loss from diarrhea and vomiting.
Her blood pressure was labile in the setting of tachyarrythmia and improved with improved rate control.
# Agitation: On admission patient was confused, stating that she was in the "men's room" and was pulling at lines and climbing out of bed.
She has baseline dementia, agitation and confusion were believed to be related to sun-downing versus decompensation in the setting of acute infection.
The following morning she appeared more lucid and oriented however became agitated again on the evening of HD 2.
# Anemia: Patient with history of collagenous colitis and is no longer taking asacol, stool was guiac positive suggesting GI source of anemia.
# Thrombocytopenia: At baseline with a history of ITP.
# Facial bruising: patient has had recent Mohs surgery for basal cell carcinoma and has resulting bruising.
Head CT in the ED was negative for acute process.
# Collagenous Colitis: former patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and treated with asacol.
Present GI symptoms are more severe than past flares of colitis.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial flutter Gastroenteritis Delirium  Secondary: Dementia Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura Hypertension History of collagenous colitis  Discharge Condition: Mental status: alert and oriented Level of consciousness: clear and coherent Activity status: ambulatory with assist (fall precautions)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with gastroenteritis, which has resolved with a course of antibiotics.
You were found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid heart rate which has not resolved with medications.
You should also have follow-up evaluation of an incidental pulmonary nodule in [**7-19**] months.
