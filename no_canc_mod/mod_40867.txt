A punctate calcification in the right lower lobe in the region of atelectasis probably represents a calcified granuloma.
No pericardial effusion is present.
No free fluid is seen in the abdomen.
There is no definite lymphadenopathy on this non-IV contrast examination.
No free fluid is seen in the pelvis.
There is nondependent air and a Foley in the bladder.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
No intra or extraaxial hemorrhages are identified.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 49 y/o M with HIV, h/o depression and polysubstance abuse now now intubated for airway protection, somnolence.
1) Unresponsiveness - most likely secondary to overdose of unclear amount and type of substances.
Arrived hypotensive to ED but no clear source of infection with neg UA and poor CXR initially with subsequent CXR with no evidence of PNA, no focal s/sx per initial ED note.
Likely that hypotension secondary to OD.
2) Hypercapnic resp failure- intubated for airway protection, no evidence on CXR or O2 sats of respiratory distress or pulmonary pathology/infection, no sig A-A gradient.
No problems oxygenating.
3) Hypotension - could likely be secondary to dehydration given acute increase in BUN/creat.
No further volume resucitation needed.
4) Acute renal insuff - Improved with fluids.
Likely was pre-renal in setting of hypotension.
Serum tox screen neg for TCA overdose.
7) Anemia - Hct decreased from baseline, could be dilutional secondary to fluid repletion.
Macrocytic anemia could likely be secondary to HIV, alcoholism.
