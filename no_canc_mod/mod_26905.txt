Most recent head     ulrasound was on [**2148-12-26**] showing almost resolved     bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhages.
Ophthalmology:  Last eye exam screening for     retinopathy of prematurity was performed on [**2148-12-10**],     showing immature retinas to zone 3, on [**12-30**] he was mature     ou and no signs of retinopathy.
