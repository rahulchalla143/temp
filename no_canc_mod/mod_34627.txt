no olds for comparison.
Low-lying endotracheal tube.
Moderate pulmonary edema.
No acute fracture or malalignment is detected.
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or malalignment.
CT Head: FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus or evidence of major territorial infarct is apparent.
There is a 3-mm focal calcification in the left periventricular white matter.
No acute fracture is identified.
There is mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Cardiac Catheterization: 1- Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated no angiographically-apparent coronary artery disease.
2- The RCA had a high takeoff and required an AL1 catheter for selective engagement.
3- Limited resting hemodynamic assesment revealed normal sustemic arterial pressure (108/57 mmHg) and mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures (LVEDP 15 mmHg post LV-gram).
4- Left ventriculography revealed normal systolic function (LVEF 60%) and no mitral regurgitation.
Marked apical hypertrophy with cavity obliteration was noted suggestive of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
APical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2178-3-24**] 8:34 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-17**], there has been placement of a ICD with its tip in the general area of the apex of the right ventricle.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
No acute pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: ICD placement with no pneumothorax.
ST segment depressions and T wave inversions in leads V3-V6.
Left atrial abnormality.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Left atrial abnormality is evident.
The Q-T interval is slightly prolonged.
Non-specific low amplitude T waves in leads I and V4.
Non-specific ST segment depressions and low amplitude T waves in  leads II, III and V4-V6.
Extensive ST-T wave abnormalities.
ST segment depressions might represent ischemia.
T wave inversions in leads I, aVL and V2-V6 suggest the possibility of anterior and lateral ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-3-13**] no diagnostic interval change.
ECG Study Date of [**2178-3-20**]  7:49:58 AM Normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial contractions.
Left atrial abnormality.
Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2178-3-15**] no diagnostic interval change.
ECG Study Date of [**2178-3-26**]  11:02:52 AM Sinus bradycardia Left ventricular hypertrophy Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - may be in part left ventricular hypertrophy and possible ischemia Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2178-3-20**], atrial ectopy absent and further ST-T wave changes seen  Brief Hospital Course: # Vfib Arrest: The patient had a Vfib arrest of unknown origin.
He was initially cooled x 24 hours for neural protection and paralyzed with cisatracuronium.
he presented with elevated CKs with a mild troponin leak suggestive of possible NSTEMI.
However, as this occurred in the context of chest compressions and shock, and the patients had negative MBs, tirofiban and heparin were discontinued.
Cardiac cath did not reveal significant coronary artery disease.
After extubation, the patient developed a pneumonia, for which he was treated with bactrim.
After resolution of his pneumonia he had an ICD placed by EP.
# respiratory status: Patient was initially intubated during resuscitation for his Vfib arrest.
After extubation, he developed a pneumonia with  coagulase positive staph aureus in his sputum, sensitive to bactrim.
He was treated with bactrim for this, and remained afebrile once treatment began.
# Mental status: Initially, the patient had poor mental status and neurological exam after extubation.
There was a concern the the patient has suffered anoxic brain injury.
head CT did not reveal any acute intracranial process.

Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA of Greater [**Hospital1 189**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Ventricular Fibrillation [**Last Name (un) 51827**] abnormality (cardiac apical hypertrophy) Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after being found down and unresponsive, secondary to an arrythmia called ventricular fibrillation.
During hospitalization, you were found to have a cardiomyopathy which may have precipitated this arrythmia.
You received an ICD, which will hopefully prevent this rhythm from causing future loss of consciousness.
If any unsafe situation arises, please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77975**] or return to the emergency department.
