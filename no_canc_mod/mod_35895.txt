Admission Date:  [**2115-10-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-11-12**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amiodarone / Mevacor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**] Chief Complaint: BRBPR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: upper GI endoscopy colonoscopy  History of Present Illness: 87 yo M with diverticular disease, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, afib on coumadin (frequently supratherapeutic), VT s/p ICD recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab after hospital course for lower back pain and hypoxia now returns with BRBPR and increased confusion and agitation at rehab.
He does not increased length of palpitations, but no ICD firing.
No hemetemesis or coffee ground emesis.
Question of MI in past 3.
Hypercholestreolemia 4.
HTN 5.
Hypothyroidism 6.
Lumbar disc disease 7.
Atrial fibrillation- Pt is anticoagulated on coumadin.
Basal cell carcinoma excisions 9.
Hypercholesterolemia 13.
Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor 15.
Admitted following a fall in [**1-/2114**] - felt [**1-11**] orthostatic hypotension 16.
Family History: [**Name (NI) 1094**] mother had rheumatic fever and a CVA.
No family history of CAD he is aware of.
No scleral icterus.
Bilateral hearing aids.
No lesions in the oropharynx.
No carotid bruits.
Venous stasis changes bilat.
RECTAL (Night of admission): frank blood in rectal vault.
Pertinent Results: EKG: irreg, irreg, 120bpm, nl axis, QTc 392, LVH, <1mm ST depressions in II, AVF, V3-6, TWI laterally (all old compared to prior on [**2115-10-13**]).
PERTINENT STUDIES: - [**2110**] Colonoscopy: normal colon - [**2109**] EGD: Small hiatal hernia; Barrett's esophagus (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum - [**1-/2114**]: P-MIBI: normal - [**11/2113**] ECHO: EF 65%, no AS, AI, trace MR .
CXR [**10-25**]: New perihilar left more than right and lower lobe opacities.
Differential diagnosis would include asymmetric pulmonary edema or aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 y/o M w/ h/o afib on coumadin, VT s/p ICD, htn who presented with GIB.
On the floor, patient suffered a PEA arrest on [**10-31**] and was transferred back to the MICU.
During his MICU course he had a large bleed into his R thigh presumably secondary to a femoral line placement.
He had persistent respiratory failure and inability to wean from the vent.
He denied any subjective shortness of breath or discomfort.
Please see below for more detailed description of hispital course prior to MICU transfer following PEA arrest.
On [**10-24**], he had several small melenotic stools.
GI was consulted and performed EGD and colonoscopy, which showed diverticulae in right colon, EGD negative.
He was diuresed and he also developed some worsening mental status changes.
On [**10-31**] he had a witnessed PEA arrest and was returned to the MICU.
While in the MICU, he had a further Hct drop while on heparin gtt and was found to have a large hematoma in his R groin.
# respiratory failure: peri-arrest ABG suggested hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Unclear cause of hypercarpia.
No sedating meds.
Pt has baseline mild restriction but not severe obstruction.
Large aspiration event during arrest and subsequent ARDS could explain.
But [**1-11**] likely PNA and trauma from code.
He was unable to wean from the vent throughout his MICU course requiring high levels of pressure support.
# PEA arrest: unclear cause.
Evidence of hyperkalemia, hypercarbia, and acidosis peri-arrest.
# hypotension peri-arrest: likely secondary to loss of spontaneous circulation during code.
No obvious evidence of sepsis.
No evidence of hemothorax or pneumothorax.
Brief pressor requirement quickly weaned off.
Likely some cardiogenic component following arrest.
# Neuro: delerium prior to code.
No obvious focal abnormalities on exam except for diminished withdrawal in LUE.
Carotid stenosis predisposes to cerebral hypoperfusion.
# Cardiac: :: Rhythm: in atrial fibrillation.
Also has a history of VT s/p failed ablation and ICD placement.
Likely diastolic dysfunction.
No evidence of ischemia.
He was continued on his AF treatment as well as his hypertensive regimen.
:: CAD: Had a documented h/o MI but no evidence of prior infarct on ECG and no wall motion abnormalities on ECHO.
# PNA: Pt w/ previous hospitalization for hypoxia, unclear etiology despite w/u with CTA (neg PE, but showed ground glass opacities).
# Glaucoma: continued on eye drops .
