He was also found to be anemia to Hct of 30 with his last checked Hct 41.6 six years prior with anemia labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
He remained hypotensive at 81/46, so he was started on Levophed 0.2.
He was given Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Decadron as he was initially alert and oriented x3 but tangential in thought for concern for meningitis.
Past Medical History: Coronary artery disease s/p cardiac cath in [**2175**] Hypertension Chronic renal insufficiency Hyperlipidemia Benign prostatic hyperplasia Insomnia  Social History: Patient is a former smoker, quit at age 42.
Used to drink beer or wine twice daily but has not drank for a month due to fatigue.

Faint pulmonary ground-glass opacities may represent atypical infection or small airways inflammation.
Bilateral adrenal nodules.
Severe atherosclerotic disease, with likely high-grade stenosis of the left renal artery origin.
Small fusiform dilatation of infrarenal aorta.
Small hypoattenuating renal lesions, too small to characterize by CT criteria.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Mild subpleural inter- and intra-septal thickening with lower lobe predominance but without honeycombing, raising suspicion for interstitial lung disease such as NSIP or early UIP.
MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR (80-90% CELLULAR) MYELOID DOMINANT BONE MARROW WITH DYSERYTHROPOIESIS AND DYSMEGAKARYOPOIESIS, SEE NOTE 1.
INCREASED IRON STORES WITH DECREASED SIDEROBLAST SUGGESTIVE OF ANEMIA OF INFLAMMATORY BLOCK.
MILD PLASMACYTOSIS, SEE NOTE 2.
NOTE 1: In a patient with cytopenias, the marrow findings of hypercellularity and dyspoiesis raise the possibility of involvement by a myelodysplastic process.
Please correlate with clinical findings to exclude other secondary causes of marrow insults which may lead to dyspoietic changes; suggest follow-up and repeat biopsy, if cytopenia persists in the absence of identifiable secondary causes.
Plasma cells are 3% of aspirate differential and 10-15% of marrow core biopsy cellularity by CD138 staining.
However, by immunoglobulin light chain staining, plasma cells appear polytypic with a slight lambda predominance, and morphologic findings diagnostic of a plasma cell myeloma are not seen in material evaluated.
CT HEAD [**2184-3-13**] IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage, edema, or evidence of acute process.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a promient fat pad.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2176-3-18**], posterior wall hypokinesis cannot be definitively identified.
RIGHT TEMPORAL ARTERY BIOPSY [**2184-3-18**]: Temporal artery with intimal hyperplasia.
No arteritis seen.
MRI Brain and Pituitary [**2184-3-21**] IMPRESSION: - Multiple punctate bifrontal and left parietal acute embolic infarcts, without significant mass effect or associated shift of midline structures.
- Left mastoid opacification.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old man who presented with one month of fatigue and FUO.
Patient underwent an extensive fever workup for hematologic, infectious, rheumatologic, and endocrine sources, none of which revealed a definitive diagnosis.
The patient developed altered mental status during the admission; imaging of the head demonstrated multiple acute embolic infarcts.
A TTE/TEE showed no evidence of vegetations.
No other cause for thromboembolic phenomena was identified.
The patient's neurological status continued to decline on the floor, and he became tachypneic / dyspneic but remained stable on oxygen.
During one night of admission on the floor, the patient became acutely unresponsive and was found to be asystolic.
Following rewarming, the patient remained unresponsive and with a persistent vasopressor requirement.
Repeat MRI brain was suggestive of watershed infarcts possibly sustained during cardiac arrest.
