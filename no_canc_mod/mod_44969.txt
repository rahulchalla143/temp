The results will be followed up by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] or his coverage.
In regard to her pancrease and the abnormal level noted on [**4-29**] a repeat lipase level was checked and was only 14.
Likely the elevated level of 258 was an error as it was an isolated event and amylase also was within normal limits at that time.
Her urine output has been marginal on the evening prior to discharge, but her chem 7 is stable and the patient is very thirsty.
She is having no urinary symptoms at this time.
