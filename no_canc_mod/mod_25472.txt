PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Again seen is a small left apical pneumothorax.
Low lung volumes limit assessment.
There is no pulmonary edema.
Persistent retrocardiac opacification suggests atelectasis/left lower lobe collapse.
Haziness at the left base suggests persistent small left pleural effusion.
Aortic valve disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
Left ventricular function.
Mitral valve disease.
Right ventricular function.

No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Conclusions Prebypass  No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post bypass  Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
There is no aortic insufficiency.
Mild mitral regurgitation persists.
On [**10-6**] she had a TEE to rule out for clot and evaluate aortic stenosis.
She received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.
Chest tubes and Epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day two and chest x-ray after removal showed small right apical pneumothorax.
Coumadin was resumed for her history of Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
