Admission Date:  [**2170-9-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-9-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left heart catheterization: Performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2170-9-11**]  History of Present Illness: This is an 88yoF with h/o dementia who intially presented to BIDN with chest pain after a mechanical fall and c/f STEMI, now transferred for acute hypoxia requiring intubation.
Patient is currently unable to provide a history, but per BIDN records on the DOA she had an unwitnessed mechanical fall at home (her 2nd in 2 days), and while being transported to BIDN by granddaughter c/o chest pain.
In the [**Location (un) 620**] ED she received a plavix load, full dose ASA, heparin and beta blockers and she was noted to be slightly bradycardic thereafter.
On the morning of [**9-9**] the patient beame agitated and hypertensive (SBP 180's), shortly thereafter she became hypoxemic (O2 sats as low as 68%) she failed 100% non-rebreather and BiPAP, and was intubated [**2-21**] work of breathing and failure to protect her airway.
No known cardiac history.
No h/o HTN, HLD, or DM.
Family History: No known h/o cardiac disease.
Sclera anicteric.
CARDIAC: RRR, III/VI crescendo systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Sclera anicteric.
PERRL NECK: Supple with no JVD CARDIAC: RRR, III/VI crescendo systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
There are also widely splayed symmetric T wave changes consistent with a cerebral event or consistent with drug effect or ischemia.
Clinical correlation is suggested for ischemia and/or cerebral event is required.
Large scale pulmonary consolidation which developed between [**9-8**] and [**9-10**] and worsened appreciably over the course of the day continues to improve, but the focal nature of the consolidation suggests that what remains could be pneumonia, particularly in the right lower lobe.
Pleural effusion is small if any.
No pneumothorax.
Multifocal opacities, greatest at the right base, continue to improve.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is probably mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable mid inferoseptal/apical septal hypokinesis and distal inferior hypokinesis although views are technically suboptimal.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The LMCA had no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting lesions.
The LAD was totally occluded after a high diagonal.
There were significant left-left and right-left collaterals supplying the LAD territory.
The LCX was a moderate caliber vessel with a 50% stenosis in OM1.
2) Resting hemodynamics showed severe left-sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 50 mmHg.
4) Successful primary angioplasty of the ostial RCA lesion with a 3.0 15mm Vision BMS.
Final angiography revealed TIMI 3 flow with no residual stenosis or angiographically-apparent dissection.
Severe two vessel CAD with probable chronic LAD disease.
Successful angioplasty of the ostial RCA lesion with a 3.0 x 15mm Vision BMS.
Severely elevated left-sided filling pressures.
Video swallow [**2170-9-13**]: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There was penetration and aspiration with thin liquids.
No aspiration or penetration with any other consistency of barium.
Small posterior wall diverticulum above the upper esophageal sphincter is observed.
Small diverticulum of the posterior wall of the upper esophagus.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 88yoF with no cardiac history presents to BIDN with chest pain after recent mechanical fall and e/o STEMI on EKG, transferred for hypoxia requiring intubation.
She went to cath lab on [**9-11**] which showed severe two-vessel disease, chronic LAD disease, and 90% occlusion of RCX.
# Hypoxia: Thought likely [**2-21**] pulmonary edema in setting of STEMI and decreased EF.
CXR initially c/f multifocal pna and she was continued on vanc/levofloxacin/flagyl (started at BIDN).
# Dementia: Per family, patient has dementia at baseline.
She was evaluated by speech and swallow service, and video swallow showed dysphagia with esophageal diverticulum above UES.
# Lacerations [**2-21**] fall:  Patient was started on doxycycline on her last ED visit, however this was discontinued as she did not show evidence of cellulitis or wound infection.
8. risperidone 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 11851**] Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: ST segment elevation myocardial infarction Dementia esophageal diverticulum Urinary Incontinence   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
As you know you had chest pain when you fell and it was determined that you had a heart attack.
