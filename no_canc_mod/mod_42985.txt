EMS found him standing outside, but became combative and subsequently experienced a seizure while enroute to [**Hospital1 18**].
Exam was notable for cold extremities and wet clothing, hematoma and abrasion over R parietal area .
He was lethargic and reported to be confused.
He was recognized as a patient who is frequently seen in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for intoxication with a history of withdrawal seizures (thought to be named [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **], MR [**Numeric Identifier 111312**]).
At that time patient became combative, and was induced and intubated to allow completion of medical workup.
CXR was unremarkable, NCHCT without acute intracranial process, and CT Cspine without acute fracture.
ED course otherwise notable for agitation requiring increasing of midazolam drip to 20mg/hr.
Patient was intubated, comfortable appearing and very lethargic.
Nursing reported pressence of copious light brown secretions from ET tube.

some psoriatic appearing plaques and numular plaque-like red lesions with scaling noted over groin and proximal extremities  Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: .
[**2183-2-21**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST - No acute fracture or malalignment is present.
The partially imaged lung apices show mild paraseptal emphysema.
Within these limitations, no acute intracranial hemorrhage, large vascular territory infarct, shift of midline structures or mass effect is present.
The visible paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells show minimal mucosal thickening in the posterior ethmoidal air cells and the sphenoidal sinus.
There is interval progression of widespread multifocal opacities, highly concerning for multifocal pneumonia, potential aspiration in origin.
Small amount of bilateral pleural effusion, left more than right, cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2183-2-25**] EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Low limb lead voltage.
Since the previous tracing of [**2183-2-21**] atrial premature beats are no longer seen and the rate is slower.
MICROBIOLOGIC DATA: .
negative [**2183-2-26**] UCx pending [**2183-2-26**] BCx pending  Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 60M with uncertain PMH history who presented with lethargy and evidence of alcohol withdrawal seizures who was intubated for airway protection and behavioral concerns.
# DELIRIUM - During and after extubation, patient intermittently very agitated, trying to get out of bed and punching staff members - occasionally becoming physical.
He was treated with PRN IV Haldol for agitation and had an infectious and metabolic work-up for causes of delirium which was unrevealing.
# ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SEIZURES - Patient with witness generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity in the ED.
Neurologic exam was without deficits on admission and head CT imaging was reassuring.
Toxic ingestion, overdose and alcohol withdrawal were all considered, with laboratory and physical evidence of alcohol withdrawal seizure.
No clear evidence of toxidrome on laboratory and physical exam work-up.
We switched him to Precedex to promote down-titration of his narcotics and benzodiazepines, and we were able to transition him to PO Diazepam for withdrawal concerns.
His electrolytes were optimized, although he had some intermittent episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia which were short-lived and asymptomatic.
# ACUTE RESPIRATORY CONCERNS - Intubation for behavioral issues, ventilating well, with copious brown liquid being suctioned from ET tube initially; given these findings, there was some concern for aspiration in the setting of seizure or peri-intubation.
He had low grade temperatures without leukocytosis on admission attributed to his withdrawal physiology.
Given his increased sedation requirements, he required mechanical ventilatory support.
His CXR did demonstrated some evidence of pulmonary congestion and possible consolidation concerning for aspiration pneumonitis vs. pneumonia.
He was antibiosed with Vancomycin and Cefepime for pneumonia coverage given his sputum culture gram stain demonstrating gram positive cocci and gram negative rods; speciating commensal organisms only.
# SINUS TACHYCARDIA - Likely multifactorial and secondary to hypovolemia and presumed alcohol withdrawal with sympathetic overdrive; no obvious sources of infection and afebrile.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA - Patient presented with worsening thrombocytopenia that stabilized following admission.
He demonstrated no evidence of active bleeding.
He had no evidence of infection.
# IDENTIFICATION - Identification was confirmed as [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] after 3-days of his hospital stay.
Medications on Admission: ** none available per patient, have included past medical history of [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **], the supposed identity of this patient ** - Thiamine 100mg daily - Aspirin 81mg daily - Diltiazem 120mg QID - Atorvastatin 10mg daily - Isosorbide Mononitrate SR 30mg daily - Omeprazole 20mg daily - Folic Acid 1mg daily - MVI  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Alcohol withdrawal seizure Secondary Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
