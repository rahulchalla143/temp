Right facial soft tissue hematoma, without evidence of underlying fracture or intracranial injury.
Moderate atrophy of the brain parenchyma is more than expected for the patient's age.
Hypodensities in the right corona radiata are non-specific, but could be due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Chronic paranasal sinus mucosal disease, without air-fluid level.
Right facial soft tissue hematoma, without evidence of underlying fracture.
Mild chronic paranasal sinus mucosal disease again noted.
Moderate brain atrophy redemonstrated.
Probable distal right clavicular fracture, but evaluation is slightly limited due to overlying catheter.
No fracture or dislocation involving the glenohumeral joint.
Displaced right lateral second rib fracture.
Acute fracture of the right second lateral rib.
Decreased size of small-to-moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure.
Possible fracture of the distal right clavicle for which clinical correlation is recommended.
No evidence of pneumothorax, solid organ injury or extraluminal gas.
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2105-3-24**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the entire septum and inferior wall, hypokinesis of the anterior wall and anterolateral wall, and hypokinesis of the distal inferolateral wall.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-3-17**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced.
CXR [**2105-3-24**] IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of left pleural effusion with complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
Cardiomegaly without frank volume overload.
Renal U/S [**2105-3-25**] IMPRESSION: 1.6-cm mid right renal cyst corresponds to hypodensity seen on CT.  CXR [**2105-3-26**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a new ICD extending to the general area of the apex of the right ventricle.
Bilateral pleural effusions are seen with lower lung volumes.
No evidence of pneumothorax.

Syncope and hypotension.
Hypotension most likely from combination of overdiuresis and antihypertensive medications as well as infection with leukocytosis and positive UA.
This was probably exacerbated by mild diarrhea prior to admission.
Hyponatremia and ARF also consistent with volume depletion.
Arrhythmia, seizure, stroke and hypoglycemia less likely.
Pt had recent NSTEMI with 70-80% stenosis RCA on cath at OSH with likley recannulization.
Here had some LAD stenosis last admission now s/p BMSx2.
No sign of acute stent thrombosis.
EKG on admission showed lateral STD consistent with strain in setting of hypotension.
Chronic systolic CHF: Pt has severe systolic CHF with EF 20% with severe LV dilation, severe MR, and pulm htn.
Upon admission, she was hypotensive and felt to be hypovolemic from possible overdiuresis.
She was volume resuscitated with NS x 2L and her heart failure meds and diuretics were slowly reintroduced.
They initially recommended repeat echo in 3 months but then recommended ICD as discussed below given development of complete heart block.
Complete Heart Block: Pt developed complete heart block on [**3-26**] with hypotension SBPs 60s and HR 50s.
ECG and telemetry c/w complete heart block with junctional escape.
Since EP was already consulted for BiV ICD for CHF with low EF, they were asked to re-evaluate patient given new heart block.
UTI: Pt had complaints of dysuria with enteroccocus on urine cx sensitive to vanco and macrobid and ampicillin.
ARF: ARF from hypovolemia as above.
Rib/Clavicle fractures: Pain controlled with tylenol prn.
Asthma: Currently no wheezing.
[**Name (NI) 95969**] Pt had eosinophilia on day of discharge, 9.9%.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or  wheezing.

You were dehydrated and had complete heart block.
Medication changes: 1.Tramadol: a medicine for pain to take for fractures 2.

Please call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] if you faint or feel dizzy, have any chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, increasing nausea, increasing redness of swelling around the pacer site, you get a shock from the defibrillator or any other concerning symptoms.
