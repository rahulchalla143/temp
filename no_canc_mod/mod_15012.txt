Originally, presented with after a week of flu like illness with altered mental status and thought to have seroquel OD (prior OD on CCB/BB).
(though were + for TCA at OSH).
Therefore, episode of altered mental status is not completely understood.
An LP was performed for HAs and showed xanthochromia in all 4 tubes.
This was concerning for SAH vs herpes vs mycotic aneurysm.
MRI spine was ordered to rule out aneurysm/AVM but patient could not tolerate the procedure secondary to nausea.
However, he continues to experience vertigo and nausea especially when he lays flat.
Patient now without headaches.
Cath [**2108-4-13**] showed no flow limiting disease with EF=50%.
His outpatient cardiologist notes that he has a severe coronary vasculopathy (based on his having quickly developed seperate coronary occlusions in rapid succession; this is why the stents were each inserted on seperate occassions; this is also in the context of presently having clear coronaries) 2.
Hypertension 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Was receiving maintenance therapy once per week until late [**Month (only) 216**], then increased to 3x/week secondary to continued symptoms of depression.
Moved around  as a child secondary to father's position in Navy, ultimately settling on Cape for high school.
Enjoys playing with dog, tending to garden, unable to do much of either secondary to illness.
H/o EtOH dependence with Section 35 to [**Location (un) 1475**] ~15 years ago, in AA, sober since with just one day of drinking in the spring.

There is a left-sided subclavian central venous catheter with the tip in the upper to mid SVC.
No focal pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, or evidence of pneumothorax.
CT HEAD: [**11-26**] FINDINGS: There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence for minor or major vascular territory infarction.
There is no overt extracranial pathology seen other than mild bilateral ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.
MR HEAD [**11-27**] FINDINGS: The right vertebral artery distal to the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery is extremely hypoplastic.
Additionally, there are bilateral fetal-type posterior cerebral arteries, the latter finding presumably correlating with the rather diminutive basilar artery.
Within the limitations of MR angiography, there is no definite sign for the presence of an aneurysm, although conventional angiography remains the standard study necessary to more unequivocal exclusion of this pathological process.
There are no areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis identified.
Within the limitations of coverage of this study, there is no overt sign for the presence of a vascular malformation.
CTA HEAD: [**11-29**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of aneurysm.
A preliminary report of no subarachnoid hemorrhages seen, no aneurysm detected on axial images was provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41684**] and confirmed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The aortic valve leaflets (3)  appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic  regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Based on [**2100**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings  indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and  echocardiographic data.
MRCSpine [**12-4**] CONCLUSION: No radiological explanation for the clinical and laboratory abnormalities noted in your history.
ADDENDUM: There is a mild Chiari I malformation of the cerebellar tonsils, with the tonsillar tips approximately 5 mm below the plane of the foramen magnum.
Additionally, there are type 2 degenerative endplate changes involving the C5-6 and C6-7 interspaces.
Finally, there is a mild degree of congenital narrowing of the AP diameter of the cervical spinal canal from the C3 through C6-7 levels.

MR [**Last Name (Titles) **] 1//18 FINDINGS: There is mild facet joint degenerative change bilaterally at the L5-S1 interspace, with a 2 mm subchondral cyst involving the left S1 superior articular facet.
There is no other overt lumbar spinal pathology seen.
Most probably, this finding relates to the relatively diminished size of the thecal sac secondary to the presence of abundant epidural fat at this locale.
CONCLUSION:No definite signs for the presence of spinal pathology accounting for the clinical and laboratory findings noted in your history.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo male with multiple h/o of SI, CAD s/p PCI, p/w apnea/bradycardia/hypotension in setting of OD.
Further inquiry revealed a HA preceding the pt's unresponsiveness.
The patient's running problems were MS changes, Infection, hypotension, Acidosis, respiratory failure, CAD, ARF, nausea and vertigo.
Ddx includes CNS infection (likely viral given non-toxic appearance and prodrome 1 week prior), SAH (supported by xanthochromia on LP x 2), trauma (no outward evidence of this), HIV sequela.
(though were + for TCA at OSH).
Pt had fever on [**11-27**] and so was covered with levo/flagyl and was cultured.
Culture data as follows: [**11-26**]: BCx with MSSA (1/4 bottles), GNR (1/4 bottles) [**11-26**]: Sputum with staph aureus [**Last Name (un) 36**] pending [**11-27**]: Sputum with staph aureus [**11-28**]: Sputum with staph aureus Treated with Clinda rather than levo/flagyl since [**11-28**] (emperic to cover poss comm acquired MRSA).
CXR does not indicate a PNA from aspiration (though there did seem to be an aspiration while pt was intubated).
Suspician for a true infection was low per clinical picture, and it was rather suspected that the growth may have been an unusual contaminant, however, antiobiotics were administered in case culture was true.
The CSF revealed persistant blood and xanthocromia and high protein on two occasions.
Pt was covered with empiric acyclovir until CSF PCR demonstrated no HSV.
On workup, pt had MRI suggesting chiari malformation hypoplastic r vert, small posterior art, no aneurysm seen, no acute stroke.
CTA was also negative for aneurism or bleed.
Defect of the spinal cord such as AVM or aneurism was suspected due to hyperasthesia in chest but MR showed no abnormality.
The last possibility that had to be ruled out was a sentinal bleed from a small cranial aneurism that was being missed by MR/CTA, so a angiogram was performed which did not demonstrate any major abnormalities on discussion with the radiologist, however a formal read is pending as of discharge date.
Resp Failure:  Pt presented with respiratory failure and was intubated on [**11-26**].
CAD: ASA, Plavix (allergies noted; only makes him bleed), held BB/CCB due to low blood pressure.
ATN is likely given hypotension and high FeNa.
UA appears infected, but UCx showed no growth.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: altered mental status depression bacteremia h.flu pneumonia hematochezia CAD sp stents  Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: Please continue your home medications, as administered by your partner.
[**Name (NI) **] were found to have blood in your stool, so you need to have this followed up.
Please ask your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] you for a colonoscopy.
Please call your doctor if you have further confusion, fevers, headaches, or notice blood in your stool.
