Mild gallbladder wall thickening with mild pericholecystic edema/fluid.
There is moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and mild CBD prominence.
These findings could represent an obstruction at the ampulla, although a discreet obstructing lesion is not identified on this study.
HIDA nuclear scan could be performed to evaluate for acute cholecystitis.
No evidence for small bowel obstruction.
Focal emphysema in the left side and dome of urinary bladder.
Marked lumbar spine degenerative disease with multilevel significant central canal stenosis and neural foraminal narrowing  GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND: The gallbladder is slightly distended.
The wall slightly thickened without evidence of definite edema.
No pericholecystic fluid, stones or sludge are seen.
IMPRESSION: Mild gallbladder wall thickening.
No stones, sludge or pericholecystic fluid identified.
KUB - IMPRESSION: Air-distended small bowel loops at the above limits of normal in terms of caliber.
No air-fluid levels.
These findings could be consistent with early small-bowel obstruction, although they are not diagnostic.
CXR - IMPRESSION: No evidence of free intra-abdominal air.
