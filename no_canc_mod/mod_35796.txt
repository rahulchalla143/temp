Patient was first diagnosed with LVOT obstruction in [**2-25**] when she was admitted for chest pressure and shortness of breath.
Patient notes longstanding chest pressure symptoms that have been present for more than 10 years.
She says that she has diffuse chest pressure over her mid sternum, poorly localized, not associated with any other symptoms such as sob, diaphoresis, radiation.
In terms of her sob, she reports symptoms starting in [**2-25**] where she could only walk 20 yards before having to stop to cath her breath.
She states that she was diagnosed with HTN at 15 and has been "well controlled" however does not check her BP at home.
It was felt that her SOB was likely due to diastolic dysfuntion with CHF exacerbation due to Prednisone, dietary indescretion, and poorly controlled HTN.
During the procedure it was noted that her LAD had a 50% lesion and confirmed the left ventricular outflow obstruction (50mmHg).
She is now admitted for elective septal ablation and LAD stenting.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient talkative and feeling well, no sob or chest pain.
Lying flat, having some back pain, groin site minimally painful.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 69yo F with CAD (70% mid LAD), HTN, CHF, MMP underwent cardiac catheterization on [**6-16**] for septal ablation to relieve left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
A 70% concentric hazy lesion of the LAD was also noted during this procedure (and was known prior to admission).
Her creatinine was slightly above baseline on admission and she received renal protection prior catheterization with mucomyst and iv fluids with bicarb.
