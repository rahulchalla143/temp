[**Name (NI) **] a left AV fisula and a left HD tunnelled catheter.
Mild abd pain.
Blood and urine sent for culture, and pt given tylenol.
He had mild abd tenderness, so CT abd performed which was negative for acute process.

He had a negative U/A and b/l pleural effusions on CXR, ?
While in ED, he had 300cc of coffee ground emesis, which cleared with NG lavage.
Admitted to MICU for concern for sepsis and UGIB.
Received vanc/zosyn to cover broadly for fever of unknown source.
No further bleeding.
He was called out to floor, and EGD was complicated by vagal episode (bradycardia and hypotension) and procedure was discontinued.
He then had a second presyncopal episode with elevated troponin with TWI noted on EKG and was sent back to the ICU.
TTE showed newly dpressed EF 30% with no focal wall motion abnormality.
Last HD yesterday in the setting of hyperkalemia (K 6).
Abx discontinued with no further fevers.
Viral screen pending.
Past Medical History: # Insulin-dependent diabetes for 20 years: HgA1c 9.4% on [**2122-6-3**] # Hypertension # Hyperlipidemia with markedly elevated TGs # CKD (mid 2s [**1-16**] to [**3-14**] most recently) # Pancreatitis; pancreas divisum # Obesity # Hyperuricemia # GERD   Social History: Patient is married with five children.
Patient with disability due to poor vision from diabetic retinopathy.
Family History: Mother and father with diabetes, no coronary disease, no colon cancer, no prostate cancer.
[**2123-1-4**] - TTE: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Moderate bilateral effusions noted.
Increased interstitial markings in the lower lungs bilaterally consistent with mild interstitial edema.
No focal consolidation or pneumothorax within the visualized portion of the lungs.
Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
No other CT findings to explain patient's abdominal pain.
THIS NEGATIVE RESULT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS (HH) IN THIS INDIVIDUAL.
HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT RULE OUT THE PRESENCE OF OTHER MUTATIONS WITHIN THE HFE GENE OR A DIAGNOSIS OF HH.
THE RISK OF THIS INDIVIDUAL CARRYING A HFE MUTATION OTHER THAN THOSE TESTED IN THIS ASSAY DEPENDS GREATLY ON FAMILY AND CLINICAL HISTORY AS WELL AS ETHNICITY.
THIS ASSAY DOES NOT TEST FOR OTHER PRIMARY OR SECONDARY IRON OVERLOAD DISORDERS.

man with DM2, ESRD on HD, dCHF, presents with N/V/D, fever, and coffe ground emesis, new cardiomyopathy.
CARDIOMYOPATHY: Patient with progressive dyspnea over the past year and interval decline in EF.
He had a history of exposure to a Chagas endemic country and was found to be Chagas IgG positive, IgM negative, concerning for Chagas cardiomyopathy.
However, the pattern of heart disease was somewhat inconsistant, and he may have other causes for cardiomyopathy.
No family history or history of toxin exposure.
UPPER GI BLEED: Coffee ground emesis most likely from upper GI source.
Hematemesis resolved.
FEVERS, NAUSEA, VOMITING, DIARRHEA: Patient presented with somewhat atypical flu symptoms of unclear duration.
