Brief Hospital Course: A/P  92W h/o afib not on AC presents as CODE STROKE after onset of garbled speech, right sided weakness and left gaze preference and arrived to ED within 3 hours of time of onset and was given TPA for NIHSS 17 and concern for left MCA occlusion on CTA head nonreformatted.
On Vanc, Aztreonam, Flagyl for fever 102 emp pulm coverage d/t tachypnea on presentation.
An EEG showed only some mild diffuse intermittent theta-range slowing (formal report pending at time of discharge).
Since she's has such remarkable recovery and the initial imaging studies, including CT/CTA/perfusion did not reveal a LMCA stroke, and MRI was done to assess for older strokes or signs of this recent stroke.
It revealed no DWI abnormalities, mild white matter microangiopathic changes, and intact vessels intracranially (formal read pending) .
Given the previous admission where she had altered mental status and speech resolved with resolution of the fever, it is a possibility that she had the same issue now.
CARDIO Recurrent episodes of CP reported upon Tx out of unit to floor.
No respiratory issues during admission.
GI/ABD/UG An abdominal scan was done for a high lactate and fever, revealing no soource of infection but a it did reveal right-sided hydronephrosis and right- sided [**Month/Day (2) 96980**] obstruction.
There also was extensive diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, multiple hepatic cysts, bilateral renal cysts that had increased in number and hypodensities in the pancreas that were anticipated.
Urology was [**Month/Day (2) 653**] for the hydronephrosis and [**Name (NI) 96980**] stenosis, and after reviewing the images they said it was OK to follow it over time as long as she was asymptomatic .
ID High grade fever on admission, empirically treated with broad spectrum ABx.
ENT She complained of a fullness of her L ear on day 3, on the floor, and of earpain bilaterally on day 4, both self-resolved with negative bedside otoscopy.
HEME/ONC The PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] regarding the issues above, and in his notes it is outlined that no further workup for her pancreatic lesion was to be done.
