Admission Date:  [**2134-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-9-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-7-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: Left-sided weakness   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 36756**] is an 81 year-old right-handed cigarette smoker with a longstanding history of HTN, HL and CKD III-IV, who presents with acute-onset Left-sided weakness while using the toilet this morning around *7:45am*.
He said while on the toilet, he had nausea and dry heaves, which he has been experiencing every morning for several weeks now (his son thinks this is secondary to a recent increase in the dose of one of his medications, but not sure which one).
He "slid" off the toilet before he could wipe, and called his son to help him back up because he realized "everything wasn't workin" meaning that his left arm and leg were paralyzed.
After finishing his business on the toilet, he asked his son to call EMS, who took him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
No sensory changes or paresthesias.
No dysarthria or altered level of arousal at any time.
No CP or SOB.
ROS +for nausea and vomiting, as noted above.
We rapidly assessed the patient and he was found to have left arm and shoulder weakness (trap/delt/[**Hospital1 **]/tri) with preserved grip strength as well as left leg weakness with complete paralysis of all LLE muscles except hamstrings, which were 2-3/5.
There was no sensory loss on my exam at the CT scanner.
HTN on [**Last Name (un) **], CCB, BB, loop diuretic 2.
Dementia NOS, on AChE-antagonist 5.
Hyperlipidemia 6.
8. h/o benign polyps on colonoscopy 9. h/o Cervical Fusion 10. h/o Testicular Cyst Removal # Says + PMH of strokes, but describes an episode from decades ago with tingling in both feet ascending up his entire body that does not make much sense and son cannot corroborate.
Social History: Tobacco: >20pk-yr h/o cigarette smoking.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
Speech sounded dysarthric vs. raspy from smoking Hx (patient and son insist this is how he normally sounds).
There were no paraphasic errors.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect or ideomotor apraxia; the patient was able to reproduce and recognize hammering a nail and brushing teeth with both hands.
There was no evidence of left-right confusion as the patient was able to accurrately follow the instruction to tough left ear with right hand.
No saccadic intrusion during smooth pursuits.
Mild left NLF depresion with smile, otherwise symmetric facial elevation.
No tremor or faciculations were observed.
No hypertonicity or spasticity.
Eyes-closed Finger-to-[**Last Name (un) **] testing revealed no proprioceptive deficit (did not miss [**Last Name (Titles) **]) on right.
No agraphesthesia on either side.
No frontal release signs, including normal (absent) rooting, <only +/- glabellar>, grasp, or palmar-mental reflexes.
-Coordination: Finger-[**Last Name (un) **]-finger testing with no dysmetria or intention tremor on the right.
Heel-knee-shin testing with no dysmetria on the right.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarction detected.
Moderate-to-severe chronic microangiopathic ischemic disease.
Acute/subacute infarction involving the right precentral gyrus and paramedian right frontal gyrus without significant surrounding edema or mass effect.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter disease likely representing the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Encephalomalacia involving the bilateral occipital lobes is likely present, possibly representing sequela of previous infarction.
A midline superior posterior scalp lipoma is present.
The MRA of the head and neck is significantly limited due to motion and technical factors.
No gross flow-limiting stenoses identified.
ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
A mild mid-cavity gradient is identified.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened, and display somewhat reduced systolic excursion, but frank aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
He was evaluated in the ED by our neurology resident and the stroke fellow and felt it was appropriate to give tPA.
Head CT was done which showed no infarct or hemorrhage, but CTA/perfusion was not done at that time.
He had residual left sided weakness post tPA, but was significantly improved.
He had an MRI of the head which demonstrated a new infarct in the right precentral gyrus along the ACA,MCA territory.
Vessel imaging of the head and neck revealed no significant stenosis or aneurysms to explain the infarct.
Carotid duplex U/S revealed <40% stenosis bilaterally.
Home lasix had been held as well, and patient had no evidence of volume overload (clear lungs, no edema, good 02 sat on room air).
Galantamine 16 mg Cap,24 hr Sust Release Pellets Sig: One (1) Cap,24 hr Sust Release Pellets PO once a day as needed for alzheimers.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Care Network  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - Stroke  Secondary - Pulmonary artery Hypertension (est: 68-70 mmHg) - Hypertension - CKD III-IV Cr now 2.0 (GFR mid-30s), c/w his baseline GFR.
- Cigarette smoker - Dementia NOS, on AChE-antagonist - dyslipidemia - Mood disorder NOS on bupropion   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were given a drug for this acute stroke and you were admitted to the ICU.
You were started on plavix to help prevent future strokes.
