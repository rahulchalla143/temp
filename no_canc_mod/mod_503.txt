Admission Date:  [**2161-2-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2161-3-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-9-3**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61 year-old male with a ten year history of progressive Parkinson's disease tripped over his own feet and fell down approximately seven steps.
He also noted pain in his legs left greater then right and in his right chest.
This showed a fracture of the anterior arch of C1.
There was a moderately displaced, comminuted, odontoid fracture extending through the base, which moderately narrowed the spinal canal.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and Parkinson's syndrome.
ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to Haldol.
He is complaining of a headache, posterior neck pain and right chest pain.
He has a marked resting tremor primarily effecting his left upper extremity and left lower extremity.
He describes altered sensation and pain to light touch and pin prick over his left occiput and right chest at approximately the T2 to T5 levels.
There is no clear sensory level to pin prick, light touch, position direction or vibration.
It was difficult to reduce his fracture and apply a halo, because of his movement disorder.
An MRI scan of the cervical spine was obtained to rule out an epidural hematoma.
This showed no evidence of any significant cord compression or epidural bleeding.
He was noted to have severe dyskinesias from his Sinemet, which made it difficult to maintain him in halo traction.
The patient was noted to have multiple episodes, which seemed to be aspiration.
The patient's chest x-ray showed an infiltrate consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
There is no evidence of any spinal cord compression on the films.
He continued to have high fevers up to 102 and 103.
It was felt that his obtundation was likely due to his fevers.
This showed no evidence of any intracranial masses or infection.
The patient had no evidence of infection at the site of his fracture.
He continued having fevers ranging from 101 to 103.
His sputum cultures grew out Methicillin sensitive staph aureus, Pneumococcus and strep viridans.
A CT scan once again reconfirmed a dense right lower lobe infiltrate.
The infectious disease consultant suggested the differential included a C-diff colitis, metastatic infection with MMSA, a possible meningitis, a drug fever or a line infection.
There was no improvement in his mental status.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Fever of unknown origin.
