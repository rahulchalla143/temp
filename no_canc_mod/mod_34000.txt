Resection of left atrial appendage.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 yo M h/o afib on coumadin, COPD, systolic HF with EF 30%, who presented to an OSH on [**2121-5-21**] with c/o [**2-26**] wks worsening SOB , increasing lower extremity edema and orthopnea and a reported 20 lb weight gain.
Notably, patient reports taking SL nitro daily for chest pain for the past few weeks.
On OSH admission, he was initially felt to be having a CHF exacerbation with concurrent COPD exacerbation and was treated with diuresis and IV steroids/nebs.
On [**2121-5-23**] patient complained of chest tightness and ECG showed diffuse ST depressions.
CT abdomen to rule out intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal bleed was considered but deferred until transfer.
Patient underwent cardiac cath on [**5-27**] which severe multivessel disease including 90% focal mid-L main, 60% mid- LAD, 80% mid left cx, 80% proximal RCA stenosis.
Given severity of coronary disease he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Notably, prior to transfer patient had CP requiring 1 SL nitro despite being on nitro gtt at 40 mcg.
On arrival, patient chest pain free on nitro gtt though developed 4/10 chest pain.
ECG cont to show diffuse ST depressions which is unchanged previous ECGs over past 24 hours.

There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid anterior wall hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and overall normal global function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with borderline normal right ventricular systolic function.
The bilateral pleural effusions are small potentially slightly increased since the prior study, although it may be explained by currently upright position of the patient.
There is questionable new left perihilar opacity that might be worrisome for a developing infectious process and close attention to this area is recommended.
Multiple calcified pulmonary nodules are unchanged.

He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner by the cardiac surgery service including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed a 60-69% left internal carotid artery stenosis and a 40-59% right internal carotid artery stenosis.
He required a transfusion of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit in the setting of his recent GI bleed.
On [**2121-5-28**], he was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to five vessels and resection of his left atrial appendage(given history of atrial fibrillation).
Ciprofloxacin was empirically started for chest x-ray findings concerning for worsening left retrocardiac opacity.
Amiodarone was initiated and beta blockade was advanced for better rate control of his atrial fibrillation.
Given his recent GI bleed, Warfarin was not resumed until GI workup was performed.
Ciprofloxacin was continued for a sputum culture that grew out Haemophilus influenzae.
