History of Present Illness: Pt is 55 yo M with CAD (s/p several MI's, s/p 3V CABG in [**2132**]), DM2, who presented to [**Hospital3 59514**] Hospital last PM with chest tightness, diaphoresis, and nausea.
At around 11:30 pm on [**11-29**], pt experienced chest tightness, diaphoresis, nausea, and bilateral elbow pain after returning home from a holiday party.
Had not had recent CP, SOB, DOE prior to this episode; was able to climb 5 flights of stairs in parking lot without CP in recent days.
Chest pain went from [**5-16**] to [**12-16**] with 3 SL NTG.
Reportedly pt had patent LIMA-LAD, thrombosed SVG-OM graft, unknown 3rd graft (cath approx [**2-7**] yrs ago for NSTEMI, no stents placed).
Stress 1.5-2 years ago with reported inferior hypokinesis, but complete results unavailable.
- DM2: on metformin at home - Recurrent cellulitis of R leg - hyperlipidemia   Social History: Married.
Family History: Father died of heart disease at age 72.
Sister with CAD (s/p CABG) and hyperlipidemia.
Cardio: RRR, nl S1S2, no m/r/g Resp: crackles at L base Abd: soft, nt, nd, +BS.
No signs of infection.
Cardiac Cath [**11-30**]: Initial angiiogram demonstrateda 50% stenosis of the proximal LCx and a subsequent 90% stenosis.
The SVG to the diag was full of thrombus and had very poor flow and considered too high risk to intervene.
It was planned to treat the native LCx lesion with PTCA and stenting.
The lesion was pre-dilated with a 2.25 x 15 Quantum Maverick balloon at 10 ATM, a 2.5 x 20 Taxus DES was deployed across the lesion at 14 ATM and post dilated with a 2.75 Quantum Maverick at 20 ATM distally and proximally.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis and no angiographic evidence of dissection, thrombus or perforation with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.
The patient left the lab in stable condition and pain free.
[**12-2**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior akinesis and mid to distal inferolateral hypokinesis and apical hypokinesis (apex not fully visualized).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-11-30**], there is no definite change.
Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2150-12-2**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2150-12-1**] 4:50 am BLOOD CULTURE     AEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending):     ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Pending):   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan:  55 year old man with CAD status post 3 vessel CABG in [**2132**] who presented on [**11-29**] with NSTEMI.
Cardiac stress test one year ago revealed inferior hypokinesis.
Repeat cardiac catheterization on [**11-30**] revealed 3 vessel disease.
1) CP/NSTEMI: Patient with known CAD, status post multiple MI's and status post 3-vessel CABG in [**2150**].
PCP/cardiologist has done stress and caths within the last several years (reported patent LIMA-LAD).
Patient ruled in for NSTEMI and was taken to cardiac catheterization on [**11-30**].
Elevated LVEDP status post procedure.
Basal inferior akinesis and apical hypokinesis.
CXR shows opacity which represents atalectasis vs. aspiration.
- Repeat PA and lateral CXR on [**12-2**] was improved and no evidence of PNA.
Patient has remained afebrile in past several days.
Discharge Instructions: -Please seek medical attention immediately if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, excessive sweating, or any other concerning symptoms.
