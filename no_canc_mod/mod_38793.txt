[** **] Date:  [**2115-1-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-1-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-4-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, found to have C.diff colitis.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Hemodialysis x 3 sessions.
History of Present Illness:  56 yo male with pmh significant for HTN, HLD, alcohol abuse who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] MICU for c-diff colitis.
He did not have fever, chills or any other symptom.
No blood or dark tarry stools were noted.
He had no recent travel, no unsual meals, no sick contacts; although there is a day care at his work and he plays with the children at times.
He has been drinking 0.5 pint of vodka or rum daily.
As per his family he continued to  have diarrhea up to 30 episodes per day and he felt very ill.
As per [**Hospital3 **] note, pt was given several liters of fluid (uncertain on amount) and started on Norepi.
He had 3 L of fluid removal today.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is drowsy but easily arousable to verbal stimuli.
He is mumbling words, in NAD HEENT: Sclera icteric, MM dry, oropharynx clear, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: RR tachy, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, diminished at bases, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: very distended, tympanic, soft, non-tender, + hyper active BS, GU: foley- small amount of dark brown urine Ext: warm, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, + trace edema Neuro: Drowsy, easily arousable to verbal stimuli, no following commands, moving all ext in bed.
Mild tremor, no asterix.
DISCHARGE PE: General: alert and oriented in NAD HEENT: Sclera icteric, PERRL, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: RRR, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: CTAB, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: +BS, soft, NT, ND Ext: warm, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, + trace edema  Pertinent Results: [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL LABS: Na 127, K 3.8, Cl 86, CO2 20, BUN of 47, Creat of 8.4, bili of 1.7, AST 181, ALT 57, alk phos 70, albumin of 3.2, and lipase of 160, WBC of 14.3, Hct 37.7, plat 131, CK 1548.
Increased opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis and effusion.
In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
[**2115-1-7**] KUB:  A nasogastric tube terminates in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum.
There is no free gas or pneumatosis.
There are multiple prominent air-filled loops of small bowel throughout the central abdomen, findings which suggest ileus.
There is no non-surgical radiopaque foreign body or soft tissue calcifications.
[**2115-1-7**] RUQ U/S: Evaluation is limited due to body habitus.
The liver is echogenic due to which may be due to fatty infiltration.
There are no focal hepatic lesions.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with the common bile duct measuring 3 mm.
Small amount of perihepatic free fluid.
The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones.
There is small amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant.
Echogenic liver may relate to fatty infiltration; other forms of more advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis/fibrosis not excluded on this study 2.
No evidence of gallstones or acute cholecystitis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary Hypertension.
Diffuse thickening and edema of the large colon which would be in keeping with Clostridium difficile colitis.
Moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
Hepatosteatosis with focal areas of increased fat deposition.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying left-sided compressive atelectasis.
Pancolitis with associated moderate intra-abdominal and intrapelvic ascites.
No focal collections or abscesses are detected.
Hypoenhancing right hepatic lesion, which may reflect focal hepatic steatosis, but a primary mass such as HCC cannot be excluded on this single-phase study.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Perigastric and perisplenic varices.
The opacification at the left base has essentially cleared with minimal residual atelectasis and blunting of the costophrenic angle.
The right base is essentially clear and there is no evidence of vascular congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo male with hx of HTN, HL, obesity, and ETOH abuse who presented to OHS 4 days ago on [**1-3**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and was found to be have [**Last Name (un) **] with anuria, and severe c.diff colitis, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
# C.Diff Colitis: Risk factor was two days of cipro prior for a GI bug prior to [**Hospital1 **].
He presented to the OSH with septic shock requiring fluid and pressors, which were weaned off in 2 days.
His abdomen was very distended at presentation, however it was soft and non-tender.
His KUB showed dilated loops of bowel with air fluid levels, but no free air.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], his vancomycin PO was increased from 250mg to 500mg, IV flagyl was continued, and vancomycin enemas were started given concern for decreased gut motility.
ID recommended stopping the Tigecycline since it could be affecting his gut flora.
He had a repeat CT abd/pelvis that continued to show pancolitis with associated moderate intraabdominal and intrapelvic ascites.
Hygiene and safety precautions to prevent cdiff infection were reviewed with him prior to discharge.
# Lower Extremity Swelling: Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed 3+ lower extremity edema secondary to fluid resuscitation while in the MICU.
His weight was 110.4kg on discharge with only trace lower extremity edema.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Presented with acute renal failure compliated by anuria.
This was likely secondary to poor renal perfusion from hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea and hypotension secondary to septic shock.
He was started on CVVH and his renal fucntion started to improve.
# Elevated LFT's, hypoalbuminemia, elevated INR: Patient has been a heavy drinker for many years.
His elevated LFT's were initally thought to be secondary to alcoholic hepatitis with a discriminant function of 6.
US of liver/gallbladder showed echogenic liver potentially related to fatty infiltration; but could not exclude more advanced liver disease with cirrhosis or fibrosis.
His LFTs have been trending down but still not WNL, and his synthetic function was also abnormal with elevated INR and low albumin.
His elevated bili during this infection and findings of gastric and splenic varices raise concern for cirrhosis.
#Hypoenhancing right hepatic lesion: Found on CT abd/pelvis which showed a hypoenhanncing hepatic lesion which may reflect focal hepatic steatosis, but a primary mass such as HCC cannot be excluded on this single-phase study.
#Hypertension: Typically hypertensive, but was hypotensive during [**Month/Day/Year **] with improvement to systolic 110s while on lasix during last day of hospitalization.
#Thrombocytopenia:  Likely related to sepsis, but with concern for cirrhosis this etiology must be ruled out.
#Transitional Issues: -Outpatient follow up with PCP [**Name10 (NameIs) **] biopsy to rule out cirrhosis -Contrast-enhanced MRI or multiphasic CT to rule out HCC -Florastor for any future course of abx -Code Status: Full Code (Confirmed) -Contact: Daughter, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **], is his health care proxy: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91841**]/cell: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91842**].

You were diagnosed with an infection called clostridium difficile (C.diff) infection that caused low blood pressures.
In order to prevent reinfection or spread of infection, wash your hands after every bathroom trip and before every meal.
