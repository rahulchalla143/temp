HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus, history of prior myocardial infarction, numerous syncopal episodes in past of unknown etiology, who noticed increased fatigue and decreased PO intake over the past two to three weeks.
She did lose consciousness for a short period.
There was no history of chest pain or shortness of breath, dizziness, vertigo, or palpitations.
The patient attends a physical therapy program every week, where she does note bilateral dull shoulder pain, which was different from her anginal pain, previously, which she experienced with mild physical activity.
Per the patient, she does not note any decreased exercise tolerance or any episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in the recent week.
The patient does not have any baseline orthopnea.
The patient has not noticed any increase in peripheral edema or weight gain over the past few days.
Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in [**2115**] with cardiac catheterization and RC stent in [**2115-6-15**], [**8-/2119**] catheterization, RCA with 40% stenotic in the midportion, 30% distally, LAD 70% mid portion stenosis, D1 70% to 80% stenosis, left circumflex diffusely diseased and completely occluded beyond the first obtuse marginal branch.
Moderate MR, moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Congestive heart failure.
Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, trace MR, left wall thickness normal.
Echocardiogram, [**2121-1-14**], EF 10% to 15%, moderate MR, left ventricular hypokinesis.
Borderline pulmonary systolic hypertension.
Echocardiogram, [**Month (only) 1096**]  [**2121**], ejection fraction 30% to 35% no LVH, severe hypokinesis to akinesis of basal inferior septum and inferior posterior wall.
Remaining segments were low normal to mildly hypokinetic.
Mild MR.  Persantine stress test:  [**2119-1-14**], no anginal symptoms, no EKG changes.
Partially reversible inferolateral perfusion defect with left inferior wall involvement on a prior study.
Diabetes mellitus.
Orthostatic hypertension.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Bilateral cataract status post surgery.
Polymyalgia rheumatica.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No family history of premature coronary artery disease or temporal arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica.
GENERAL: The patient is a pleasant female with no apparent disease.
HEENT:  Bruise on upper lip, no JVD, mucous membranes moist.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Lungs revealed crackles [**2-16**] of the way up.
ABDOMEN:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound or guarding.
Chest x-ray revealed congestive heart failure, left ventricular enlargement.
CT of the head revealed no hemorrhage, no mass effect, no infarct.
EKG revealed old left bundle branch block, ST segment elevation only about 1  mm elevations in V2 through V5.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name **] Service, where she ruled in for myocardial infarction by CKs and troponins.
The patient was held off the carvedilol secondary to active congestive heart failure.
Unfortunately, this worsened the congestive heart failure with crackles remaining 2/3rds of the way up, even after IV Lasix dose.
Renal consultation was curbsided and it turns out that the patient had hypoaldosteronism in the past, which explains her chronically elevated levels of potassium and three times a week of Kayexalate.
On [**2121-9-30**], the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation, which is new.
The atrial fibrillation was accompanied by systolic blood pressure dropping into the 70s and heart rate jumping into the 120s.
The patient also noted an episode of right shoulder pain at that time and EKG revealing atrial fibrillation and rate-related ST segment changes.
The patient could not be given beta blocker or Cardizem due to decreased blood pressure.
The patient's pain resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
It was decided that the patient should go to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for elective cardioversion due to atrial fibrillation resulting in cardiovascular compromise.
The patient, during the cardiac catheterization, had runs of V tachycardia, which converted by defibrillation.
The patient had a balloon pump placed.
She was continued on heparin since she had ruled in for a second MI due to that brief episode of chest pain.
Urine culture at that time was also found be positive as was the chest x-ray with a question of left lobe infiltrate.
The patient was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for a ten-day course due to the possibility of aspiration pneumonia with the intubation, as well as positive urine culture for E. coli.
It was suggested that the patient's ACE and beta blocker were to be restarted, but she remained in CHF and the beta blocker was deferred.
IV Vancomycin was also started, while she was in the coronary care unit for one out of four bottles positive for gram-positive cocci, which was possibly thought to be a contaminate, but secondary to the presence of central line.
Of note, on the day prior to discharge from coronary care unit, the patient had an echocardiogram done, which revealed severely depressed LV systolic function, ejection fraction of 20% to 25%, anteroseptal inferior hypokinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
On the second day, status post coronary care unit stay, the Digoxin was discontinued, secondary to heart rates around 56 since she was on Amiodarone, Digoxin, and beta blocker at this time.
The beta-blocker was held secondary to acute congestive heart failure.
The ACE inhibitor was also held due to high creatinine and potassium and hypokalemia.
Hemolysis labs were performed, which were not consistent with acute hemolysis, only an LDH, which had been elevated.
The patient was continued on her gastrointestinal prophylaxis and Reglan for nausea, from an Infectious Disease standpoint.
Of note, the patient was markedly depressed after her coronary care unit stay.
The patient was also referred for social worker consultation to discuss some of her depression and the recent myocardial infarction.
The patient was also to be followed up by the Department of Physical Therapy for evaluation on Monday to see if her new MI and numerous interventions would prevent her from returning back to her independent lifestyle.
