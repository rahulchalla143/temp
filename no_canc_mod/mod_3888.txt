HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with a complicated medical history including type 1 diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled with triopathy), coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease who was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] where he was intubated for congestive heart failure and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
The patient was in respiratory distress and also required emergent dialysis (acute renal failure for initiation of hemodialysis for volume overload) and anemia (requiring recent transfusions) and discharged home on [**2166-12-2**] without outpatient Nephropathy and Cardiology appointments.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] has had increased pain and can hardly walk.
No fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or back pain.
The pain is the worst the patient has ever experienced in his life, even to light touch.
He has increased swelling of the left foot and no trauma.
The patient's pain went from [**11-14**] to [**4-14**].
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (with recent diabetic ketoacidosis).
Coronary artery disease.
(b)  status post a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction on [**2166-11-11**].
(c)  A stress on [**2166-11-5**] showed no perfusion defects and an ejection fraction of 40%.
Moderate new fixed defect.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with recent acute renal failure; started hemodialysis on [**11-21**] to [**2166-11-26**]).
A renal ultrasound in [**2166-11-5**] was consistent with chronic interstitial disease.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post revascularization on the left times two and on the right times three.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 51% on echocardiogram in [**2166-11-5**] and 40% on Persantine MIBI in [**2166-11-5**]).
Also with symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, as well as anteroseptal and apical hypokinesis.
Magnetic resonance angiography of the kidneys in [**2166-12-6**] with mild stenosis of the proximal renal artery on the right.
No history of gout or cellulitis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history of coronary artery disease in a brother.
Brother with a myocardial infarction at the age of 40.
In general, the patient was a gentleman in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a systolic murmur.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
Back examination revealed no tenderness.
Extremity examination revealed the left foot with dorsal edema (pitting), erythema on the left lateral around the medial malleolus, some left lateral leg erythema.
Motor strength was [**6-9**] in the left ankle but with pain bilaterally.
The right foot with edema but less than on the left.
Extensor hallucis longus weak bilaterally.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A left ankle film revealed cortical irregularities along the medial malleolus and small osseous fragment distal to the tip of the medial malleolus and lateral to the medial malleolus.
The medial malleolus fragment was linear and appeared less likely to be chronic in nature.
There was no dislocation or destructive osseous lesions.
There was soft tissue swelling noted around the medial and lateral malleoli.
There was no evidence of osteomyelitis, small fragments around the medial and lateral malleoli were more consistent with an acute fracture, although they both may be chronic.
A chest x-ray revealed mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure and cardiomegaly.
Repeat ankle films were done on [**12-29**], as the patient remained with an elevated white blood cell count.
This revealed old inferior malleolar medial evulsion injuries.
Possible small evulsion injury at the anterolateral aspect of the tibia is unusual location in the absence of point tenderness and likely little clinical significance.
The patient remained afebrile throughout his hospitalization, but given his foot infection on [**12-28**], ciprofloxacin was added given his diabetes and prednisone was held.
Therefore, oxacillin was discontinued and vancomycin was started given the recent hospitalizations and therefore at increased risk of having a resistant bug.
Additionally, Rheumatology was consulted who felt that gout was not suspected in this case and there  was no evidence for septic arthritis.
They recommended arterial Duplex of the lower extremities given the patient's history of bypass graft bilaterally.
This showed widely patent left-sided femoral-tibial bypass graft; however, it did show high-grade stenosis within the medial portion of the patient's jump graft on the right at approximately the gastrocnemius level.
Given that the left graft was patent and it was the left side with the cellulitis, it was felt no intervention was need at this time.
The erythema of the area did improve slightly, but there was a darkened area that appeared more ecchymotic than necrotic which remained unchanged.
The patient remained requiring narcotics for pain control.
This showed no evidence of acute fracture.
It showed peroneal tenosynovitis with surrounding soft tissue edema and adjacent bone marrow edema involving the posterolateral lateral malleolus and lateral aspect of the calcaneous and diffuse soft tissue and subcutaneous edema most marked in the plantar deep tissues.
No discrete deep fluid collection and minimal enterosepsis tear of the distal Achilles tendon.
On [**1-4**], the Vascular Service debrided the eschar at the bedside and purulent serous fluid drained and was sent for culture.
This showed diffuse muscle and subcutaneous edema with fluid extending to the sagittal planes in the left greater than right calf edema nonspecific with the differential including infectious myositis or diabetic myonecrosis.
Diffuse subcutaneous and fascial edema may be related to cellulitis fluid overload, venous insufficiency, or fasciitis.
No focal abscess was identified.
On [**1-7**], it was decided that because of the possible spread and seeding of further tissues the patient needed to go to the operating room for incision and drainage and exploration.
The patient had an incision and drainage of the left ankle under local anesthesia and MAC anesthesia.
During this procedure 10 cc to 15 cc of purulent discharge was found and cultured as well as liquefying necrosis being found.
Dressing changes were done twice per day (per Podiatry recommendations), and the patient remained nonweightbearing with foot elevation and multipoultice boot in place.
The patient's pain was well controlled using Tylenol 1 gram q.6h., oxycodone as needed, and intravenous morphine only for breakthrough pain.
Swabs from the bedside incision and drainage on [**1-4**] showed 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes on Gram stain but grew nothing on culture.
Swabs from the operating room on [**1-7**] grew rare Staphylococcus coagulation positive.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  On [**12-27**], the patient had a chest x-ray showing moderate congestive heart failure with desaturations to 87% on room air.
The patient did not have symptoms of shortness of breath.
His standing Lasix had been discontinued secondary to increased creatinine, and Lasix was then dosed as needed secondary to his creatinine and clinical fluid status.
He was also noted to have an elevated jugular venous pulsation.
A repeat chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular engorgement with interstitial edema with small bilateral pleural effusions; essentially unchanged from [**12-27**].
At that time, secondary to his acute-on-chronic renal failure, it was felt prudent to start Natrecor rather than use Lasix to attempt diuresis.
The patient continued to have intermittent oxygen needs and jugular venous pulsation as well as crackles in his lungs.
However, a chest x-ray on [**1-2**] showed persistent vascular engorgement, bilateral perihilar haziness, as well as diffuse interstitial pattern; probably unchanged, but a right small pleural effusion did slightly increase.
Over the course of the next several days, the patient was noted to have worsening oxygen saturations and an increasing oxygen requirement as well as a worsening lung examination with increasing rales; however, the patient remained asymptomatic throughout this.
On [**1-6**], the patient had a repeat chest x-ray which showed worsening congestive heart failure.
However, despite this, it was felt urgent and necessary to take the patient to the operating room on [**1-7**] for debridement of his infection to help prevent spread and further seeding.
A chest x-ray from [**1-12**] showed a slight improvement in congestive heart failure and continued bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions.
The patient did receive some Lasix given his congestive heart failure.
Previously, the patient had been noted to have mild renal artery stenosis on the right.
A renal ultrasound was repeated on [**12-30**] which showed no significant change compared to [**11-28**].
There was no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or masses.
There was increased echogenicity in both kidneys.
It was felt that this was more likely due to blood loss from phlebotomy and procedures such as incision and drainage, open wound, and peripherally inserted central catheter line in the setting of anemia of chronic disease.
He had trace ketones in his urine, but large acetones in his blood.
It was felt the patient was in diabetic ketoacidosis, although the etiology was unclear.
It was possible that this was due to stress from the operating room or possibly a missed insulin dose.
The patient was ruled out by enzymes for a myocardial infarction.
HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  On admission, the patient was noted to be very hypertensive.
It was thought that perhaps this was secondary to pain and missed medications prior to admission.
Blood pressures will need to be followed closely as significantly elevated blood pressures most likely will make his congestive heart failure difficult to control.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  On admission, the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.
He had a troponin of 0.05, but this was felt to be secondary to his congestive heart failure and renal failure and not an acute myocardial infarction.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and was only noted to have rare single premature ventricular contractions and occasional sinus bradycardia.
The patient was nauseous intermittently, but the electrocardiograms remained unchanged.
These were checked because he is a diabetic and has never had chest pain.
After the episode of diabetic ketoacidosis to was again cycled and was negative by enzymes.
On [**1-2**], the patient developed a very loud 2:3 component pericardial rub.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 50%, a P-R gradient of 49% to 54%, moderately dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular free wall motion was normal, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
There was no pericardial effusion.
The rub then disappeared and was heard intermittently throughout the following days of his hospitalization for short periods.
It was felt unlikely to be [**Last Name (un) 21160**] given his non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in [**2166-11-5**], had negative creatine kinases, and only mild troponin levels, and his echocardiogram did not show any focal wall motion abnormalities.
However, his alkaline phosphatase and glutamyltransferase were noted to be elevated with an alkaline phosphatase of 327 and a glucose tolerance test of 241; however, this had been chronically elevated since [**2166-2-5**].
In [**2166-2-5**], an abdominal ultrasound showed cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis, and no evidence of biliary ductal distention to suggest obstruction.
As this seemed to be a chronic problem, it was suggested that this followed up as an outpatient.
ORTHOPAEDIC ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have a small Achilles tendon tear on magnetic resonance imaging.
PAIN ISSUES:  The patient had significant pain on admission and was put on a morphine patient-controlled analgesia.
However, he felt that he became confused on the patient-controlled analgesia as well as feeling an increase in his nausea.
Additionally, he was receiving rate morphine for breakthrough pain.
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were avoided given his acute renal failure.
VASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have severe stenosis of the right peripheral graft on study.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient's x-rays showed significant congestive heart failure.
However, he developed a cough, and an infection could not be excluded from the x-ray.
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ISSUES:  On [**1-6**], it was noted that the patient had significant swelling in the right upper extremity, very asymmetric to the left, with pitting in the dependent portions.
He had no neurologic compromise with good strength, good capillary refill, and 2+ radial pulses on that side.
There was no erythema, pain, or heat.
An ultrasound of the right upper extremity was performed which showed no clot of fluid collection.
It was treated with elevation and total body diuresis, and the swelling seemed to improve.
PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on a bowel regimen, subcutaneous heparin, Protonix, and incentive spirometry.
