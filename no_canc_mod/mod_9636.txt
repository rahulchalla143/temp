Admission Date:  [**2109-8-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2109-8-9**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old woman with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presented to an outside hospital complaining of mid-sternal pressure like chest pain which he rated 7 out of 10 in severity.
The patient states she had chest pain the night prior but it went away and she thought it was just gas.
She says that the pain radiates to both arms causing tingling.
She also has nausea but no vomiting, no diaphoresis, and no increase in her normal shortness of breath.
The patient denies similar chest pain in the recent past.
She has no orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, but she states that in the last month she had been having some lower extremity edema.
The patient has a questionable history of congestive heart failure and says in the past she was hospitalized approximately eight years ago with shortness of breath and some chest pain, and was told that she has congestive heart failure.
The patient was admitted to the outside hospital and had ST elevations in leads V2 through V4.
She was started on sublingual Nitroglycerin times two, heparin, aspirin, a Nitroglycerin drip, with a resolution of her chest pain.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from chronic bronchitis.
Diabetes mellitus.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Congestive heart failure.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Left anterior descending showed proximal 80% tubular stenosis, 30 to 40% mid-tubular stenosis and mild diffuse disease distally.
The left circumflex supplies a large distal obtuse marginal; luminal irregularities throughout.
Ramus was small caliber but tubular subtotal occlusion was present proximally with slow flow.
The right coronary artery had ulcerated proximal 40% stenosis and diffuse mild disease.
The ramus lesion was dilated with some improvement in flow, however, the decision was made to not attempt a stent as it is unlikely to be the culprit vessel.
On admission, her temperature was 97.0 F.; blood pressure 111/81; pulse 95 with normal sinus rhythm and occasional premature ventricular contractions.
She was a pale, elderly woman in no acute distress.
No jugular venous pressure was present or carotid bruit.
Distant heart sounds; regular rate; S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs had bibasilar crackles and positive for expiratory wheezing.
The patient had trace edema, good radial pulses and dorsalis pedis pulses.
The femoral sheath site was in the right femoral vein and was not bleeding and no bruit was present.
Old EKG on [**2109-7-17**], showed 94 beats per minute, normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.
No axis deviation.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has coronary artery disease with two vessel disease seen on catheterization status post stenting of her proximal left anterior descending, so she was continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Integrilin for 18 hours.
Beta blockers were initially withheld secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but were started the following morning, attempted trial first with a 5 mg push which was tolerated.
The patient did not have any respiratory issues.
The patient had no further chest pain during the hospital course.
Pump - the patient had elevated PA pressure and capillary wedge pressures and was diuresed with Lasix.
Conclusions were left atrium is normal size, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the distal half of the septum, anterior wall and distal lateral inferior walls.
The apex is also akinetic, but not aneurysmal and no discrete left ventricular thrombus is seen.
The patient has no aortic regurgitation, no significant aortic stenosis, one plus mitral regurgitation and an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure normal.
IMPRESSION:  Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with extensive regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease, a mid left anterior descending that wraps around the apex, mild mitral regurgitation.
Rate and rhythm:  The patient had an elevated rate on the night of admission.
She was sedated and given some Diltiazem 20 mg intravenous push with some resolution of her tachycardia.
Overnight, she had an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
If the patient continues to have episodes of atrial fibrillation, the patient may require long-term anti-coagulation.
Pulmonary:  The patient has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was started back on her Atrovent and Albuterol nebulizers and daily dose of Prednisone 10 mg.  She was initially quite wheezy on admission but after nebulizers improved.
There were no active issues.
Nutrition:  The patient was advanced to cardiac and diabetic diet.
Infectious Disease:  The patient's white blood cell count was elevated, likely secondary to her myocardial infarction.
The patient remained afebrile and had a low white blood cell count and no active Infectious Disease issues.
The patient was placed on Protonix as a GI prophylaxis.
Acute myocardial infarction status post catheterization with stenting of proximal left anterior descending.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Diabetes mellitus.
