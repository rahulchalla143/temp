No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.

Provisional Findings Impression: SPfc SAT [**2128-12-4**] 10:57 AM PFI: No change from [**2128-3-24**] and overall no acute intracranial process.
If clinical suspicion exists for acute infarction, MRI is a more sensitive modality for evaluation.
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or vascular territorial infarction.
Ventricles and sulci are enlarged, consistent with parenchymal volume loss and unchanged from the comparison study.
There is cerebellar and brainstem atrophy.
Also unchanged is bilateral periventricular white matter hypodensity, reflecting chronic microvascular infarction.
Scattered calcifications throughout the intracranial parenchyma are unchanged.
There is no fracture.
Included paranasal sinuses reveal mild mucosal thickening bilaterally at the ethmoid air cells, unchanged from the comparison study.
IMPRESSION: No change from [**2128-3-24**] and overall no acute intracranial process.
If clinical suspicion exists for acute infarction, MRI is a more sensitive modality for evaluation.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] DR.

After discharge, he developed significant respiratory distress at home and dysarthria.
He was found to have bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on CXR.
DFA has returned negative for influenza and the Oseltamivir has been discontinued.
Neurology saw him in consultation and were not worried about an acute stroke, rather felt his acute illness was resulting in a delirium/acute encephalopathy unmasking prior strokes/ischemic damage.
Neurology did note that his CT showed marked cerebellar atrophy and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] stated, "Assess: Given the degree of atrophy in the cerebellum and pons it would not be unusual for this gentleman to experience dysarthria, dysphagia, oculomotor abnormalities and ataxia in the setting of infections or other metabolic stresses.
I do not have a reliable FMH but the appearance is consistent with OPCA, a collection of sporadic and inherited degenerative disorders that usually present at a much younger age but can present as late as the 8th decade.
However, he has not experienced any conclusive clinical evidence of these disorders except when he is infected.
Given his age and comorbid conditions he does not require further evaluation unless these symptoms should return."
On [**12-6**], he was noted to be confused with hallucinations overnight.
There are multiple possible precipitants - infection, bacteremia, change in environment, underlying cognitive dysfunction, language barrier etc.
EKG was noted to be unremarkable per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his labs were not significantly changed except for a mild elevated BUN, his rectal exam was without stool impaction, KUB showed: small amount of stool in the decending colon consistent with mild constipation.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12332**] from Neurology who stated Neurology feels his deficits are all secondary to a multifactorial encephalopathy and recommended supportive care.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] was stopped on [**12-6**] given his mild constipation.
He had an EGD in [**12/2127**] that showed gastritis and a colonoscopy in [**12/2127**] that was normal to the cecum.
Due to day-night disorientation and daytime somnolence on [**12-6**], he had poor oral intake and was given a 500 cc bolus of Normal Saline.
On [**12-7**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was much improved, alert, interactive, tolerated a normal breakfast and offered no complaints.
