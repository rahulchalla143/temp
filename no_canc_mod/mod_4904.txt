There are pleural effusions, right greater than left, a small amount of perihepatic ascites.
The gallbladder is collapsed with an abnormally thickened wall - likely reflecting liver disease.
There is no pericholecystic fluid.

Brief Hospital Course: MICU Course: 72 year old male transferred from rehba to the MICU for congestive hepatopathy and encephalopathy due to Afib with RVR whose heart condition continued to decompensate and it was determined that given his poor perfusion and recent studies that he has end stage heart dieseae and  changed his goals of care to comfort measures only.
# Acute hepatitis- patient was originally admitted with transaminitits and this was felt to be int he setting of poor forward flow of the heart given his Afib with RVR.
# A. fib with RVR: Pt with a known history of atrial fibrillation with BiV ICD.
His warfarin was d/c'd due to his changes in goals of care to CMO.
# End stage heart failure- Patient has history of both systolic and diastolic heart failure with an EF of 15-20%.
His medical management was optimized however due to his low blood presures and EF.
It was then felt that his heart failure with worsening renal function was end stage, and his goals of care were changed to CMO.
# Acute renal failure- Patient had intermittently elevated Cr in the setting of oliguria likely due to decreased perfusion of his kidneys from his poor cardiac output.
#Cystitis: Patient had a positive urine culture for E. coli.
No associated complications.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses End stage heart failure Acute Renal Failure Congestive Hepatopathy Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate  Secondary diagnoses: Insulin dependent type II diabetes   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
We discussed with you and your health care proxy that the long term prognosis for the heart not pumping well were not good, and that you have end stage heart failure.
