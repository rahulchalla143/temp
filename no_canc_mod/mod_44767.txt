She in fact developed abdominal pain 10 days ago, on good [**Hospital1 2974**], and presented to LGH.
She was called back for possible pulmonary edema, and to rule out MI, which was negative.
After discharge, she continued to have abdominal pain, with nausea and anorexia.
The pain has been constant, throughout her entire abdomen, and radiating to her back.
The pain was not relieved by tylenol.
She has had shortness of breath with the pain.
Prior to the onset of pain, she had been taking protein shakes, substituting for one meal a day, for weight loss.
She denies any other urinary symptoms, rashes, diarrhea, masses or lesions.
Past Medical History: PMH Hypertension, poorly controlled ?Hyperlipidemia ?CKD Prior CCY, [**2089**] Prior hysterectomy, for benign mass Prior abnormal pap smears   Social History: SH: Originally from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].
No alcohol or tobacco.
Lungs:  decreased at bases, no rales, no wheezes with forced expiration.
CV:  RRR without murmurs Abdomen: soft, tender in epigastrium, and throughout upper abdomen, no rebound or guarding.
Ext:  no edema Neuro:  alert/oriented X3, face symmetric, answers all questions appropriately, full strength in upper and lower extremities.
Status post cholecystectomy with common bile duct dilatation to 13 mm, but no intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
MRCP is a more sensitive exam for the detection of choledocholithiasis and can be performed for further evaluation.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration of the liver.
More severe hepatic disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this study  EKG [**3-21**] SB nl axis, intervals, no ischemic changes.
Labs at LGH [**3-21**]: Cr 1.04 Alk phos 372 Bili 5.4 AST 732 alt 911 Lipase 6741  CT from LGH, dissection protocol:  No dissection, found to have acute pancreatitis, without pseudocyst or abscess.
Small 5 mm increased density in the region of the pancreatic head/distal CBD could be an obstructing stone/choledocholithiasis.
Two more balloon sweeps were performed that did not reveal additional stones or sludge.
Impression: The ampulla appeared bulging concerning for an impacted stone Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 13 mm.
However given the clinical picture  suggestive of gallstone pancreatitis and the finding of bulging ampulla concerning for an impacted stone, a decision was made to perform a sphincterotomy.
Two more balloon sweeps were performed that did not reveal additional stones or sludge.
Otherwise normal ercp to second part of the duodenum   [**2102-3-26**] 06:10AM BLOOD ALT-132* AST-25 LD(LDH)-223 AlkPhos-159* TotBili-0.7  Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: 66F with PMHx of hypertension, s/p CCY [**2089**], who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from LGH for acute gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP w/sphincterotomy [**3-22**], hospital course complicated by new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
# Afib w/RVR: After the ERCP, the patient developed new-onset afib w/RVR.
A TTE was performed which showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, However there was mild left atrial dilatation which may have been a cause or effect of the atrial fibrillation.
# Hypoxemia: Most likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the context of fluid resuscitation and new atrial fibrillation.
LFTs are trending down and she reports improvement in her abdominal pain.
Likely due to inflammation from acute pancreatitis.
S/p ERCP w/sphincterotomy; no evidence of cholangitis on ERCP, but given low-grade fevers (99.5) and increasing leukocytosis, started empiric cipro.
No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
# Hypertension:  She was discharged on amlodipine and metoprolol.
NASH/hepatic fibrosis on ultrasound.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: gallstone pancreatitis atrial fibrillation pumonary edema   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with abdominal pain and found to have pancreatitis caused by gallstones.
Your course was complicated by Atrial Fibrillation (irregular heart rhythm) with rapid heart rate and fluid in the lung requiring ICU stay.
You will need to follow up with your PCP to discuss treatment for Atrial Fibrillation with at least daily aspirin, but this may also include an additonal medication, Clopidogrel.
