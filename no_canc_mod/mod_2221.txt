Admission Date:  [**2134-8-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-9-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-5-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Dilantin / Tegretol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: ICH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 71 yo woman transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital after having unresponsive episode at home followed by vomitting that was witnessed by husband.
Husband reports patient had a staring spell followed by dizzy/drunken walking to the bathroom and being unable to get there in time.
She had urinary incontinence.
Head CT revealed large R frontal IPH.
Past Medical History: 1. left PICA aneurism clipping after prior SAH [**2126**], [**2129**] 2. two other aneurisms, one at the left C2 segment of the caroted and another at the ophthalmic segment of the left internal carotid 3. amyloid angiopathy [**5-28**] - episode of ptosis on the right along with mild right facial droop in mid-may.
MRI showed new small areas of susceptibility, suggesting amyloid angiopathy.
4. osteoporosis 5. generalized convulsive seizures [**11/2128**] - EEG that showed right frontal theta and sharp waves but no spike-slow waves.
There is evidence of old right frontal infarct where she had prior intraparenchymal blood at the time of her SAH.
She was placed on AEDs to prevent seizures from this right frontal cortical lesion.
6. atrial fibrillation/AV paced - h/o vasovagal syncope on autonomic testing with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], who also has a history of recurrent palpitations associated with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
pcp is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15505**] [**Name9 (PRE) **] DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia   Social History: former teacher of cosmatology for vocational school, no Tob or ETOH, lives with husband of 49 years in a house.
Family History: irregular heart beat, father, brother  Physical Exam: vitals: T 97 rectal, 122/77 afib AV paced, 74, 100% CMV 450X18 100% PEEP 5 Gen: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: intubated, arousable to voice Neck: ETT CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2 Lung: well ventilated bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Intubated and responsive to voice.
No observed myoclonus or tremor.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Final [**2134-9-16**]):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Final [**2134-9-21**]):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2134-9-7**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Final [**2134-11-8**]):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
STUDIES:  [**8-28**] Head CT: Unchanged large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension as before.
Newly apparent subarachnoid blood within the sulci of the left frontal lobe.
[**8-28**] Head CT: Large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and questionable subfalcine herniation.
[**8-28**] EEG: This is an abnormal EEG due to the poorly formed background activity and bursts of generalized slowing.
These abnormalities suggest diffuse cortical dysfunction, which may be seen with infections,  medication effect, toxic metabolic abnormalities or ischemia.
The sharply contoured activity over the F4 electrode was consistent with electrode artifact.
Since the previous tracing of [**2130-5-15**] native beats show T wave inversions in leads V1-V2.
No significant interval change in appearance of the brain compared to yesterday's study.
Again demonstrated is a large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and associated subfalcine herniation to the left.
A small amount of subarachnoid blood of the left frontal lobe sulci appears similar.
Patency of the carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations as well as the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and its major tributaries.
Differential dx included ateriovenous malformation, aneurysm rupture, mass, hypertension or amyloid (most likely).
On head CT, there was a 4cm x 13 slices right frontal hemorrhage with extension to 3rd ventricle.
Repeat head CT [**8-28**] showed no major change.
Concern that she might be seizing, an EEG was performed and showed diffuse cortical dysfunction.
She was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
On [**8-29**], patient developed impaired upgaze, emesis, concern for hydrocephalus.
CTA was negative for aneurysm.
Unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker.
Patient was started on mannitol due to increased ventricular size.
Repeat EEG showed [**12-28**] Hz rhythmic spike wave complexes bifrontal.
Patient did develop pneumonia and grew MORAXELLA CATARRHALIS on sputum culture.
PPX: pneumoboots, bowel reg, ppi, RISS  DISPO: Family meeting was held on [**9-3**] to discuss goals given poor prognosis.
