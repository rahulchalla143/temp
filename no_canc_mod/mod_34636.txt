On exam he had decreased lung sounds at bases and was coughing up white sputum.
ABG was pH 7.12/103/87 and patient placed on BIPAP 25/5 with 60% FiO2, he then became hypotensive and got IVFs to restore his BP.
Pt had hypernatremia over last few days treated w/free water flushes.
Noteable studies: He had CXR which showed no signs massive aspiration but atelectasis on LLL and additional Chest CT showed left pleural effusion.

His respiratory failure was thought to be related to chronic aspiration and and a large chronic left sided pleural effusion (present since  [**4-5**].)
He had a PEG tube placed, and a repeat speech and swallow evaluation performed which showed Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of level 1, not safe for pos.
He experienced no complications, and his oxygenation improved to the point that he no longer required oxygen.
Pt was alert and oriented times 3, and was cheerful and conversant with his providers.
He did not have any new neurological deficits.
Recurrent aspiration pneumonia 2.
Unilateral transudative pleural effusion 3.
History of ischemic stroke 4.
Atrial fibrillation 5.
Pt has had borderline low potassium, phos, magnesium.
Recommend reassess swallow eval in [**1-31**] weeks to assess for improvements that may allow po intake.
