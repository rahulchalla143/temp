emergency department.
He had a CT torso which did not show pneumonia and he had a non-contrast CT head which was negative.
LP was not performed because of elevated INR.
MRI of the head showed no evidence of any infection.
Patient was mildly hypotensive but never required pressors.
Pt was continued on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin to cover for possible bacterial meningitis for full two week course (last day of treatment will be [**2184-4-30**]).
It is unclear it patient had a known diagnosis of diabetes prior to his hospital admission but he was found to have a HgbA1C of 13 at presentation consistent with longstanding diabetes.
On presentation, pt's EKG demosntrated deep ST wave depressions and T wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads.
He denies any history of chest pain.
He had been on digoxin on presentation but his digoxin level was found to be 1.5 and he initially had bradycardia so his digoxin was held.
Cardiac enzymes were elevated on presentation but trended downward with clinical picture more consistant with demand ischemia rather than true ACS.
Patient did not have any episodes of chest pain throughout his hospital course.
Pt has a history of atrial fibrillation which was rate controlled on metoprolol.
Patient's digoxin was held during this admission due to mild bradycardia.
Of note, patient had mild episode of acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine in the ICU.
Pt was also found to have a small right heal ulcer on presentation which he had not been aware of prior to admission.

You were also noted to have elevated blood sugars and started on an insulin sliding scale and glargine.
You should work with your primary care doctor as an outpatient to determine the best regimen to control you blood glucose levels .
We also found a small ulcer on your right heel and left fore arm that we are treating with daily wet-to-dry dressing changes Medication changes include: * We started amlodipine, glargine, antibiotics (ampicillin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone), lovenox until you are therapeutic on your coumadin, and lipitor * We increased your Aspirin to 325mg per day * We changed your Metoprolol to 75 PO three times per day * Your heart rate was slightly low when you were admitted therefore we did not give you your digoxin.
