Admission Date:  [**2135-12-13**]     Discharge Date: [**2135-12-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-6-14**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year-old female wit peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, carotid disease (40 to 59% on the right and 40% on the left), subclavian stenosis, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25% status post ICD.
The patient was in her usual state of health prior to admission, yesterday complained of substernal chest pain at around 12:00 p.m. characterized 5 out of 10 radiating across shoulders, diaphoresis and no other associated symptoms.
Pain to door was approximately three hours.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2135-12-14**] showed LMCA with distal 30%, left anterior descending coronary artery osteal 40% with diffuse disease and serial 70 to 80% stenosis in mid vessel and distal luminal irregularities.
Left circumflex showed diffuse tortuous disease with 90% serial stenosis around mid vessel.
Ventricular tachycardia status post ICD placement in [**5-7**].
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2129**] after acute myocardial infarction, left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, arteritic, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery occluded, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal two occluded.
ETT on [**2-7**] at outside hospital showed lateral fixed defect and anterolateral ischemia.
Mitral regurgitation 4+ shown on catheterization of [**5-7**] and 1+ AI.
Cardiovascular disease with carotid stenosis bilaterally.
Peripheral vascular disease with bilateral claudication right more then left.
Atrial fibrillation complicated by Amiodarone toxicity (pulmonary).
Left subclavian stenosis (70%) with 60 mmHg gradient, prior to left internal mammary coronary artery.
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 40% in [**5-7**].
General, pleasant, elderly female in no acute distress.
Neck sight audible bruits bilaterally, no lymphadenopathy.
No dullness to percussion.
Extremities nonpalpable dorsalis pedis pulse or posterior tibial pulse.
No femoral bruits.
Electrocardiogram interpretation left axis deviation, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in 1, L, T waves in 3 and F, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V2 through V6, left atrial hypertrophy.
Echocardiogram in [**2135**], severe left ventricular dysfunction with EF of 25%, atrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation (4+ on cardiac catheterization).
Left anterior descending coronary artery 40% with diffuse disease and serial 70 to 80% stenosis in mid vessel and distal luminal irregularities.
Left circumflex diffuse tortuous disease with 90% serial stenosis at mid vessel.
Left anterior descending coronary artery, proximal calcifications 60% stenosis, serial 70 to 90% stenosis to distal vessel.
Left circumflex no significant change from yesterday.
Intervention, mid vessel of left anterior descending coronary artery was dissected by the balloon inflation distal flow down the artery was lost.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissections and 0% residual stenosis in the stents and a 1.5 to 2.0 mm diagonal with residual 90% stenosis mid vessel and 40% stenosis in the ostium.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Indications for echocardiogram were evaluation for pericardial effusion.
Portal chest x-ray on [**2135-12-18**] indication, fever and pleuritic chest pain.
Impression was mild congestive heart failure with interstitial edema, superimposed upon the more chronic interstitial pattern, which has been previously treated with IVF.
New left basilar opacity, which may be related to pneumonia.
There is also a new small left pleural effusion.
The patient had intervention on the left circumflex that was complicated by dissection and perforation.
The patient was watched closely via telemetry and hemodynamic monitoring.
The morning after the cardiac catheterization the patient was complaining of chest pain 7 out of 10 across the shoulders.
Electrocardiogram showed worsening ST depressions in leads V3 and V4.
The patient was then transferred to the floor and remained hemodynamically stable with no telemetry events.
On the floor the patient complained of two further episodes of chest pain relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
Hence, she was placed on Imdur 30 q day and was chest pain for the subsequent two days.
No evidence of overt blood loss on examination.
At that time she was complaining of some pleuritic chest pain with shortness of breath necessitating nasal cannula for 2 liters.
Chest x-ray was taken, which showed mild congestive heart failure with interstitial edema, superimposed upon a more chronic interstitial pattern, which has been previously treated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
New left basilar opacity, which may be related to pneumonia.
There is also a new small left pleural effusion.
At this point it was decided to start the patient on Levaquin 500 mg q 24 hours for early developing pneumonia.
