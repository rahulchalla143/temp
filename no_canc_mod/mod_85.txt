There is no pleural effusion.
There is a striated appearance of bilateral kidneys, with peripheral wedge- shaped hypodensities bilaterally.
However, there is circumferential wall thickening involving both ureters throughout its course.
These findings are overall suggestive of bilateral pyelonephritis, with associated ureteritis.
The appendix is not definitively visualized, without secondary findings to suggest acute appendicitis.
There is no free fluid or free air.
Scattered retroperitoneal nodes are seen, not meeting CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Urinary bladder, rectum are unremarkable.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
IMPRESSION: Findings most compatible with bilateral pyelonephritis and ureteritis.
Although no discrete abscess is identified, a hypodensity within the left upper pole is seen, which may be at risk for developing into an abscess.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo female with hx of chronic hepatitis C infection (without cirrhosis) presenting to the ED with 4 day hx of dysuria, chills and found to have a grossly positive U/A with evidence of bilateral pyelonephritis on CT Abd/pelvis who became hypotensive to 80/30.
# Pyelonephritis/Sepsis: Pt w/ signs and sx of UTI for several days; most likely with ascending GU infection.
The patient has no recent UTIs or hx of resistent organisms.
CT scan of was performed and consistent with pyelonephritis w/ no discrete abscess, but showed a hypodensity that could represent possible developing abscess in the left upper pole.
Pt remains hypotensive (SBP 80-90) even after receiving 7L of IVFs, but likely was dehydrated prior to presentation and has high insensible losses due to fever.
Pt also reports a "low" blood pressure at baseline.
The patient's urine grew E. Coli and sensitivities were pending.
# Acute renal failure: The patient initial creatine was 1.1 and stablized to 1.0 today.
This is likely prerenal w/ combination of poor po intake, vomiting, fever.
# Chronic hepatitis C infection: Stable, has not required treatment.
# Lyme disease/Bell's palsy - resolving .
# PPx: heparin sc, bowel regimen .
# Access: PIV .

The patient was hypotensive in ICU (not pressor dependent), but was back to her baseline blood pressure at discharge and afebrile.
Additionally, the patient's CT scan showed a hypodensity within the left upper pole, which may be at risk for developing into an abscess.
Imaging should be repeated if symptoms worsen or recurrs after treatment.
