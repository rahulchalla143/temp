HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old gentleman with a history of severe dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**2142**] by catheterization, at which time he was found to have normal coronaries and elevated PA pressures of 80/45 with a cardiac output of 2.9 and 4+ mitral regurgitation.
It has been class 2 heart failure maintained on ACE inhibitor, Lasix, Digoxin and amiodarone.
In [**2148-5-15**], the patient had deterioration in his status with increased fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain.
Patient was found to be H. pylori positive, treated with antibiotics and on [**4-23**] had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed chronic inactive gastritis.
At the end of [**Month (only) 547**] the patient noted worsening of dyspnea on exertion as well as orthopnea.
Patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization and for inotropic therapy.
He had limited angiography but a patent LAD.
On arrival to the Cardiac Care Unit patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, palpitations, nausea or vomiting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Congestive heart failure:  severe dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**2142**], echocardiogram in [**2148-4-15**] showed ejection fraction of 15 to 20 percent, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, 1% atrial regurgitation, 4+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, catheterization in [**2142**] showed normal coronaries with a cardiac output of 2.9 and an index of 1.4.
2) History of peptic ulcer disease with H. pylori treated.
3) History of hypertension.
4) History of supraventricular tachycardia on Holter in [**2148-1-16**].
5) History of left bundle and intraventricular conduction delay.
6) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**4-16**] with chronic gastritis.
No known drug allergies.
General:  Patient is a pleasant thin, ill appearing gentleman lying flat in no acute distress.
Neck supple with jugular venous distention of 8 cm.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S3, loud s3, II/VI systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Left ventricular heave.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds with mild tenderness to epigastric region but no rebound or guarding.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema, 2+ pedal pulses.
Skin:  No rashes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 62 year-old gentleman with class 4 congestive heart failure and a severe dilating cardiomyopathy admitted for hemodynamic monitoring and Noridone therapy.
No evidence of ischemia.
Heart Failure:  Patient was class 4 congestive heart failure and severe dilating cardiomyopathy on milrinone therapy which was started at .4 mcg per minute which was ultimately titrated down during the hospital course to .3 due to hypotension.
The dosages of these medications were titrated down during his hospital stay due to hypotension.
The patient noted that throughout his hospital stay his symptoms of dyspnea and gnawing abdominal pain resolved such that he was able to ambulate multiple times daily as well as climb stairs without experiencing any symptoms.
He had a definite improvement in his symptomatology related to his class 4 congestive heart failure.
He was seen by the EP consultation service who decided he was not a candidate for biventricular pacing due to his significant mitral regurgitation, however, they agreed that a DDD pacer would be potentially beneficial for increased heart rate to increase the patient' cardiac output.
On [**5-24**] the patient had a DDD pacemaker placed without any complications and it has been functioning within normal limits throughout his hospital stay.
His symptoms and his weight were monitored closely.
Because of chronic severe pulmonary hypertension, transition from He The patient decided along with his family transition from He ambulatory Heart Mate LVAD to transplantation was recommendeundergo a heartD to transplantation was discussed.
He decided that he was not willing to receive blood transfusion, due to his religious beliefs, which has very high likelihood of being required as life saving therapy during both procedures.
He has a history of atrial fibrillation but remained in normal sinus rhythm.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of gastritis and gnawing abdominal pain.
His daily weights were monitored.Abdominal pain resolved with improvement in hemodynamics and diuresis.
Patient was noted to have an infiltrative intravenous on the day prior to discharge in his left forearm with erythema and induration over the area.
NYHA Class 4 heart failure.
Severe dilated cardiomyopathy.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Patient should also monitor his daily weights and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding weight gain or loss.
