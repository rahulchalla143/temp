Traditional angiography pending.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of mid-to-apical myocardioum.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 20-25 %) with regionality; akinesis of mid-to-apical walls with sparing of the apex.
Moderate to severe (3+) tricuspid regurgitation.
No acute traumatic injury seen in the cervical spine.
Airspace consolidation in the posterior lung apices with smooth septal thickening.
There has been further interval progression of bilateral regions of hypoattenuation involving the medial inferior frontal lobes.
There is no associated parenchymal hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
The streak artifact produced by left distal internal carotid artery coils obscures evaluation in area.
Trace intraventricular hemorrhage layering posteriorly in the occipital horns as well as small amount in the third ventricle are stable.
The mastoid air cells and imaged paranasal sinuses remain well aerated.
Further evolution of bifrontal hypoattenuation, which may represent infarcts rather than non-hemorrhagic contusion, given the progression.
No parenchymal hemorrhage.
Stable extent of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CXR [**2165-6-5**] Final Report INDICATION: 52-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage, dilated cardiomyopathy.
Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
Single AP chest radiographs compared to 13 hours prior shows no change.
Again seen are bilateral perihilar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, not significantly changed from prior exam.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Cardiac Echo : [**2165-6-11**] Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s).
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There is no mass/thrombus in the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Akinesis of mid-to-apical walls with sparing of the apex has resolved.
FINDINGS: Feeding tube tip is directed cephalad in region of gastroduodenal junction.
FINDINGS: There is a tract of hypodensity extending along the course of the prior right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter (2:13).
There is no hyperdensity along this tract to suggest the presence of hemorrhage.
There is streak artifact from a left ICA aneurysm coil.
There is no evidence of prior subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is hypodensity in the territory of the left MCA related to prior infarct (2:15), which appear stable without evidence for hemorrhagic transformation.
Post-right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter removal without evidence for hemorrhage.
Unchanged appearance to region of infarction in the left MCA distribution without hemorrhagic transformation.
SAT [**2165-6-22**] 12:08 PM Final Report INDICATION: 52-year-old female with transaminitis and fevers.
There are no other focal liver lesions identified.
There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The gallbladder is unremarkable, with no wall thickening, no pericholecystic fluid.
There are no stones or sludge identified within the gallbladder.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
Small right pleural effusion is noted.
1.2-cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver, as appreciated on CT of the chest dated [**2165-6-7**].
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 52F admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after transfer from OSH following a witnessed syncopal episode.
She also had a cardiac echo done for concerns of a catacholamine induced cardiomyopathy(had developed pulmonary edema), which showed significantly depressed cardic function.
Emergent head CT was done which showed likely evolving brifrontal hypoattenuations/possible stroke.
The patient was brought to angio, there was no significant spasm and given 5mg verapamil-aneurysm stable.
The sputum culture was positive for rare yeast.On [**6-7**]: The patient had an acute PaO2 decrease to 50%.
There was a concern for Pulmonary embolusE.
The CTA of the Chest was not consistent with Pulmonary embolus.
The patient was moniotored for possible Central Diabetes Insipidus.
On [**6-8**],  The patient was pan-cultured for a fever to 102.
A head CT ordered for elevated ICP to 44, Mannitol was initiated for increased ICPs.
A CTA was performed which was consistent with a slight decrease in intercranial vasospasm.
There were no changes in the patients mental status with these ICP increases.On exam the patient was intermitently following commands in the right upper extremity, the left upper extremity moved to command, the left lower extremity and Right upper extremity withdrew to pain,the patients eyes were open and tracked with her eyes.
On [**6-11**], The patient underwent an angio which was consistent with mild to mod vasospasm.
[**6-14**] CT shows:new stroke in the posterior left MCA distribution CTA shows diffuse, severe vasospasm involving the bilateral MCAs (left worse than right)the following day she underwent a cerebral angiogram which showed Mild to moderate spasm Left A1,2 and M1,2 segments though her exam seemed to slightly improve with brisk localization on LUE and localization on RUE though not as brisk as left.
She had some intermittent eye opening.
OR was cancelled for the day for her temperature, and possibly to re-attempt [**6-19**] or [**6-20**] if afebrile and no positive cultures.
Meds and diet were advanced through PEG as recommended without issue.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for stridor.
