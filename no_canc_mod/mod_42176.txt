Admission Date:  [**2150-8-24**]       Discharge Date: [**2150-9-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2108-3-7**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU/[**Location (un) **] Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 11752**] is a 42-year-old female with a history of depression and polysubstance abuse, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital for fulminant hepatic failure and renal failure.
The patient was anuric and transiently placed on a Lasix drip and renally dosed dopamine drip.
Per the patient's husband, the patient has had worsening depression recently but adamantly denied a suicide attempt.
Chronic pain status post motor vehicle accident.
History of OxyContin abuse.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
In general she was somnolent but she opened her eyes to voice and answered questions with short responses before falling back asleep.
Dry mucous membranes and oropharynx was clear.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Lungs:  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Neurologic:  She was confused, somnolent, unable to assess for asterixis given the poor cooperation.
Several etiologies were entertained as to the possible cause for her hepatic failure.
Niacin is known to cause liver failure in several cases.
Another possibility was hypotension leading to shocked liver.
An infectious etiology for her fulminant hepatic failure was also considered, however the patient was found to be hepatitis C negative, hepatitis B negative.
Her CMV antibody titers were consistent with an old infection as there was no IgM present.
Her [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus antibody titers were also consistent with an old infection with negative IgM titers.
An RPR test for syphilis was also found to be nonreactive.
The hepatic venous Doppler interrogation was suggestive of a hyperdynamic state, however the hepatic vasculature was otherwise unremarkable, and there was no focal liver mass.
The gallbladder wall showed thickening, possibly due to a low protein state or related cardiac disease.
There was also increased echogenicity of the kidneys consistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.
On admission the patient was believed to be encephalopathic from her liver failure and she was started on Lactulose via a nasogastric tube.
The patient was also given vitamin K to reverse her elevated INR.
2 hour fingersticks with Regular Insulin sliding scale due to the risk of hyperglycemia with liver failure.
Ultimately, it was believed the cause for her fulminant hepatic failure to be this niacin toxicity from the overingestion of diet pills, with a possible contribution from hypotension.
Acute renal failure:  The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with acute renal failure.
There were several possible etiologies for the acute renal failure including acute tubular necrosis from direct toxic effect, hypovolemia, questionable history of rhabdomyolysis, or liver failure.
On admission the patient was anuric and she had an anion gap acidosis with increased phosphate, increased potassium and decreased calcium.
The kidneys also demonstrated increased echogenicity consistent with chronic parenchymal renal disease.
There was no hydronephrosis but there was a small amount of fluid surrounding the kidneys.
Urine electrolytes were obtained which showed a picture consistent with acute tubular necrosis.
At the time of discharge it was believed that her acute renal failure was most likely due to acute tubular necrosis from medication and/or hypotension and/or rhabdomyolysis.
Hypertension:  On admission the patient was hypotensive at the outside hospital, however soon after being transferred to the intensive care unit, the patient started to develop extremely elevated and labile blood pressures to a systolic blood pressure of 200.
The cause for her increased blood pressure was believed to be due partly to the acute renal failure and also partly due to agitation.
It was noted that when the patient became extremely agitated, that her blood pressure would increase.
Seizure disorder:  The patient has no previous history of seizures, however on [**2150-9-4**] she was found to have four seizures with 2 mg of Ativan IV between each seizure.
A work-up was performed and her head CT showed bilateral frontal hypodensities as well as bilateral thalamic hypodensities.
An MRI was then performed which showed posterior leukoencephalopathy likely due to extremely elevated blood pressures combined with renal failure.
Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, which was found to be normal and there was no evidence of infection.
Acute Neurontin withdrawal has been associated with seizures.
Another possibility raised was that Flagyl, which the patient had been taking for a pneumonia, was a possible cause for seizures, however this is less likely as the patient was taken off Flagyl following the first set of seizures and she had recurrent seizures even off the Flagyl.
A third possibility is that the combination of severely elevated blood pressures as well as acute renal failure could have led to malignant hypertension manifesting itself in seizures.
The patient has a long history of substance abuse, which she has not been very forthcoming about.
She was continued on Dilantin with daily Dilantin and free Dilantin level checks, as well as Keppra throughout the remainder of her hospital course and she had no further seizures.
Neurology was consulted and assisted with the thorough work-up of her seizures as well as with medication dosing.
