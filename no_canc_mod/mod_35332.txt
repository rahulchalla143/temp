Her heart was of regular rate and rhythm and a grade III/VI systolic ejection mumur was appreciated.
No edema or varicosities were noted.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Bilateral pleural effusions.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally with normal gradient for this prosthesis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Well seated aortic bioprosthesis with normal gradient, but trace aortic regurgitation.
At least mild mitral regurgitation.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Frontal views show no significant interval change with no new consolidation and no pneumothorax.
There she was found to be in atrial fibrillation and was placed on amiodarone.
Due to  hypotension she was transferred back to the surgical intensive care unit for fluid status management and tenuous pulmonary status.
Scan revealed a sizeable left pleural effusion.
Anticoagulation was started with coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
