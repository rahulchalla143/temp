He described the pain to be 6 out of 10 severe substernal chest pain/pressure.
The pain diminished to a 3 out of 10 after some rest later that day.
He presented to an outside hospital and demonstrated electrocardiogram changes that were dynamic as well as continued substernal chest pain at that time.
At that point he was started on nitro times three, aspirin, morphine and his pain diminished to 1 out of 10.
Overnight, the patient had diminished chest pain, which resolved while he was on an addition of heparin as well as Integrilin drips.
Overnight the patient experienced 1 out of 10 chest pain discomfort and at some point during the evening his pain returned to a severity of 3 or 4 out of 10.
At that point he was transferred to our hospital for continued chest pain, rising cardiac enzymes and dynamically changing electrocardiograms with ST and T wave changes.
The patient at that point was noted to have electrocardiogram changes significant for normal systolic rhythm of 77, ST elevations in V1 through V3 as well as having a J point elevation of approximately 2.5 mm.
During all of these episodes the patient never experienced diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness or radiation of his pain or pressure to his extremities or to his jaw.
At that time the patient was evaluated and deemed necessary to be taken to catheterization for diagnostic as well as possible intervention at that point.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for elevated cholesterol, mild hypertension as well as approximately a fifteen pack year history of smoking.
The patient was in no acute distress.
He was noted to have no bruits.
Normal S1 and S2 and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur that radiated to the axilla.
His lungs were clear bilaterally except for bilateral basilar crackles right greater then left.
He had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
He had 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilateral lower extremities and 2+ radial pulses.
A chest x-ray was done, which demonstrated no cardiomegaly.
No infiltrates were seen.
No pulmonary edema was noted.
At the catheterization laboratory the patient was noted to have left main coronary artery, left anterior descending coronary artery and circumflex that demonstrated no disease and an obtuse marginal one that demonstrated an 80% lesion and a right coronary artery that demonstrated total occlusion.
The patient experienced overnight no chest pain, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness and all chest pressure discomfort had resolved at that point.
Over the course of the next day the patient continued to have no episodes of chest pain.
The echocardiogram was noted to have 1+ MR.  His aortic root was noted to be mildly dilated.
The patient remained sating 95% on room air and remained afebrile throughout his hospital course.
His physical examination had remained unchanged and the patient was noted to have no recurrence of chest pain, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting or any other associated symptoms.
The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician within one weeks time for continued monitoring of his condition as well as to set up a cardiology appointment within the next three weeks.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute myocardial infarction status post catheterization with stenting times two of his right coronary artery.
