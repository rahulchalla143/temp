FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2163-3-26**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications could reflect pulmonary edema, widespread pneumonia, or even ARDS.
Extensive bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities at low lung volumes and minimal pleural effusions.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
No interval recurrence of new parenchymal opacities.
Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities consistent with the underlying disease.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
No evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities, the presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
The GI team was consulted, and there was some concern that he might need to be intubated for the procedure given his history of interstitial lung disease (complicated by recent ARDS at OSH and high O2 requirement).
Ultimately, the patient and his HCP decided against an endoscopy with or without intubation.
Plavix and aspirin were held given bleeding, and GI felt that he would be at high risk for rebleed with Plavix given no definitive intervention was done.
Hypoxia/IPF/COPD: The patient's hypoxia was likely multifactorial and was thought to be due to ARDS in addition to his COPD and IPF.
Hx of CAD s/p PCI: He did not have any chest pain or discomfort during the admission.
His metoprolol and simvastatin were continued but his plavix and aspirin were initially held in the setting of his GI bleed.
Loose stool: Noted to have some loose stools on the day of discharge, without melena or hematochezia.
Did not test for C diff, but GI advised testing for C diff if diarrhea continued.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Atrovent HFA 17 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Melena Hypoxia  Secondary: COPD Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis Dementia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for dark stools concerning for bleeding in your GI tract.
You and your health care proxy decided to not have an endoscopy done to evaluate your GI tract, and the bleeding stopped with medications.
You also had more difficulty breathing and required more oxygen to help you breathe.
Stopped plavix as it thins your blood and will make you more likely to bleed.
Started pantoprazole twice daily to protect your stomach and stabilize any ulcer or cause of bleeding in your GI tract.
Started miconazole powder for scrotal fungal pain.
