Admission Date:  [**2188-4-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2188-4-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2118-2-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with most recent exacerbation in [**2-/2188**], who was admitted to the MICU after he passed out early yesterday morning in the lobby of his apartment complex.
The patient woke up in the early morning with shortness of breath and went to the window to catch some fresh air.
He continued to be dyspneic and subsequently went down to get some water and he passed out.
He reports that over the past one week he has had progressively worsening shortness of breath and a nonproductive cough.
He has had several episodes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation in the past, which culminated in hospitalizations.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient had bronchitis as a child.
He recently had pneumovacs approximately one year ago, but he has never had influenza vaccine.
No lymphadenopathy, supple.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, erythema, or edema; pulses 2+ bilaterally.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 138, left axis deviation, right bundle branch block.
Radiographic data:  CT angiogram showed no evidence of PE, three nodules noted in the right apex, and some colonic diverticulosis.
PULMONARY:  Trigger for patient's COPD exacerbations unclear (environmental versus upper respiratory tract infection).
The clinical picture is most consistent with chronic bronchitis.
The patient's white blood cell count was elevated likely secondary to Prednisone.
He remained afebrile throughout the course of his stay in the hospital.
The patient is to followup with the Pulmonary Clinic for further management and workup of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had elevated CKs, however, they were though to be secondary to muscle injury from his fall.
It seemed that the respiratory decompression could not fully explained by pleurisy or COPD.
The sequence of his exacerbations were unusual and it was thought that there might be a cardiac component to his respiratory distress, which included tachycardiac from Albuterol that may have lead to pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic dysfunction.
Additionally, the patient's EKG showed T-wave inversions in V1 through V6.
Cardiology consult was obtained and it was decided for the patient to have stress echocardiogram.
The stress echocardiogram showed anterior abnormalities (please see stress report for further details).
Due to this atrial abnormality, the patient had cardiac catheterization, which showed mild-to-moderate CAD with no flow-limiting lesions; normal filling pressures, left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.
The patient was started on aspirin, however, beta blockers were held due to the patient's respiratory disease.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation in the setting of URI.
