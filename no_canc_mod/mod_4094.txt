CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2135-7-31**] 5:57 PM IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 11060**] is a 73 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for Alzheimer's dementia, DM 1, and CAD s/p CABG admitted for bilateral pyelonephritis.
Septicemia due to pyelonephritis: - Patient with CTAP demonstrating bilateral perinephric fat stranding and hydronephrosis.
That said, patient has had two UA's in the ED that were negative for pyuria, which is atypical for pyelonephritis, suggesting that a non-infectious post-obstructive uropathy leading to hydronephrosis may be causing his symptoms, although given fever and leukocytosis and prior dose of antibiotics this may be a culture with no growth due to antibiotics.
Constipation: KUB showed large amts of stool in bowel.
Also noted previous days to have some scrotal edema, which is now improved.
Acute renal failure: Likely secondary to post-obstructive uropathy.
Hyponatremia: Most likely etiology is intravascular volume depletion.
Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to lactic acidosis given lactate of 2.6.
Patient without ketones on UA, although was noted to have a blood glucose of 500 at his NH.
