NEURO: Grossly in-tact without focality.
DRAINS/TUBES: PICC SITE: No significant hematoma, tenderness, or fresh bleeding.
Imaging/diagnostics: ERCP ([**2145-7-15**]): Impression: Normal major papilla Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts and biliary radicles were filled with contrast and well visualized.
The course and caliber of the structures are normal with no evidence of extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities, and no filling defects.
Balloon catheter sweep of the duct did not reveal any stone or sludge.
Excellent drainage of bile and contrast was noted  Echocardiogram ([**2145-7-20**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension with dilated right ventricle and mild to moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 84-year-old man with history of atrial fibrillation presenting with abdominal pain, found to have acute cholecystitis at outside hospital, transferred for management of possible cholangitis.
# Cholecystitis: The patient was transfered from [**Hospital1 2436**] Hopsital with acute cholecystitis; imaging showed no stones and CBD of 4 mm.
Given his WBC elevation to high 20s and fever, there was concern for cholangitis.
The patient transfered to the MICU and had an ERCP on [**2145-7-15**], that showed no obstruction or stones.
After this, his bilirubin has trended down from 2.1, and the patient had no signs of post-ERCP pancreatitis.
Alkaline phosphatase remained elevated to 170s with increase to 238 on day of discharge, while AST and ALT have peaked in the 60s and 70s.
The patient continued to have drainage from his cholecystostomy drain, and his pain resolved.
# Atrial fibrillation/Acute right sided CHF: The patient was newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation on [**2145-7-12**] by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] he reports possibly being told that he had an irregular heart beat prior.
An echocardiogram on [**2145-7-20**] showed a dilated left atrium and right ventricle, with evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension and mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Continuous telmetry monitoring showed no recurrent rapid ventricular rate on exertion.
Notably, the patient was reluctant to begin aspirin therapy due to a remote history of duodenal ulcer.
# Dyspnea: The patient reported chronic SOB on exertion but worsening SOB after hospitalization in the setting of hypervolemia per above.
Chronic dyspnea could be attributed at least partially to the pulmonary hypertension seen on echocardiogram.
The possibility of pulmonary embolism was raised, but since he was doing well clinically and anticoagulation is not an option at this time, it was not pursued further.
# Hyperlipidemia: The patient's home statin was held due to elevations in LFTs and transhepatic cholecystostomy placement, with plan to restart once his LFTs improve.
# Leg Wound: The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma with recent excision by his dermatological surgeon over the right shin.
The wound appeared well-healing with granulation tissue.
# Urinary retention: The patient has a history of prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy.
# Left Iliacus Hematoma: Hematoma was discovered clincially by patient's PCP and confirmed on inpatient imaging.
On exam, area showed fading violaceous ecchymosis without significant induration or tenderness.
Physical therapy evaluation showed no focal deficits.
# GERD / History of Peptic Ulcer Disease: The patient's home omeprazole was continued and also serves as gastric protectant while on aspirin.
Diuresis: Plan for giving furosemide 20 mg IV qam on [**2145-7-23**] and [**2145-7-24**], with strict I&IOs, goal of negative 0.5-1L daily until clinically euvolemic, monitoring Chem7 for renal dysfunction.
Wound monitoring: Patient has wound s/p excision of squamous cell carcinoma on his shin.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary -Acute cholecystitis  Secondary -Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response -Right sided heart failure, with normal left ventricular ejection fraction -pulmonary hypertension -prostate ca s/p resection with bladder neck stricture   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were transferred to our hospital with abdominal pain and diagnosis of an infected gallbladder.
You required a procedure (ERCP) to look for blockage of your gall bladder and placement of a gall bladder drain (cholecystostomy tube).
You also developed an irregular heart rythm called atrial fibriliation at a high heart rate.
You were started on medications to control the heart rate and aspirin to prevent clots from forming in the heart.
Please discuss this finding with your primary doctor or new cardiologist.
You also were seen by urologists, with concern that you had asymptomatic urinary retention due a constriction in your urinary bladder.
- Simvastatin was stopped for now due to your liver test abnromalities.
- Nifedipine was stopped as your blood pressure remained normal after treatment for your heart rate.
- Ampicillin-sulbactam was started to treat your infection  Followup Instructions: Please make an appointment with your primary doctor for follow-up care before leaving rehabilitation.
Please call him and report the results of your voiding trial after your Foley catheter is removed.
