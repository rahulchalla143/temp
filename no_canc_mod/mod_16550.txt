Neck was without jugular venous distention or masses.
There was a 3/6 systolic murmur heard loudest at the right second intercostal space.
No costovertebral tenderness.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in V2-V3.
X-RAYS:  Chest x-ray at the outside hospital was reported to show mild congestive heart failure.
Patient ruled in for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 1.58.
Patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on [**2102-7-31**] and in the cardiac catheterization laboratory the patient was found to have a left ventricular ejection fraction at 50%, a 50% left main coronary artery lesion, 90% long mid LAD lesion, 80% ostial OM-1 lesion, and 80% proximal right coronary artery lesion with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, and a LVEDP of 16.
Patient had an echocardiogram subsequent to her cardiac catheterization which showed a depressed ejection fraction at 35% with anterior wall hypokinesis.
The CT scan showed a large area of hypoattenuation within the distribution of the right middle cerebral artery and the right posterior cerebral artery with foci of high attenuation in the region of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle that represented associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There was evidence of significant mass effect with effacement of the sulci on the right and significant right to left shift.
No evidence of uncal or cerebellar herniation.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
Neurosurgery was consulted upon evaluation of the CT scan for evaluation of the swelling and mass effect seen on CT scan.
At this time, the patient was noted on physical examination to not be following commands, was positive for doll's eyes.
Minimal movement of her left lower extremity to painful stimuli.
Patient was noted to have a slight gag.
The patient continued to have a left facial droop.
Patient had gross motor movement of her left upper and left lower extremity and purposeful movement with fine motor movement of right upper and lower extremities.
CT scan of the head showed no change.
No significant bleed, and no evidence of herniation.
On postoperative day #5, the patient continues to improve from a neurologic standpoint.
Patient tolerated this procedure well with no postoperative complications.
Urinalysis from postoperative day #5 showed evidence of trace leukocyte esterase.
On postoperative day #8, the patient underwent a video fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation by the speech pathologist which showed overall mild oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced bolus control and formation with premature spill-over of liquids, oral residue and a mild delay in swallow initiation.
No aspiration occurred during the study.
They recommended a diet of soft solids, thin liquids, whole pills with liquids, basic aspiration precautions.
On postoperative day #11, the patient underwent a carotid ultrasound which showed no flow limiting stenosis in either the right or left carotid arteries.
The patient's pacing wires were removed on postoperative day #9 without complication.
By postoperative day #11, patient had progressed to significantly increased fine and gross motor movement of her left upper extremity and lower extremities with significant improvement in speech.
The Neurology Service felt the patient was stable from a neurologic point-of-view and signed off.
On postoperative day #12, patient began complaining of nausea and refused to take po.
Patient underwent a CT scan of her abdomen to rule out intraabdominal process.
CT scan showed no evidence of pancreatitis.
Normal bowel and no evidence of any intraabdominal process.
Patient's nausea continued to improve over the next several days and had disappeared by postoperative day #14, was able to eat and tolerate tube feedings without complaints of nausea.
Patient has a left visual field neglect, but has some compensation with cueing.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no rub and no murmur.
The patient has not complained of any nausea over 36 hours.
Culture data:  Patient had a [**1-28**] blood cultures drawn on [**2102-8-14**] that was positive for coag-negative Staph.
The patient had a urine culture from [**8-14**] which showed Enterococcus species.
Patient's stool was negative for Clostridium difficile.
