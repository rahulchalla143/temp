Hypotension:  The etiology of her hypotension is unclear, the differential includes sepsis vs. cardiogenic vs. combined.
Other possibility is severe congestive heart failure, but pt is anuric and unable to benefit from HD at this time given her inability to sustain BPs.
Hypoxia: Also of unclear etiology, DDx includes pneumonia, aspiration, congestive heart failure, and massive burden of sarcoidosis vs. recurrent metastatic cancer.
Pt appears in severe respiratory distress, with an oxygen saturation of 85% on 100% NRB + 6L NC.
Goals of Care: Pt and family were aware of situation re: pt's hypotension and hypoxia.
Initially, pt was continued on admitting treatment of antibiotics and pressors without escalation.
At this point, antibiotics and pressors were discontinued, and morphine was used for comfort for respiratory distress.
Over several hours, the patient gradually became increasingly hypotensive and bradycardic, and developed agonal respirations.
