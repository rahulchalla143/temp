Admission Date: [**2147-6-26**]        Discharge Date: [**2147-7-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-2-12**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45-year-old male with no previously diagnosed coronary artery disease, who is transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital status post acute ST elevation MI.
The patient was woken up from sleep early the morning of admission by [**9-19**] sharp, substernal bilateral chest pain, which was associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, and possible palpitations.
The patient denies any associated nausea or vomiting.
The chest pain was nonpleuritic and aside from mild right forearm tingling, did not radiate.
At the outside hospital, the EKG showed ST elevations greater than 3 mm at I, aVL, V1 through V5, peaked T's anteriorly, ST depressions inferiorly, poor R-wave progression.
Patient was treated with Heparin, nitroglycerin, aspirin, Lopressor and was transferred here for emergent cardiac catheterization, which revealed an 80 percent stenosis of the mid RCA, 100 percent proximal LAD stenosis, 80 percent proximal left circumflex, and 99 percent stenosis of the OM-1.
Low back pain.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father:  History of CVA at age 72.
Patient has three brothers and one sister with no known history of heart disease.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS ON TRANSFER TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Negative for chest pain, dyspnea, or diaphoresis.
He had no constitutional symptoms.
He denied a history of syncope or presyncope.
He had no known PND, orthopnea, or dyspnea on exertion.
Cardiovascular exam was regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly, no palpable pulsatile masses.
Extremities are warm and dry without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Had a sheath in the right and left groin without hematoma and palpable distal dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
His EKG on [**2147-6-26**] at 11:02 a.m. showed sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute, poor baseline artifact, anterior ST elevations less pronounced, approximately 1.5 to 2 mm.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a normal left main coronary artery, proximally occluded LAD, a proximal 80 percent tubular lesion on the left circumflex.
ST elevation MI.
This 45-year-old gentleman with no known    history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, high    cholesterol, or hypertension was transferred to [**Hospital1 55251**] from [**Hospital3 417**] with a    ST elevation MI.
There was discussion regarding whether the most appropriate course of care would be to perform a CABG or to repeat catheterization with stenting of the other lesions in the RCA and the left circumflex.
Given that these lesions appeared to be discrete rather than long tubular lesions, a decision was made that repeat catheterization would be a favorable choice in this patient.
He did not experience any chest pain, shortness of breath postprocedure.
He did have some mild right groin pain.
He did not develop any significant hematomas or bleeding from his catheterization site.
EP was consulted, and felt that given patient has had a recent large anterior myocardial infarction with three vessel intervention, that his three beats of NSVT was likely secondary to reperfusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] recommended that the patient have an echocardiogram as well as a Holter monitor prior to following up with her [**8-10**] at 12:30 p.m. to help discuss possible electrophysiology study and possible ICD placement if needed.
The patient was started on Lipitor 80 and Lopressor was titrated up daily for cardioprotective effects.
In addition, the patient was started on Coumadin given that his post-ST elevation MI echocardiogram demonstrated the patient had a depressed ejection fraction of 25 percent with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and akinesis of the distal [**3-14**] of the heart with evidence of mild aneurysm of the apex.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable, no further chest pain, or nonsustained VT.
Anterolateral ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure.
Left ventricular aneurysm.
He was advised to avoid all heavy lifting or vigorous exercise.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for followup of his INR and advice regarding cessation of the Lovenox injections and adjustment of Coumadin dosing.
