The morning of admission the patient was without complaints per the nursing home staff, however having increasing shortness of breath throughout the day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck:  Supple; jugulovenous pressure flat.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Chest x-ray:  Diffuse patchy linear infiltrates, question loculated effusion.
EKG:  MAT at 99, 0.5 mm ST segment depressions in V4, V5, low voltage in limb leads, Q-waves in 3.
