Diffuse esophageal thickening and a 1 cm right paratracheal  lymph node noted on CT in 8/[**2144**].
There was noted to be some difficulty with peristalsis as well on a barium swallow study of  [**7-/2145**], as well as a questionable stricture in the distal esophagus.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.

No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The right common carotid artery was imaged with a Berenstein  catheter selectively showing patent Right common with a right internal with a 80% tubular lesion at prior CEA site.
We placed the Berenstein in the right external and exchanged over a SupraCore wire for a 6F Shuttle sheath after giving Heparin (ACT 265).
We then crossed the internal carotid lesion with a Prowater and exchanged for a 6mm Spider filter.
The patient  tolerated the procedure well with minimal hypotension as status post CEA.
Post intervention angiography showed no complications and the right carotid now filled the right ACA.
Stenting of right internal carotid for restenosis after CEA   Brief Hospital Course: #.
Carotid stenosis/PVD: Carotid ultrasound consistent with severe RCA disease and moderate LCA disease.
Patient asymptomatic on admission denying any numbness, tingling, or weakness.
# HTN: Patient has had two episodes of HTN urgency.
No signs of end organ ischemia.
Patient as an outpatient not on HD, and patient has not had discussions with nephrologist about this in the past.
Likely secondary to renal dysfunction.

Hypothyroidism  Discharge Condition: afebrile, vital signs stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for carotid artery stenting.
You tolerated the procedure well without complication.
You should call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] if you experience any neurologic symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, numbness or tingling in your fingers or toes or loss of motor coordination.
YOu should come to the ER if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain.
