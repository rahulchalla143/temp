Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
Right pleural effusion [**2151-3-20**] status post right thoracentesis, and status post an anterior wall myocardial infarction in [**2151-3-20**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old male who developed chest pain and shortness of breath while he was shoveling snow [**2151-4-1**] for which he was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] and found to have an acute myocardial infarction status post unsuccessful thrombolytics and rescue PCI with an intra-aortic balloon pump placement.
He was in the CCU for eight days which was complicated by paracarditis, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and a right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis as well as pneumonia, status post a 10 day course of Levaquin.
Left main coronary artery disease, mildly diffuse, 70-80% left anterior descending artery stenosis, and the mid right coronary artery with 70% stenosis, distal right totally occluded.
Cardiac echocardiogram was done on [**2151-4-8**] which revealed an ejection fraction of 30% with left ventricular systolic function moderately-to-severely depressed secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and the inferior free wall and moderate hypokinesis of the posterior wall.
There is no A.I, no mitral valve prolapse, and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch of the left circumflex on [**2151-5-6**] as well as paracardial patch of the inferior ventricular aneurysm.
Patient was afebrile with a hematocrit that came up from 21 to 33.2.
The patient went into atrial fibrillation overnight, and was administered Lopressor as well as an amiodarone drip, and because the patient's cardiac index continued to be on the low side at 1.96, the patient continued to receive milrinone at 0.25.
Postoperative day three, patient was administered a 150 mg IV bolus of IV milrinone for the atrial fibrillation with a rate of 90 to 100's.
Patient continued to go in and out of atrial fibrillation for which she was administered amiodarone boluses as well as Lopressor with good effect, converted back to sinus with a good ventricular rate.
Postoperative day six 24 hour events included the patient going in and out of atrial fibrillation again while on the floor.
Postoperative day six, the patient with complaints of an anxiety attack, and patient was given 0.5 mg of Ativan with good affect.
The patient did have two episodes of nausea and vomiting for which an abdominal x-ray was performed which was negative.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting x3.
