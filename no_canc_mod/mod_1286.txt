TTE at that time showed no effusion.
He was also given Abx for abnormalities on a Chest CXR/CT, although he had no clinical signs of PNA and radiology reports described the posterior left base opacity as likely atelectasis.
Two days after completing the 5 day course of ibuprofen 800mg tid which he was prescribed, he developed diffuse left sided chest pain different from his initial pleuritic pain (and not as intense).
Repeat ECHO done at [**Hospital1 **] showed a moderate effusion (report not available) which had evolved within 5 days--reportedly not concerning for tamponade.
No pulsus on exam with BP 95-105/50-60.
On arrival, neck veins wnl, BP at baseline, no pulsus, prelim ECHO without diastolic collapse of RV.
Of note, co-synotropin testing at [**Hospital1 **] showed that pt is adrenally insufficient s/p distant unilateral adrenalectomy after which he never followed up with an endocrinologist.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent chills or rigors, although felt briefly febrile on the night prior to admission.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN (SMEAR REMADE).
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
urine cx: [**2152-11-26**]: negative blood cx: [**2152-11-26**]: no growth to date  TELEMETRY:  no events .
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade physiology.
IMPRESSION: Moderate circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade physiology.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion (0.5cm around the apex, <0.5cm inferolateral to the left ventricle and anterior to the right ventricle.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
CXR: PA, LATERAL: [**2152-11-27**] there is evidence of substantial effusion posteriorly on the lateral view.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo M w/ CAD developed pericarditis one week ago, then developed moderate sized effusion w/o tamponade over the course of one week.
Pericardial Effusion/Pericarditis: The patient had a rapid accumulation of moderate sized effusion over the span of one week.
Etiology unknown, negative evaluation most consistent with viral infection.
Preliminary ECHO without tamponade physiology.
At time of discharge, patient had no further recurrence of chest discomfort, dyspnea, lightheadedness or other symptoms consistent with pericarditis/ pericardial effusion.
Pleural effusion: Although the pericardial effusion improved, the patient was noted to have a significant left sided pleural effusion.
Several hours later, though, the microbiology lab reported an error in their reporting, stating that nothing had grown on culture and that there were actually no micro-organisms seen.
Ceftriaxone was discontinued, as the patient was afebrile at this time, with no localizing signs of infection.
He did not have an elevated white blood cell count.
Fevers were most likely secondary to inflammation from the pericarditis.
Possible adrenal Insufficiency:  The patient was started on replacement doses of hydrocortisone given his history of adrenalectomy and [**Last Name (un) 104**]-stimulation test at the OSH.
Subclinical hypothyroidism: In addition, his TSH was elevated at 10, but his free T4 was normal.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute pericarditis Pericardial Effusion Pleural Effusion Anemia Adrenal Insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You had pericarditis and a fluid collection around your heart.
You also had some fluid collections in your lungs that was tapped and cultured.
Start Hydrocortisone 10 mg Tablets: take two in the morning and one at night to treat your adrenal insufficiency 2.
