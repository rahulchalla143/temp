He was found to have absent R lung sounds requiring needle decompression with rush of air.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: On Admission: P 101  BP 130/palp  Intubated, sedated and paralyzed Pupils fixed 2mm bilaterally Bilateral hemotympanum, blood in the right ear canal Bilateral breath sounds, R chest tube in place No chest crepitus Heart RRR Abdomen soft, NT, ND Abrasion R hand Contusion bilateral knees Contusion Left pretibia Contusion Right occiput Pt had purposeful movement of right upper extremity when sedation was held.
Large right epidural hematoma adjacent to right temporal [**Month/Day/Year 500**] fracture, 2.
Hemorrhagic contusion in the left inferior frontal and temporal lobe.
Small extra-axial hemorrhage along the left posterior frontal lobe.
Diffuse ventricular, sulcal and cisternal effacement.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no focal consolidation.
CT Cervical spine [**2190-5-1**]: IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment involving the cervical spine.
Extraaxial blood about the cord at the foramen magnum likely reflects tracking from blood seen in the basilar cisterns.
Bilateral posterior lung consolidations likely represent combination atelectasis/aspiration.
No acute injuries in the abdomen or pelvis.
Postoperative CT Head noncontrast [**2190-5-1**]: Status post right craniotomy and evacuation of epidural hematoma.
There is a small amount of expected pneumocephalus and small amounts of residual blood products.
There is no  new intracranial hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
The degree of mass effect exerted by the right epidural hematoma has been alleviated.
The previously noted hemorrhage on the right side of the foramen magnum/upper cervical region is decreased on the present study.
A small hypodense area in the left temporal lobe poster-medially is unchanged.
Intracranial drain, entering the cranium at the superior margin of the osseous surgical defect and with the tip terminating in the right middle cranial fossa.
No flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion is noted.
CT Head noncontrast [**2190-5-2**]: IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to postoperative study.
Facial fractures include comminuted nasal fractures.
Skull base fractures include the sphenoid body and both greater wings, extending into the bilateral carotid canals.
High-attenuation material persists in the left maxillary sinus, sphenoid sinuses, and ethmoid air cells, compatible with evolving blood products.
Note is made of mild pan-nasal mucosal thickening and aerosolized secretions.
There is mild S-shaped deviation of the nasal septum, apparently due to an acute fracture, with a rightward bony spur that does not obstruct the middle meatus.
In the right temporal [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] anterior longitudinal fracture involves the mastoid and petrous segments, and extends into the middle ear.
In the left temporal [**First Name3 (LF) 500**], a transverse fracture involves the petrous portion, extending to the temporomandibular joint anteriorly and the middle ear posteriorly.
There is high-density fluid within both external auditory canals, extending into the middle ears, with complete encasement of the auditory ossicles, and partial opacification of the mastoid air cells.
Structures of the inner ear, including the cochlea, vestibule, semicircular canals, and internal auditory canals, appear intact.
Moderate soft tissue swelling and trace subcutaneous gas is noted overlying the craniotomy site.
Residual pneumocephalus is present in the right middle cranial fossa, along with a heterogeneous extra-axial fluid collection measuring up to 8 mm in depth.
Hemorrhagic contusions measuring 3 x 2.2 cm in the left temporal lobe and 2.2 x 1.3 cm in the left frontal lobe continue to evolve.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left cerebral and convexity and suprasellar/perimesencephalic cistern also persists.
There is contour deformity of the inferior left maxilla, with abnormal lateral concavity and absence of the maxillary left bicuspids and molars, suggesting remote injury.
The mandible appears intact, but there is absence of the left mandibular first and second bicuspid, and the right mandibular second bicuspid.
Right craniotomy, with residual epidural blood products.
Left frontotemporal hemorrhagic contusions and multifocal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CT Head Noncontrast [**2190-5-3**]: Stable appearance of brain with multiple fractures, right craniotomy and residual extra-axial fluid collection, left frontotemporal contusion, diffuse subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage, global cerebral edema, and blood in paranasal sinuses and middle ear cavities.
The new left-sided PICC tip is difficult to see but extends at least into the right atrium and should be pulled back by at least 5 cm.
There is bibasilar atelectasis but otherwise the lungs appear clear.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Repeat imaging following resolution of hemorrhage would be helpful.
Nondisplaced transverse left temporal [**Month/Year (2) 500**] fracture, extending through middle ear and mastoid segment of the facial nerve canal.
Decreased sinus hemorrhage and evolving intracranial hemorrhage.
Continued evolution of left inferior frontal and temporal hemorrhagic contusions, with expected decreased density of edema, but no increase in the hyperdense hemorrhagic components, and no increased mass effect.
Stable small residual right extra-axial collection.
Evalution of subarachnoid hemorrhage is limited by artifacts.
Multiple skull base, bilateral temporal [**Month/Year (2) 500**] and facial fractures, better assessed on prior studies.
[**5-11**] CXR - negative   Brief Hospital Course: On [**2190-5-1**], the patient was transferred to the operating room emergently for Right epidural hematoma evacuation.
He was started on a 7 day course of clindamycin and placed on sinus precautions for sinus fractures.
On [**2190-5-3**], dilantin dose was increased, CT head was stable, and the patient was started on precedex and fentanyl infusions in an attempt to wean sedation for extubation.
He had no cough or gag reflex, so extubation was deferred.
ENT was consulted for Bilateral temporal [**Month/Year (2) 500**] fractures and a dedicated CT temporal [**Month/Year (2) 500**] was obtained.
The team felt that the patient was at high risk for pulling out his feeding tube once placed due to his current mental status and decisded to defer placement of a gastric feeding tube over weekend to see if patient can tolerate a po diet.
It was felt that he would require placement of a PEG for nutrition as he was unable to take adequate PO due to his depressed mental status and inability to follow commands.
His diet was advanced to sips of nectar liquids.
[**5-10**], the patient was transitioned to keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
He was noted to have right sided facial twitching that resolved within minutes.
INR was again elevated and it was decided to continue to monitor.
On [**5-12**] a u/a was obtained for preop which was postitive therefore he was started on a course of cipro.
WBC was noted to be elevated which was thought to be due to UTI, but INR was within normal limits.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] from Cognitive neurology was contact[**Name (NI) **] to give input regarding his care and the plans were for him to be seen on Friday [**5-21**].
They recommended to advance diet to soft with thin liquids.
He had completed PT/OT, but continues to require cognitive therapy.
At the time of discharge he is tolerating a regular diet, ambulating without difficulty, afebrile with stable vital signs.
Medications on Admission: methadone  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Epidural Hematoma Right traumatic pneumothorax Multiple facial fractures including commminuted nasal Fxs, bilat ethmoid fxs Complex Skullbase fractures Bilateral Temporal [**Month/Year (2) 500**] fractures agitation Confusion dysphagia UTI - e. coli insomnia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Daily Wound check for signs of infection.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
- followup in General Surgery in early [**Month (only) **] to evaluate your PEG for removal.
