Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Neuro-ICU of the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 86**] campus for new onset headache associated with left sided arm, leg and facial weakness.

Cocaine causes blood vessel constriction, which increases blood pressure causing vessel damage.
Continue to take tylenol or oxycodone for daily headaches, and imitrex when you experience a typical migraine headache.
- To prevent further brain hemorrhages and other complications of cocaine such as heart attacks, extreme elevations in blood pressure and depression, we strongly recommend that you abstain from cocaine completely.
