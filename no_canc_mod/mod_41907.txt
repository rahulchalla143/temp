# Hyperkalemia: Likely secondary to acute metabolic acidosis given acuity of renal failure, prior Cr.
Effective volume depletion and hypoaldo states ([**3-10**] adrenal insufficiency) may have contributed to her hyperkalemia.
Patient was transferred to the ICU for NSVT and transient AMS.
She was initially treated with hydrocortisone 100mg PO Q8H for adrenal insufficiency which we started to taper on [**10-6**] until she was resumed on her home hydrocortisone on [**2190-10-7**].
# Transient AMS: In the setting of NSVT, hyperkalemia, history of seizure (last seizure was 9 yrs ago), admission hypoglycemia, and potentional TIA event.
Unclear what caused her transient AMS, but was likely not seziure given she was not post-ictal.
She had no further arrhythmias s/p correction of acidemia and electrolyte abnormalties.
# Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient had transient episodes of asymptomatic hypotension to SBPs in mid 80s in ICU on [**10-5**] and [**10-6**], at first while sleeping.
Thus, they were felt to be due to continued hypovolemia.
CXR showed small b/l pleural effusions.
She was given 80mg IV lasix, nitro s/l x3, 100mg po labetalol and albuterol/atrovent nebs with improvement in her BP to 140/90 and resolution of her SOB and chest tightness.
# AG metabolic Acidosis: Likely multifactorial given uremia in the setting of ARF and lactic acidosis in the setting of dehydration.
# ARF: Pt was dry on initial exam and in the setting of markedly increased ostomy output, this could be pre-renal failure, liekly c/b ATN given delayed response to IVF.
# Increased ostomy output: Pt is s/p partial colectomy.
# Cognitive impairment: patient carries diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment.
No infectious-toxic-metabolic source of her cognitive impairment was identified, and it was felt that this was likely a reflection of slowly declined cognitive function, plus possibly pseudodementia/depression.
On the morning of discharge, patient was seen by her outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17446**], who felt she was at her baseline mental status.
UA prior to discharge grew Staph and Enterococcus (<3000 colonies each), which likely represents contamination given the low colony number and the fact that she was asymptomatic; UA had no pyuria or nitrite.
If she develops dysuria or fever, she should see her PCP for presumed UTI.
# Panhypopituitarism : Was given stress dose steroids which were decreased on [**10-6**] with plan to decrease to home dosing on [**10-7**].
# DM: On admission to the floor, BG was 43, likely [**3-10**] insulin/glucose in the ED.
