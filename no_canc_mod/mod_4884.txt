Admission Date:  [**2125-9-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2125-9-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2050-1-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU/MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease.
He is status post a silent myocardial infarction and also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (he has 100 pack year of smoking tobacco and is still smoking).
He also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension.
He also has a history of lower gastrointestinal bleed and anemia.
The patient presented to the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on [**2125-9-7**] with shortness of breath and diaphoresis.
He was found to have an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure at the [**Hospital1 882**] and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
In the catheterization laboratory revealed three vessel disease, 100% left anterior descending coronary artery and right coronary artery, short left main carotid artery without any lesions, and an 80% left circumflex artery and an 80% OMI.
There were no interventions done during the catheterization.
In preparation preoperatively he had an echocardiogram, which showed an ejection fraction of 15 to 20% and apical inferior and basal akinesis.
This was in contrast to his transthoracic echocardiogram study in [**2124-5-5**] that showed an ejection fraction of 50%, mild hypokinesis of the inferobasal wall.
The patient was also noted post catheterization to have a mild groin hematoma.
Further preoperative evaluation included diuresis with Lasix as well as carotid doppler ultrasound studies, which demonstrated 60% occlusion in the left carotid artery and essentially clean right carotid artery.
The patient was shocked repeatedly for ventricular fibrillation.
He subsequently went in and out of asystole alternating with ventricular fibrillation.
