Admission Date:  [**2175-6-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-6-8**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13685**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 86608**] is a [**Age over 90 **]M with a history of CAD, CHF (LVEF 20%), atrial fibrillation, moderate atrial stenosis, chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.4 at baseline) transferred from [**Hospital1 112**]/[**Hospital1 882**] on [**2175-6-3**] for further management of systolic heart failure, pulmonary edema, and atrial fibrillation .
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital in early [**Month (only) 116**] for respiratory distress with flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and hypotension requiring vasopressors.
He was eventually discharged to rehab where he spent two days and then re-presented to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on [**2175-5-27**] with BRBPR on tissue after wiping, low grade fever, and leukocytosis.
He was found to be C. difficile positive and was started on PO Flagyl with PO vancomycin added on [**2175-6-1**].
He had a tenuous hemodynamic status during the course of his hospitalization with episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring BiBAP (occurring both in setting of AF w/ RVR as well as when rate controlled)with good resopnse to small IV lasix boluses and on maintenance lasix 20po [**Hospital1 **].
He had several episodes of asymptomatic hypotension with systolics in the 70s-80s for which he was given small fluid boluses.
Per OSH D/C summary, there was concern that cardiac ischemia was contributing to decompensated heart failure so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for stress testing and possible cath.
He had an episode of hypotension earlier in the day so given IVF, carvedilol dose reduced, lasix held.
Then around 21:00 atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Then at 23:00 triggered for tachypnic to 40s, answering questions but retractions on exam, evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR.
Per son, the patient told friend that has not been feeling well for past 6 months with fatigue, shortness of breath.

Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]M with a history of CAD, systolic heart failure(LVEF 20%), atrial fibrillation, moderate atrial stenosis, chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.4 at baseline) transferred to CCU for respiratory distress with evidence of acute pulmonary edema.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Most likely acute pulmonary edema in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate in a patient with severe systolic heart failure and tenuous fluid status.
CXR not consistent with pneumonia.
Pulmonary embolism unlikely given given supratherapeutic INR.
# HYPOTENSION: The suspicion is highest that intermittent hypotension is due to reduced cardiac output in setting of acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
Patient's carvedilol was restarted at a reduced dose but his lisinopril was not given his history of low blood pressure.
- Please do not give ivfs for low blood pressure, unless patient is symptomatic - Tolerates SBP of 80s .
# SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient with EF of 20% on most recent echo thought to be [**2-7**] ischemic heart disease.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Currently in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate in 80-90s.
#HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Unclear history, TTE with evidence of inferior wall akinesis possible c/w old infarct.
# C. DIFFICILE ASSOCIATED DISEASE: Patient treated initially with IV flagyl and vancomycin.
On discharge patient still having diarrhea, can consider cholestyramine at rehab if diarrhea persists.
# CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Baseline creatinine of 1.8, and current Cr is below (1.6) baseline after diuresis.
# BRIGHT RED BLOOD PER RECTUM: No evidence of ongoing bleeding, stable hematocrit.
Assumed to be [**2-7**] hemorrhoid, no colonoscopy.
# TINEA CRURIS: Secondary to diarrhea, in the groin area.
Bruise on left great toe: noted at [**Hospital1 882**] on [**5-28**], no evidence of infection.

Discharge Instructions: You have had many episodes of congestive heart failure in the past month.
WE think that these episodes are because of your atrial fibrillation and have continued the amiodarone to help with heart rate and rhythm control.
You also have been treated with antibiotics for a bowel infection that has caused a lot of diarrhea.
Stop taking the Milk of Magnesia and dulcolax suppositories 2.
Start Nystatin powder or cream to treat the rash in your groin area 4.
Increase lasix to 40 mg daily Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
