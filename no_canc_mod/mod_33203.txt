He awoke this am with 7 episodes of non-biliois, non-bloody vomiting.
Had some associated abdominal pain but no fevers or chills.
Denies any pain from known bilateral hernias.
Also denies any CP, SOB or palpitations today.
CXR showed mild-moderate pulmonary congestion.
Labs notable for mildly elevated WBC ct of 11,000 and lactate of 2.4.
In the ICU, he reports that nausea and vomiting have resolved.
Family History: Mother died of a CVA and had an MI; father died of the flu at age 27; brother had MI at age 79; sister with bladder ca.

Dilated loops of proximal small bowel leading to a long zone of transition ending within a left inguinal hernia with decompressed loops leaving the hernia sac which is concerning for high-grade partial versus early complete small bowel obstruction.
Pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
Moderate pericardial effusion.
CXR: Persistent mild-to-moderate pulmonary congestion with possibly tiny left pleural effusion.
No focal airspace consolidations.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 3 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo male PMH severe AS, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], parksions, inguinal hernia, DMII and HTN admitted for vomiting and abd pain likely [**12-29**] to transient SBO.
Pt also found to be hypoxic with O2 =85 on RA in the ED, and CXR suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
After discussion with cardiology and surgery, decision was made not to intervene or perform elective hernia repair since pt would be at high surgical risk given his underlying critical AS.
He had no further episodes of vomiting and diet was advanced to his home diet of ground solids and thick liquids- which he tolerated well.
#.Acute on chronic systolic CHF/HYPOXIA: Likely related to chronic interstitial lung disease from asbestos exposure as well as CHF component.
CXR revealed some pulm edema.
Recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 41020**] for an exacerbation and started on imuran.
Critical AS: Echo on this admission reveals severe/critical AS (valve area 0.8) with worsening valve gradient and decreased EF 70-->50%.
Pt also had component of CHF [**12-29**] AS and was diuresed.
# Diet: Initialy on clears (thickened clears) and was slowly advanced to ground solids with thickened liquids.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 79449**] ALF  Discharge Diagnosis: Transient small bowel obstruction Severe aortic stenosis Inguinal Hernia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have a transient small bowel obstruction from your hernia.
It was felt that elective surgery was not safe for you given your heart valve disease so the decision was made NOT to perform surgery unless you emergently need it in the future.
