She had been treated with cefazolin [**Date range (1) 19770**] and Vanc [**Date range (1) 19503**] at HD for positive Coag neg staph bacteremia.
On [**2138-10-16**], patient underwent exchange over a wire of left femoral tunneled hemodialysis catheter because of persisent bacteremia with coag negative staph.
Currently, patient reported fatigue and some nausea at dialysis.
She reports poor appetie and poor PO intake over the weekend.
Her boyfriend reports that she has had nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in the past 3 weeks after dialysis.
Also she reports a lesion on her finger.

Echo [**10-21**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT Scan [**2138-10-22**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized thorax, there is a small left pleural effusion and associated relaxation atelectasis.
Atelectatic changes are also seen at the right lung base, though some regions suggest possibility of aspiration as well.
There are dense coronary artery calcifications.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a small amount of pneumoperitoneum with the bulk of free air located anterior to the liver.
In the abdomen, evaluation of the solid organs is limited without intravenous contrast.
Linear regions of low density adjacent to calcified hepatic arteries, particularly in the left [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be dilated bile ducts.
Small locules of air also seen in the superior and anterior central small bowel loops (series 2, image 39).
No definite pneumatosis is seen.
Bowel wall thickness is difficult to establish without oral contrast but appears abnormal the descending colon.
There is no pathologic abdominal lymphadenopathy.
Multiple calcific round densities within the bulky anteverted uterus suggest dystrophic calcification within fibroids.
There is no pelvic  lymphadenopathy.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the spine.
A small umbilical fat- containing hernia is seen.
Abnormal small bowel loops, gas distended, probably will wall thickening and demonstrate fat pericolonic fat effacement.
Possible bowel wall thickening involving the colon and pericolonic fat effacement involving all large bowel.
A locule of air abutting a segment of hepatic flexure.
Densely calcified aorta and celiac and superior mesenteric artery takeoffs in this context is suspiscious for an ischemic component.
Left pleural effusion and associated relaxation atelectasis.
Dense vascular calcifications.
Small fat-containing umbilical hernia.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU Course:  The patient was admitted to the medical ICU for hypotension and concern for recurrent bacteremia after dialysis.
Echocardiogram showed no masses or vegetations, though did show her EF was now 20%, similar to 25% from most recent other echocardiogram.
During an episode of dialysis, she became again hypotensive and developed increased abdominal pain following completion.
Serial KUBs became positive for free air, and CT scan of the abdomen confirmed viscous perforation.
Dialysis was stopped, and on [**2118-10-27**] she had a cardiac arrest, and was declared dead at 1625 without resuscitation efforts.
