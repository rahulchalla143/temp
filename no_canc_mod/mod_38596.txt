Mitral valve replacement 27-mm Biocor tissue heart valve.
History of Present Illness: This 88 year old male with known mitral regurgitation recently developed new onset of exertional chest discomfort.
He underwent elective catheterization at [**Hospital1 **] which revealed severe coronary disease.
He is without pain on transfer.

[**2152-2-25**] Echo: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the distal anterior, anterolateral, and apical walls.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail involving the P1 and P2 scallop interface.
There is moderate to severe mitral annular calcification.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is some suggestion of left ventricular septal dyskinesis/dyssynchrony that may be reated to ventricular pacing.
The apical and distal anterior, anterolateral hypokinesis noted in the prebypass study remains.
There is a bioprosthesis located in the mitral position.
There is a trace perivalvular jet of mitral regurgitation on the anterior side of the prosthesis and a trace jet of valvular regurgitation.
This may indicate some element of functional mitral stenosis.

He developed an ileus that resolved over a couple of days and he was then able to eat, although a modified soft solids and nectar thick liquids.
He had urinary retention and the Foley was replaced on two occassions and was therefor, left in at discharge.
