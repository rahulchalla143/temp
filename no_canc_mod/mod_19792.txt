Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No  atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis in the apex with overall EF around 35-40%.. 3.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in  the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There appear to be three aortic valve leaflets, however there is extensive commissural fusion between the left and the right coronary cusps.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Peribronchial opacity and traction bronchiectasis within the lower right upper lobe and lingula which are likely chronic.
Diffuse atherosclerotic calcification within the aorta and coronary arteries.
No evidence of thoracic aorta aneurysm.
Limited views of the kidneys demonstrate low-density lesion within the upper pole of the right kidney as well as hyperdense lesions within the left kidney, which are incompletely characterized.
His preop CXR revealed a calcified aorta and he had a chest CT to further evaluate.
The patient was noted to have frequent runs of atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia and was started on Amiodarone and Heparin infusions.
He was also noted to have a left arm phlebitis that required antibiotic treatment prior to surgery.
The patient had a metabolic acidosis with low cardiac indicies in his early post-op course and was started on inotropes.
His chest tube was left in place slightly longer for a left pneumothorax however was successfully removed on [**2136-7-16**].
His creatinine was noted to be elevated and his ace inhibitor was held.
