History of Present Illness: 70 yo M with history of ESRD on HD, multiple MRSA line infections, atrial fibrillation, and CAD who is admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.
The patient was noted at dialysis on the day prior to admission to have a fever to 102 with altered mental status and was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He was admitted to the general medicine service on [**2132-6-5**] with fever and lethargy.
An LP was not performed given that the pt's lethargy had improved and he was thought to be at his baseline mental status.
35 minutes after initiating dialysis (with 500cc fluid removal), the pt began having rigors with shortness of breath.
HTN 4.
CAD - mild 40% prox LAD on cath '[**27**] 7.
Hypothyroidism 10.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 102.7 BP 108/40 HR 90 RR 26 99% on 100% NRB Gen: ill-appearing man in respiratory distress, answers questions yes and no, diaphoretic HEENT: dry mucous membranes, PERRL, EOMI Neck: supple, JVP ~[**8-2**] Lungs: diffuse crackles with decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in bilateral lower lobes Cor: RRR, nml S1S2 Abd: NABS, soft NTND Ext: warm, no edema, previous fistula RUE   Brief Hospital Course: 1.
CXR reveals slightly increased vascular markings and new cuffing, concerning for possible volume overload though compared to last several months the CXR is not that different.
This CXR was after the patient was acutely hypertensive to 203/126 with HR 122, which could point to possible flash pulmonary edema.
Given hx of DVT, can also consider PE, especially with large A-a gradient.
Pt also has element of hypoventilation with poor oxygenation by ABG.
Pt developed opacity on CXR suggestive of pna and abx treatment initiated once MRSA pneumonia identified; however, pt's respiratory distress did not resolve c vancomycin x 19 days.
Pulmonary edema noted on CXR and pt diuresed gently because prone to hypotension particularly c hemodialysis.
Currently, limiting factor largely pt's respiratory muscle weakness 2/2 prolonged hospitalization.
Yesterday also tolerated trial sprint of [**3-27**] although became tachypneic.
Sepsis: Pt with elevated lactate, fevers and hypotension (after intubation) pointing to sepsis.
Likely line infection from femoral dialysis catheter.
Continue Levofloxacin for GNR (which are sensitive) and Vanco given hx of staph aureus line infections.
After abx course pt continued to have intermitent feverss and multiple episodes fo MAP dropping into 30-40s.
Initially treated c multiple IVF boluses.
Etiology of hypoT likely sepsis and hypovolemia as pt had CVPs<10 and hypotension worse after hemodialysis.
Pt eventually grew Serratia out of his blood cultures and was treated c a 21 day course of ceftaz.
Afterwards, he continued to have low grade fevers and developed the aforementioned LLL pna.
On this regimen his LLL opacity has resolved and his fever curve has turned downward.
He has since had no positive blood cultures.
Pt currently no WBC, no tachyc and today hypertensive c MAPs>75.
Pt c temporary dialysis cath in place and will require more permanent line eventually.
Pt required supplementation of his phosphate c neutraphos regularly and briefly reqrd recalcitrol.
Possibly [**12-26**] GI bleed as pt c h/o melanic stools, Guiac positive regularly, and on significant anticoagulation c argatroban/coumadin.
Also, maybe [**12-26**] Fe deficiency and so pt given iron supplements.
Pt will require colonoscopy/EGD as outpt to further eval guiac positive stools.
Pt c one episode of tachycardia c rate controlled c diltiazem.
Otherwise no incidents.
[**Name (NI) 34483**] Pt c h/o HIT and also upper extremity clots so not started on heparin.
Requires intermitent supplementation of phosphate c neutraphos based on low serum phosphate.
On left pt has braciocephalic clot preventing PIC placement.
Pt now c 1 peripheral IVs.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed: For anxiety when pt's resp rate increases significantly.
