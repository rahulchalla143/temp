Admission Date:  [**2105-10-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-10-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2028-9-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Codeine / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: s/p fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R sided thoracocentesis   History of Present Illness: 77 yo female with pmhx sig for hypertension and ETOH abuse who initially presented to ED hypotensive and hypothermic after being found down at her home for an undetermined amount of time.
Pt was found to have small left parietal subdural hemorrhage around motor cortex strip, and intraventricular blood on CT scan, started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
In addition, pt noted to have multiple R rib fractures, right nondisplaced clavicle fracture, and a right distal radial fracture (reduced and splinted).
Abdominal CT also revealed contusion around the uncinate process of the pancreas and third portion of duodenum, with a small amount of fluid.
Patient also noted to have significant CK elevation.
Complains of slight difficulty breathing secondary to pain.
Denies chest pain, nausea or vomiting.
Cannot recall the details of her fall and says she "doesn't care".
HTN Hyperlipidemia Glaucoma Anemia (baseline hct unknown)   Social History: smoked [**1-5**] ppd x 56 years, + ETOH use, pt reports last drink Friday, cannot quantify how much she drinks per day, widowed, lives alone, three sons involved with care  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: tm 98.8/ tc 97.4/ bp 110/60/ pulse 86/ 88% on 5L NC GEN: elderly female, well developed, lethargic but arousable, conversant, answers questions appropriately HEENT: L pupil > R pupil (3 mm, 1 mm), reactive.
NECK: c-collar in place CV: RRR, no murmurs, no rubs LUNGS: Decreased bs at bases, R>>L.
Poor air movement.
RIGHT WRIST XRAY: There is an obliquely oriented fracture across the distal right radius which extends into the radiocarpal and radioulnar joint spaces medially.
There is moderate lateral offset and mild to moderate dorsal angulation.
Small acute subdural hemorrhage along the left inferior parietal lobe; small amount of intraventricular blood in the lateral ventricles.
Sinusitis; polypoid soft tissue in the frontal sinuses may represent polyps versus retention cysts.
7 mm scalp hematoma along the right temporofrontal region.
C-SPINE CT: Marked degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Emphysematous changes in the lungs with superimposed fluid overload.
Small right pneumothorax.
Dependent soft tissue material in the trachea, which may represent secretions; attention to this region should be paid on future imaging.
Note added at attending review: The extent of the facet degenerative changes and fragmentation make it difficult to exclude subtle facet fracture.
Small amount of fluid around the uncinate process of the pancreas and third portion of duodenum with a small amount of fluid at the mesentery, representing contusion.
Multiple fractures in right ribs and right distal clavicle.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Fibroid uterus.
Marked degenerative changes of the spine.
Persistent increase in interstitial pulmonary markings at lung bases.
Small left parietal extra-axial subacute hematoma in keeping with CT findings of [**2105-10-20**].
No acute ischemic event.
Findings consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic change in the supratentorial white matter.
Polyp versus mucus retention cyst in the left frontal sinus and air/fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 77 yo female smoker with pmhx sig for ETOH abuse, HTN, s/p fall and LOC resulting in multiple fractures and [**Hospital 56102**] transferred to MICU for hypoxemia in setting of splinting, COPD, increasing pleural effusions.
# Hypoxemia - On admission, O2 sats were noted to be in mid to high 80s on [**3-8**] L NC.
Thought to be [**2-5**] underlying COPD vs. splinting from rib fxs vs. PNA vs. fluid overload.
Given nebs for COPD and incentive spirotmetry.
Pain was controlled with Ultram prn, standing tylenol, prn dilaudid, prn morphine (pt did not ask for morphine), lidocaine patch and topical capsaicin.
Had R sided thoracocentesis performed with 1 L of serosanginuous fluid removed.
Studies consistent with exudative effusion with > 100 K RBCs and 1800 WBCs, pH 7.47.
Exudative effusion likely [**2-5**] mixed picture of blood from multiple R sided rib fractures and WBCs likely from pneumonic process, although effusion not parapneumonic.
CTA to r/o PE was also considered; however not obtained as pt did improve s/p thoracentesis and pt likely lives at lower O2 sat given severe emphysematous changes seen on chest CT on admission.
No signs/symptoms of active withdrawal.
Social consult consulted for addictions and followed pt, offering support during hospital course.
# SDH - Found to have L parietal extraaxial hematoma and small intraventricular hemorrhage on admission.
Noted to have sudden R facial droop and RUE weakness on HD 3, neurology consulted.
Repeat NCHCT showed stable bleed, no new hemorrhage.
MRI/MRA not significant for ischemic event.
EEG showed diffuse slowing but no epileptiform waves.
Received acetaminophen standing, morphine prn, dilaudid prn, lidocaine patch for pain control.
# Hypertension- Norvasc was held on admission and restarted in setting of elevated BPs.
# FEN- low Na diet.
# Access- L sided PICC.
# Code- full, but patient would not want to be on ventilator for prolonged period of time .
