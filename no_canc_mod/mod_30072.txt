No acute pathology is identified to explain the patient's symptom.
No evidence of bowel ischemia or arterial dissection is identified.
Anasarca is present and there is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Echo: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis.
There is turbulent color flow around the left main coronary artery coursing anteriorly.
This may reflect hyperemic coronary flow, but a coronary artery A-V fistula cannot be excluded.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
