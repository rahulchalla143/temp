Admission Date:  [**2191-11-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-11-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-9-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Hydralazine / Opioid Analgesics / Compazine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Removal of hemodialysis catheter, replacement with tunnelled catheter Pulmonary Intubation Placement of PICC line Cardiac cathteterization: 3VD   History of Present Illness: 74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, HTN, SVC stenosis s/p dilation presents from HD with acute dyspnea.
In dialysis, she had a low-grade temp of 99, and developed chills and respiratory distress with sats 80's on NRB at which time she was sent to ED for further evaluation.
She reported chest pain.
She had evidence of new LBBB with discordant ST elevations <5mm in V2-V4.
In the cath lab, she was found to be right dominant with no disease in left main.
Serial 90% lesions in LAD with TO at mid LAD.
She has left-to-left collaterals.
Minimal disease in circ.
Lesion in RCA could be crossed wire but not ballon due to tortous nature.
LVEDP was elevated at 35.
Hypertension 2.
CVA [**2186**]: left caudate infarct; mini-strokes before that 6.
SVC stenosis 9.
Family History: Mother: died 5 year ago (cause unknown to pt) Father: died when pt was 17 (cause unknown to pt) Children have no major medical problems  Physical Exam:   VS: T=98.3 BP=159/66 HR=82  RR=19 O2 sat= 95% on AC 500/16/5/1 HENT: Pupils 4->3 mm, equal.
Scleral edema  GEN: Intubated.
II/VII systolic murmur at LUSB without radiatation to carotids.
Diffuse ralles.
NGTD since then Influenza neg C Diff neg x 3  CXR [**11-29**] No evidence for CHF or pneumonia.
Minimal bibasilar atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
This is very likely due to underdistension and much less likely due to antral gastritis.
No bowel obstruction.
No evidence of fluid collection.
Colonic diverticula, most prominent in the sigmoid colon.
No evidence for diverticulitis.
These are indeterminate by CT criteria and may be further evaluated with renal ultrasound.
This is unchanged from multiple prior studies and may represent an adrenal nodule.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall, distal septum and apex.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-10-26**], a mild regional left ventricular wall motion abnormality is now seen c/w CAD, Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now present.
Diastolic dysfunction and elevated systemic blood pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
BACTEREMIA: Pt found to have Pantoea spp in multiple cultures on [**11-22**].
As pt continued to be febrile with climbing WBC, his hemodialysis line was removed and thought to be the culprit infectious source as she developed rigors with removal.
Given the persistent elevated WBC, pt was screened for C Diff and although was negative x 3, was treated empirically with PO flagyl while on Meropenem for the bacteremia.
PUMP: On presentation pt was hypoxic with SOB, and showed signs of pulmonary edema on CXR, in the setting of demand ischemia.
Echo showed normal EF, interatrial aneusym and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall, distal septum and apex.
Patient was extubated without difficulties, and continued to sat well afterwards.
CORONARIES: Pt was determined to have demand ischemia given bacteremia.
Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions not amenable to PCI that appear chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given bacteremia.
RHYTHM: Pt remained in NSR the majority of the hospitalization except several episodes of atrial tachycardia controlled with IV betablocker.
GI BLEED: Had guaiac positive stool but HD and labs stable.
C diff was sent and negative x 3 but per ID recs, given high white count and broad, will continue getting prophylactic flagyl dosed at hemodialysis while on 2 week meropenem course.
HYPOTHYROIDISM  - Pt was continued on levothyroxine.
Lactulose 30ml PO PRN for constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Anxiety.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Fever, pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Demand coronary ischemia, not STEMI End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis Bacteremia with Pantoea, on Meropenem Gastroenteritis/Diarrhea Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable.
You developed an infection in your blood, you will need intravenous antibiotics to treat this.
Miropenem: to treat the infection in your blood 2.
Flagyl: to prevent a bowel infection while you are on the Miropenem 3.
