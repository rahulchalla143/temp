At that time, she had been near her baseline [**Location (un) **] but did note increased burping several times/week associated with [**Location (un) 2452**] juice for low blood sugars.
She now gets SOB with walking across her garage.
An echo was performed to further evaluate her new DOE and revealed new LV dysfunction.
In addition, at her PCP's office, she reportedly had an EKG with TWI in the inferior distribution.
On the night prior to admission, she had 1 episode of left chest pain which lasted for 1hr, radiated to left arm and was associated with nausea.
In the ED, EKG showed T wave inversions in inferior-lateral leads.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Diabetes Mellitus Type II Palpitations - frequent APCs, PVCs Carpal Tunnel Syndrome   Social History: No tobacco use.
Family History: Her father died of massive MI in 50's.
There is no other family history of malignancy.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Neck: Supple with JVP flat., no carotid bruits CV: RR with one ectopic beat, normal S1, S2.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No focal consolidations are seen.
No evidence of pleural effusion.
2)Ischemic ST segment changes persisting late post-exercise in the absence of anginal symptoms 3) At the level of exercise achieved, severe fixed apical inferior to basal inferior wall defect.
4) Moderate to severe primarily reversible defect of the apex and antero-septal/septal segments extending from the apex to the base.
The RCA had a long 50% proximal lesion and was totally occluded in its midportion; the distal RCA system was supplied by good left-to-right collaterals.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertension and markedly elevated LV filling pressures.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve.
Left ventriculography showed depressed LV function with 45% LVEF.
There was severe inferoapical hypokinesis.
[**2132-8-20**] Carotid Ultrasound: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
[**2132-8-21**] Echocardiogram: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal inferior wall and hypkinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 32233**] was admitted under cardiology, and ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Stress test on [**2132-8-18**] demonstrated ischemic EKG changes, and MIBI demonstrated a irreversible defect inferiorly, and a significant reversible area in the apical-septal/septal area.
On the morning of [**2132-8-19**], she complained of dull chest pain and nausea, with EKG changes noted in the distribution seen on stress.
Cardiac catheterization revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
She remained pain free on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to assist in the management of her diabetes mellitus.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 169**] of [**Location (un) 55**] (formerly known as Heathwood)  Discharge Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease - s/p CABG Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Diabetes Mellitus Type II   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: 1)Please shower daily.
