There is bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.

This may account for blurring of bronchovascular structures in the perihilar regions as well as indistinctness of the diaphragmatic contours.
However, considering clinical suspicion for infection, repeat radiograph with suspended inspiration would be helpful to exclude subtle abnormalities in these areas.
There are no pleural effusions.
