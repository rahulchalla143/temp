The patient was seen urgently in the clinic for evaluation on [**2118-10-5**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 715**] for right-sided chest pain and CXR done at that time revealed bilateral lower lobe opacities that could represent pneumonia as well as diffuse lung disease with peripheral and basilar distribution associated with honeycombing and punctate pulmonary calcifications suggestive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

The patient had a routine appoitment with his [**Name10 (NameIs) 3390**] on the day of admission, who referred him to ED because of persistent symptoms and slow decline.
No drenching sweats.
He does have contipation and occasional lower extremity swelling.
No weight loss.
CXR showed new focal opacity in the righ lung apex.
On home oxygen and chronic prednisone.
Hypertension 3.

Spinal stenosis 9.
Degenerative arthritis 10.
Hearing loss 11.
He is retired attorney and denies any occupational exposures.
Family History: Positive for cardiac disease and hypertension  Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS: 95.5, 138/70, 81, 18, 92% on 4L GENERAL: elderly gentelman, alert and oriented, pleasant, cooperative, well appearing HEENT: NC, AT, pupils equal and small, sclera non-icteric, OP with thrush NECK: supple, no LAD, no thyromegaly LUNGS: dry bilateral crackles HEART: regular, nl S1, S2, [**2-6**] syst murmur at LUSB ABDOMEN: + Bs, soft, NT, ND EXTREMITIES: no edema, DP 2+ bilaterally NEUROLOGIC: Alert and oriented, appropriate, no gross motor and sensory deficits SKIN: no exanthems   Pertinent Results: CXR [**2118-10-18**]: New focal opacity at the right lung apex, likely represents pneumonic consolidation.
Additional bibasilar opacities consistent with continued superimposed pneumonia.
Bilateral emphysematous change and interstitial opacities suggestive of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
Ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe which may represent superimposed infection.
Extensive inter and intralobular septal thickening with bilateral basal honeycombing consistent with UIP.
Bilateral severe emphysema with large emphysematous bullae in the lower lobes.
Small hypoechoic lesions in the liver, which are too small to  characterize.

Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with h/o possible idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis on chronic prednisone admitted with progression of DOE, low grade fevers and change in sputum color after failing outpatient empiric therapy for PNA.
Shortness of breath.
Most likely due to an acute infectious process superimposed on his underlying interstitial lung disease.
The differential for this patient on chronic prednisone was considered to be broad, including atypical CAP as well as fungal infections, [**Age over 90 3390**], [**Name10 (NameIs) **] less likely MAC given upper lobe distribution.
There was no no evidence of bronchospasm and no evidence that this underlying interstitial lung disease was contributing to his decompensation.
Pt is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in dyspnea center, where he will also have repeat PFTs.
It appears that patient underlying condition is more consistent with IPF rather than COPD .
Most likely in the setting of acute renal failure and demand ischemia.
Acute renal failure.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
RUL pneumonia - Gram positive rods 2.
Acute renal failure 3.
HTN 5.
If you experience any fevers/chills and worsening of cough, please seek medical attention.
If unable to eat and drink also seek medical attention.
