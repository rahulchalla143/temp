Mesenteric Angiography.
History of Present Illness: This a 71 year old female with multiple medical problems including recurrent GI bleed, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastritis, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency and depression who presents to the ED after finding her blood pressure to be 84/54 at home on the day of admission.
Patient reports having worsening dyspnea on exertion, dark stools, dizziness with standing and chest pressure with walking x 3-4 days.
Patient has a history of upper GI bleed secondary to gastritis ([**4-27**]) and a negative workup for a duodenal neuro-endocrine tumor.
Most recent hospitalization for bleeding was secondary to small bowel AVMs found on EGD.
Denies changes in diet, fever/chills, abdominal pain, recent alcohol consumption, nausea/vomitting or recent trauma.
A nasogastric lavage was performed which did not reveal an active bleed but also failed to produce bile.
Gastritis 2.
History of upper gastrointestinal bleed 3.
Coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2095**] 5.
Hypertension 6.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.
Type 2 diabetes 8.
History of small bowel bleed, s/p electrocauterization of AVMs `04 18.
History of hospitalization for intermittent small bowel obstruction   Social History: Former smoker, quit greater than 30 years ago.
General: Alert and oriented, pleasant, no dyspnea and no acute distress.
Cardiovascular, regular rate with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at base radiating to carotids.
No carotid bruits auscultated.
No jugulovenous pressure.
Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
No cranial nerve deficits.
EKG [**2103-7-11**] Sinus rhythm, without diagnostic abnormality.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2103-1-18**] T wave inversions are no longer present.
IMPRESSION: Selective arteriography of the superior mesenteric artery and jejunal branches demonstrated no evidence of arteriovenous malformation or active hemorrhage.
ECHO [**2103-7-17**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 71 year old female with multiple medical problems who presented with GI bleed.
GIB: A push enteroscopy was performed that revealed melena in the duodenum and fresh blood in the proximal jejunum 80-90 cm from teeth.
IR was unable to embolize the source of bleed and so patient underwent repeat endoscopy with successful cauterization of the site of bleed.
NSTEMI- She developed chest pain and EKG showed ST depression in V4-V6.
NSTEMI was likely secdonary to demand ischemia with tachycardia in setting of her GI bleed.
Plaxix and asapirin were held given history of GI bleed.
A repeat ECHO on [**2103-7-17**] was mainly unchanged aside from increased left ventricular hypertrophy.
Patient had remained chest pain free from the time of tranfer from the MICU to the day of discharge.
Anemia- patient was found to have iron deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficient.
Non-ST elevation myocardial infarcation.
Acute Renal Failure.
Blood Loss Anemia.
Left Lower Lobe Pneumonia.
Chronic Renal Insufficiency.
Duodenal Neuroendocrine Tumor.
CAD - Angioplasty Lcx [**10/2096**].
Diabetes Mellitus Type II.
Iron Deficiency Anemia.
15. s/p Small bowel resection.
