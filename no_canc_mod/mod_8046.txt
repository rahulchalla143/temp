Admission Date:  [**2121-4-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-4-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-5-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Augmentin / Gluten  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**] Chief Complaint: back pain/groin pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement CT-guided left paraspinal muscle biopsy right knee arthrocentesis   History of Present Illness: 70 year old female with celiac disease, osteoporosis, B12 deficiency, L4 compression fracture initially presented with to PCP [**4-1**] with right groin/hip pain X 2 weeks; U/S was without DVT.
She was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic [**4-3**] and underwent an pelvic MRI, later read as a right sacral insufficiency fracture.
She presented to the ED [**4-7**] complaining of continued right groin pain, associated with difficulty starting her urine stream and constipation.
In the ED, she had a temp to 101.6, and was noted to be hypotensive sbp 80s (baseline 90s-100s)in the setting of a HCT 24 (baseline 34-36).
Currently, she notes mild low back pain.
No groin pain at rest, but pain occurs, "gnawing" in character, when she moves her right leg.
She notes that the back pain is in a band across her back, worse on the left, occasional shooting pain around her back, but not down her leg.
She also notes bilateral leg weakness R>L, although it is difficult for her to determine whether this is due to true weakness or pain.
She notes fever and chills X 1 week.
She has noted difficulty initiating urinary stream X 6 mos, denies urinary/bowel incontinence  ROS: She denies shortness of breath or cough.
No sore throat, no dysuria, no diarrhea.
She is constipated, no black stool or rectal bleeding  Past Medical History: Celiac sprue: chronic diarrhea, improved recently on a gluten-free diet.
Does yoga  Family History: Mother with osteoporosis and diabetes.
(+) mild edema right lower extremity.
(+) right groin tenderness over hamstring tendon.
Sensation intact to light touch proximally and distally in upper and lower extremities bilaterally Psychiatric: appropriate, pleasant GU: normal external genitalia Heme/Lymph: No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy Back: (+) point tenderness L4, L5, S1.
(+) paraspinal muscle spasm at L5.
(+) pain at hip flexion to 60 degrees, but pain is in groin, not back/leg.
Left atrial abnormality.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Radiology [**4-18**] Torso CT: No pulmonary nodules, parenchymal consolidations, or pleural effusions are noted within the lungs.
There is a calcific focus/surgical clip in the calcification in the left lung apex which is associated with fibrotic change most likely secondary to the patient's prior granulomatous disease.
Shotty mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged by CT criteria.
The liver has decreased attenuation consistent with fatty change.
No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal mesenteric lymph nodes are seen.
Right ischial bursitis.
Fluid collections are noted within both hip joints most likely secondary to an underlying arthritis.
There are areas of sclerosis within the sacral bones which are consistent with the patient's history of sacral insufficiency fracture.
The previously mentioned hypodensity in the left paraspinal area at the level of L4 and T11 are unchanged.
[**4-16**] MRI L-spine: No significant interval change in the enhancement of the left paraspinal muscle tissues compared to [**2121-4-9**].
Differential diagnosis would include both infection versus inflammation.
[**4-14**] right upper extremity ultrasound: Thrombosis of the right cephalic vein.
No evidence of extension to other veins of the upper arm.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion  [**4-10**] right shoulder X-ray: No fracture is seen.
No prior shoulder studies available  [**4-9**] C/T/L spine MRI with contrast: Cervical spine: No disc, vertebral or paraspinal pathology is seen.
There is no spinal stenosis or suluxation of the component vertebrae.
Thoracic spine: No significant interval changes are seen in the thoracic spine images when compared to a prior study.
Folowing gadolinium adiminstration, no abnormal enhancement is seen.
Lumbar spine: Sagital and axial images of the lumbar spine after gadolinium administration demonstrate enhancement of the left paraspinal muscles from L2 to L5 extending into the subcutaneous soft tissues.
No other areas of abnormal enhancement are noted.
IMPRESSION: L2 to L5 left paraspinal muscle enhancement extending into the subcutaneous tissues.
In view of negative history of recent trauma, these findings most likely represent infection.
[**4-8**] MRI T spine without contrast: There is mild compression of the superior endplate of T11 identified without increased signal on inversion recovery images indicating chronic compression.
Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic region.
No evidence of acute compression fracture identified.
There is no evidence of cord compression.
There is no evidence of intraspinal fluid collection.
[**4-8**] MRI L spine without contrast: Insufficiency fracture involving the right ala of sacrum.
Fluid within the left facet joint of L4-5 with soft tissue increased signal in the adjacent areas could be secondary to degenerative change and soft tissue edema but early septic arthritis of the facet joint could not be excluded.
[**4-7**] CT Abd/pelvis w/o contrast: No retroperitoneal bleed or intra-abdominal collections.
Tiny perihepatic air bubbles of unknown significance.
[**4-4**] MRI hip: bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures R>L, bilateral hip effusions, extensive SC edema, small amt of intraperitoneal free fluid  [**4-4**] Lumbar spine plain films: unchanged L4 compression fracture, mild degnerative arthritis, narrowing of L4-5 disc space  [**4-3**] LENI: tubular hypoechogenic strcuture in right groin area adjacent to tendinous structures that could represent hematoma  Pathology [**4-18**] Left paraspinal muscle biopsy: Nodular fibroblastic proliferation with associated dense fibrosis and focal chronic inflammation; adjacent skeleton muscle with atrophic and reactive changes; no active inflammation present.
[**4-22**] left temporal artery biopsy: No arteritis seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old female with celiac disease, osteoporosis, and spinal compression fractures admitted with groin/back pain in the setting of recently diagnosed sacral insufficiency fractures, found to be anemic with fever and elevated inflammatory markers.
1) Fevers/myositis/elevated systemic inflammation markers: Given fever, back pain, and lower extremity weakness, there was an initial concern for epidural/spinal infection.
The patient underwent C/T/L spine MRIs with and without contrast (see results section), which were significant for fluid within the left facet joint of L4-5 with soft tissue increased signal in the adjacent areas that could be secondary to degenerative change and soft tissue edema but early septic arthritis of the facet joint could not be excluded.
A repeat MRI of the L-spine was obtained on [**4-16**] which showed no significant interval change in the enhancement of the left paraspinal muscle tissues compared to [**2121-4-9**].
The biopsy showed nodular fibroblastic proliferation with associated dense fibrosis and focal chronic inflammation; adjacent skeleton muscle with atrophic and reactive changes; no active inflammation was present.
In terms of other infectious work-up, blood cultures had no growth to date, TTE was without evidence of endocarditis, and urine culture was negative.
Given elevated ESR (max 103) and CRP (max >300) a rheumatology consult was obtained.
[**Doctor First Name **] was negative and RF was not elevated; SPEP and UPEP were without monoclonal bands.
She has a torso CT which showed left apical lung calcific focus, shotty, non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal/hilar LAD, fatty liver, right ischial bursitis, and bilateral hip effusions, but no evidence of malignancy.
Orthopedics were consulted for possible hip arthrocentesis, but given good range of movement of hips without significant pain, these were not felt to be infected (rheumatology and infectious disease services agreed).
The patient underwent a temporal artery biopsy to evaluate for giant cell arteritis on [**4-22**], which was without evidence of arteritis.
She remained afebrile and, at time of discharge, her ESR and CRP were trending down (85 and 119.7, respectively).
She should also follow-up with her gastroenterologist for EGD/colonoscopy (given risk of lymphoma with celiac sprue) and have age-appropriate outpatient cancer screening (mammogram - last [**2118**] BIRADS 1, pap smear).
2) Bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures: The orthopedic service (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted, who recommended weight bearing as tolerated and follow-up with orthopedics as an outpatient.
3) Anemia of chronic disease: The patient's HCT was 24 on admit from 36 on 11/[**2119**].
She has a history of celiac sprue, but her symptoms have improved on low-gluten diet.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease (due to celiac sprue vs above inflammatory process), vitamin B12 was elevated, folate wnl, and UPEP/SPEP without monoclonal bands (has had abnormal tests in the past).
Fibrinogen was elevated, not consistent with DIC, and haptoglobin was elevated, not consistent with hemolysis.
The nephrology team was consulted, who felt this was secondary to SIADH (possibly related to pain, chest CT/head CT without abnormalities) and recommended fluid restriction (2L/day) and salt tabs.
8) Osteoporosis/spinal Compression fx: The patient was continued on calcium, vitamin D, and Fosamax  9) Right arm cephalic vein thrombosis: Following a right PICC line placement, the placement developed right arm swelling.
An ultrasound revealed a catheter-associated right cephalic vein clot.
3) Please see your primary care physician or come to the emergency room if you develop worsening back pain, weakness, fevers, chills, or other symptoms that concern you.
