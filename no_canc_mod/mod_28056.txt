EMS came and found her to have a v-fib arrest.
At the OSH, she was treated with insulin, glucose, and bicarb for hyperkalemia (6.5) and was started on an amiodarone drip.
She was dialyzed yesterday night with improvement in her K to 4.4 and resolution of her EKG changes.
She was started on levophed for hypotension and was noted to have an elevated WBC with a left shift.
She was also noted to have an elevation in cardiac enzymes (CK 1440->1348, MB 27-23, MBI 1.9-1.7, Trop 0.39) and new [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] cardiology was consulted.
Cardiology recommended that she go for an urgent cardiac catheterization.
At cath, she was noted to have 3+ MR< LVEF of 40%, and severe inferior hypokinesis.
She had a 90% mid-LAD lesion, a 70% LCx lesion at the ramus, and a 100% proximal RCA lesion.
She had two stents placed to the mid-LAD, but during the procedure she vomited coffee-ground emesis and the catheterization was terminated.
Past Medical History: h/o GIB in the past, as above DM not on insulin since [**5-19**] infection ESRD secondary to PCKD, with HD qMWF s/p renal transplant several years ago HTN, not medically treated since [**5-19**] infection h/o line infection [**5-19**]   Social History: Married with children  Physical Exam: On arrival in MICU: Afebrile SBP 80s-100s on pressors RR10, 100% O2 on CMV at 40% FiO2 Gen: Intubated, sedated, nonresponsive HEENT: mmm, OP benign, PERRL CV: RRR systolic murmur Resp: coarse breath sounds bilaterally anteriorly Abd: obese, NABS, soft, nondistended Ext: edematous, warm.
Left subclavian dialysis catheter, R forearm fistula (maturing), left radial arterial line, left femoral line Skin: no rash Nro: Intubated and sedated.
However, in the absence of soft tissue changes or abscess, the findings are not specific.
Dual energy gallium/bone scan would be helpful for further evaluation.
The signal abnormality involving both medial temporal lobes, insula bilaterally, and cingulate gyri appears to have progressed, and demonstrates abnormal signal on diffusion-weighted imaging.
New high signal intensity in the CSF overlying the right parietal lobe, incompletely assessed.
CXR: ([**10-7**]): A single portable chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular heads.
No right-sided central venous catheter is evident.
No pneumothorax.
Right hilar contour is unchanged from previous study of [**2137-10-4**].
Retrocardiac opacity and mild pulmonary edema remain unchanged.
CAROTID US ([**10-7**]): IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
UE US ([**10-7**]): 1) No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or collection.
No evidence for abscess.
Right kidney complex hyperdense lesion likely consistent with renal cell carcinoma and less likely a complex hemorrhagic cyst.
Mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
Splenic infarct.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No obvious evidence of endocarditis seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2137-9-25**], there has been no significant change.
EEG ([**10-8**]): IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to overall slowing suggestive of a diffuse moderate encephalopathy with superimposed bursts and runs of sharp and slow, spike and slow discharges suggesting marked increase to irritability overall.
Brief Hospital Course: * Hypotension - The hypotension could have been from infection, cardiogenic shock, or medications; there were no signs of hemorrhage/volume depletion or neurogenic compromise.
The patient remained persistantly hypotensive on levophed during her 2 week stay in the MICU, with the addition of vasopressin and continued hypotension.
She received antibiotics and antivrials to treat possible infections; her MRI was suggestive of HSV encephalitis although CSF cultures were negative, and only one set of sputum cultures ([**9-28**]) were positive, with no positive blood cultures.
An abdominal CT showed no source of infection, there was no pneumonia seen on chest x-rays and no sign of thrombophlebitis on US.
Her LFTs showed no suggestion of hepatic or biliary infection.
* Mental Status changes: After her first extubation in the CCU the patient was noted to have an asymmetric neuro exam, with concern for CVA but head CT negative.
An MRI was suggestive of temporal lobe enhancement suggesting HSV encephalitis and the patient was maintained on acyclovir.
An LP yielded no organisms in culture.
EEG showed severe encephalopathy without seizure.
* NSTEMI - On arrival in the MICU, the patient was s/p cath, able to get stents in LAD before termination.
Repeat ECHOs showed good EF (>55%) and no abnormalities to explain the patient's persistant hypotension.
* Vfib arrest- The etiology is most likely ischemic given h/o chest pain prior to event.
This acidosis probably caused hyperkalemia as well, as pt's K was very high.
There were no more episodes of vfib or arrythmia during admission and the patient received stents with ECHOs showing good function.
*Renal failure/hyperkalemia - She was followed by the renal team and maintained on CVVH as her blood pressure permitted.
*Prophylaxis: - no sc heparin as initial GI bleeding; pneumatic boots, PPI, bowel regimen  *Communication - with husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 42632**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 63275**]), daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 22807**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 63276**](H), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 63277**](C))  Medications on Admission: ASA 81mg protonix lidoderm patch SSI + NPH  Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory failure Persistant hypotension status-post Ventricular fibrillation arrest Encephalopathy with concern for herpes encephalitis Polycystic kidney disease Diabetes GI bleeding Hypertenion End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis  Discharge Condition: Expired
