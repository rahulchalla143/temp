Recent admission on [**9-12**] for placement of a new hepatic drain in the right lobe that grew out B-lactamase producing Klebsiella and Enterococcus that was resistant to Synercid.
Patient had been afebrile following the last discharge until day of admission when he developed fever and chills.
He also has chronic abdominal pain which has not worsened.Denies dysuria or constipation/diarrhea  Past Medical History: cryptogenic cirrhosis, s/p liver transplant [**11-21**] hepatic artery thrombosis VRE bacteremia sepsis multiple liver abcesses SBO with surgical repair [**4-21**] chronic renal insufficiency inguinal hernia diverticulitis depression esophageal varices hyperkalemia anemia  Social History: no tobacco, no EtOH, former chef   Family History: single lives with Mother [**Name (NI) **] 3 siblings with 1 deceased sibling  Physical Exam: On admission: VS:100.5, 112, 100/57, 24, 97%RA Gen: NAD, Cachectic HEENT: Sclera anicteric, no cervical LAD Lungs: CTA bilaterally Heart: RRR Abd: Soft, Non-tender, non-distended, no guarding, no rebound, 3drains in place Extr: No LE edema, warm, well prefused  Pertinent Results: On Admission:[**2122-9-26**] GLUCOSE-160* UREA N-23* CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-130* POTASSIUM-5.1 CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-17* ANION GAP-15 ALT(SGPT)-35 AST(SGOT)-37 ALK PHOS-343* AMYLASE-11 TOT BILI-1.3 DIR BILI-0.8* INDIR BIL-0.5  LIPASE-8 ALBUMIN-2.7* CALCIUM-8.5 PHOSPHATE-2.8 MAGNESIUM-1.7 WBC-5.4# RBC-3.26* HGB-10.1* HCT-27.2* MCV-83 MCH-31.0 MCHC-37.2* RDW-16.6* PLT COUNT-40* PT-15.5* PTT-32.6 INR(PT)-1.4*  Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted from [**Hospital **] Rehab with recurrent fever with chills.
CT Abdomen/pelvis performed on [**9-27**] showed: Two new low attenuation regions within the right lobe of the liver that likely represented new bile lakes.
Diffuse pneumatosis of the colon and unchanged appearance of partially occlusive thrombus at the confluence of the SMV and portal vein.
It was felt that these bile collections were too small to add an additional drain at that time.
Patient spiked fevers to 104.
ID was consulted for revision of the antibiotic regimen to include Amikacin, Colistin and Tigecycline for the Klebsiella and Posaconazole & Caspofungin for the [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and Mucor.
CXRs were stable with small right pleural effusion.
J tube was also self removed when he was delerious during a febrile/hypotensive episode necessitating SICU management.
He continued to spike temps intermittently and his condition worsened with increased lethargy/endurance.
After much deliberation by the patient and the transplant team, the patient was informed that his chance of receiving a liver was very unlikely due to persistent high grade klebsiella antibiotic resistance and fungemia.
He was discharged on his transplant immunosuppression to prevent rejection which consisted of Rapamune 0.5mg qd via the J tube.
His abdominal pain was managed well with po dilaudid.
He continued to have persistent hypokalemia requiring daily repletion.
