Admission Date:  [**2197-10-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2197-11-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2158-10-30**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEUROLOGY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 38-year-old woman with history of left internal capsule stroke in [**2177**], secondary to cavernous angioma, right frontal stroke in [**2195**] secondary to right internal carotid dissection.
She was admitted on [**2197-10-16**] after undergoing cerebral and renal angiograms for evaluation of a right internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm and further evaluation of diagnosis fibromuscular dysplasia.
Post procedure, she developed occlusion of the internal carotid artery and had embolus to the right middle cerebral artery.
On transfer to the floor, physical examination was as follows:  The patient was a pleasant, interactive, well-developed, well-nourished woman in no acute distress.
Neck was supple without mass or bruit.
She had a bruit on the right side, earlier during her hospital course, but this was no longer excitable.
Cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
She had a small palpable, but nonpulsatile hematoma in the right groin at the placement of the catheter site.
She was oriented to the months of the year and reversed slowly with several pauses and omissions.
There is a left facial droop and decreased sensation on the left face for light tension and temperature.
Joint position sense is intact.
Coordination tests for rapid-alternating movements and finger-to-nose finger are limited by weakness on the left, but, otherwise, without dysmetria.
HISTORY PRIOR TO TRANSFER:  The patient has history of fibromuscular dysplasia, which begins at the age of 19, when she presented with right hemiparesis and aphasia, which resolved completely after approximately one year.
She later admits having used cocaine at the time, but she was also found to have a cavernous angioma in the left internal capsule.
Last [**Month (only) 1096**], she developed a right sided headache after several hospitalizations at an outside hospital.
The MRA demonstrated a right internal carotid dissection and on DWI there was a small area of acute ischemia in the right frontal lobe deep white matter.
She was also noticed to have irregularity of the right middle cerebral artery suggestive of FMD.
Over a few months she had complete resolution of her symptoms.
The MRI on [**2-26**] showed resolution of the right frontal lobe hyperintensity, although there was no recannulization of the vessel.
On MRI on [**2197-8-28**], there was focal dilatation of the distal right cervical ICA suggestive of a pseudoaneurysm near the prior dissection.
She then developed acutely slurred speech and left facial droop.
She was anosognosic and neglecting the left side.
She had persistent headache, which was posterior occipital and radiating to behind the right eye.
For breakthrough pain, despite OxyContin and Topamax, she was also started on Vicodin p.r.n., which controlled her pain fairly well.
It was noted that the angiography site in her right groin was continuing to enlarge and this was seen by interventional radiology, who felt that this was consistent with a pseudoaneurysm and took her to procedure for embolization of the aneurysm, which was uncomplicated.
The left facial droop and left hand weakness improved and left deltoid biceps and triceps were all strong.
She did have some pain relief with this.
On [**2197-10-30**], repeat head CT was done, which showed no hemorrhage or new intracranial problems.
Acute right middle cerebral artery stroke status post angiography.
Fibromuscular dysplasia.
