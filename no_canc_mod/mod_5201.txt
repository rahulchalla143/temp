She also reports right shoulder pain that occurs at times on exertion and at times at rest.
She had one episode of nausea and nonbloody vomiting this morning, [**2136-6-12**].
She denies any diaphoresis, substernal chest pain.
She saw her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2136-6-11**] for the R shoulder pain, was thought to have MSK pain and prescribed ibuprofen.
Earlier today, with persistent R shoulder pain and dyspnea on exertion, she represented to her PCP's office, was seen by a different doctor, and was advised to come to the ED.
Her most recent colonoscopy was in [**2133**], revealing grade 1 internal hemorrhoids but no other pathology.
CE neg x 1; ECG showed lateral ST depressions that were unchanged from prior.

Mild cardiomegaly.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Mild volume overload.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Echogenic focus in the periphery of the right common femoral vein spanning 1.7 cm demonstrating normal surrounding flow represents nonocclusive DVT.
IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive residual thrombus in the right common femoral vein .
4 mm right pulmonary nodule should be followed in one year to document stability if there are risk factors such as smoking or primary malignancy, otherwise no followup is necessary.
There is a small locule of gas in the nondependent portion of the bladder and would recommend correlation with prior instrumentation.
Multiple non-pathologically enlarged lymph nodes seen in the periaortic, pericaval and periportal regions.
Two calcified nodes seen in the mesentery which may be related to prior granulomatous disease or treated lymphoma if clinical history is supportive.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar dependent atlectatic changes.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Calcified degenerated fibroid in the uterus.
Bilateral pars defects at L4.
Minimal erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis, Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
Diverticulosis of the rectum, Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: 60-year-old woman with DM2, HTN, HL p/w dyspnea on exertion, right shoulder pain, and Hct 13, now know to be due to severe Fe defficiency anemia, etiology under investigation, whose course was c/b PEA arrest of unclear etiology, and patient found to have a DVT, with CTA negative for PE.
Patient had undergone CT of abdomen/pelvis in search of a possible malignancy leading to the anemia, which was negative for gross abnormality to account for the anemia.
# Anemia: Admission Hct 13 and MCV 53, Fe/Tf were very low, with high TIBC and impaired retic count, all consistent with Fe deficiency aneamia.
There was no evidence of hemolysis.
DDx included GIB and/or thalassemia.
Peripheral smear with reactive PMNs and multiple morphologies or RBCs (see pertinent results).
Given anemia and DVT (see below), she underwent a CT abdomen/pelvis in search of cancer source.
Patient finally underwent an EGD which showed minimal erythema in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis, otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.
Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of the rectum, otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
# DOE/CHF/Pulmonary hypertension: Was felt to be from severe anemia, in combination of pulmonary hypertension.
She had a stable O2 sat and on ECHO was noted to have EF 65%, LVH, and 2+MR and 2+TR as well as pulmonary hypertension (50-60mmHg).
There was some evidence of vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema on CXR.
Has DM, HTN, HL, no hx of MI, but has sx of HF even prior to this presentation, ROMI completed.
Has small pleural effusions, which were felt to be contributing to DOE.
Following this, patient developed PEA arrest (see below).
She was transferred back to MICU, where she was treated for flash pulmonary edema intubated x 12hrs.
She was found to be in mild CHF and diuresed with a total of 80mg IV lasix.
With this treatment, her DOE improved significantly, RR decreased from 30s on admission to 18 and she remained free of oxygen requirement after transfer from the MICU.
# DVT.
Her only identifiable risk factor is hospitalization with decreased mobility.
There was no PE on the CTA.
# PEA arrest.
There were no metabolic derangements.
The most plausible theory was that patient may have developed flash pulmonary edema in setting of 5 U PRBCs, with subsequent hypoxemia leading to above cardiac findings.
It is also possible that leucocytosis was a reactive process due to severe anemia.
No overt evidence of other infection was noted.
# Hematuria.
Likely due to anticoagulation and traumatic foley as patients UA was negative for RBCs on admission.
# DM2: Patient had fasting hypoglycemia in AM, thus her Lantus was decreased to 50U QHS.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Outpatient Lab Work CBC, PTT/PT/INR, please obtain [**2136-6-24**] and forward results to: Name: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Location: [**Street Address(1) **] Address: [**Hospital1 **], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 12201**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7976**] Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12895**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Uphams Corner Home Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Iron deficiency anemia, source unclear; s/p PEA arrest Secondary: HTN, HL, DM   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with Anemia, shortness of breath and fatigue.
This was found to be an iron defficiency anemia.
In addition, you were found to have a vein clot (DVT, deep venous thrombosis), but no lung clots.
It is unclear what is causing your anemia at this time.
This found that your heart had a normal pumping function, but you also had pulmonary hypertension.
The following changes were made to your medications: - Aspirin was discontinued - Dextromethorphan was discontinued - Ibuprofen was discontinued - Metoprolol was increased - Iron tablets started two times daily - Senna and colace started for constipation - Lovenox injections for your blood clot.
Should you develop worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, fevers, chills or any other symptom concerning to you, please call your primary care doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.
