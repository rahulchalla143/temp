The third axial series and the coronal reformats are of diagnostic quality.
The right mastoid is nearly completely included with a small portion of the lateral temporal bone not included.
Compared to the non-contrast head CT, [**2163-3-21**], there has been interval increase in fluid within the bilateral middle ear cavities as well as worsening of opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells.
There is no focal fluid collection or abscess identified and no evidence of bone destruction.
No paranasal sinus disease.
Compared to [**2163-3-21**], interval worsening in amount of fluid within the bilateral middle ear cavities as well as worsening of bilateral mastoid air cell opacification without evidence of focal fluid collection, abscess, or bone destruction.
Findings could represent sterile effusions related to intubation, although otomastoiditis is possible.
Multiple air space opacities through both lungs are unchanged, consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: No interval change in multifocal pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions and congestive heart failure, but without frank edema .
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2163-3-24**] 5:24 PM FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and pulsed wave Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed on the right subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.
Echogenic noncompressible thrombus is seen within a portion of the cephalic vein, but only in the antecubital fossa.
No other intraluminal thrombus is identified.
Note is made of diffuse edema throughout the right arm.
IMPRESSION: Superficial thrombosis of the right cephalic vein in the antecubital fossa.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right upper extremity.
There is regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild focal hypokinesis of the apex and the mid to apical septum, anterior, and lateral walls.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are difficult to assess due to suboptimal technical quality, but are probably normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease or other focal myopathic process.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
KNEE (2 VIEWS) RIGHT PORT  [**2163-3-21**] 2:28 PM FINDINGS: Two views show no evidence of joint effusion.
The bony structures are quite well maintained without evidence of narrowing or spurring.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2163-3-21**] 7:09 PM FINDINGS: No evidence of acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus or evidence of major territorial infarction.
There is again noted moderate diffuse global cerebral atrophy.
There is moderate-to-severe periventricular white matter hypoattenuation consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
There is new opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
There has been a right orbital lens replacement.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
New opacification of the mastoid air cells which may be compatible with acute mastoiditis.
Moderate-to-severe chronic periventricular white matter ischemia/infarction, unchanged.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2163-3-21**] 7:10 PM CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Bibasilar opacities are present with associated small pleural effusions.
Nodular opacities are also noted within the parenchyma of the right and left lower lobes.
Bilateral calcific pleural plaque is present suggesting previous asbestos exposure.
No pericardial effusion or cardiomegaly is present.
Evaluation of the upper abdomen is limited given streak artifact from arms within the field of view.
There is a round hypoattenuated lesion within segment IV of the liver measuring 1.3 cm in greatest axial dimension, consistent with a simple cyst.
An adjacent hypoattenuating lesion is too small to adequately characterize.
The gallbladder is distended without definite intraluminal stone.
A trace amount of ascitic fluid is present surrounding the liver.
Limited views of the pancreas suggest mild pancreatic ductal prominece and a probable 8 mm hypoattenuating lesion within the body (2:27).
No gross abnormalities are detected within the adrenal glands, which are not well evaluated given artifact.
There is a heterogenous appearence to the left kidney which may be secondary to considerable streak artifact in this region.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a mild amount of ascites within the pelvis.
There is no small-bowel obstruction.
There is calcific atherosclerotic plaque within the descending abdominal aorta with a very mild aneurysmal dilatation in an infrarenal location measuring 2.6 cm in greatest axial dimension.
There is a large intramuscular hematoma in the anterior compartment of the right thigh.
No arterial blush is identified to suggest active extravasation of contrast material.
There is a right femoral intramedullary rod with dynamic screw in the right femoral neck and head.
Coarse calcifications are detected in the region of the scrotum bilaterally.
Large intramuscular hematoma in the anterior compartment of the right thigh.
Bibasilar consolidation with small pleural effusions.
Bilateral knee effusions.
Calcific atherosclerotic plaque within the descending abdominal aorta and iliac branches with very mild infrarenal aneurysmal dilatation.
Suggestion of mild pancreatic ductal prominence and a rounded cystic lesion within the body.
Subcutaneous edema in bilateral lower extremities.
Diffuse osteopenia is noted.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 y/o male recent discharged after MICU stay for influenza pneumonitis, representing with respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status & hct drop, concern for onogoing superimposed bacterial pneumonia.
MICU course:  EGD performed and upper GI tract clear without evidence of bleed.
As it turns out, patient has large hematoma in right thigh.
Patient also had head CT on arrival secondary to mental status change.
Was found to have acute bilateral mastoiditis for which he was started on ceftriaxone.
Respiratory work-up was unrevealing though there was evidence of a a possible right lower lobe infiltrate, however, his primary pathology seemed to involve peripheral paranchyma suggestive of a possible interstitial lung disease.
He does have a history of work in a shipyard and the CT was noted to be consist with asbestosis in the past.
Hemolysis labs WNL.
Hct finally went to 30, no e/o hemodynamic instability.
Guaiac negative from golytely BM, reported coffee grounds in NG lavage performed in ED, bile currently present when OG suctioned, EGD on [**3-21**] showed clean upper GI tract without evidence of bleeding.
Seen by rheum no blood on tap, no crystals.
Scan showed large hematoma with no evidence of active extravation of contrast.
# Respiratory failure/#likely aspiration pneumonia: etiology unclear, possibly aspiration versus inability to clear secretions causing respiration pneumonitis vs. acute flare up of what appears to be underlying interstital lung disease.
Respiratory viral screen positive for HSV 1, but felt to be an oral contaminant.
CXR and prior CT seem consistent with underlying interstitial ling disease, making reserve lower.
continued to have delerium, inability to eat safely, ultimately, after many disucssions with family, pt.
#Altered mental status/#dementia: Delerium in the setting of acute illness, ICU stay and intubation with associated sedating meds.
He subsequently was quite lethargic with minimal interaction.
# anasarca -- in the setting of fluid resucitation and acute illness.
Right upper ext felt to be larger than left, so U/S doppler done with no evidence of DVT (only superficial clot).
Family was informed this does not decrease his risk for aspiration.
After much discussion, decision made to make patient DNR/DNI, not pursue replacement of dobhoff or PEG, but consider IV nutrition.
Plan is to assess for any improvement in overall mental status and respiratory status and then re-assess goals of care.
He fluctuated from this point forward, with two episodes of mucous plugging with desaturations to the 60s, requiring invasive nasotracheal suctioning to clear the secretions.
He slowly became more alert and interacitive, but was unable to comply with PT or speech evaluations.
Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 1-10 mg PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for pain, increased secretions.
