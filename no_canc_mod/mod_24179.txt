Moderate dilation of the common bile duct with mild central intrahepatic biliary dilation with an apparent filling defect in the distal CBD at the level of the ampulla, likely a stone.
Just proximal to this filling defect, the distal CBD appears to narrow, and there is mild biliary wall enhancement, likely due to inflammation.
Hypodense lesions within the right kidney are incompletely evaluated.
Diverticulosis, with no evidence of diverticulitis.
EKG: NSR 90, NA/NI, poor r wave progression, no ST changes or TWI   Brief Hospital Course: She was admitted to the surgery service.
She underwent CT abdomen and pelvis that showed dilated CBD with possible stone lodged at ampulla.
The [**Year (4 digits) **] showed multiple stones and sludge at the biliary tree extracted successfully (sphincterotomy, stone extraction, stent placement).
She has continued to progress and is tolerating a regular diet, pain controlled and ambulating independently.
