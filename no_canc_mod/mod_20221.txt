No evidence of fracture.
AP and lateral views of the lumbar spine demonstrate an unremarkable appearance of the lumbar spine, with preservation of vertebral body and intraventricular heights.
An S-shaped metallic object on the AP view may represent a naval ring, and multiple staples are seen projecting anterior to the L3 vertebral body, but are not clearly localized on the AP view.
To rule out traumatic injury.
Multiple sagittal T1 weighted images, T2 weighted images and multiple axial gradient echo images of the cervical spine are performed without administration of contrast.
FINDINGS:  There is straightening of cervical curvature noted.
Increased signal is noted in the C7 and C3 vertebral bodies, consistent with known fractures.
There is prevertebral soft tissue swelling noted from the level of C1 to C4.
There is increased signal noted in the posterior soft tissues along the posterior elements from the level of C2 to C6, consistent with ligamentous injury.
No evidence of cord compression noted.
2) No evidence of cord compression noted.
