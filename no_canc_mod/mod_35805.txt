Admission Date:  [**2165-12-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2165-12-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-3-15**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right lower extremity pain, presumed secondary peripheral vascular disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old male with a history significant for coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2154**], abdominal aortic aneurysm status post endovascular stent graft in [**2165-2-2**] now being evaluated for total occlusion of right iliac limb graft.
On [**9-7**] the patient developed increased right lower extremity pain with exertion (walking about the length of a football field), which started in his right buttock with radiation to his right foot.
This pain was relieved with rest.
On the day prior to admission the patient presented for CT angiogram, which revealed total occlusion of his right limb of his graft with collateral flow from contralateral iliac artery branches.
The patient underwent angiography on the day of admission showing a patent aortic graft with normal left iliac graft limb.
However, right limb was flesh occluded with no filling of entire limb extending proximally to the Voda wire.
The patient subsequently had a guidewire passed through occluded right limb graft and then underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator.
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further evaluation with a planned relook catheterization on the following day.
Denies fevers or chills, nausea or vomiting.
No abdominal pain.
No melena or bright red blood per rectum.
No shortness of breath.
Coronary artery disease status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2154**].
Ejection fraction 28% presumed ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post endovascular stent graft [**2165-2-2**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile at 97.1.
General, he is a well developed, well nourished man comfortably lying flat on back without shortness of breath.
HEENT no JVD appreciated.
Initial angiography showed occluded right limb graft and the patient underwent passage of guidewire through thrombosis and intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator beginning in the catheterization laboratory.
Subsequent relook angiography on [**12-20**] showed successful thrombolysis of the previously occluded right limb aortic stent graft with persistent and widely patent aortic stent graft.
However, there was narrowed distal thrombus present in the proximal right posterior tibial artery at the level of the foot and dorsalis pedis.
On [**12-24**] he returned to the catheterization laboratory where angiography showed thromboembolic occlusion of his right posterior tibial artery.
The patient subsequently underwent successful PTA and thrombectomy of his right posterior tibial artery.
He has a history of coronary artery disease, but did not have any chest pain.
As mentioned above he will be on life long Plavix for his peripheral vascular disease.
He did have an episode post second angiography where he was bradycardia and hypotensive into the 70s.
The event being to possible vasovagal episode.
He was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells earlier during his hospital course for a decrease in hematocrit in the setting or recent tissue plasminogen activator.
His hematocrit responded appropriately to that and his hematocrit remained stable during the rest of his hospital course, although showed a slight decrease near the end.
He did have small bilateral hematomas at the site of his groin sticks that remained stable during his hospital course.
He did undergo bilateral groin ultrasounds, which were negative for pseudoaneurysms or fistulas.
During his hospital course he developed increased diffuse bilateral joint pain and swelling, which was initially attributed to his gout.
This has been a problem that has plagued him for quite some time and he was advised to follow up with Rheumatology for further evaluation of his pain as the team was not completely convinced that this is true gout pain.
Peripheral vascular disease status post occluded right limb graft, status post successful localized tissue plasminogen activator thrombolysis complicated by right posterior tibial thrombus, status post successful thrombectomy and PTA.
Congestive heart failure, stable.
