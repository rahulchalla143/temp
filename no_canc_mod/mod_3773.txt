Admission Date:  [**2142-6-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-6-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: 85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who presents from [**Hospital1 **] with lethargy and AMS.
Recent history is remarkable for being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2142-6-4**] after presenting with abdominal pain, being found to have SBO and undergoing lysis of adhesions and left inguinal hernia repair, with a course complicated by pneumonia for which she received vanc/zosyn and eventually required trach/PEG for difficulty weaning off ventilator (was unsuccessfully extubated during hospital stay).
Given her transient hypotension and concern for sepsis, she was admitted to the MICU for further management.
She denied chest pain, headache, shortness of breath, and pain in general.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Past Medical History: Cerebellar infarcts Pancreatic cyst Diabetes Mitral valve disease s/p MVR with mechanical valve Severe tricuspid regurgitation (3+) Aortic regurgitation (1+) History of rheumatic fever Chronic atrial fibrillation Congestive heart failure Iron deficiency anemia Hypertension Seizure disorder CCY Left inguinal hernia   Social History: No alcohol.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Severe multi-chamber cardiomegaly.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Bibasilar extensive consolidations accompanied by volume loss that might be considered for a combination of atelectasis and pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Upper lung opacities that might represent infection versus pulmonary dema.
Extreme kyphosis due to the presence of multiple thoracic fractures is described in detail within the text.
ECHO [**2142-6-14**] The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The prosthetic mitral valve disks appears slightly thickened, but open normally.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Given estimated RA pressures, pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is estimated as severe.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with higher-than-normal gradients.
Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Probably severe pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who presents with AMS and question sepsis.
# Pneumonia/respiratory failure:  She was admitted with altered mental status and met SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, with infiltrates later seen on chest CT.  She was treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime.
Cultures eventually grew stenotrophomonas sensitive to bactrim but this was thought to repesent colonization rather than infection.
She continued to require intermittent respiratory support with mechanical ventilation, particularly overnight when there was concern for tiring.
She was also diuresed intermittently because her chest x-ray demonstrated some pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
# Altered mental status: She was lethargic and minimally arousable at presentation but had an arterial blood glass that demonstrated a normal pH.
Her altered mental status was thought to be secondary to infection and improved with treatment of pneumonia.
# Atrial fibrillation:  She was previously on metoprolol but was started on digoxin during [**Month (only) 547**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
# Mitral valve replacement: Mechanical valve per report and history of rheumatic heart disease.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Ventilator associated pneumonia Respiratory failure Right ventricular failure Atrial fibrillation  Secondary: Mitral valve replacement   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of a change in your mental status.
We diagnosed you with pneumonia and treated you with antibiotics.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain, shortness of breath or anything else of concern.
