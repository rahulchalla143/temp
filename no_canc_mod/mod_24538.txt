#Pneumonia-He was admitted with fever and cough and was found to have a right lower lobe pneumonia.
He was satting well, and started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin as he is chronically hospitalized.
His blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum cultures had no growth.
# Hypotension-He has baseline low bp secondary to severely impaired cardiac function.
BP appeared below baseline in the MICU possibly secondary to sepsis physiology (with some signs of underperfusion including waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status).
Source of infection pulmonary, though SBP could not be excluded.
# Hyponatremia-He is hyponatremic at baseline, likely secondary to liver disease from heart failure.
His hyponatremia was stable and was not treated with fluids management as he is fluid overloaded but hypotensive and was not symptomatic.
# End-stage CHF complicated by cardiac [**Hospital 68806**] hospital day 3 he became uncomfortable with the amount of fluid in his abdomen.
# Renal insufficiency.
Please note that his change in code status back to full code appears to have been  influenced by his acute presentation, though he did not require pressors or any intubation this admission.
He did seem to understand that intubation and resuscitation with his underlying conditions likely would not result in improved quality of life and successful recovery to his prior status; i.e.
