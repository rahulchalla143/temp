Patient unable to give her own history secondary to dementia.
Her husband reports she had some mild dysuria the day before and had given her a dose of cipro (which she needs periodically per him).
Day of admission awoke and suddenly became very short of breath.
No recent change in diet, no change in orthopnea, had not been lying more flat.
No fevers of chills.
In the ED, she presented with O2 sat 98% on 2L, but became hypoxic to 88% on 2L, with elevated blood pressure, and trop of 0.06 without EKG changes.
Her blood pressure and hypoxia improved with SL nitro and a 100% NRB.
CXR showed left pleural effusion.
CT chest without contrast showed no mass or underlying PNA.

CXR: There is severe underlying emphysema.
There has been interval development of a large left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is evident.
Scattered calcified nodules are again identified and relatively stable, consistent with prior granulomatous insult.
Aortic arch contour abnormality suspicious for a saccular aneurysm.
Given the patient's chronic renal insufficiency, which precludes the use of iodinated intravenous contrast with CT imaging, further evaluation is recommended by thoracic aortic MRA.
Small right and moderate left pleural effusions.
Mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
Mildly enlarged main pulmonary artery, consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
7 mm anterior listhesis at L3/4 with associated narrowing of the central canal and the neural foramina bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 80 y/o female with COPD and left pleural effusion presents with dyspnea and hypoxia, likely due to worsening left pleural effusion of unknown etiology.
# Dyspnea/Hypoxia: She likely has contributions from non ventilated alveoli (atelectasis from pleural effusion), decreased oxygen diffusion(COPD).
She was able to be weaned quite quickly back to room air without significant intervention in MICU, making mucus plugging or mild pulm edema from hypertensive urgency more likely.
Effusion was believed to be transudative based on previous tap albumin, T prot, and no malignant cells (although no concurrent bloodwork was done to get true light's criteria).
Differential includes nephrotic syndrome, protein losing enteropathy, heart failure (cardiomyopathy and MR), renal failure, pulmonary embolism (although INR supratherapeutic); exudative causes include malignancy, lupus, pneumonia.
Since patient was no longer symptomatic by time of transfer to the floor and INR still above 2, decision made to do thoracentesis next week as outpatient.
# CRI/ARF: Creatinine elevated again on admission.
Renal consulted and concern that patient is rapidly approaching end stage renal disease requiring HD.
Per renal recs, ACE-I stopped and patient started on isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine for afterload reduction.
Cont calcium acetate.
Small bump in troponin believed secondary to renal insufficiency in face of some cardiac strain (no EKG changes).
# HTN: Blood pressure elevated on admission but improved with additional agents.
# Anemia: dropped 6 points [**Date range (1) **], but up to 26.2 on recheck.
Patient has evidence of anemia of chronic disease.
# Cardiomyopathy: EF 50-55% combination of valvular disease from 2+MR/?ischemic disease, no known h/o CAD, though significant vasculopath.
# PVD: h/o aortofemoral bypass, on warfarin.
Also thoracic aortic aneurysm seen, may be slightly larger in size.
- hold warfarin for thoracentesis .
# H/O GI bleed/partial gastrectomy.
# N/V: possibly due to renal failure, dehydration, IMI, or UTI.
# FEN: Passed speech and swallow eval on [**1-24**].
