Slightly increased retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
There is linear atelectasis in the left mid lung.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No upper abdominal or osseous abnormality is identified.
IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-1-26**] 9:36 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-20**]: Left upper lobe has collapsed again rendering the entire left lung airless.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism, substantial evidence of pulmonary hypertension and reflux of the contrast material into IVC with dilatation of IVC and hepatic veins, consistent with known tricuspid regurgitation.
Multifocal consolidations involving both lungs, mostly pronounced in the right upper and left lower lobe, and might be consistent with multifocal infection/aspiration.
Narrowing of the airways, most likely due to tracheobronchomalacia.
Some amount of secretions is present in both lower lobes bronchi.
No gross aspiration or penetration was seen.
IMPRESSION: No gross aspiration.
TTE: IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-10-30**], the findings are new, and suggestive of a primary pulmonary process.
Micro: Blood cx- neg Urine cx- neg     Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: 71 yo F with h/o developmental delay, h/o aspiration pneumonia, and other medical issues presents with senior care center because of cough and O2 Sat 88%.
ACTIVE ISSUES: #  Aspiration Pneumonia:  Based on limited history, most likely an aspiration event, with differential including aspiration pneumonitis vs. pneumonia.
She was afebrile without leukoctyosis on admission.
CXR demonstrated left lower lobe pna.
Noted to have significant secretions and requiring 3-4L NC.
On HD2 she spiked a fever and flagyl was added for better anaerobic coverage.
A repeat chest xray demonstrated worsening of left lower lobe infiltrate and new RLL opacity.
Concern for persistent aspiration events despite NPO status, mucus plugging versus/and volume overload in setting of volume rescussitation the day prior.
An ABG demonstrated hypoxic respiratory failure (7.36/66/52) on 5L NC.
In the MICU, the patient was found to have multilobar pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions.
She underwent a speech and swallow evaluation which showed her to have a increased risk of aspiration during eating.
# Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia.
She was given IV metoprolol 5mg x 2 on HD2 with improvement after triggering for tachycardia.
She was volume rescussitated with 500cc bolus NS and given 1L NS as maintenance on HD with concern for hypovolemia.
Her HR was intermittently elevated during her stay in the MICU, likely due to over-diuresis and in the setting of infection.
# Left Upper Lobe Lung Collapse- On a portable cxr it was noted that her LUL had collapsed most likely due to prior secretion aspiration event.
11. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for constipation.
17. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for Itching.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Aspiration Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis: Developmental Delay Diabetes Type II Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to the hospital with pneumonia caused by your secretions from your mouth going into your airway.
