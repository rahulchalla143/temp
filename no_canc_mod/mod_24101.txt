There was no urinary incontinence.
Then, he became increasingly combative and agitated, and therefore, he was intubated.
Head CT was done which reportedly did not show an acute intracranial process, but this was not available at time of presentation to review.
Blood cultures were obtained, and he was empirically started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for meningitis coverage.
He received magnesium 2 g IV or mildly prolonged QT interval.
On neuro [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] his wife, he does not have history of headaches.
Within the past year, he had minor head trauma without loss of consciousness described as falling and hitting his head on a brick wall.
He has not had recent vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Past Medical History: His wife describes an episode of waking up with confusion/short-term memory loss which occurred 6-8 months ago.
His wife denies history of hypertension, diabetes, or high cholesterol.
He has never had a seizure before.
No history of febrile seizures or learning disabilities.
He has no prior hospitalizations or surgeries.
Family History: His wife is not aware of any family history of seizure or stroke.
Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION Vitals: T: 97.4   P: 69 R: 16  BP: 121/85 SaO2: 100% FiO2 98 % PEEP 5 General: intubated HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: + petecchial rash on shoulders, arms, chest  Neurologic: -Mental Status: intubated.
When examined off propofol, he is not responsive to voice or noxious stimuli.
No horizonatal or vertical oculocephalics present.
No corneals bilaterally.
No gag reflex.
Does not withdraw to noxious stimuli.
No acute infarction.
Allowing for the pulsation artifacts, no areas of altered signal intensity on the FLAIR sequence.
A followup study, along with MRV can be considered for better assessment if there is continued concern.
In the coronal sequences, the hippocampi are grossly symmetric in size; slightly increased T2 signal in the left hippocampus, which is equivocal significance.
Paranasal sinus disease as described above.
CTA No acute abnormality is seen.
CK on discharge: [**Numeric Identifier 88658**]   Brief Hospital Course: Seizure  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 8320**] was admitted after he had a witnessed GTC seizure at home.
He required multiple agents post-ictally as he was combative and ended up being intubated.
There was initial concern for an infarct given absent cranial nerves on exam, however it was later thought that this could be secondary to paralytics.
His MRI showed FLAIR abnormalities in the right temporal lobe consitent with a recent seizure.
His EEG was pending on discharge but showed no evidence of seizure activity.
Rhabdomyolisis  His CK was climbing on HD 3 to a max of [**Numeric Identifier 88659**].
Outpatient Lab Work BUN/Creatinine CK   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizure Acute Kidney Injury Rhabdomyolisis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the neurology service after you had a seizure while waking up that was described as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
Following the seizure you were confused and combative and were intubated.
A CTA was done that showed no evidence of a stroke and an MRI showed no evidence of stroke or mass.
You will need to stay on Keppra and will need an MRI with contrast of your head which was not done given the acute kidney injury.
An EEG was done which showed no evidence of seizure activity.
