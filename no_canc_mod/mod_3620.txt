She was unable to stand up from the toliet due to new proximal muscle weakness and ended up sitting there before rolling off to try to crawl to reach the telephone which rang intermittantly.
She specifically denies any chest pain, palpitations, loss of consciousness, or staying flat on one part of her body or the other.
At baseline, she is able to climb a flight of stairs before getting leg weakness, but no dyspnea/ chest pain.

Moderate multilevel degenerative changes, most pronounced at C3-C4, C5-C6, and C6-C7, as detailed above.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is significant spinal canal stenosis at C3-C4, which may predispose the patient to spinal cord injury, with appropriate mechanism of injury.

RUE ULTRASOUND IMPRESSION:  No evidence of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
It still projects slightly more laterally than is typically seen, but this could be due to vascular engorgement.

Brief Hospital Course: 84F with no known coronary disease but a history of DM/ HTN/ HL, diastolic heart failure and known mod AS, mild AI and breast CA who p/w fall at home earlier on the morning of [**8-31**], on the floor for 8 hours, developed rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, found to have group B strep bacteremia of unknown source.
# FEVER, SEPSIS, BACTEREMIA:  On morning of admission, pt developed fever of 102.9, hypotension with SBP into the 70s, despite IVF hydration, tachycardia.
- Blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in pairs & chains, speciated to group B strep (pansensitive).
- CT abdomen and pelvis - no evidence of infection - RUE US, no evidence of DVT to explain swelling--most likely from lymphedema from breast cancer s/p excisions and radiation treatment - Urosepsis also a possibility, as GBS 10,000-100,000 organisms/mL did grow out of urine.
- Blood cultures x2 were positive for gram posiive cocci in pairs & chains, final speciation of Group B strep - Urine cultures grew pansensitive Proteus mirabilis >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML and GBS 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML - Antibiotics narrowed to ceftriaxone alone on [**2145-9-3**] - TTE shows severe aortic stenosis, high risk of endocarditis in setting of GBS bacteremia, so we opted not to do TEE.
Will treat empirically for endocarditis with 4 weeks of IV antibiotics.
# RHABDOMYOLYSIS - likely secondary to prolonged immobilization, On UA 1 RBC and Moderate blood, CK > 20x upper limit.
Does endorse some proximal muscle weakness / inability to rise from toilet, but more likely generalized weakness in the setting of sepsis.
- [**Month (only) 116**] consider workup for inflammatory myositis if proximal muscle weakness persists after resolution of infection - Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is unlikely given acute onset, but held atorvastatin during hospitalization; restarted on discharge - IVF, monitor for pulmonary edema / dyspnea given history of diastolic heart failure - Creatinine improved markedly with volume resuscitation and source control from peak of 1.5 to 1.1 upon transfer back to floor from ICU, on discharge was 1.3, which is near baseline.
# ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES:  Elevated troponin and CK in setting of proximal muscle weakness and 8 hours of immobilization on the floor after fall.
Was started on a heparin drip overnight on night of admission for possible ACS, but was discontinued prior to transfer to the unit as demand myonecrosis was the most likely explanation for elevated cardiac enzymes, and suspicion for ACS was low.
Pt complained of no chest pain or shortness of breath.
- Most likely had demand ischemia [**1-21**] to AS and LVH.
No evidence of focal wall motion abnl, concerning ECG changes for ischemia.
- Cardiac echo showed LVEF 55% and severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2) with moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP 43mmHg) - CK significantly elevated & initially trended up 4062->5032, MB stable 21->22, troponin 0.2->0.45, all of which resolved with control of her infection and volume resuscitation  # AS w/ diastolic CHF: h/o CHF with preserved systolic function (LVEF > 55%), severe AS, mild AR.
c/o dyspnea but appears euvolemic, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Due to CXRay c/w CHF after volume resuscitation, patient was IV diuresed x1, with good output.
Will need for her to recover and see if she is symptomatic from her AS.
- Monitored resp status closely given IVF hydration for rhabdomyolysis as above, pt appeared clinically euvolemic and was satting well on RA, but CXR showed worsening fluid status, so diuresed with 20mg IV lasix ONCE then transitioned back to home lasix.
# Weakness: Has diffuse joint pain and muscle aches.
No focal signs.
No spinal tenderness.
No clinical evidence of focal abscess at this time.
# RUE swelling:  is s/p mastectomy & LN excision.
Mildly hypervolemic due to IVF in ICU for sepsis.
No erythema or fevers to suggest infection.
No focal tenderness - RUE ultrasound confirmed no clot  # Transaminitis:  Mild transaminitis, trending down.
Most likely NASH given CT findings of diffuse liver steatosis  # SVT: Episodes of aflutter/SVT, which patient notes treating at home with carotid massage.
- Continue metoprolol.
# UTI: Proteus - Treat for week long course given diabetes, on ceftriaxone for GBS bacteremia as above.
- Avoid nephrotoxins - Renally dose medications  # Hypertension:  Originally hypotensive, so held all home meds.
Day before discharge, was hypertensive (BP 135-180), restarted all home meds previously held for hypotension.
- [**Month (only) 116**] consider adding calcium channel blocker as outpatient if hypertension persists.
# Subgaleal hematoma s/p fall - No change in mental status  HEALTHCARE MAINTENANCE # DM: A1C of 6.1 on [**4-1**] - Held home glipazide, restarted on discharge - HISS # Spinal stenosis: Had started pregabalin recently.
F/u as outpatient  #CODE: Full confirmed  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Follow up for aortic stenosis with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] # Continue abx for 4 weeks duration.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You suffered a fall and developed a condition called rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle) from being on the floor for a prolonged period of time, for which we treated you with IV fluids.
You were found to have an infection in your bloodstream, for which you will complete several weeks of IV antibiotics.
