CXR: Limited study with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of perfusion abnormality.
Small infarct in the left internal capsule, new since prior CT of [**2101-3-9**], and of uncertain chronicity.
If there remains concern for ischemia, MRI with DWI is more sensitive for acute infarct.
Mild atherosclerotic disease within the proximal left ICA, with 25% stenosis at this level.
No evidence of perfusion abnormality.
Small infarct in the left internal capsule, new since prior CT of [**2101-3-9**], and of uncertain chronicity.
If there remains concern for ischemia, MRI with DWI is more sensitive for acute infarct.
Mild atherosclerotic disease within the proximal left ICA, with 25% stenosis at this level.
MRI L-spine [**5-16**]: No evidence of epidural abscess or canal compromise.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
Midline soft tissue edema at L1 through L4, unchanged from [**2101-6-4**], and may relate to soft tissue edema from patient immobility.

Pt was initially admitted to MICU but responded to fluids rapidly and had no further hypotension; was called out to the floor the following am.
History c/w radiculopathy possibly d/t disc bulge or nerve irritation.
No saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder incontinence to suggest cauda equina or cord compression.
She received a CT/CTA which showed a likely old internal capsule lesion but no areas of acute stroke.
The day after admission, her new symptoms had resolved, but she continued to complain of left leg pain and right knee numbness (all old symptoms).
#Hypotension: The patient had transient hypotension on admission, likely dehydration from chronic diarrhea and diuretics as outpt.
She was monitored overnight on the floor and her HCT recovered without intervention.
# Elevated CK: The patient has had elevated in the past, but was elevated to 1300 during admission.
It is unclear if she truely had a statin induced myopathy or if her CK was elevated due to ARF.
