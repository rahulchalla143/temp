He said, to EMS (from whom we got direct sign-out), that his mother sounded slightly tired, but this is her baseline and otherwise was normal.
He then came to see her after running errands about 1 hr later and found her lying in emesis and stool.
EMS called and found to develop a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
In the ED CT head/Neck showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
She does have subtle areas of hypodensities in left basal ganglia, pons, and midbrain maybe artifactual or represent ischemia.
UA showed no bacteria or leuks, but did have large blood, 300 glucose, 300 protein  Of note, pt noted to have trop of 1.03, with flat MB.

FINDINGS:  CT HEAD: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, vascular territorial infarction, edema, or mass effect seen.
Smaller hypodensities are seen in bilateral periventricular white matter concerning for small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.
Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in bilateral intracranial vertebral arteries and cavernous carotid arteries.
No fracture is seen.
CTA HEAD: Bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries, vertebral artery, small basilar artery and their major branches are patent with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysm formation.
CTA NECK: There is a bovine arch configuration with a common origin of the innominate and left common carotid artery from the aortic arch.
Bilateral common carotid arteries, internal carotid artery and vertebral arteries in the neck appear patent with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection or pseudoaneurysm formation.
The left vertebral artery appears congenitally hypoplastic.
Visualized soft tissue structures in the neck appear unremarkable.
While there is no evidence of hemorrhage or acute vascular territorial infarction, there is subtle hypoattenuation in the basal ganglia, thalami, pons and midbrain, suspicious for edema.
Evidence of small vessel ischemic disease.
Unremarkable CTA of the head and neck, with no evidence of steno-occlusive disease.
No finding to suggest cerebral venous thrombosis.
CT C-Spine FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative joint changes are most pronounced at C6-C7 with intervertebral disc space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis and disc osteophyte complex formations.
No critical central canal stenosis is noted.
No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Degenerative changes are most pronounced at C6-C7 level.
Dilated and patulous esophagus with moderate amount of secretions, may predispose patient to aspiration.
Initially presented with thrombocytopenia, renal failure, seizures, fevers, and hemolytic anemia consistent with TTP.
Intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory distress/ failure to maintain air way.
Family meeting was held which discussed poor prognosis and poor recovery given multiple organ distress and cerebral pathology.
