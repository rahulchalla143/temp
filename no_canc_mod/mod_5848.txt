At OSH, pt underwent cardiac catheterization [**2160-2-6**] where during injection of dye into native vessels, experienced [**9-5**] CP and severe HTN, relieved with nitro and IV lopressor.
ISR and an 80% distal stenosis along with 2 other lesions w/in the graft, patent LIMA, occluded SVG to [**Month/Year (2) **], patent SVG to PDA w/ moderate disease.
He reports recent increase in his anginal symptoms including DOE and chest pressure (mostly with activity, but occasionally at rest).
SVG to OM had minimal flow.
Attempted intervention c/b perferation with embolization.
Currently, patient describes 2/10 chest pain, no SOB, no palpitations, no n/v or fevers, chills or diaphoresis.

R groin c/d/i, no hematoma.
L groin small oozing, no hematoma.
L foot pulses palpable DP and PT.
[**2160-2-13**] pleural effusion cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Mesothelial cells, macrophages and neutrophils.
Selective limited vein graft angiography of sapehenous vein graft to an obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery  revealed a degenerated, thrombotic lesion of 80% in the mid graft and a proximal 60-70% stenosis partially within a stented segment in the proximal portion of the graft.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
[**2160-2-12**] CXR PA/Lat: FINDINGS: There is no focal consolidation or superimposed edema.
There is a moderate to large sized left pleural effusion.
Very small right pleural effusion is also evident.
There is no pneumothorax.
Extensive prior interventions in the heart as noted above [**2160-2-12**] left lat decub CXR: New small bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right, is freely mobile on the left, partially mobile on the right.
[**2-14**] CTA: No Pulmonary Embolism, no masses, R hilar lymph node 1.4cm, coronary calcifications, bilateral ground glass opacities likely infection or infiltrate, but could be bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: # Cardiac: A. CAD with AMI: Pt w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD, SVG to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and RCA) in [**2148**] and multiple PCI who p/w exertional angina, + stress test for cardiac cathetherization.
SVG to OM had minimal flow.
Patient had persistant chest pain similar to his anginal pain.
His anginal pain was medically optimized with imdur 120, metoprolol to 100 tid, and lisinopril 2.5mg.
Had episodes of hypotension on [**2-9**] in setting of incresed medications which were decreased.
# Pleural effusion: Initially seen on PA/Lat film taken for persistent left sided shoulder pain distinct from his typical angina.
It was tapped on [**2-13**] and was exudative with PMN predominance.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
# CRI: Pt w/ h/o CRI, baseline Cr 1.3-1.4.
# H/o PUD: protonix and maalox.
# Tobacco abuse: Counsel on smoking cessation ----------------- PCP to follow up: 1) pleural effusion cultures 2) repeat CT scan in [**7-4**] weeks for resolution of opacities, monitor lymph notde.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: CAD s/p cath NSTEMI Chronic kidney disease Tobacco use Pleural effusion   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Vital signs stable.
Patient still with residual chest pain without obvious gross anatomical cause.
Discharge Instructions: You had a cardiac catheterization.
It was complicated by a vein graft thrombosis and subsequent heart damage.
You also had a pleural effusion (fluid around your lung.
You had a CT which showed some opacities and a lymph node.
We have changed some of your medications.
Please have Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24873**] follow up with the CT scan results and the pleural effusion cultures.
