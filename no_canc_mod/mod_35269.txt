Active Diagnoses: # Variceal Bleeding / Hypotension: Patient presented with active variceal bleeding and hypotension (SBP 60s) during an outpatient EGD.
On admission, the patient admitted to several episodes of hematemesis over the few days prior to the EGD.
In addition, he was given ceftriaxone as an empiric therapy for possible biliary/GI infection.
# Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine was 2.7 on arrival to the ICU, up from a baseline of around 1.0 from his recent admission.
This was likely prerenal related to recent blood loss and hypotension.
# Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has a long history of cirrhosis with complications from variceal bleeding, but otherwise fairly stable.
His LFTs were slightly elevated from his baseline on admission to the ICU with ALT 49, AST 120, and TBili 1.2.

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a gastrointestinal bleed secondary to your liver cirrhosis.
We transfused you with blood and stopped the bleeding source.
You are still at risk for gastrointestinal bleeds and it is imperative that you stop drinking.
Please call or return to the hospital if you develop blood in the stool, blood in your vomit, dark tarry stools, lightheadedness, dizziness, or any other symptom that concerns you.
