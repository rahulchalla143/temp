No acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema or mass.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4639**]n-weighted imaging is more sensitive for detection of acute ischemia, particularly in setting of underlying chronic microvascular and lacunar infarction.
Left occipital cystic encephalomalacia and bilateral thalamic and left internal capsule lacunes, unchanged.
No evidence of hemorrhage, or acute infarction, or aneurysm.
Bilateral internal carotid 35% stenoses.
Left vertebral artery stenosis at its origin.
Severe vascular calcifications consistent with atherosclerotic disease.
-TTE: LVEF 55%, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality and patient lack of cooperation, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Short segment mild-to-moderate stenosis of the proximal and the mid poritons of the basilar artery, without flow limitation and unchanged.
Paranasal sinus disease as described above.
-CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: small vessel infarct to brainstem   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with new aberrant eye movements causing some double vision, and we suspected that this resulted from a small vessel infarct, or stroke, to your brainstem.
It will be important to control your blood pressure, your diabetes, and your high cholesterol in order to further minimize your future stroke risk.
