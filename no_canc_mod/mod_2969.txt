Admission Date:  [**2177-11-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-11-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2139-5-19**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 38 year old male transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital early on the morning of [**2177-11-14**], with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, abdominal pain and nausea.
He states he checked himself into detoxification facility on Tuesday after having several days of severe nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
He reports feeling poorly, continuing to have nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain.
In general, he is a 38 year old male in no acute distress.
Anicteric sclera.
Lungs revealed diffuse bilateral wheezing.
Cardiovascular is tachycardic, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Chest x-ray shows mild congestive heart failure.
Head CT negative for bleed, but small hypodensities bilaterally towards the vertex in the frontoparietal region.
Questionable nonspecific changes in the T waves in V1 through V6.
No acute ST-T wave changes.
Acute renal failure - Initially, the patient was treated in the MICU with emergent hemodialysis for a bicarbonate of 7 and potassium of 6.0.
It was felt likely acute tubular necrosis secondary to ingestion most suspicious for ethylene glycol although difficult to diagnose as the patient presented seven to eight days after possible ingestion.
Renal ultrasound showed enlarged kidneys bilaterally with left measuring 14 centimeters and right measuring 13 centimeters.
No stones and no hydronephrosis.
No oxalate crystals were seen in his urine.
His initial laboratories on [**2177-11-14**], were negative for ethylene glycol, acetone methanol and isopropanol with a serum anion gap of 33 and plasma osmolar gap of 15 but acute renal failure may cause both elevation in the serum anion gap and osmolar gap, making these uninterpretable.
The patient will likely not require biopsy if his urine output continues to increase and he will likely be discharged to a rehabilitation facility and follow-up for outpatient dialysis treatments as necessary and follow-up with renal in clinic.
Serum anion gap and plasma osmolar gap - Suspected polyethylene glycol ingestion although complicated by the fact that acute renal failure can cause both to be elevated.
Decreased mental status - Concern for intracranial hemorrhage initially but head CT negative for bleed.
Small hypodensities found in the vertex near frontoparietal region likely secondary to toxic metabolic damage secondary to ingestion.
The patient had seizures on arrival to the Emergency Department [**2177-11-14**], and was treated with Ativan.
These were felt to be likely withdrawal seizures from alcohol.
Hypertension - Poorly controlled hypertension while in the hospital with evidence of some fluid overload and possible element of diastolic dysfunction secondary to ingestion.
He has unclear source of infection and this may possibly be a leukemoid reaction to his ingestion.
Urinary analysis was negative.
We will check a repeat chest x-ray although he has had no infiltrates on past chest x-rays.
Pulmonary - The patient with intermittent desaturation into the high 80s with increased blood pressure and crackles on examination.
Likely secondary to fluid overload and improved saturation with tighter blood pressure control and more frequent dialysis.
Will check a chest x-ray today to rule out any pneumonia.
