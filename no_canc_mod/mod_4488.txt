u/s groin-IMPRESSION: Hematoma without evidence for pseudoaneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1356**] is a 53 yo male with PVD, HTN, HL, CAD s/p MI, s/p liver [**Known lastname **] for alcoholic cirrhosis, admitted to the MICU for hypotension.
Patient had significant hypotension in the ED that required 4L of NS to normalize, and patient is now normotensive in the MICU.
Perhaps hypotension is related to overdiruesis with home lasix dose, and med effect from several antihypertensives, however there is concern for early sepsis in this patient who is immunosuppressed with cellcept and prograf.
Patient has significant right groin pain, making the surgical site the most likely source of infection.
Another possibility is cardiac etiology of hypotension given transient chest pressure several days ago, but this seems less likely in the setting of unchanged EKG.
PT covered with vanco/zosyn overnight.
U/S showing hematoma but no sign of abscess.
Acute Renal failure.
He likely has pre-renal ARF as it responded to 4LNS bolus, though it remains above baseline.
Prograf may be causing the elevated Cr as well, but dose was lowered today.
Likely secondary to renal failure and groin hematoma resorption.
No EKG changes.
Patient is s/p femoral graft removal and replacement due to infection last week.
Now with significant wound tenderness.
No clear evidence of drainage.
Patient is s/p liver [**Hospital1 **] in [**2150**] for alcoholic cirrhosis.
CAD s/p MI.
Patient has EKG without ischemic change.
- consider echo if not clear source of hypotension .
