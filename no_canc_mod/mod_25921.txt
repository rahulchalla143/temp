Admission Date:  [**2139-10-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-11-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-8-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Levofloxacin / Benzodiazepines / Hydantoins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: SOB/cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old man with h/o HIV (last CD4 182, VL 56 per report), on HAART, [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] ED with shortness of breath and cough.
The patient reports 6-8 weeks of progressively worsening shortness of breath and productive cough.
He was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 302**] for hyponatremia and left from rehab last week (unclear if he left AMA or was discharged home).
He notes that he was short of breath at the OSH, but that it has gotten worse over the past week.
He now gets short of breath with any movement.
CXR showed bilateral patchy interstitial opacification of the lower lobes.
Breathing seemed less strenuous.
However, given concern for hypotension, hypoxia, and possible decompensation overnight, he was transferred to the MICU for further monitoring.
In the hour prior to transfer the patient had a rapid increase in work of breathing.
Although his saturations held in the low 90s he was increasing tachypneic and tachycardic.
Per nursing he was slightly disoriented, however eating without signs of aspiration.
Given gradual decline in respiratory function (6-8 weeks), this appears to be a more chronic process that is acutely worsened by evolving PNA within the LLL and GNR in sputum.
There seems to be underlying lung obstructive pathology that was not previously identified(probable COPD).
Pt continued to receive meropenem for GNR identified on BAL Cx; pt's respiratory status continued to decline.
Family decided that given severe underlying disease and poor prognosis in regard to returning to desired quality of life, pt was to be extubated and placed on CMO with DNI/DNR.

Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given gradual decline in respiratory function (6-8 weeks), this appears to be a more chronic process that is acutely worsened by evolving PNA within the LLL and GNR in sputum.
There seems to be underlying lung obstructive pathology that has not been identified yet (probable COPD).
# Acidosis:  possible proximal RTA with elevated Cl and suboptimal increase in bicarb; proximal RTA most likely secondary to anti retrovirals.
Anemia: Pt with macrocytic anemia.
