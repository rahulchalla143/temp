Patient denies any chest discomfort or dizziness during the episode.
Patient reports 4 weeks of sub-sternal "heart burn" with exertion, which he thought could also be musculoskeletal related to climbing into his new truck.
He describes this pain as a band-like tightness [**4-13**].
Patient has baseline 2 pillow orthopnea and intermittent lower extremity edema (not worsened recently).
On review of systems, denies stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel and left main disease unsuitable for PCI.
The LMCA had an 80% stenosis distally at the bifurcation of the LAD and LCX.
The LAD had mild disease in the previously placed proximal stent and moderate mid-segment disease.
The LCX had an 80% ostial stenosis with an 80% stenosis proximally in a high OM1.
The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the mid-segment and an 80% stenosis in the proximal right posterolateral branch.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated systemic arterial pressure despite a nitroglyercine IV drip with an SBP of 181 mm Hg.
The LVEDP was also elevated at 25 mm Hg suggestive of severe diastolic dysfunction.
There was no gradient suggestive of aortic stenosis with pullback across the aortic valve.
Left ventriculography given renal insufficiency.
Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
These findings are c/w hypertensive heart.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2179-6-22**], prominent left ventricular hypertrophy is now identified.
[**2186-10-30**] ECHO PRE BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2186-10-30**] Carotid Ultrasound Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
CHEST (PA & LAT)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 29794**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    55 year old man with s/p cabg REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    f/u atx, effusions Final Report CHEST, PA AND LATERAL REASON FOR EXAM: Status post CABG, follow up effusion.
Minimal bilateral pleural effusions are associated with small left basilar atelectasis.
There is no volume overload.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4078**] [**Name (STitle) 4079**] DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2618**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2619**]     Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-10-27**] for management of his dyspnea and chest pain.
A cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed severe left main and three vessel coronary artery disease.
He ruled in for a myocardial infarction by enzymes.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed no significant internal carotid artery disease.
He did well in the immediate postoperative period, however he did have a metabolic acidosis and therefore remained intubated until the morning of POD1 at 6AM.
