Admission Date:  [**2183-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-3-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-10-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7299**] Chief Complaint: Aspirin and Tylenol ingestion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Femoral dialysis line placement PICC line placement  History of Present Illness: 60 year old female with PMH of depression followed by a psychiatrist with h/o suicide attempt 15 years ago and past psychiatric hospitalizations (last 1 year ago), bipolar disorder, HTN, and hypothyroidism who initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] at 4:30PM on [**2-25**] s/p an overdose of reportedly 300 tablets of aspirin and 10 tablets of Tylenol Extra Strength at 3:30PM this afternoon.
She said that this was a suicide attempt but reported no other co-ingestions.
She denied CP/SOB, abdominal pain, and diarrhea at [**Location (un) 620**].
Initially when she presented to [**Location (un) 620**]: 4:21 pm - ETOH neg, tylenol 87, aspirin 9.7 6:45 pm - LFTs neg, tylenol 40.3, aspirin 63.2 bicarb=24.5 Cr 1, K 4.6 EKG: QRS 102 She was started on a bicarb drip at [**Location (un) 620**], given activated charcoal, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for toxicology.
An EKG showed sinus rhythm at 90, NA/NI, TWI in III.
CXR shows bilateral increased vascular markings but no acute infiltrate.
Toxicology was consulted and recommended q2 hour aspirin levels and alkalinization of the urine with a goal pH of 7.5-8.0.
Toxicology recommended no intubation.
If ASA levels increase or acidosis is refractory, toxicology wanted renal consultation for dialysis.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: T: 98.3, BP: 132/64, P: 110, R: 23 O2: 96% General: Obtunded, tachypneic, uncomfortable appearing, diffusely erythematous HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM Neck: supple CV: Tachycardic Lungs: Tachypneic, clear to auscultation bilaterally with some rales bilaterally at bases Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present GU: Foley Ext: warm, no clubbing or edema Neuro: obtunded .
At discharge: 98.9, 139/94, 75, 18, 94% RA General: AAOX3, anxious but well appearing female in NAD HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, EOMI, PERRLA Neck: supple, no JVD, no lymphadenopathy CV: RRR, no M/R/G Lungs: CTABL, reduced air entry bibasally.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: warm, no clubbing or edema Neuro: CNII-XII grossly intact.
No previous tracing available for comparison  Imaging: AP CXR on admission: IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for pulmonary edema.
The aorta is slightly tortuous.
The lung volumes are low, resulting in bibasilar atelectasis.
However, there is a superimposed right basilar opacity which could represent aspiration or early pneumonia.
Linear left basilar opacities reflect atelectasis versus focal scarring, unchanged since the [**2183-2-25**] examination, but new neighboring opacities are also concerning for mild aspiration/consolidation.
There is no pneumothorax.
Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is suggestive of a tiny pleural effusion.
Right basilar aspiration or consolidation.
Possible left basilar consolidation or aspiration.
Bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
Prominence of the portal triads, correlate with LFTs or right heart failure.
Evidence of lithium nephropathy with bilateral innumerable tiny cysts.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 year old female with PMH of depression followed by a psychiatrist with h/o suicide attempt 15 years ago and past psychiatric hospitalizations (last 1 year ago), bipolar disorder, HTN, and hypothyroidism who initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] at 4:30PM on [**2-25**] s/p an overdose of reportedly 300 tablets of aspirin and 10 tablets of Tylenol Extra Strength at 3:30PM this afternoon.
It was thought that she likely had an aspirin bezoar in her stomach that was slowly leeching out variable doses of aspirin.
This increase was associated with decreased consciousness but did not have any evidence of seizure.
She was extremely tachypneic during the first few days in the MICU.
Her mental status and tachypnea improved.
Suicide attempt: patient has long history of bipolar disease and past suicide attempts.
After her mental status improved, she was kept with a 1:1 sitter.
She was started on antibiotics, and due to rapid clinical improvement, transitioned to PO levofloxacin.
Hypernatremia: She was hypernatremic on presentation, but blood sodium levels dropped to low 130s on the bicarbonate drip.
The patient had large urine output, dilute urine with urine osmolality 133 with serum osmolality 304.  Review of outpatient labs at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] revealed that hyponatremia has been chronic since at least 07/[**2181**].
The picture is consistent with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as a consequence of chronic lithium use.
Her abdominal ultrasound also showed microcystic changes in the kidneys, consistent with lithium toxicity.
Hypotension:  She had been persistently hypotensive after her toxic ingestion of ASA, likely due to vasodilation from direct aspirin toxicity, possibly complicated by an aspirin bezoar or sepsis from aspiration pneumonia.
# Elevated LFTs: Likely secondary to tylenol toxicity combined with aspirin toxicity.
She was noted to have acute renal failure in the setting of toxic ingestions, but also chronic kidney disease of unclear etiology, likely secondary to lithium toxicity with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Please encourage drinking of water and ensure constant access to free water, to allow the patient to self-correct hyprnatremia secondary to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
She will complete a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia on [**2183-3-13**]  Medications on Admission: -Levothyroxine 88mcg daily -Lithium 300mg [**Hospital1 **] -Citalopram 20mg daily -Dulcolax daily -MVI daily -Glycopyrrolate 1mg TID -Clonazepam 0.5mg daily -Lisinopril 2.5mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. miconazole nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).
PO once a day as needed for constipation.
You were admitted following an overdose on aspirin and tylenol, following which you became obtunded and developed severe metabolic abnormalities.
You also had some liver damage from the tylenol, for which we treated you with N-acetylcysteine to remove tylenol from your body.
While your mental status was poor, you likely inhaled some secretions into your lung and developed an aspiration pneumonia.
Blood and urine tests suggested that this is probably a condition called "nephrogenic diabetes insipidus" a condition in which the body makes excess amounts of dilute urine and causes the sodium level in the blood to rise.
An ultrasound scan of your kidneys showed some cysts in your kidney, which may also be related to lithium.
We made the following changes to your medications: STOPPED Lithium STOPPED Citalopram STOPPED Clonazepam STOPPED Glycopyrrolate .
