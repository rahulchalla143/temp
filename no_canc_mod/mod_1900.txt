She had a chest x ray demonstrating a right middle lobe pneumonia.
She had transient hypotension and was on Levophed.
She had received a dose of levofloxacin in the ED, but this was stopped due to potential reaction with myasthenia.
Her NIFs and vital capacities were monitored to ensure no myasthenic crisis.
No organism was identified as the etiology of her pneumonia.
2) myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: patient was maintained on prednisone and Mestinon at her home doses.
She did well and had no complications from her myasthenia.
She was started on Bactrim for pneumocystis prophylaxis given her chronic steroid use.
3) mineralocorticoid deficiency: Ms. [**Known lastname 12289**] had persistently low blood pressures upon leaving the intensive care unit.
These were minimally responsive to fluid boluses.
Given her chronic prednisone use(relatively glucocorticoid specific), a urine sodium was checked.
It was thought that she had a mineralocorticoid deficiency and was started on Florinef.
4) atrial fibrillation: the patient remained in atrial fibrillation as an inpatient.
She had several runs of rapid ventricular response to 140s-150s.
Initially her b blocker was held due to low blood pressure.
Pneumonia complicated by sepsis 2.
Atrial fibrillation 4.
Mineralocorticoid deficiency  Discharge Condition: Good, oxygenating well on room air and ambulating without assistance.
Please contact your physician or present to the ER if you experience fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or other concerns.
