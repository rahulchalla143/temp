Left atrial exploration and ligation of left atrial appendage.
History of Present Illness: Pt is a 74 yo man with h/o stroke in [**2186**] on warfarin, recent TIA in [**5-1**], a. fib, HTN, and dyslipidemia who presents for scheduled cardiac catheterization for further assessment of aortic stenosis.
He denied any chest discomfort or palpitations at rest or with exertion.
after his TIA (presented with general weakness and diplopia x 2-3 hours in [**5-1**]) after which he had been "taking it easy."
He had no recent syncopal events.
He does have a remote history of syncope during a humid day after standing up too quickly.
Pt denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema.
He also denied HA, cough, hemoptysis, N/V/D, abdominal pain, melena, or BRBPR, and recent fevers or chills.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Aortic stenosis 2.
HTN 4.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.  h/o TIA (generalized weakness, diplopia, dysarthria) in [**5-1**] 6.  h/o stroke (R-sided paresthesias) in [**2186**] 7.  h/o intermittent vertigo after L ear infection 7.  h/o hernia repair 8.  h/o L shoulder surgery  Social History: Social history is significant for the 15 pack years, quit 37 years ago.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No carotid bruits noted.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed moderate two vessel coronary artery disease with slow perfusion consistent with microvascular dysfunction.
The proximal LAD had a 40-50% stenosis at S1.
The LCx had a 50% stenosis in a small distal AV groove just after takeoff of the major OM2.
The RCA had a 30% stenosis at the origin, and mild diffuse disease was noted throughout.
There was a large RPL.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 21-23 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 46-47 mmHg.
The cardiac index was depressed at 1.1 L/min/m2 with modest augmentation of cardiac output with dobutamine to 15 mcg/kg/min (with minimal change in heart rate and only mild increase in systemic systolic arterial pressure), based on a measured oxygen consumption post-sedation.
The calculated valve area will UNDERESTIMATE the true valve area in the setting of his known aortic regurgitation.
Left ventriculography showed a moderate-severely calcified aortic valve, mild (1+) non-ectopic mitral regurgitation, and normal wall motion with estimated ejection fraction of 60%.
[**2200-7-30**] Carotid Study There is a less than 40% right ICA stenosis and less than 40% left ICA stenosis with antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
Gallstone, without evidence of cholecystitis.
Slightly echogenic liver, likely steatotic, however, other forms of liver disease such as significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis cannot be totally excluded.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Stranding seen adjacent to the pancreas tail, consistent with mild uncomplicated pancreatitis.
No evidence of pseudocyst formation or other sequelae of pancreatitis.
Peripherally-enhancing relatively low attenuation lesion seen within the spleen, most likely representing a hemangioma, or possibly other vascular lesion.
Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
[**2200-8-14**] CXR Left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusions have improved and nearly resolved.
No pneumothorax is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2200-7-28**] for surgical management of his aortic stenosis.
As his coumadin had been stopped 4 days prior to admission, heparin was started for anticoagulation given his chronic atrial fibrillation.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization in preparation for surgery which showed mild two vessel coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, mild pulmonary hypertension and a normal left ventricular function.
A head CT scan showed a moderate degree of small vessel ischemic changes and scattered lacunes.
His risk of perioperative stroke was thus estimated to be around 4.8-8.8% and he was cleared for surgery.
He developed rapid atrial fibrillation and cardioversion was attempted unsuccessfully.
He was transfused with packed red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] soon developed emesis and his NG tube was replaced.
Laboratory studies were consistent with pancreatitis and TPN was started for nutrition.
The genral surgery service was consulted for assistance with his pancreatitis.
A CT scan was performed which showed stranding seen adjacent to the pancreas tail which was consistent with mild uncomplicated pancreatitis however no evidence of pseudocyst formation or other sequelae of pancreatitis was identified.
Coumadin was continued for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
