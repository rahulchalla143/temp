Admission Date:  [**2176-9-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2176-10-3**]   Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year old white male well known to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a past medical history significant for subdural hematoma, status post evacuation, difficulty to wean, Enterobacter Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and acute cholecystitis, status post a seven day course of antibiotics and delirium who was discharged from [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**9-9**], to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation Facility and returned with a one day history of decreased mental status and hypotension.
At baseline, the patient is intermittently agitated and confused.
Since his arrival the patient has had a negative head computerized tomography scan and abdominal computerized tomography scan negative for free fluid, free air or inflammatory processes.
The abdominal computerized tomography scan was positive for a large left pleural effusion with collapse and a moderate right pleural effusion.
His right upper quadrant ultrasound was positive for gallbladder wall thickening, large stone in the gallbladder, biliary sludge in addition to pericholecystic fluid and adenomyomatosis, all of which were unchanged from a prior study done prior to his admission.
The patient was seen by General Surgery in the Emergency Department and not felt to have an acute gallbladder or other intra-abdominal pathology.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Arthritis, glaucoma, subdural hematoma in [**2176-7-29**], complicated by an extended Intensive Care Unit stay with Enterobacter, Enterococcal pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin and Zosyn, cholecystitis treated with Ampicillin and Flagyl and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sputum treated with Vancomycin for presumed Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, status post tracheostomy placement and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter, hypertension, hernia surgery, increased cholesterol, transurethral resection of prostate in [**2159**], gout, peptic ulcer disease, left carpal tunnel release, right knee replacement and baseline mental status as of [**9-9**] as agitated but able to communicate intermittently with a component of delirium.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Cardiovascular, obscured by coarse breathsounds.
Micro sputum gram stain, greater than 25 polys, greater than 10 eppys, 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs with clusters, positive gram negative rods.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound, stable appearance of gallbladder with gallbladder stones, sludge, wall thickening and edema, positive adenomyomatous disease as seen previously.
Computerized tomography scan of the head and abdomen, no changes or pathology seen.
ASSESSMENT:  This is an 84 year old male status post subdural hematoma, approximately two months ago, status post evacuation with his hospital course complicated by difficulty weaning respirator, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter pneumonia and cholecystitis who was discharged to a nursing home for about one week when he developed hypotension, tachycardia and tachypnea at first thought to be sepsis, later found to have an anterior wall myocardial infarction with a decreased ejection fraction admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of his multiple medical problems.
Cardiovascular - Coronary arteries, the patient is status post anterior wall myocardial infarction on admission, currently on Aspirin, Beta blocker, ACE inhibitor and a statin pump.
The patient initially had a decreased ejection fraction from a baseline of 55 to 25% after his acute coronary event.
The patient had transudative bilateral pleural effusions which were taped one time, however, further thoracentesis was not pursued given its transudative nature and likelihood of recurring.
Rhythm, the patient had a history of atrial fibrillation, did have a few episodes in-house and was cleared for anticoagulation by Neurosurgery, however, was not continued on anticoagulation given his increased bloody secretions and urine once being on Heparin and Coumadin.
The patient also suffered from sick sinus syndrome while in-house after his anterior wall myocardial infarction.
The patient was continually monitored with no further events.
His hypotension improved dramatically as compared to the beginning of his stay with the addition of these agents.
Respiratory failure - Secondary to the patient's bilateral pleural effusions and weakness.
We continued to maintain the patient's pressor support given his persistent effusions and muscle weakness, however, the patient did not show any evidence of distress.
The patient's controlled agitation has significantly helped his hypertension as well.
Infectious disease - The patient has a history of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia as well as Enterobacter pneumonia, status post treatment with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
The patient's follow up cultures have not been significant for gram negative rods, indicating complete resolvement of his Enterobacter pneumonia.
The patient is colonized with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and his follow up sputum to show gram positive cocci significant for Staphylococcus coagulase positive, however, the patient has already been treated with Vancomycin and is not exhibiting any signs pneumonia at this time and no further treatment is necessary.
Follow up liver function tests have been within normal limits and the patient has not exhibited a leukocytosis, temperature spikes or right upper quadrant tenderness indicating any progression of his gallbladder infection.
The patient did not have surgical removal of his gallbladder, given his increased surgical risk.
The patient did suffer from yeast infection of his urine while in-house.
His Foley catheter was changed by Urology given his complicated urethral anatomy, status post transurethral resection of prostate surgery back in [**2159**] with no further complications.
The patient was ruled out for Clostridium difficile diarrhea with all of his toxins coming back negative.
Neurological - The patient has a history of subdural hematoma, status post evacuation.
Follow up head computerized tomography scan at the end of [**Month (only) 216**] showed a stable subdural hematoma with no changes.
The patient was cleared for anticoagulation by Neurology but as mentioned above, anticoagulation was not pursued given his increased bloody secretions and urine.
