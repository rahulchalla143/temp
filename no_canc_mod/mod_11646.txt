The patient was started Ondansetron for nausea and gastric prophylaxis was initiated with Ranitidine 50 mg IV every eight hours.
Since the patient's repeat MRI of the brain with magnetic resonance imaging  of the arteries revealed mild stenosis in the origin of the left carotid artery, tortuosity of the thoracic aorta without MR evidence of significant atheromatous disease and questionable dissection of the right vertebral artery, he was started on anticoagulation with heparin following his transfer to the Neurology Floor on the [**2132-3-31**].
