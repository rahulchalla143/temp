Admission Date:  [**2190-4-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-4-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-10-13**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old female who presented initially to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Last Name (un) 4068**] with the complaint of "not feeling well" for the last 24 hours.
She was taken to the ED via EMS and found to be in third degree complete heart block with a rate of 37-40, but stable vital signs.
At 6:00 am, she had an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia for about 20 beats, which broke spontaneously.
A III/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex.
EKG:  Showed ventricular escape rhythm at a rate of 48 with third degree AV block.
CHEST X-RAY:  Showed atherosclerotic changes in the aorta.
HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) CARDIOVASCULAR - A) ISCHEMIA:  The patient with no clear anginal symptoms.
The patient had a slight bump in her cardiac enzymes from a CK of 194-293 after placement of her pacemaker, which again came down the next morning.
2) ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  When the patient initially came, she was unable to fully communicate.
She was able to communicate and was oriented x 2, but still had some occasional hallucinations of seeing puppies, or multiple boxes in the room.
Her altered mental status may likely be due to a source of infection, as her white count has increased to 20.
Her chest x-ray initially showed some opacities at bilateral bases, which may be consistent with aspiration.
3) HYPERTENSION:  The patient noted to be extremely hypertensive at the outside hospital.
4) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient with fractional secretion of sodium of 0.5 likely secondary to hypotension and dehydration.
Although her PO intake may be decreased due to her altered mental status, we will continue her on gentle IV fluid hydration.
5) HEMATOLOGIC:  The patient was initially on Coumadin on admission for atrial fibrillation with an elevated INR.
