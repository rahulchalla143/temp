Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 19714**] Admission Date: [**2158-4-10**] Discharge Date: [**2158-4-16**] Date of Birth:  [**2094-1-6**] Sex:  F Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 64 year old woman with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and a murmur since childhood.
She has been worked up for the last several months for increasing dyspnea on exertion and related chest pressure.
She had a stress test back in [**2157-10-21**] which demonstrated fatigue, some ST depressions, and was referred for cardiac catheterization in [**2158-1-21**].
The cardiac catheterization demonstrated an aortic valve area of 0.4 and mild dilation of the ascending aorta.
Since that evaluation, she continues to have some dyspnea on exertion, though her symptoms have not worsened and she has not noticed any new symptoms.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post resection of a melanoma on the right knee, with a right groin lymph node dissection.
ALLERGIES:  She has a Lipitor allergy which leads to muscle aches.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father passed away of a myocardial infarction at age 58.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for what is mentioned above, which is dyspnea on exertion.
She is regular, with a IV/VI systolic ejection murmur that radiates to the carotids.
An echocardiogram on [**2157-2-16**] showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 70 percent and a mildly dilated ascending aorta of 3.9 cm, and a severe aortic stenosis.
Cardiac catheterization from [**2158-2-16**] demonstrated an aortic valve area of 0.4 with a peak gradient of 120, mean 80, one plus mitral regurgitation, two plus aortic insufficiency, ejection fraction 75 percent, mild dilation of the ascending aorta.
Severe aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency.
Dilation of ascending aorta, status post ascending aorta    replacement with tube graft.
Gastroesophageal reflux disorder.
She will go home with services to have the wound checked, medication checks, and to ensure that she is continuing to progress as she has done here.
