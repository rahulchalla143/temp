Upon being found EMS was called and he was transported to [**Hospital1 **] for evalaution.
He underwent CT of his torso, and X-ray of his right knee per trauma service and he had a CTA of the head to rule out vascular injury at our request.
Past Medical History: HTN, NIDDM, ETOH abuse, cardiac ablation for unknown etiology  Social History: ETOH abuse, works as traffic office for city of [**Hospital1 8**]  Family History: CAD  Physical Exam: Hunt and [**Doctor Last Name 9381**]:3       [**Doctor Last Name **]: 3     GCS 9T E:2   V:1T Motor:6 Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
Subdural blood tracks along the tentorial leafs and the falx.
Minimal change since the prior imported scan (3 hours).
2.Segmental consolidation in the superior segment of the right lower lobe is concerning for aspiration or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
No acute traumatic pathology.
CTA [**2173-5-26**]: No dissection, aneurysm, or AVM detected.
No focus of active extravasation.
Stable to slightly decreased diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Prominent bifrontal extra-axial spaces.
No evidence for ventriculomegaly or shift of normally midline structures.
----------------- Lumbar xrays [**2173-5-30**]: No radiographic evidence of acute lumbar spine fracture CT Head [**5-31**]  1.
Stable appearance of right frontal and temporal hemorrhagic contusions.
Mild reduction in the subarachnoid hemorrhage along the quadrigeminal and ambient cisterns.
----------------- EEG [**2173-6-2**]: This is an abnormal routine EEG, due to the presence of a significant portion of the record spent in sleep and mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
This pattern is consistent with an early diffuse encephalopathy, commonly seen with medication effect, metabolic disturbance, or infection.
However, there were no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features seen.
LENI [**2173-6-3**] No DVT in either lower extremity.
Diffuse axonal injury within the splenium of the corpus callosum and posterior mid brain, with mild swelling and effacement of the left aspect of the quadrageminal cistern.
Lung volumes are low,but there is no pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Mild cardiomegaly is exaggerated by low lung volumes but probably real and unchanged over the past ten days.
CXR [**2173-6-6**]: Low inspiratory volumes with patchy retrocardiac and left suprahilar opacity, ?due to atelectasis.
He developed hypertension and tachycardia and was started on delerium tremens prophylaxis.
He developed fever and had thick secretions and was started on antibiotics for presumed pneumonia possibly aspiration related.
He was in a hard collar which was removed by the ICU team for a negative cervical CT done at [**Hospital6 **].
The leg would withdraw briskly to minimal noxious but no commands.
He had no palpable step-offs or point tenderness.
X-ray of the lumbar and sacral spine were obtained which showed no acute fracture.
Psychiatry consultation was requested [**6-2**] for assitance with withdrawal/agitation medication - they recommended haldol and to add pain medication.
The also suggested EEG which was obtained and results showed early diffuse encephalopathy and no epileptiform activity.
He was also intubated in order to obtain MRI of the brain which showed diffuse axonal injury; MRI of spine was considered but not done as pt was moving all extremities with no motor deficits and the information to be gained from doing this study would not change current management.
He finished up his course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and his prophylactic seizure medication and these were both discontinued.
Foley was removed but had to be replaced due to retention.
Blood glucoses were mildly elevated throughout his hospitalization but better controlled once on tube feedings and resumed usual home meds.
