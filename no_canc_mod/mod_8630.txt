states that she has experienced a chronic cough which is mostly dry but with occasional clear sputum production for around 5 months.
About 3 weeks prior to presentation ([**7-5**])the pt presented to [**Hospital1 **] for similar dyspnea and was admitted with a dx of a-fib, anticoagulated, and cardioverted.
She was discharged on [**7-9**] to a rehab facility where poor monitoring of INR on coumadin resulted in an INR of 9.1 when the pt.
was found to have a CHF exacerbation with BNP=1425 in the context of a TEE from [**7-6**] which had shown diastolic dysfunction.
Two days prior to presentation, pt reports increased cough with wheezing along with severe nausea such that she "wishes she could throw up" and fevers with rigors up to 102 degrees accompanied by confusion.
She denies associated CP, emesis, diarrhea, dysuria, or urinary frequnecy.
Sepsis protocol was initiated; a LIJ CVL was placed, she received 5L IVF, and was started on a levophed ggt.
Past Medical History: Diastolic congestive heart failure  EF>=60% Atrial Fibrillation - s/p cardioversion.

3 sets cardiac enzymes negative.
U/A small blood with no RBCs otherwise normal.
Micro [**7-23**] Blood culture: 4/4 bottles S.aureus (MSSA) sensitive to clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, bactrim, oxacillin [**7-24**] Blood culture no growth to date (as of [**7-30**]) [**7-25**] Blood culture no growth to date (as of [**7-30**]) [**7-27**] Blood culture no growth to date (as of [**7-30**]) [**7-23**] urine culture negative  ECHO ([**7-27**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There are no obvious vegetations are visualized.
The severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly reduced.
Left lower extremity ultrasound ([**8-5**]): No evidence of DVT in the left leg.
Mild degenerative changes of the sacroiliac joints and hips.
No evidence of discrete fluid collections, abnormal enhancement, or underlying osteomyelitis.
Soft tissue fluid consistent with anasarca, likely from third spacing of fluid.
This may reflect underlying hypoalbuminemia or fluid overload.
No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.
Non-occlusive thrombosis of the left cephalic vein within the forearm.
Patient in ICU requiring pressors and fluid boluses, then transferred to the floor where she was afebrile and improving, she continually diuresed much fluid.
No evidence of pelvic abscess or osteo (checked given hip/groin pain) or of seeding of valves (checked by transthoracic echo).
Atrial fibrillation: in the setting of large fluid shifts (diuresed negative 5 liters 1 day post ICU discharge) she returned to atrial fibrillation rhythm after just being cardioverted a few weeks ago.
QTc was followed while on this drug and she showed no significant QTc prolongation.
Hyponatremia: Thought to be due to CHF versus SIADH.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
Septicemia 2.
Diastolic congestive heart failure 3.
Sepsis with MSSA 2.
Diastolic congestive heart failure 3.
Hypertension 4.
Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were experiencing chills, fever and weakness.
In the emergency department, you had signs of severe infection and received a large amount of fluids and needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit.
During our workup, we found you to have an infection of in your blood.
You were resuscitated with a lot of fluid while in the ICU due to your low blood pressure, and were cardioverted back to sinus rhythm and started on a new medication (norpace) to keep you in that rhythm.
If you begin to experience fever, chills, or other symptoms that worry you please call your primary care doctor or come into the emergency department.
