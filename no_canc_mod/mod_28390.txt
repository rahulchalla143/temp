Antenatally diagnosed hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
Antenatally diagnosed hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
Antenatally diagnosed bilateral pyelatelectasis  HISTORY:  This infant was delivered at 38-6/7 weeks to a 38- year-old gravida 2 para 1 now 2 woman with a past obstetric history notable for a term spontaneous vaginal delivery in [**2097**]; this child is alive and well.
Pregnancy was complicated by ventricular size discrepancy noted on fetal survey with subsequent echo showing the following: hypoplastic left heart syndrome with probable aortic and mitral valve atresia, mild tricuspid regurgitation, adequate pulmonary artery, good right ventricular systolic function, large PDA, small left atrium, moderate nonrestrictive atrial septal defect.
The fetal survey also showed bilateral pyelectasis.
Elective cesarean section was undertaken, without prior labor, for fetal indications.
There was no fever or other clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis.
Infant was mildly cyanotic initially but attained good color over 1-2 minutes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Term infant in no distress.
No nasal flaring.
No adventitious sounds.
CVS: Well perfused [capillary refill 3 seconds], regular rate and rhythm; femoral pulses normal; II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border radiating across the chest and into both axilla.
ABD: Soft, nondistended, no organomegaly.
A 3- vessel umbilical cord is noted.
MSK: Infant has a shallow sacral dimple with an easily visualized base.
CNS: The infant is active and responsive to mild stimulation.
IMPRESSION:  This term infant presents with antenatally diagnosed hypoplastic left heart syndrome, currently stable in room air, and antenatally diagnosed bilateral pyelatelectasis.
PLAN:  The infant is to be transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] for definitive management.
The infant has no sepsis risk factors.
We will therefore defer antibiotic coverage for now but consider this if cardiorespiratory symptoms develop.
