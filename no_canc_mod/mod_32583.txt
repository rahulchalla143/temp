Admission Date:  [**2118-8-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-9-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-3-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: Myocardial Infarction, Cardiac Arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization Endotracheal intubation (done at another hospital) and extubation   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o DM, CAD s/p stents to D1 and LCx, who presented from [**Hospital3 4107**] as a Code STEMI.
The patient was reportedly in his normal state of health until noon on [**8-27**], when he was lifting furniture and developed chest pain.
He reportedly had associated diaphoresis and lightheadedness.
An hour and a half later, the patient drove himself to [**Hospital1 **], where he continued to have substernal chest pain.
In the cath lab, the patient was found to have a total occlusion of the mid-RCA.
He was weaned off the pressors, and heparin and integrilin were discontinued as the patient continued to have substantial bleeding from his nares.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
LUNGS: Diffuse coars breath sounds bilaterally.
No crackles or wheezes appreciated.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ edema bilaterally.
Femoral venous lines in place bilaterally.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
MODERATE GROWTH.
However, there is new fullness in the hilar regions bilaterally and increase in interstitial markings suggesting new pulmonary edema above what would be expected for extubation.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are also evident.
There is no pneumothorax.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No definite valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Dilated aortic root.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-domimant system revealed single-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no significant stenoses.
The LAD had mild diffuse disease and patent stents in the first diagonal with moderate diffuse restenosis.
The LCX had patent proximal stent and a large OM2 branch with mild diffuse disease.
The RCA had an acute mid-vessel total occlusion 2.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated biventricular filling pressures and RA / PCWP pressures suggestive of right ventricular infarction, with depressed cardiac output.
Final angiography showed TIMI 3 flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
Post PCI bleeding was observed in the left nares, resolved with manual pressure and cessation of integrilin.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 **] s/p cardiac arrest with STEMI and is now s/p BMS to the RCA.
# Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarct:  The patient presented with chest pain and subsequently lost consciousness at [**Hospital1 **].
He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.
He was then rewarmed and weaned off sedation without complication.
Heparin and integrilin were held due to nose bleeding post-cath.
He had episodes of hypotension over the 24-48 hours after cath, and was aggressively given IV fluids to maintain blood pressure.
After cardiac cath, extubation was slightly delayed due to concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia and increased secretions.
He was extubated without complication and his respiratory status improved daily.
He was given ipratropium nebulizers and was diuresed with Lasix prn for fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
# Neurologic Status - Patient was intubated and sedated on arrival to our hospital.
He also has slight difficulty with balance while ambulating.
# Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV infarct and his hemodynamics in the cath lab demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.
A TTE after cath showed an LVEF>55% and no wall motion abnormalities.
He appears euolemic at discharge with no O2 requirement or evidence of fluid overload.
# Nose bleed:  The patient had a persistent nosebleed in the setting of traumatic NGT placement and integrilin/heparin gtts.
The bleeding stopped with Afrin nasal spray and the patient's Hct has remained stable.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient had thrombocytopenia approximately 5 days after being started on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
# Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Patient with some apneic episodes while sleeping.
This may be related to a previous condition, or may be a result of brain injury after his cardiac arrest.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: MASONIC PARTNERS [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 82936**]  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction of the right ventricle Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure due to Myocardial Infarct and Cardiac arrest, now ejection fraction 60% and heart failure resolved Epistaxis Memory Deficits after cardiac arrest Multilobar Pneumonia Thrombocytopenia  Discharge Condition: Stable, oriented, and afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and you developed cardiac arrest.
You did have a heart attack and needed to be on a breathing machine with medicine to support your blood pressure.
You have recovered well and now have only small memory defecits because of the cardiac arrest.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39288**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any further chest pain, trouble breathing, fevers, increasing coughing, fatigue, unusual swelling or any other concerning symptoms.
You should not drive until Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tells you it is OK. You may go up and down stairs, take short walks, go shopping but no strenuous exercise until after you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Please weigh yourself every day and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39288**] if your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
