Admission Date:  [**2155-8-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2155-8-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2112-9-15**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 42-year-old white male with past medical history significant for alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis resulting in pancreatic insufficiency, and insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine of 4.0, chronic thrombocytopenia, who has a recent admission to the [**Hospital1 69**], who presented on [**2155-8-13**] with acute onset fatigue, worsening dyspnea on exertion, increased lower extremity edema, and decreased urine output x3 days.
The patient was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 190**] from the period of [**2155-7-12**] to [**2155-7-16**] for refractory lower extremity edema x2 weeks.
This admission was also associated with a 25 pound weight gain with increased abdominal girth and exertional shortness of breath, and fatigue.
He was discharged home with decreased edema on Lasix dose of 80 mg po bid, hydrochlorothiazide qod, along with levofloxacin for urinary tract infection.
He now returns reporting return of the fatigue, exertional dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema for the past few days, and decreased urine output.
On presentation, he denied any chest pain, fevers, abdominal pain, cramps, or cough.
He reports baseline diarrhea which is not changed.
Rectal examination showed heme-negative stool.
Urine electrolytes were not consistent with a prerenal etiology of acute or on chronic renal failure, but of note, he had been getting Lasix at home.
Chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocyst in 10/99, resulted in pancreatic insufficiency and insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus with nephropathy and neuropathy:  Insulin dependent x3 years.
He had episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis with an Intensive Care Unit admission in 08/[**2154**].
Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine of 4.0.
History of bilateral nephrolithiasis, complicated by development of pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
Anemia secondary to renal failure.
History of thrombocytopenia secondary to Haldol.
History of multiple perirectal abscesses, status post multiple incision and drainage procedures.
History of ARDS in 10/99 with tracheostomy for six weeks; developed ARDS during pancreatitis episode.
History of left lower extremity DVT.
History of Clostridium difficile colitis.
History of right vocal cord paralysis.
History of diabetic foot ulcers.
Divorced with no children.
Coronary examination:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmur.
Abdominal examination:  Positive bowel sounds, nontender, distended, positive fluid wave, liver and spleen not palpable.
Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact, moves all four extremities, no asterixis noted.
Chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusions.
Left lower lobe atelectasis.
Urinalysis showed specific gravity of 1.010, large blood, negative nitrate.
Positive trace protein.
Moderate leukocytes, [**12-11**] red blood cells, and greater than 50 white blood cells, 0 epithelial cells, and no bacteria.
Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
A large simple right kidney cyst was noted.
Acute renal failure:  Patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, diabetes with nephropathy, status post recent admission for worsening renal failure, and urinary tract infection, now presents with a [**3-25**] day history of exertional dyspnea, fatigue, poor urine output consistent with fluid overload secondary to acute on chronic renal failure.
The etiology of his acute on chronic renal failure is unclear.
Initially, it was felt that the patient did not have any indication for acute hemodialysis.
Indications for hemodialysis were to include intractable dyspnea, uncontrolled uremic symptoms like nausea or encephalopathy, or hyperkalemia.
However, his respiratory status remained stable, and on hospital day #2, he reported an inability to make urine.
He continued to complain of shortness of breath, but not to the point that it limited activity.
He continued to remain alert and oriented, and without any signs of uremic encephalopathy.
The metabolic abnormalities associated with his uremia included calcium carbonate 500 mg po tid, Nephrocaps one cap po q day, Epogen 5,000 units subQ 2x/week on Tuesdays and Fridays, Amphojel, and calcitriol.
Dyspnea:  The patient was only slightly dyspneic likely to compensate for the underlying metabolic acidosis secondary to his uremia.
Initially, the plan was to diurese the patient or dialyze him if he became severely dyspneic and had chest x-ray evidence of fulminant failure.
However, the patient's respiratory status remained stable and his level of dyspnea was felt not to warrant acute intervention.
Initially, it felt that some component of his dyspnea might be due to his abdominal ascites collection.
Therefore on hospital day #2, he underwent a paracentesis with drainage of 2 liters of acidic fluid.
This resulted in some resolution of his dyspnea.
Finally, the patient was to continue his BiPAP machine that he brought from home for treatment of his obstructive-sleep apnea.
Elevated troponin:  Upon admission, the patient had an elevated troponin value.
It was felt that very possibly he had an acute coronary event a few days prior to admission leading to renal hypoperfusion, which might explain his acute renal decompensation.
An aspirin was held given patient's history of thrombocytopenia and uremia.
He was not given a beta blocker given that his clinical status was tenuous and there was a question of unstable hematocrit values.
Cardiac echocardiogram was obtained, which demonstrated a hyperdynamic ejection fraction greater than 75% and mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
Cirrhosis:  Upon admission, the patient had large volume ascites.
He had a diagnostic tap on his previous admission in [**2155-6-22**] with no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
He underwent a therapeutic paracentesis on the afternoon of [**2155-8-15**] with removal of 2 liters of acidic fluid.
Anemia:  On the day of admission, patient had a drop in hematocrit from 28 to 23.6 in 12 hours.
Per their recommendations, multiple topical ointments and moisturizing regimens were added to the patient's previous medication list.
In addition, wound consult was obtained secondary to patient's history of diabetic foot ulcers.
After initiation of this dermatological regimen, the patient experienced mild improvement in his skin rash and excoriation.
History of alcohol abuse:  Patient was placed on Ativan and CIWA scale monitoring for alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
