[**Last Name (STitle) 58577**]nted to an outside hospital for a syncopal episode and was found upon workup to have coronary artery disease and was ultimately referred for catheterization.
This revealed a right-dominant system with a 60 to 70 percent left main coronary artery stenosis as well as a 40 to 50 percent ostial right stenosis.
He also had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with no regional wall motion abnormalities and no mitral regurgitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia, asthma, injury to the right eye with loss of vision, history of osteomyelitis as a young child, hypercholesterolemia, vertigo, and arthritis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post laminectomy, status post umbilical hernia repair, status post eyelid surgery, status post sebaceous cyst removal, status post open cholecystectomy, status post appendectomy, status post right leg surgery as a child, and status post hemorrhoidectomy.
ALLERGIES:  The patient states an allergy to CODEINE which causes nausea and itching.
There is no recreational drug use.
On postoperative day two, he had complaints of an inability to sleep and nausea but had remained hemodynamically stable; although his creatinine had risen slightly from 1.1 to 1.3 on postoperative day two.
The only remaining problem that persisted for Mr. [**Known lastname 6164**] was that of lower extremity and scrotal edema which was quite pronounced for a number of days.
He did have a good response to this with a drop in his weight as well as a decrease in the peripheral edema and a decrease in his serum creatinine level.
It was their recommendation to obtain an ultrasound of the femoral veins to rule out a deep venous thrombosis.
ACE wraps were put on both of his legs, and his scrotal edema had also significantly decreased.
No murmurs noted.
His incisions were clean and dry with no erythema.
His peripheral edema had significantly decreased as had the scrotal edema, and he was fully ambulatory independently.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery    bypass graft.
