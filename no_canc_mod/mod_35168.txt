Patient and wife report that over the last several months he has progressive shortness of breath with exertion.
He denies PND or orthopnea.
He is normally very active, doing significant amounts of yard work, walking up a large [**Doctor Last Name **] on his property and does not normally have significant shortness of breath.
He denies fever/chills, weight loss and night sweats.
He does not wear oxygen at home and has never been diagnosed with lung disease.
On [**2120-5-18**] patient was drinking water and reports that it 'went down the wrong pipe' this was followed by an episode of severe coughing and shortness of breath that did not resolve.
CT showed diffuse interstitial changes thought to be secondary to rheumatoid-associated lung disease.
His echo revealed a normal EF of 55% with moderate to severe TR and moderately elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
EKG showed an rate of 60 with old RBBB and right axis deviation.
Though his symptoms did improve, repeat CT showed worsening of left lung process and patient was not able to be weaned off oxygen.
Yesterday when seen by pulm consult resident, patient reports that he is feeling fine and is without complaint.
He denies any tobacco use, chemical exposures, pets or recent travel.
He was extubated post-op but then re-intubated for hypoxia and increased work of breathing.

Apparently he initally did well after extubation but then had increased work of breathing and hypoxia.
It seems possible that he could have had flash pulmonary edema vs aspiration that caused acute decompensation requiring intubation.
- appreciate thorasics input - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX .
- check b12, folate, iron studies - trend for now - guaiac all stools .
CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.
As a result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension well.
- re-start coumadin per thorasics - as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate control w/ metoprolol for now .
PPX: Sc heparin, bowel regimen prn, ranitidine -- [**5-31**] - path c/w UIP - discussed with rheum: hold humira x2wk post vats, hold mtx indefinitely - staph from sputum sensitivities pending .
[**5-31**] - weaned steroid down to 60mg methylpred - increased ptx on AM CXR but thoracics ok with keeping on water seal - attempted to reach outpt rheum - no answer from office.
spoke with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rheum attending here rec HOLD humira x2 weeks post VATS, then may restart if no infection identified.
[**6-1**] - increased PTX, changed CT to suction from water seal - changed zosyn dosing - MIE Q2H, chest PT - NG tube placed, pulled out of position with question aspiration event, replaced .
[**6-2**]: - desat to 70s up to 70% facemask PLUS nasal canula, but subsequently weaned weaned down to 35% without NC - afib with rvr got 5mg metoprolol with good response - CT placed back to suction given inc. size of PTX -> waterseal this AM - Family mtg held, ok to reintubate, if reach point with little hope of improvement, family will likely withdraw care .
[**6-3**] - chest tube put on waterseal again in AM, but ptx worse on repeat chest film to returned to low wall suction - restarted digoxin - pulled out NGT -------- [**6-4**] -HR mainly in the 70-80s but occasional sympathetic driven spikes to 140-150. continued dig 0.125mg daily and changed PO lopressor to 5mg IV lopressor IV q4hrs -patient desats with any slight movement, for the most part on 6L NC -plan to call family regarding any need for intubation and they will likely say to not intubate at this point, still full code currently though -I/O goal even, by 7 p.m. even -changed CT to water seal, no real change in PTX, per thoracics attg patient will need pleuradesis as he will unlikely improve given stiff lungs related to ILD -MIE stopped -decreased solumedrol to 20mg IV x 1 today, with a plan to continue weaning rapidly -S+S to re-eval [**2120-6-5**] -haldol 0.5mg started tid prn anxiety ------- [**6-6**] - family meeting regarding goals of care - thoracics placed pneumo stat - repeat evening CXR with worsening PTX so placed on suction - 9 pm repeat evening CXR improved - started bactrim for PNA - d/c'ed all nonessential po meds -------------- -re-trial of pneumo-stat failed -chest tube replaced and placed to suction, plan to place to water seal in a.m. prior to discharge home with hospice.

Congestive Heart Failure 2.
Macrocytic Anemia 3.
Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with increasing shortness of breath.
Afterwards, you had trouble breathing so you were re-intubated for low oxygen levels.
You are being sent home with a chest tube to "water seal" meaning there is no significant suctioning applied to the space between your lung and chest wall but air cannot enter from the outside.
Speech and Swallow consult saw you, and recommended nectar thickened liquids.
If you have any of the following symptoms, please call your doctor: fever>101, chest pain, increased shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
