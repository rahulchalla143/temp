The patient reported that in the past 5 days, he noticed increased lethargy and generalized weakness as well as presyncope with lightheadedness and dizziness but denies any syncope.
He denies any headache, change in vision (wears glasses at baseline), or focal weakness or change in balance.
As his symptoms of lethargy and confusion persisted, his wife called 911.
In the ED, the patient was found to have pancytopenia with a Hct of 14.5, he was guaiac negative with a SBP initially 86 that then dropped to 60 with a HR in the 60s.

He was evaluated by neurology in the ED who felt his neurologic exam was stable and not indicative for acute stroke.

1.5-cm hypodense area in the right occipital lobe, which may represent subacute-to-chronic infarction.

No prior study available for comparison.
EKG on [**5-17**]: Sinus rhythm, Right bundle branch block, Left atrial abnormality, Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities -are in part primary and suggest ischemia - clinical correlation is suggested.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
EKG on [**5-18**]: Sinus rhythm, Right bundle branch block, Left atrial abnormality, Anterolateral ST-T wave abnormalities -may be in part primary and are nonspecific - clinical correlation is suggested.
Since previous tracing of same date, no significant change.
EKG on [**5-19**]: Mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion.
EEG on [**5-19**]: Abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the moderate slowing of the background in wakefulness.
This suggests a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of persistent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
Brief Hospital Course: # Pancytopenia: On admission the patient was found to be pancytopenic - Hct 14.5, WBC 2.9, ptl 89.
The initial differential included idiopathic, medication-induced aplastic anemia (nifedipine, NSAIDs), viral-induced aplastic anemia (HIV, parvo B19), myelodysplastic syndrome (?lymphoma or other malignancy), TTP (without fever, acute renal dysfunction, with mental status changes, anemia, and thromboctopenia)or DIC with elevated INR.
There was evidence of hemolysis with LDH in [**2099**] range and hapto <20, D-dimer 2600.
The peripheral smear was most notable for polychromatophilia and anisocytosis.
The obtained additional labs revealed a Vit B12 deficiency (75), Folate normal (6.2), elevated Iron (233) and Ferritin (624) and low TiBC (186).
The BM biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Vit B12 deficiency as the underlying disorder and showed no signs of leukemia.
# Hypotension On admission the pt presented with BP of 86/48.
He reported light-headnesses and dizziness but denied syncopal episodes, falls, CP or SOB.
His physical exam did not reveal signs of HF, such as increased JVD, hepatojugular reflux, ascites or peripheral edema.
His hypotension was [**Month/Year (2) 2771**] to dehydration and his BP was successfully elevated by volume resuscitation (3l of IVF and 5 Units of PRBC) and d/c of home BP-meds.
# Lethargy, confusion Pt presented with 5 days h/o worsening confusion, possible baseline dementia, to the ED.
He has a PMH for stroke in [**2093**], with no residual deficits per wife.
In the ED a CT of the head was obtained to r/o possible stroke as cause for MS changes.
It showed subacute/chronic infarcy in right occipital lobe.
Neuro evaluated the patient in the ED and felt that this was most likely consistent with chronic infarct.
Pt had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] episodes of confusion (disoriented to date, location and context; agitation) when still on the MICU and after he was transfered to the floor.
Since the CT had been negative for acute bleeding, the changes in his MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2771**] to his hypotension on presentation as well as to the Vit B12 deficiency.
A EEG was performed, following neuro recs, which showed widespread encephalopathy.
Patient is likely to have baseline dementia (atrophy seen on initial CT) and (resolving) neurologic manifestation from Vit B12 deficiency.
# EKG changes The EKG drawn in the ED showed the following abnormalities: RBBB, ST-depressions and TWI in V1-V6, which were thought to be a result of demand ischemia.
There was only little suspicion for ACS as the etiology for his hypotension, since the pt had no complaints of shortness of breath/chest pain or radiating pain.
A repeat EKG on [**5-19**] showed RBBB, no remaining ST-depressions or TWI.
# Chronic renal insufficiency Creatinine presented with Creatinine of 1.7 on admission, which was his baseline Crea according to old recs.
The chronic renal insufficiency might be due to diabetic nephropathy.
Please see your primary care physician or come to the ED if you notice any of the following symptoms: Headache, dizziness, changes in vision, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, increased weakness in legs or tendency to fall or any other reasons that are concerning you.
Test for consideration post-discharge: CBC, Reticulocyte count, Intrinsic Factor Antibody, Anti Parietal Cell Antibody with referral to GI based on results.
Consider outpatient stress test for EKG changes and slightly elevated troponin on presentation.
