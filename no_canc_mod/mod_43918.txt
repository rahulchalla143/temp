Admission Date:  [**2167-4-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2167-5-8**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old female, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and excision of a choledochal cyst on [**2167-4-29**].
ALLERGIES:  SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted as part of a workup with diabetes with acidosis, acute renal failure, and cholecystitis.
The patient is also a significantly debilitated woman who looked as if she was in poor status of caring for herself and the appearance of somebody who is failing to thrive in her cachexia and just overall general appearance and care.
She presented to the hospital and was admitted for what appeared to be a diabetes exacerbation with acidosis, and acute renal failure, and cholecystitis, and dehydration.
It was decided (according to Surgery) that the patient was presenting with cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, dehydration, poor compliance with her diabetes, but no evidence of cholangitis on initial presentation.
It was decided by Neurology for analgesia as needed.
Renal failure with a creatinine of 4; we wanted to rehydrate her with intravenous fluids.
After serial imaging and acute resuscitation from her acute renal failure and diabetes exacerbation the patient was deemed to have a choledochal cyst.
On [**4-29**], the patient underwent a hepaticojejunostomy and excision of a choledochal cyst.
She was a little bit acidotic as far as post procedure and did okay until she acutely desaturated on the floor and had mental status changes.
She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory failure and was intubated.
The patient had a complicated medical course but eventually was extubated on [**5-4**] after the metabolic acidosis was resolving.
A chest x-ray was revealing a left lower lobe pneumonia, and the patient was improving from a pulmonary perspective with aggressive pulmonary toilet.
The patient was watched very carefully from a pulmonary perspective as if she had little pulmonary reserve.
There were no signs of infection.
However, on [**5-6**], the patient appeared to have a small amount of serosanguineous drainage at the inferior portion of the wound.
The wound was packed for localized wound cellulitis.
The patient was to complete the 2-week course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
She was to continue dressing changes at the rehabilitation facility for the lower abdominal wound infection.
The patient's diabetes, which had been under much better control in the hospital setting because of compliance issues, would continue.
Choledochal cyst; status post excision.
Diabetes mellitus.
Change in mental status.
Metabolic acidosis secondary to acute renal failure which prompted intubation.
In part, the respiratory failure may have been contributed to by her left lower lobe hospital-acquired pneumonia.
