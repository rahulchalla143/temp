A head CT was negative; a chest CT showed LLL PNA vs atelectasis and A/P CT showed only gall bladder sludge.
He had serial EKGs with "STE in Anterior leads" that were considered part of his baseline.
Cardiology was consulted and performed a TTE where there were no WMA and an EF of 75%.
He never had any neck stiffness or fever.
Renal insufficiency improved to 2.3 .
He had good graft function without significant proteinuria as of [**10-8**].
Recent CVA - now on full dose ASA but does not want to take pravachol.
Family History: DM and Asthma  Physical Exam: On Admission: VS: Temp: afebrile BP: 156/73/ HR: 90-110 RR:16 O2sa: 98 GEN: Dishevelled, malodorous;Eyes closed, interactive, nonverbal, two crying spells.
Ketotic breath HEENT: anicteric, severe cataract, equally round, unreactive pupils, Dry MM, Poor dentitition, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: Tachy with RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
SKIN: Severely Dry scales, several excoriations without obvious infection over arms, legs.
Abrasions over backside covered with bandage NEURO: No obvious posturing.
2+DTR's-patellar and biceps  On Discharge: Objective:Tm:98.5 P:91-93 BP:131-142/90-94 RR:18 O2sat:98-100%RA CBG: 140/227/100/132 General: Male in no acute distress HEENT: PERRLA.
No crackles or wheezing noted Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs or gallops appreciated Abdomen: Soft, nontender and nondistended.
No expressive or receptive aphasia.
Mild stuttering of his speech which is at baseline according to sister.
Toward the end of the recording, background frequencies improved significantly, and the recording began to resemble drowsiness and sleep.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were additional bursts of generalized delta slowing, sometimes followed by the generalized faster activity.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping patterns were evident early in the recording, but drowsiness or early sleep emerged toward the end.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the substantial suppression of the background with slower frequencies throughout and occasional bursts of generalized slowing.
These findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy, with medications among the most common causes.
Metabolic disturbances and infection are other possibilities.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
Later in the record, the background included faster frequencies and suggested the presence of drowsiness or early sleep.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
No acute infarction.
Dystrophic right globe- correlate clinically.
EEG ([**2197-12-3**]): No pushbutton for seizure symptoms occurred.
The  recording, however, continues to show frequent bursts of frontal central synchronous rhythmic theta and occasional delta frequency activity suggesting a projected abnormality although there are some independent- appearing runs over the right central region.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 46 year old male with IDDM, s/p DD Renal Tx ([**2178**]), s/p R MCA CVA [**12/2196**] (L weakness), Blindness, presenting from [**Hospital1 3597**] MICU for further management of DKA, [**Last Name (un) **], and minimal responsiveness after being found down by family.
Altered Mental Status - The patient's mental status on admission was minimally responsive but cooperating with commands; he did not speak or open his eyes.
The differential included tacrolimus toxicity, meningitis, cerebrovascular accident, seizures or psychotic disorder.
Empiric antiobiotics were started on admission (Vancomycin, ceftriaxone) but were discontinued when outside hospital records showed no source of infection.
CT/MRI head negative for acute intracranial process.
Psychology did not think he has selective mutism.
Diabetic ketoacidosis - Unclear precipitant.
Non-adherence was considered; however, we also were concerned with underlying infection.
He was initially on an insulin drip while in the unit, as well as on the floor due to poor glucose control with sliding scale insulin.
[**Last Name (un) **] - not likely tacrolimus toxicity.
Elevated cardiac enzymes.
He has an elevated CK to 1011 with troponin up to 0.10 here, likely due to being found down on the floor.
Hyperbilirubinemia - Peaked at 5.1, now down to 2.4 on admission here which is mostly indirect.
Unclear source with schistocytes on peripheral smear but haptoglobin and LDH negative.
MRI and CT head did not show new cerebrovascular accident.
Hyperlipidemia - Patient is not on a statin.
Diabetic ketoacidosis .
Type I diabetes mellitus 2. s/p kidney transplant in [**2178**]   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your records from outside hospital did not show infection in your brain, blood or urine.
