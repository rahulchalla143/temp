Admission Date:  [**2160-1-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-1-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-3-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation for mechanical ventilation Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] is a 82 yo [**Known lastname 8230**]-speaking man with a history of COPD, ESRD on HD w/ some residual urine production, asthma/COPD, and chronic diastolic CHF (EF 60% in [**12-4**]) with multiple recent admissions for PNA and CHF exacerbations, who presented from rehab with respiratory distress.
Of note, he was recently admitted from [**Date range (3) 82787**] for acute dyspnea that improved with lasix and dialysis.
He was also admitted from [**Date range (1) 19970**] for dyspnea thought to be [**1-29**] volume overload, and from [**Date range (1) 82788**] for SOB in the setting of fluid overload and missing HD.
On prior admissions, there have been extensive discussions regarding the optimal setting for the patient and whether he would benefit from an LTAC facility.
The patient was subsequently intubated given his failure to improve and altered mental status.
Patient was thought to have a COPD exacerbation given extensive wheezing and received methlprednisolone.
Past Medical History: * ESRD on HD (T/Th/Sat schedule) * Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 * Hypertension * Diastolic CHF: Last ECHO [**2159-12-6**] showed LVEF>55%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and  regional biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Dilated aortic sinus.
* Hypercholesterolemia * Asthma * ?COPD  Social History: Lives with caretaker (mainly [**Name (NI) 8230**] speaking only) who takes care of him.
Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Mild wheezes on anterior exam CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Withdraws to pain .
No JVD/LAD appreciated.
Lungs: Mild expiratory wheeze anteriorly, bilaterally.
?Decreased breath sounds in left lower lobe.
No dullness to percussion appreciated.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused; +DP/PT pulses but with 1+ pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities.
No cyanosis, ecchymosis.
Studies: CXR ([**2160-1-23**]): The cardiomediastinal silhouette is currently more clearly identified consistent with mild cardiac enlargement.
Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate.
There is bilateral atelectasis, involving left lower lobe and most likely right lower lobe at least partially.
Currently, there is no evidence of pulmonary edema, just minimal vascular engorgement.
CXR ([**1-21**]): Moderate left pleural effusion has worsened.
Left lower lobe remains consolidated or collapsed.
Moderate right pleural effusion increased.
No pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
There is a moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
There is left lower lobe atelectasis.
There is mild atelectasis at the right lung base with a small right pleural effusion.
Renal Ultrasound with Dopplers: 1.
Small bilateral renal cysts.
Doppler examination could not be performed as the patient was unable to hold his breath for the examination.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Focal hypodensities consistent with old lacunar infarcts in the right cerebellum and left basal ganglia.
Chronic small vessel ischemic change.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old male with a history of dCHF, COPD, ESRD on HD and multiple recent admissions (4 at [**Hospital1 18**] since mid-[**11-26**] at [**Hospital6 **]) for pneumonia and pulmonary edema, who presents from homw with hypoxia.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation (wheezy on exam initially), volume overload (noncompliance with HD and medications), acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation (non-compliance with low-sodium diet and has BNP 21,224 with L pleural effusion), pneumonia +/- aspiration (elevated WBC and suggestion of consolidation of LLL on early CXR).
Given multiple recent hospitalizations, patient was felt at high risk of health care acquired pneumonia and initially treated with Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levofloxacin.
There was also lower suspicion for COPD exacerbation given patient's intermittent wheeziness so his steroids were also discontinued.
Of note, patient had received high dose IV steroids in the MICU/ED given concern for COPD exacerbation initially.
Cardiac enzymes were negative (baseline slightly elevated troponin given renal disease) for concern of myocardial ischemia causing CHF exacerbation.
He was also kept on Lasix 120mg daily on nonhemodialysis days, with some urine diuresis.
He was saturating ~93% on room air by time of discharge - Continue nebulizers as needed for symptomatic relief.
- Supplement oxygen as needed - Ensure aggressive hemodialysis (patient's respiratory status very sensitive to volume overload) - Continue Lasix 120mg on NON-HEMODIALYSIS DAYS (Mon, Wed, [**First Name3 (LF) **], Sun) - Patient requires a very strict low sodium (<2 grams), renal, diabetic diet .
# Delirium: Patient has a history of sundowning, especially [**1-30**] days after being in an unfamiliar environment.
Patient has significant dementia at baseline, with difficulty remembering things hour by hour.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], is aware of patient and his complicated psychosocial situation.
DM2:  Patient was continued on his home dose of NPH 8 units with breakfast, with moderate blood sugar control.
- Increased Labetalol from 600 to 800mg three times daily - Continue Olmesartan and increase if necessary  Medications on Admission: MEDICATIONS upon d/c on [**1-18**]: Famotidine 20 mg PO Q24H Fluticasone-Salmeterol 250-50 mcg/Dose [**Hospital1 **] B Complex-Vitamin C-Folic Acid 1 mg Capsule PO DAILY Labetalol 600 mg PO TID Simvastatin 20 mg PO DAILY Amlodipine 10 mg PO DAILY Sevelamer HCl 400 mg PO TID W/MEALS Bisacodyl 10 mg PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg PO twice a day as needed for constipation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1643**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Respiratory distress likely secondary to acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation and volume overload .
Secondary: End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, Type 2 Diabetes, hypertension, dementia, asthma/COPD   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent, but poor short term memory (dementia)  Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: -You were admitted with sudden, severe shortness of breath.
You responded well to hemodialysis and nebulizers, as well as some steroids and antibiotics.
It was felt that you likely became volume overloaded at home.
We made the following changes to your medications during this admission: --> START Omeprazole 20mg daily instead of Famotidine 20mg daily  --> INCREASE Sevelamer 400mg to 1600mg three times daily --> INCREASE Labetalol 600mg to 800mg three times daily --> START Zydis 5mg daily as needed for agitation --> RESUME Nephrocaps daily --> RESUME home Flovent 1 puff twice daily --> RESUME home Olmesartan 40mg daily --> RESUME Albuterol/Ipratropium nebulizers every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath, wheeze .
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
