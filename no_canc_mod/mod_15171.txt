There were no complications until the day before delivery when the mother developed spontaneous rupture of membranes and onset of labor.
She emerged with good cry and respiratory effort and was transferred to the NICU where moderate retractions and increased requirement for oxygen was noted, and the baby was started on CPAP.
Lungs were clear and equal with moderate retractions noted on CPAP.
She had a regular, rate and rhythm with a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border with fair perfusion.
Abdomen was soft with no organomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Respiratory:  She had initial respiratory distress on was initially placed on CPAP.
She was intubated on the first day of life for progressive respiratory distress and was given a dose of Surfactant.
She has not shown any evidence of apnea of prematurity and has not been on Caffeine.
Cardiovascular:  The baby has not had any blood pressure issues throughout her admission; however, on admission, she was noted to have a prominent murmur.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed a small to moderate PDA.
After the first course of Indomethacin, she continued to have an audible murmur and was started on a second course of Indomethacin which was completed on [**1-30**].
At that time, the murmur was still persistent, but a repeat echocardiogram performed showed no patent ductus arteriosus artery, but by report of the cardiologist, did show evidence of peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
Subsequently, the murmur has persisted; however, the baby continues to do well in room air without tachypnea or bounding pulses.
We suspect that the murmur is consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
Subsequently, she was advanced rapidly on enteral feeds with occasional problems with spitting.
Subsequently, the baby has not had any other infectious disease issues.
An ophthalmology exam was performed on [**2-8**] which showed immature retinal vasculatures in zone 3 bilaterally.
