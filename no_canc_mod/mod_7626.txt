Admission Date:  [**2131-7-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-7-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-7-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: Acute onset SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Intubation -Abdominal aorta & visceral artery imaging, selective renal angiography-->PTA/Stent x1 celiac artery, PTA/stent x1 Right Renal artery.
History of Present Illness: 57 M c CAD s/p CABG, PCI, PVD s/p atherectomy to R SFA, dm2, bilateral RAS, copd p/w sudden onset SOB to OSH.
The patient developed acute respiratory distress rather suddenly while on a car trip with his family.
There were non-specific small ST elevations II, III, aVF that resolved with improved bp control.
Past Medical History:  - CAD - RCA stenting [**2123**].
Repeat cath in [**4-18**] showed acute stent thrombus in SVG-D1; restented.
Cath [**4-20**]: 90% distal RCA tx c [**Month/Year (2) **], 50% L main, severe LAD c diffuse mid and proximal disease but filling distally from LIMA, diffuse moderate LCX c proximal OM occlusion.
90% stenosis in the distal stent just before the bifurcation.
- PVD - [**1-20**] - directional atherectomy to R SFA.
MRI/MRA [**4-21**] showing mild-moderate stenosis of celiac artery.
Stenosis ostium L renal artery, atherosclerotic disease of infrarenal abdominal aorta + b/l common iliacs.
- Type II DM on insulin; neuropathy - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - COPD - GERD - hx Lyme disease - hx Pericarditis [**2099**] - b/l knee surgery   Social History: SH: married, 1 ppd tobacco * 40 years, denies ETOH, truck driver on disability   Family History: FH: father with CVA at 66, mother with DM, ESRD, sister with DM    Physical Exam: VS:  Temp: 100.4    BP: 119/73    HR: 95  RR: 19   O2sat: 99 RA general: intubated, sedated HEENT: PERLLA, no jvd lungs: clear anteriorly, no wheezes.
heart: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g abdomen: nd, +b/s, soft, nt/nd extremities: no cyanosis, clubbing or edema   Pertinent Results: ECHO Study Date of [**2131-7-3**] Ejection Fraction: 35% to 40% (nl >=55%) Conclusions:  The study is suboptimal due to inability to properly position the patient.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderatel global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 M c CAD s/p CABG, PCI, PVD s/p atherectomy to R SFA, DM2, Renal Artery Stenosis, COPD p/w sudden-onset SOB to OSH.
## Resp failure: Pt intubated upon admission for hypoxic respiratory failure.
His acute respiratory decompensation was due to CHF exacerbation in the setting of hypertensive urgency with renal artery stenosis.
PE was considered as a possible cause of the acute respiratory decompensation given the history; however, the pt's rapid improvement with diuresis argued against this.
COPD & bronchitis may have contributed to pt's respiratory failure as well.
There was no evidence of PNA on CXR, though pt initially febrile with leukocytosis.
Pt reported having a cough for one week prior to this event (his whole family has similiar sx's).
We treated him for a presumed bronchitis with 5 days of azithromycin.
## Cardiac: #Ischemia: significant CAD history.
Pt did not have ACS, despite subtle ST elevations.
#Pump: EF 35-40%, w/ slight decrease in LV systolic funx since last echo, BNP 1870, CXR showed CHF.
He was given two diuretics because of his apparent tendency to become volume overloaded.
Initiation of an ACEi was considered, particularly given the pt's h/o CHF & diabetes; however, given the number of changes made to the pt's anti-hypertensive regimen prior to discharge we refrained from this.
#Valves: no know dz #Rhythm: No abnormalities .
## Vascular Dz: The pt had been previously found to have renal artery stenosis (although prior to admission it was thought to be bilateral).
He also described a history of weight loss and poor appetite, which was consistent with mesenteric ischemia.
Upon angiography of the aorta, the viscera, and the renal arteries, the pt was found to have only uni-lateral RAS (90%) & celiac artery stenosis (70%).
These lesions were stented with good residuals & flow post-stent placement.
## ARF: Pt was in renal failure on admission with Cr=1.7.
Hence, it was thought that his acute renal failure was pre-renal, resulting from poor forward flow & poor perfusion in the setting of CHF exacerbation.
## COPD: no PFTs available.
No steroids were given, as it was thought that his copd was playing a major role in his picture.
## Hct drop: Pt's initial HCT of 49 was thought to be falsely elevated due to hemoconcentration.
As his volume status improved, his HCT acutely dropped to 32.
There was no evidence of bleeding & he was asymptomatic.
Wife now concerned their rented home is poorly accessible for pt as there are many stairs to enter, pt unable to manage as he gets very SOB.
SW providing support to wife, offered resources re: seach tools for accessible housing.
