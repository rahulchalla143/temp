Radiology- [**8-9**] Echo: hyperdynamic w/LVEF 75%, 3+ TR [**8-8**] CT Head: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**8-8**] CT head ([**Location (un) 620**]): no acute injury, old L frontal infarct [**8-8**] CT c-spine ([**Location (un) 620**]): rotary subluxation of C1 on C2, no definitive acute fx.
[**8-8**]: Shoulder films: Left eighth and ninth rib fractures.
[**8-7**] TL-spine: mild compression deformities of L1 and L3.Disc space narrowing and associated discogenic endplate changes are noted at L4/5 and L5/S1 .
No prior studies are available for comparison.
There is significant rotation due to scoliosis.
There is a small right effusion.
No pneumothorax.
-PELVIS, AP VIEW: No prior studies available.
There is no evidence of fracture, dislocation, bony destruction.
EKG [**8-7**]-Sinus rhythm and frequent atrial ectopy.
However, the tracing of [**2158-5-18**] records evidence for prior inferior wall myocardial infarction.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2160-8-8**] 6:29 PM 1) No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2) Large encephalomalacia from chronic left frontal infarct.
3) No CT evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction, though if clinical suspicion remains high, MRI is far more sensitive to assess.
There is atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and major branches.
There is coronary artery calcification.
There is no evidence for acute aortic injury.
The pulmonary arteries opacify, but there are multiple large filling defects bilaterally consistent with pulmonary emboli.
Note is made of a large hiatal hernia.
Small mediastinal nodes are present, but there is no pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar adenopathy.
Evaluation of the lung windows is limited secondary to respiratory motion, but there is right apical scarring and calcified plaque formation.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis (left greater than right).
The osseous structures are remarkable for degenerative disease.
Multiple left-sided posterior rib fractures are present.
There is a compression deformity of the lower thoracic spine.
There is anterior fusion of the thoracic vertebrae.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli with moderate/significant clot burden.
Left-sided posterior rib fractures.
Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
Cardiomegaly, coronary artery calcification and atherosclerotic aortic calcification, large hiatal hernia, and degenerative disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo woman with dementia, HTN, LVH, occluded left ICA, old left frontal infarct who was initially admitted to the TSICU after a fall.
Shortly before discharge, she was found to be C. diff positive, explaining her elevated WBC.
# Dyspnea/CHF: Thought to be due to submassive PE in addition to CHF component.
IVC in place as patient is unable to be anticoagulated given history of GI bleed and guiaic positive stool.
initially had elevated Troponin (.28) thought to be secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of anemia and tachycardia.
was thought to be a high risk for cath and is DNR/DNI.
was maintained on Metoprolol, Moexipril ASA, Atorvastatin and pain control.
# CHF: Echo showed hyperdynamic LV with EF at 75%, symmetric LVH likely [**12-27**] hypertension and minimal AS.
UA +, consider UTI as cause of mental status change in this elderly  patient.
#C. diff Colitis: Likely cause of leukocytosis (18.0 on discharge).
# HTN: Labile SBP, at times elevated to 200.
# Cerebral Ischemia: Chronic disease with known cerebral pathology.
# Hyponatremia: Steadily improved and thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting of CHF.
Gastrointestinal Bleed   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: 1.
Call your doctor or go to the ER for any of the following: chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers/chills, bleeding from your rectum or vomiting blood or any other concerning symptoms                               [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 734**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 735**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 799**]
