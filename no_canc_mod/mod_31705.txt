Bilateral pulmonary embolism in right main pulmonary artery, right upper lobe and right lower lobe segmental and subsegmental arteries, subsegmental left upper lobe arteries, and segmental and subsegmental left lower lobe arteries.
Probable pulmonary hypertension, chronicity indeterminate.
Possible right ventricular strain.
Aortic valvular calcification of unknown hemodynamic significance.
Atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Kyphosis and degenerative changes of the right shoulder.
TTE [**10-4**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 year old female with a past medical history of addison's, PE [**2127**], HTN, mild AS s/p recent femur fx and ORIF p/w fevers, hypotension, PE and elevated troponin concerning for PE vs sepsis.
# Hypotension / Sepsis / Pulmonary Embolism: The pt arrived with SBP 60-70's.
As the patient was hypoxic on arrival and has a history of PE, CTA was performed and revealed large bilateral PE, concerning for cardiogenic shock also contributing to hypotension.
Echo showed mild RV dilation, but only mild systolic dysfunction, and improved pulmonary htn compared to last echo.
EKG did not show ischemic changes, but trop of 0.2 and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier **] suggest strain.
Per cardiology IVF were stopped to avoid volume overload and maintain a CVP 10-12.
Patient started on Heparin gtt for anticoagulation for PE with bridge to Coumadin.
Since this was a rapid rise, her INR as well as any signs of bleeding should be monitored closely at rehab since INR will likely be supratherapeutic.
She will need 48 hours of therpeutic INR and then Lovenox may be discontinued.
Also, antibiotics were stopped since concern for infection was low but threshold for treating hospital acquired pneumonia if she spiked a fever or developed cough would be low.
#) Arrhythmia- Patient had narrow QRS tachycardia in MICU which responded to metoprolol.
Differential included AVRT, AVNRT, atrial tachycardia.
?d on admission for hypotension, so arrhythmia may have been the result.
Stable on day of discharge  #) Femur fx: Oxycodone was held initially due to concern for mental status.
Since she did not complain of pain or require pain medication during stay she was discharged without oxycodone and on tylenol prn.
# Depression: qhs nortriptylline was initially held for drowsiness, restarted on discharge, pt A+O x 3.
#) Code: Full  On day of discharge pt was alert and oriented, no pain at rest, all vital signs stable, breathing comfortable on room air with 02 sat 96%.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every [**5-15**] hours as needed for fever or pain.

Osteoporosis 5. s/p R hip fracture and ORIF [**2140-9-26**] 6. s/p bilateral total knee replacements 7. h/o PE post-operatively in [**2127**]   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, shortness of breath improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure and found to have low oxygen levels and blood clots in your lungs.
We were initially concerned you had pneumonia because you had a fever so started you on antibiotics but there was no evidence of pneumonia on your CAT scan so we stopped your antibiotics on [**10-7**].
Please return to the ER or call your primary care doctor if you develop shortness of breath, chest pain, fever>100.4, chills or any other concerning symptoms.
