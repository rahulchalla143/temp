History of Present Illness: 47 yo M with a history of HIV (last CD4 ([**1-1**]) 81, VL 48) who restarted HAART 3 weeks ago who presented to the ED from [**Hospital 18620**] clinic with a complaint of worsening vision loss.
His symptoms started in mid-[**Month (only) 205**], when he suddenly developed some mild pain at the back of his left eye.
These symptoms prompted him to present to his PCP and ophthalmologist, and he was prescribed PredForte drops Q1 h and scopolamine drops [**Hospital1 **], which initially provided relief of the symptoms.
However, in [**Month (only) 216**], he developed similar symptoms in his right eye (pain, central vision loss, blurry vision) and he saw his ophthamologist again.
During the week prior to admission, he started to experience exacerbation of his visual changes, and he may not have been compliant with using the eye drops.
He was seen by ophthalmology on the day prior to admission, and was diagnosed with bilateral panuveitis.
But possibly acquired the infection in [**2108**].
Allergies: penicillin causes itchy hives and rash (received PCN once as child and once in 20s-30s), vancomycin (red man syndrome), acyclovir (itchiness), seasonal allergies  Social History: 10 pack-year smoking history, quit 15 years ago.

CXR ([**9-23**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo male with HIV and recently diagnosed bilateral panuveitis who presents from ophthalmology clinic with worsening vision loss.
#Vision Loss:  The patient was admitted with bilateral vision loss, central scotoma, and a recent exposure to syphilis.
He was afebrile during the admission without an elevated WBC.
He was initially empirically started on Vancomycin 1 gm IV q12hr for possible Staph uveitis and Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV q8hr for possible CMV/HSV infection.
The patient developed diffuse urticaria and rash after receiving Vancomycin, thought to be red man syndrome.
His symptoms improved with premedication with Diphenhydramine prn and Ranitidine [**Hospital1 **].
Head CT showed no evidence of intracranial mass or hemorrhage.
LP showed opening pressure of 8, elevated WBC, increased protein, decreased glucose.
CSF showed no bacteria, no virus isolated so far, no fungus, and no cryptococcal antigen.
The patient was thought to have neuro-ocular syphilis and was started on Penicillin G 4,000,000 Units IV q4 hours after PCN desensitization in the MICU.
Acyclovir was discontinued on hospital day 5 when CSF viral culture showed no virus isolated so far.
- Other Positive Blood Tests: VZV IgG, CMV IgG - Other Negative Blood Tests:  VZV Ab IgM, CMV IgM, Toxoplasma IgG/IgM, Lyme Disease, Blood/Fungal Culture, Blood/AFB Culture, ACE, RF <3, PPD negative - Pending Blood Tests: Blood Cx x2 NGTD, HLA-B27 - Pending CSF Tests: AFB Cx, VDRL, Treponema Antibody .
#Penicillin allergy: The patient reported a history of non-anaphylactic allergy to PCN, and had developed hives and a rash after receiving it once as a child and once in his 20s-30s.
The patient's vision loss was due to neurosyphilis, and PCN-G IV is the recommended treatment.
