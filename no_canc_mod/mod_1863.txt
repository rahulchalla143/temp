It was unclear whether this was a demand event vs. an acute plaque rupture coronary syndrome.
Echo showed mild focal hypertrophy of the basal septum with mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Patient was started on medical therapy for CAD with aspirin, beta blocker, low dose ACEI, and high dose statin.
# COPD: Echo showed evidence of pulmonary hypertension and RV dilation with systolic dysfunction as well as severe TR likely [**2-13**] COPD.
Her volume was managed with prn Lasix based on symptoms of dyspnea and orthopnea.
# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Given rhythm abnormality and history of TIA patient was started on aspirin and warfarn after discussion with family based on high CHADS2 score.
