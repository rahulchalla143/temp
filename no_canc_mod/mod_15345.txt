Admission Date:  [**2132-3-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2132-3-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2074-9-4**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2131-2-10**], hypertension, diabetes mellitus, presenting with lightheadedness and fatigue, status post calcium channel blocker overdose at home.
He presented to the Emergency Department where he was found to be in a wide complex rhythm and hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 60s.
He was found to be in acute renal failure with creatinine up to 2.5 and hyperkalemic with a potassium of 6.5.
He was given Kayexalate, insulin, calcium and glucose for his hyperkalemia.
The patient denied at the time any chest pain or shortness of breath.
He did not have nausea or vomiting.
The patient does have a history of a suicide attempt in [**2123**], but denied any suicidal ideation currently.
The patient also complains on review of systems of decreased urinary stream times three years.
He denies any bright red blood per rectum or melena and no fevers or chills.
He has had a history of recent microscopic hematuria with a recent renal ultrasound two weeks ago.
He does not complain of any dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2131-2-10**], in the setting of sepsis and aspiration pneumonia, history of left bundle branch block and prolonged PR interval, transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2131-2-10**], with an ejection fraction of 45% and inferior and anterior hypokinesis.
Diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, he was alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Serum toxicology was positive for tricyclic antidepressants.
Urine toxicology positive for Cocaine.
Normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation.
No ST-T changes.
Chest x-ray did not show any focal infiltrates with prominent pulmonary vasculature.
Cardiovascular - The patient presented with hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 60s, likely secondary to a calcium channel blocker overdose, taking twice the dose that he usually takes at home.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient also presented with a wide complex rhythm seen on telemetry in the Emergency Department.
This was likely secondary to his hyperkalemia as well as overdose of calcium channel blockers.
Repeat electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a narrow complex and normal intervals.
On admission, the patient ruled out for myocardial ischemia by negative cardiac enzymes times three.
The day after he was transferred to the floor from the Intensive Care Unit he developed much nausea and vomiting, probably secondary to Lopressor.
Given his previous history of myocardial infarction in the setting of demand ischemia, and as the patient has a baseline tachycardia, he was again placed on telemetry which did not show any events and again ruled out for ischemia by negative cardiac enzymes times three.
Acute renal failure - The patient presented with a creatinine of 2.3.
This was thought to be secondary to his long-standing diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension.
The patient also has a history for three years of benign prostatic hypertrophy with a recent renal ultrasound two weeks ago which did not show any hydronephrosis, benign prostatic hypertrophy with moderate postvoid residual.
He will follow-up with further workup of his microscopic hematuria next week at the VA with a cystoscopy.
His urinary sediment was checked and did not show any evidence of acute tubular necrosis.
The pathology resident was contact[**Name (NI) **] as to false positive urine toxicologies and his specimen will be sent to [**Company 5620**] for confirmation.
Psychiatry - Psychiatry was consulted to evaluate whether this calcium channel blocker overdose was secondary to a suicide attempt although the patient denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation.
The patient was evaluated by psychiatry and it was thought that this episode was not consistent with a suicide attempt.
Diabetes mellitus - The patient was maintained on his NPH regimen at 50 units twice a day as well as sliding scale insulin four times a day.
