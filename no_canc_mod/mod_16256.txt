Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities.
Findings raise consideration of possible drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect.
ECG Study Date of [**2103-5-15**]  1:59:52 PM Probable sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay and marked left atrial abnormality but low amplitude atrial wave forms make assessment difficult.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities.
Findings raise consideration of possible drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect.
Since the previous tracing of the same date no significant change.
ECG Study Date of [**2103-5-15**]  2:03:00 PM Probable sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay and left atrial abnormality but low amplitude atrial wave forms make assessment difficult.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities.
Right precordial lead U waves appear prominent but are difficult to assess.
Findings raise consideration of possible drug/electrolyte/metabolic effect.
There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, coursing below the diaphragm with tip in the expected location of the stomach.
There is increased opacification at the right lung base.
Bibasilar opacities are seen, new since the prior study, which may be due to infection and/or aspiration.
Trace blunting of the right costophrenic angle is seen and a trace effusion is not excluded.
Multiple featureless dilated loops of bowel are partially imaged in the upper abdomen.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2103-5-15**] 2:19 PM Patient has chronically gaseous dilated loops of bowel measuring  up to 13 cm.
However, loops of bowel appear more featureless and with overall increased distention as compared to the prior study.
Interval decrease in the degree of gaseous distention of the large bowel with persistent 8 cm distention of the cecum.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2103-5-16**] 10:33 AM Minimal interval increase in the degree of cecal dilatation  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-5-17**] 4:16 AM FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased.
There is a newly appeared left pleural effusion.
The left lung base shows signs of atelectasis.
A pre-existing right pleural effusion has also slightly increased in extent.
No opacities suggesting pneumonia.
AP CHEST, 6:40 P.M. [**5-17**] AP chest compared to [**5-15**] and 12: Greater opacification at the base of the left lung is largely to moderate pleural effusion unchanged since 4:46 a.m.
There is now greater heterogeneous opacification at the base of the right lung which could be aspiration, as well as a small right pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2103-5-17**] 6:28 PM AP chest compared to [**5-15**] and 12:  Greater opacification at the base of the left lung is largely to moderate pleural effusion unchanged since 4:46 a.m.
There is now greater heterogeneous opacification at the base of the right lung which could be aspiration, as well as a small right pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is cardiomegaly, with bibasilar effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
ompared with [**2103-5-17**] at 18:40 p.m., the NG tube has been retracted, the right-sided effusion is slightly more prominent, and the upper zone redistribution may also be slightly worse.
There is small-to-moderate bilateral effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Upper zone redistribution, consistent with mild CHF.
There is small-to-moderate bilateral effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Upper zone redistribution, consistent with mild CHF.
Brief Hospital Course: 89yoF was admitted with past medical history of chronic abdominal distention, CVA, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, presents with worsening abdominal distention, acute mental status change, and worsening fatigue.
Presentation was concerning for volvulus vs. Ogilivie's (colonic pseudo-obstruction).
Abdominal xray upon admission suggested Ogilivie's, but could not rule out volvulus, and demonstrated worsening distention relative to previous studies.
She has had no further complaints of distention.
Upon transfer to the medical service, patient had a clamped nasogastric tube.
The plan had been to use the NGT tube for feeding, given concern for aspiration.
#Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate/response: Patient has a history of Afib w/RVR.
While in the intensive care unit, post decompression, patient was in sinus rhythm with good rate control; this was achieved with her home regimen of PO diltiazem 30mg qid.
She did have an occasional run of atrial fibrillation with heart rates reaching 140-150; these episodes resolved within minutes without intervention.
Upon transfer to the medical service, patient had a run of atrial fibrillation that did not resolve as quickly as the previous episodes, again with rates in the 140's to 150's.
Diltiazem was discontinued when patient was transitioned to comfort measures only as she could not tolearte po's or take pills.
She had been noted to have copious secretions in her upper airways; she had previously resisted having these secretions suctioned.
She had no further decline in oxygen saturation below 90%.
#Diabetes: Patient had a single episode of hypoglycemia (finger stick found to be: 74) found on routine blood sugar monitoring.
