In addition, it was also desired to provide a permanent stoma for the patient because of deteriorating mental status, numerous occasions where he has self-decannulated.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated on postoperative day number one with an episode of marked hypotension reportedly with systolic pressures down into the 50s.
Ultimately, this was felt to be secondary to benzodiazepines and narcotics which he was receiving per the ICU team.
These were subsequently discontinued and the patient did not have any further episodes of hypotension.
Trach care was minimally required predominantly for suctioning as well as care of any drying secretions on the edge of his trach.
