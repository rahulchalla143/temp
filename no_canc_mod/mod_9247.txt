Hepatitis C and alcohol cirrhosis.
Bipolar disease.
The patient underwent a CAT scan that demonstrated a 4 x 5 x 4.7 cm collection consistent with a large biloma.
The patient had an MRCP that showed that his left duct communicated with a large biloma at the confluence.
This was consistent with hepatic artery thrombosis and bile duct necrosis.
On the 25, the patient was admitted, had some depression of his mental status and was admitted to the ICU for monitoring.
They showed a large biloma with question of infarction of the liver, and small pleural effusions.
The patient's biliary cultures grew out gram-negative Staph.
The patient was relisted for liver transplant patient with a diagnosis of hepatic artery thrombosis.
The patient had significant lower extremity swelling, and had an IVC gram that showed a stenosis that was angioplastied on the [**10-8**].
The patient had full investigations including tube cholangiograms which were normal, CT scanning with IV contrast which demonstrated a small wasting of the portal vein with good flow through the portal vein, and a small residual stenosis of IVC with good flow in the IVC.
The patient had an IVC gram that showed no gradient across the IVC stenosis.
The patient had a mesenteric A gram that demonstrated the hepatic-splenic artery anastomosis to be intact with good flow and perfusion of the left and right hepatic arteries without evidence of stenosis.
The patient had a liver biopsy that was consistent with some ischemic changes of preservation injury, without evidence of rejection.
With his increasing bilirubin, the patient required reintubation for decreased mental status and inability to clear his respiratory secretions.
The patient had a repeat CT scan done on the [**9-27**] which showed a small collection in the lesser sac for which he had a percutaneous drain placed.
This percutaneous drain fluid was consistent with a small pancreatic fistula.

Right-sided nephrolithiasis.
The patient has a biliary T-tube in place that is capped.
