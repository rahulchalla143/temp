Admission Date:  [**2177-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-2-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-1-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfasalazine / Nsaids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 30258**] is an 80yo woman with pmh significant for chronic systolic congestive heart failure, LVEF 20%, presenting to ED from nursing home after becoming acutely short of breath in the morning of admission.
BNP was 26,000, CXR showed bilateral infiltrates.
Attempts were made to wean her form Bipap to NRB and venti mask, and were unsuccessful secondary to O2 desaturation and tachypnea.
The patient has had multiple CHF exacerbations recently, which have all been handled at [**Hospital **] rehab.
Per the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been decompensating somewhat with diminished PO intake.
The patient had an [**Name10 (NameIs) 10718**] of shortness of breath at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2-7**] which reoslved with lasix 90mg IV and morphine.
[**Name (NI) **] has expressive aphasia.
Also notable for absence of fever, chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: HTN DM type 2 insulin-dependent PVD (s/p bypass) CAD (s/p MI in [**9-/2175**]) h/o stroke (in [**9-/2175**] w/ residual complete R sided hemiparesis,  dysphagia, expressive aphasia) CHF (LVEF 20-25%) Depression Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor found on CT [**8-6**] Parkinson's disease  Social History: Nursing home resident ([**Hospital 100**] Rehab).
Puree/nectar liquid diet.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: crackles at bases b/l.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with inferior, anteroseptal and apical akinesis/severe hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR ([**2177-2-11**]) IMPRESSION: Regression of pulmonary vascular congestion during the last one day interval.
Sizable left-sided pleural effusion persists.
No evidence of pneumothorax or new localized infiltrates.
CXR ([**2177-2-13**]) IMPRESSION: Interval development of mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion, and slight interval decrease in moderate-to-severe left pleural effusion.
Urine Cx [**2177-2-13**] - no growth   Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms [**Known lastname 30258**] is an 80 year-old woman with chronic systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with shortness of breath.
# Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: History and presentation consistent with CHF exacerbation - LVEF 20%, BNP 26,000 on admission, lung exam with crackles, CXR w left pleural effusion/congestion.
Unclear etiology of CHF exacerbation, possibly from upper respiratory infection vs uncontrolled hypertension (a few SBPs in 140s-150s).
# Shortness of breath: Pt required BiPAP on admission, transitioned to Venti mask within hours.
# Pneumonia:  After diuresis, patient developed worsening productive cough and fevers.
CXR notable for likely right lower lobe infiltrate.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Patient had a brief [**Month/Year (2) 10718**] of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate that was controlled with beta blocker and returned to sinus after 4 hours.
The decision was made not to anticoagulate with warfarin given that this was likely precipitated by her acute illness and she was already on Plavix and full-dose aspirin.
# CAD: History of MI in [**2175**].
# Peripheral Vascular Disease: S/p bypass.
# CVA: Patient with right-sided hemiparesis, right facial droop, expressive aphasia.
Continued aspirations and fall precautions, as well as supportive measures.
# Parkinson's disease: Continued carbidopa levodopa TID.
# Depression: continued sertraline and bupropion.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed: hold for loose stool.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every eight (8) hours as needed for fever or pain: max dose 4000mg per day.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation Pneumonia Acute renal failure .
coronary artery disease hypertension Parkinson's disease   Discharge Condition: hemodynamically stable, satting in mid-90s on 2L O2 by NC, chronic aphasia with right-sided hemiparesis   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.
It was caused by exacerbation of your chronic congestive heart failure in the setting of a respiratory infection.
We changed your medications as follows: 1. started HCTZ 12.5mg daily for diuresis 30 minutes before your lasix 2. changed losartan 50mg to twice daily 3. changed furosemide 80mg by mouth to twice daily (the rehab may reduce this dose if you have too much urine output) 4. continue levofloxacin 750mg every other day through [**2-19**] for your pneumonia .
If you have chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, or other concerning symptoms please seek medical attention.
