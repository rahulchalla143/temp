Patient was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 3105**] in [**Month (only) 958**] for altered mental status and discharged to rehab on [**2163-5-4**].
During this hospitalization, he was in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure s/p intubation/extubation, acute systolic CHF exacerbation and required pressors for hypotension.
A TTE done at that time showed an EF of 10% with akinetic motion of the anteroseptal wall and markedly hypokinetic motion of inferior wall of the LV.
Patient remained minimally responsive and ABG showed 7.21/79/207/33.
Repeat FSBS was 150s without change in mental status and ICU transfer was initiated.
Denies chest pain and abdominal pain.
Otherwise unable to obtain secondary to confusion.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] is a 77yo M with history of insulin dependent DM, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 10% and COPD who was electively admitted for cardiac catheterization and ICD placement.
Upon arrival to the cardiology service he was transferred to the unit for hypersomnolence, hypoglycemia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# Respiratory Distress: On iniital arrival to the floor, he appeared to have respiratory distress with agonal breathing.
He has a history of COPD and was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure one month prior ([**4-22**]) at an OSH.
His arterial blood gas on the floor showed hypercarbia to 79 (pH 7.21) with improvement to 61 (pH 7.3) overnight in the ICU.
Initial hypercarbia may have been related to somnolence from hypoglycemia leading to decreased RR and Co2 retention or decreased respiratory drive from excess oxygen supplied.
Volume overload from cardiogenic pulmonary edema was likely contributing as aggressive diuresis overnight in the ICU initially resulted in marked improvement in O2 sats and mental status.
On return to the floor, he continued to have at least daily episodes of apnea and mild hypercarbia that were associated with episodes of decreased responsiveness of various lengths.
His episodes of decreased responsiveness seemed to increase in frequency throughout the week with agressive diuresis and progressive contraction alkalosis.
# Decreased responsiveness:  Patient experienced multiple episodes of decreased responsiveness during this admission.
He has a known history of moderate dementia.
The majority of instances appeared consistent with hypoactive delirium.
On arrival his unresponsiveness was believed to be due to persistent hypoglycemia.
His COPD and metabolic alkalosis from aggressive diuresis were also likely responsible for CO2 retention and possible sedation.
He was ultimately found to have ESBL E. coli UTI and upon treating with IV antibiotics his episodes of decreased responsiveness became less frequent.
His gabapentin 300 mg po tid was discontinued as this may cause sedation and he had significant fluctuations in his renal function.
He often requested vicodin for chronic back pain but this was not provided given his episodes of unresponsiveness.
The patient would also frequently refuse to get out of bed and had extremely poor sleep/wake cycles that likely contributed to his delirium.
Would strongly recommend avoiding sedating medications and attempt to manage his pain with acetaminophen, lidocaine patches and increased mobility.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy/CAD: Initially patient was directly admitted for ICD placement and cardiac catheterization.
Recent EF 10% with some bilateral lower extremity edema on exam on admission.
After patient became more stable and euvolemic, cardiac catheterization was attempted but patient became unresponsive on arrival to cath lab and it was cancelled.
Decision was made to pursue a less invasive method of assessing CAD with a nuclear viability study at rest which showed moderate to severe fixed defect at inferior, apex, and distal anteroseptal walls.
Stress mibi was scheduled as well to evaluate for reversible defects, however due to hypotension patient was unable to tolerate procedure and it was cancelled.
Based on these reports, the patient was felt to have fixed coronary disease that would likely not be amenable to PCI.
They are aware that the patient may return for re-evaluation for ICD placement at any time after his infection has cleared should the family change their mind.
Patient will continue medical management of his systolic CHF and CAD with aspirin, beta blocker, statin, diuretics and [**Last Name (un) **] (currently being held until BP and renal function have proved stable).
Patient's weights should be monitored closely after discharge and his diuretic dose adjusted for increased weight, shortness of breath or oxygen desaturations.
# ESBL E. coli UTI: On presentation urine culture appeared consistent with colonization with ESBL.
Repeat culture during the admission in the setting of unresponsiveness and new leukocytosis showed active infection with E. coli with ESBL.
His hypoglycemia responded to D50 and discontinuation of long acting insulin.
When his glucose eventually became elevated he was started on long acting glargine and sliding scale insulin which provided less risk of hypoglycemia compared to his 70/30 regimen given his various po intake.
# COPD: He has a history of COPD and takes Spiriva and Xopenex at home.
# Hypertension: Patient with multiple episodes of hypotension during apneic episodes, otherwise BP generally well controlled.
Diovan was stopped for elevations in creatinine and occasional hypotension.
# CKD: He has a history of CKD with baseline Cr 1.3 to 1.5 per records.
The family is aware of his poor prognosis and why invasive procedures including cardiac catheterization and ICD placement could not be safely pursued during this admission.
Discussion was also had with the entire family regarding the utility of an ICD, as this would prevent death from arrhythmia but not death from other causes.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 39857**] - [**Location 9583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic systolic heart failure Acute respiratory failure Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Hypoglycemia E. coli ESBL urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for your worsening heart function.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection.
You were also very sleepy and had difficulty breathing while you were here.
This is due to multiple reasons, including COPD, worsening of your heart failure with fluid overload, and, in the beginning, low blood sugar.
You should also continue to use the CPAP mask while sleeping, which will help push air into your lungs and prevent your breathing from stopping.
START taking ipratroprium and xopenex nebulizers every six hours as needed for shortness of breath 7.
