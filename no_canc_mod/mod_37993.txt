[**2165-8-9**] CT HEAD: No acute intracranial process.
No signs of muscle edema or myonecrosis in the left calf.2.
Subcutaneous soft tissue edema of the left calf may reflect third spacing of fluid and edematous changes or cellulitis in the proper clinical setting.
Probable small bone infarcts involving the posterolateral distal tibia and lateral aspect of the talus correlated with [**2165-8-9**] left ankle radiographs 4.
Mild thickening of the Achilles tendon at attachment site with associated enthesopathy at the posterior calcaneus.
Moderate cardiomegaly with moderate coronary calcifications.
Small hiatal hernia.
No evidence of aortic pathology.
No evidence of acute infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass lesion.
Changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Generalized cerebral atrophy.
Focus of old hemorrhage in right frontal lobe which is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo F with PMH schizoaffective disorder, CAD, HTN, DM, restrictive lung disease, discoid lupus, and h/o CVA, who p/w 3d h/o audio and visual hallucinations, leg pain, and SOB with altered mental status.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  #Alered Mental Status/Hallucinations: Given pt's history of schizoaffective disorder and vascular dementia, initial presentation was thought to be related to delirium vs. progressive dementia or primary psychiatric condition.
Urine analysis was unremarkable, chest xray showed no infiltrate, blood cultures showed no growth.
A head CT was negative for an acute intracranial process.
A head MRI was also obtained to further evaluate for neurologic causes,and showed only chronic changes and no new areas of ischemia.
An EEG was obtained and was negative for epileptiform activity.
Over the course of the work up described above, the pt slowly became more withdrawn, which was different from her initial presentation in which she was talkative and quite labile with religious ideosity and frequent outburts of "hallelujah" and "praise [**Doctor Last Name **]."
She was awake but not responsive to questions verbally, answering only with mild head nodding.
At this time, she was found to have a urinary tract infection (see below), seroquel and haldol were discontinued and the urinary tract infection was treated and her mental status improved the following day, returning to a level similar to at the time of admission.
Pt then developed recurrent SVT to the 220s, relieved with carotid massage.
In the unit psychiatry was consulted and atypical presentation for neuroleptic malignant syndrome was considered.
She was treated with 2mg cogentin and ativan with mild improvement in her mental status.
She was transferred back to the general medicine floor, where her mental status continued to wax and wane but never returned to her initial level of interactiveness on admission.
# Urinary tract infection: [**2165-8-18**] patient was febrile and urine analysis suggested urinary tract infection.
Urine culture revealed grew out presumptive Strep Bovis and E.coli grow out in her urine.
On [**2165-8-19**] she developed SVT to the 220s, which resolved spontaneously.
Over the course of the following day, she had 4 more episodes of SVT which responded to carotid massage, she was never hypotensive.
Cardiology was consulted who identified the rhythm as atrial tachycardia vs. AVNRT.
# Hypoxia: On admission, patient was hypoxic with 2LNC O2 requirement.
There was no evidence of pulmomary edema or consolidation.
Given significant a-A gradient, and persistent tachycardia, CTA was performed and showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
# Ankle pain: Initial laboratory analysis was remarkable for CK in the 800s and an elevated ESR and CRP.
Given her complaints of left leg and ankle pain, orthopedic and rheumatologic causes were considered, as well as PE.
Plain films of the left ankle and hip were negative for fracture, but did show an area of possible bone infarct in the distal tibia of unclear significance.
Rheumatology was consulted who did not believe the presentation was consistent with SLE, or gout.
Statin-induced myopathy was considered, and statin was held however CK had already begun to trend down when the statin was stopped, making statin induced myopathy unlikely.
A LE doppler was negative for DVT.
MRI of the leg MRI was done to evaluate for myositis, skeletal vasculitis or other inflammatory myopathy, and diabetic myonecrosis.
It was negative for any muscle inflammation or necrosis, and showed only edema in the subcutaneous tissues, which had been noted on physical exam.
Within the first few days of her admission, ankle pain and erythemia resolved, etiology remains unclear.
#Cog-wheel rigidity/masked facies/resting tremor - On admission to the MICU, the patient developed acute presentation of symptoms concerning for extrapyrimidal symptoms related to antipsychotics.
Psych was consulted, who felt that her symptoms were consistent with EPS.
On [**2165-8-25**] she was restarted on seroquel 50mg po BID prn agitation in an effort to avoid sedation associated with benzos.
# Hypertension - pt had very difficult BP management while in house.
# hypercholesterol:  Because of elevated CKs (peaked at 819), the patient's Simvastatin was discontinued.
INACTIVE ISSUES:  # CAD - Chronic.
Clopidogrel was continued on admission but simvastatin was discontinued shortly after admission secondary to elevated CK levels.
Pt is likely compensated at a lower pO2 secondary to her lung disease.
She was repeatedly hypoxic during admission without complaints of shortness of breath.
# DM - held glyburide, gave SSI while in house  # h/o candidal rash: miconazole powder  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # schizoaffective disorder: The patient was admitted on Seroquel 250 qhs and because of the possibility of NMS, the patient is being discharged on Seroquel 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# please check the patient's CK as an outpatient, as she had elevated CK levels as outpatient.
