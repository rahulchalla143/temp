He went to see his PCP with reportedly no EKG changes.
Subsequently he developed 8/10 chest pain and went to the nearest emergency room.
He had test which revealed anterior ST elevations and reciprocal inferior depressions.
His pain decreased to [**2-15**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He has two brothers with recent myocardial infarctions and interventions and extensive coronary artery disease on his mother's side.
He is pleasant, anxious but in no acute distress.
He had a regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram demonstrates sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute with ST elevations in V1 through V3, aVL and aVR.
On the second day of hospitalization, he was determined stable to be transferred to the floor at which point he underwent echocardiogram, demonstrating an ejection fraction of 40% to 45% with areas of anterior septal apical hypokinesis to akinesis.
Based on his only moderately depressed ejection fraction, it was decided that he would not be started on anticoagulation.
His leukocytosis was thought to be reactive as he remained afebrile and it came down on the second day of admission.
It was recommended that he have a repeat cholesterol panel as well as echocardiogram in a few months to determine ongoing cardiac risk factors.
