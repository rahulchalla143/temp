HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 55901**] is an 81-year-old man on Coumadin for a history of DVT and PE who ambulated to [**Hospital3 418**] Hospital early in the day on [**2188-6-12**] for medication refills.
At the hospital, he began to have acute onset of visual disturbances and headache.
The patient was seen by Neurosurgery in the Emergency Room where a repeat head CT showed a large left cerebellar hemorrhage with rupture into the subdural space and upward herniation of the vermis resulting in effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Left upper extremity:  Flexion only to 45 degrees to pain, right upper extremity with mild internal rotation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Head CT on admission revealed a large left cerebellar bleed with upper herniation of the vermis and effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Additionally, the patient was on Coumadin for DVT and PE and was found to have an INR of 2.4 on admission.
The decision after discussion with the chief resident and attending was to take the patient immediately to the Operating Room for decompression of the cerebellar bleed and he was started on an A-line, transfused FFP to reduce his INR and he was given factor VII preoperatively for stabilization of his anticoagulative state.
The operation went well without any complications.
After returning to the ICU, a ventricular drain was placed to prevent any hydrocephalus, and the drain was initially set at 18 cm.
The patient was continued on Oxacillin for his ventricular drain.
The patient's neurologic examination after the surgery off sedation was minimally improved from his preoperative examination with minimal responsiveness, and a small amount of flexion of the left upper extremity and lower extremities withdrawal to pain.
On postoperative day number one, the patient received a CTA of his head which revealed no aneurysm or subdural bleed.
He was given Narcan without any success and he was sent for a stat head CT which showed no interval change in the size of his cerebellar hemorrhage.
On postoperative day number four, the patient's neurologic status was found to be unchanged and he was sent for an MRI which revealed no change in the prior cerebellar hemorrhage and upward tentorial herniation, without any evidence of new infarctions or hemorrhage.
There was a concern that the patient may have aspirated while undergoing the MRI and he was initially started on Flagyl and Zosyn for broad antibiotic coverage.
On postoperative day number five, the patient received an EEG which revealed no evidence of seizures and diffuse slowing, left greater than right.
At this time, it was clear that on the patient's neurological examination, the patient was largely unresponsive without following commands, and that he would intermittently demonstrate the ability to flex his left upper extremity to 45 degrees during painful stimulus as well as intermittent withdrawal to pain, left greater than right in the lower extremities.
On postoperative day number six, the discussion between the neurosurgical team and ICU Team was that the patient for further care would need a tracheostomy tube as he was completely ventilator dependent and that he would also need a feeding tube for enteral nutrition.
