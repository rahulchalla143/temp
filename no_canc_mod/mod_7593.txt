The patient was admitted on [**2103-12-28**], as a transfer from [**Hospital3 3583**] for further management of hypertension and respiratory failure.
The patient also noted weakness and hand numbness, left greater than right.
While in the emergency room, the patient apparently had a cyanotic episode and was intubated.
A left femoral line was inserted for central access and a right brachial artery line was inserted for blood pressure monitoring.
[**Last Name (STitle) 31399**] in [**Location (un) 3320**], who is an OB-GYN physician.
HEENT:  Conjunctivae are clear, no scleral icterus, no mucosal ulcerations.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Tachycardiac, regular, no murmur appreciated.
ABDOMEN:  Examination was soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present, midline abdominal scar.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm with no edema.
Back examination revealed surgical scar over the lumbar spine.
SKIN:  Skin showed petechiae and pustules over her left inner thigh and petechiae with erythema over the right axilla and shoulder.
Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed right mainstem intubation, low lung volume, no infiltrate.
EKG at the outside hospital showed sinus tachycardia with normal axis.
Urinalysis revealed moderate blood, positive protein, trace ketones, 6 to 10 white cells, 6 to 10 epithelial cells, 0 to 2 granular casts, 6 to 10 hyaline casts.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 39-year-old woman with hypertension, fever, and multiorgan failure including DIC and renal failure and metabolic acidosis.
The patient is in septic shock secondary to an unknown cause; likely causes include toxic-shock syndrome, meningeal coxemia and gram-negative sepsis.
She has a history of back pain and spinal surgery, also concerning, but no recent surgeries noted and no inflammation or localizing signs on examination.
The patient was given oxacillin and Clindamycin for toxic shock, Ceftriaxone for meningeal coxemia and gram-negative sepsis.
A DIC panel was checked on admission as the patient had elevated coagulation panel.
Cultures of the tampon came back positive for Staphylococcus aureus, which was Penicillin resistant, but methicillin sensitive.
The Clindamycin, Oxacillin, Ceftriaxone and activated protein C were continued and stool was sent for C-difficile analysis.
The patient is still in nonoliguric renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis secondary to ischemia.
The original blood samples on the tampon from [**Hospital3 3583**] were transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] and then sent on to the CDC for toxic shock syndrome toxin #I and for antibodies to toxin #1.
Hospital day #5, the patient had right upper lobe and left lower lobe infiltrates on chest x-ray.
The Ciprofloxacin was added to treat a ventilator-associated pneumonia, presumptively.
A new rash was noted and thought secondary to antibiotics or other medications.
She also said that she felt like she was breathing hard and she complained of her usual chronic back pain.
On transfer to the floor team, current issues included pulmonary bilateral infiltrates, ARDS versus ventilator-associated pneumonia.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient has all cultures negative.
The tampon grew out Staphylococcus aureus and the patient had clinical criteria for toxic shock syndrome.
The patient is in post ATN diuresis phase with high urine output and slowly decreasing creatinine.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient complained of mild abdominal pain and cramping.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient continues to complain of her chronic low back pain and weakness of her hands bilaterally.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient has sensory deficit to her elbow bilaterally and weakness of her hands.
On hospital day #11, which was [**1-7**], stool was sent for C. difficile and Flagyl was started empirically for loose stool, crampy abdominal pain, and persistently elevated white count to 22.
The patient's abdominal pain and cramping persisted with minimal p.o.
On hospital day #13, the patient's reported resolving loose stool and decreased abdominal cramping and the patient was able to take some POs.
The patient also reported continued improvement in her neurological symptoms of her hands bilaterally.
The neurological deficits continued to resolved slowly.
MRI of the cervical spine was obtained to rule out any central pathology.
On [**1-10**], after tolerating a good breakfast, the patient was deemed stable for discharge if the patient could each a good lunch without any abdominal cramping or loose stool.
Toxic shock syndrome.
Acute tubular necrosis.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome, now resolved.
