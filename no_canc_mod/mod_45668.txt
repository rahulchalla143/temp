status improved over the course of the hospital stay, she began to have some reaccumulation of fluid in her left extremities.
The patient had no further cardiovascular issues.
PULMONARY:  Over the last few hospital days, after persistent questioning of the patient by various staff members regarding any residual shortness of breath, the patient finally admitted to some shortness of breath which did not completely resolve after removal of the pigtail catheter from the pericardial space.
Therefore, given the patient's right-sided pleural effusion, it was felt that she might be experiencing some subjective shortness of breath secondary to this effusion.
Proper consent was obtained from the patient's daughter (as a translator for the patient), and a right-sided thoracentesis was performed with removal of approximately 700 cc to 800 cc of serosanguineous fluid.
On the day following the right-sided thoracentesis, the patient was questioned by the primary team as to whether she felt any improvement in her shortness of breath.
However, later that day, upon questioning by other members of the team, she did admit to some improvement in her shortness of breath.
Therefore, a Pulmonary consultation was obtained, who suggested that given the patient's equivocal answers she might benefit from thoracentesis of her left-sided pleural effusion as well.
Therefore, consent was once again obtained (via the patient's daughter as translator), and a left-sided thoracentesis was performed with removal of approximately 500 cc of serosanguineous fluid without any complication.
The patient was watched carefully over the following hospital day and had no further complaints of difficulties.
