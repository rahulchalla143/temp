HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 51-year-old male, without any significant past medical history, who was transferred from an outside hospital for cellulitis and adenitis that was not responsive to antibiotics, resulting in hypotension.
The groin pain became progressively worse over the next several days, and also he noted an area of erythema.
He developed fevers on [**2167-7-19**].
At that time, he was diagnosed with cellulitis and adenitis, and was given 2 gm of ceftriaxone, and was discharged to home.
He continued to have persistent fevers to 103 and returned the following morning to the outside hospital Emergency Department where he was admitted for cellulitis and adenitis.
He was started on Ancef, but developed a diffuse erythroderma rash the day after initiation of Ancef therapy, which was felt to be due to a drug rash.
On [**2167-7-22**], the day of transfer to [**Hospital6 256**], the patient was still persistently spiking fevers, had an elevated white blood cell count with a bandemia, and became hypotensive despite IV antibiotics, including vancomycin, clindamycin and Levaquin.
The patient reported that 3 to 4 days prior to the onset of his symptoms on [**7-14**], he had been doing work at a family member's house and had been trying to close-off openings that rodents were using to get into a house.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No family history of early coronary artery disease, or diabetes.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
Anicteric sclerae.
No facial asymmetry.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  No lower extremity edema.
2 plus dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
LEFT GROIN:  With several large, palpable subcutaneous nodules and an erythema over the left upper thigh extending from several inches above the knee to just below the inguinal crease.
CHEST X-RAY:  Showed increased interstitial markings, possibly suggesting fluid overload.
EKG:  Showed sinus tachycardia with first degree AV block with a PR interval of 0.218.
GROIN ERYTHEMA AND SUBCUTANEOUS NODULES:  The patient's    groin erythema was clinically consistent with a    cellulitis.
The Gram stain showed 2    plus polys but no organisms.
A repeat ultrasound at [**Hospital6 256**] showed only left groin enlarged lymph nodes.
No evidence of an abscess or fluid collection.
The surgical service was consulted for biopsy of the left upper thigh lymph nodes, as the patient continued to spike fevers and had a persistently elevated white blood cell count despite vancomycin and clindamycin.
An excisional biopsy was attempted; however, no lymph node was obtained.
After approximately 3 to 4 days, the patient's cellulitis was clinically improving, he was no longer spiking fevers, and his white blood cell count was decreasing.
Given his extremely low risk for MRSA, and the fact that his cultures did not reveal any organisms, the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed to PO clindamycin.
There was also concern for possible streptococcal infection with his diffuse erythroderma rash, possibly representing the rash seen as scarlet fever.
The patient never reported any pharyngitis, but given his complaints of diffuse arthralgias, myalgias, migrating neuropathic pain, there was some concern of rheumatic fever, as the patient had 2 ASO screens performed which were both negative.
MYALGIAS, ARTHRALGIAS AND NEUROPATHIC PAIN:  The patient    complained of bilateral shooting neuropathic-like pain,    migrating arthralgias, swelling in the fingers and toes,    and pleuritic chest pain.
The patient was started on    doxycycline to cover tularemia and Lyme disease.
The patient did develop a significant amount    of pleuritic chest pain that was relieved with NSAIDS and    IV Toradol.
He also developed a pericardial friction rub.
An echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and    no pericardial effusion, and Lyme titers were initially    negative.
However, given the patient's clinical evidence    of pericarditis, newly prolonged PR interval, and    migratory arthralgias and neuropathic pain, there was a    significant concern for Lyme disease and Lyme carditis    despite lack of serologic evidence.
