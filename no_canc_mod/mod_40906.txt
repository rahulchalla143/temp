There is normal compressibility flow, and augmentation in bilateral venous systemts.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
CT HEAD: COMPARISON: Series of studies dating back to CTA of the head and neck dated [**2176-10-28**] with most recent head CT dated [**2176-11-25**].
FINDINGS: There is continued resorption and redistribution of previously-seen blood products with some remaining diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and similar amount of intraventricular hemorrhage within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles dependently.
No evidence of new hemorrhage is seen.
Again noted is hypodensity along the medial frontal lobes, consistent with evolving infarction in bilateral anterior cerebral artery distribution.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells, unchanged.
A fat-containing lesion in the left parietal scalp is unchanged and may represent a sebaceous cyst or lipoma.
Interval resorption and redistribution of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, with stable amount of intraventricular hemorrhage and no new hemorrhage.
Continued evolution of bifrontal infarction in ACA distribution.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 84 year-old man with recent admission for SAH secondary to aneursym s/p coiling, intraventricular shunt, trach and PEG presenting from rehab with tachypnea and found to have with bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Pulmonary Emboli: Patient had RUL,RLL, LUL and left lingula lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli.
CT did not show evidence of RV strain.
LENIs showed no evidence of a DVT.
There was no indication for a IVC filter.
Cerebral hemorrhage: Patient was admitted on [**10-28**] following an unwitnessed syncoal episode with resultatnt SAH and IVH now s/p ACOM coiling, VP shunt placement, tracheostomy and PEG placement.
HTN: Not hypertensive on admission to MICU.
At discharge, he was mildly hypertensive with SBP in 130s-140s and was restarted on his home losartan.
4. senna  Oral 5. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Hospital1 **]: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for tachypnea.
8. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pulmonary Emboli   Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 91300**],  You were admitted to our hospital because you had blood clots in your lungs.
You also had increased secretions from your tracheostomy which was likely caused by bronchitits.
You were started on azithromycin, an antibiotic for treatment and your secretions improve.
