She had a recent diagnosis of progressing pulmonary fibrosis.
She was found to be hypoxic to 79%on 3L NC and presented to [**Hospital1 **] where she was found to be hypotensive to 80/48 and remained hypoxic at 82% on NRB with respiratory distress.
CXR with bilateral patchy infiltrates and question of PNA, pleural effusions, concern for aspiration.
No increase in peripheral pressors.

CXR [**2197-5-9**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-7**], there is substantial increase in opacification bilaterally, especially at the right base.
This suggests developing pneumonia on a substrate of significant interstitial lung disease.
There are probable bilateral pleural effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis.
There is a comminuted prominently angulated Colles fracture of the distal radial metaphysis which probably involves the distal articular surface.
The navicular bone is poorly assessed with probable old postfracture deformity and marked narrowing of the radial talonavicular joint.
There is loss of length of the dorsal portion of the radius with corresponding positive ulnar variance.
IMPRESSION: Comminuted intra-articular Colles fracture .
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2197-5-13**] 2:11 PM pending   Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with pulmonary fibrosis, prior CVA with resultant aphasia, HTN, and DM who presented to [**Hospital1 **]-N in respiratory distress and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure thought to be secondary to aspiration.
She had a history of swallowing problems related to her prior CVA, as well as progressing pulmonary fibrosis contributing to baseline poor pulmonary function.
She was admitted intubated after sudden onset of hypoxic respiratory failure.
She was hypotensive on arrival to [**Hospital1 **]-N requiring pressure support with Dopamine, then Levophed.
Her son (healthcare proxy) requested no central venous catheters, pressors, or escalation of care.
She was weaned off Levophed and hypotension was managed with fluid boluses.
She had anion Gap metabolic acidosis secondary to lactic acidosis with a lactate of 4.8.
She was volume resuscitated as above and acidosis resolved.
On admission, sodium was 160 which was likely an acute rather than chronic elevation.
She appeared grossly volume depleted suggesting hypovolemic hypernatremia.
The patient's left wrist was noted to be swollen with overlying hematoma on presentation.
An x-ray was obtained that revealed a comminuted intra-articular Colles fracture.
Disp:*60 mL* Refills:*0* 3. loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 1036**] - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure advanced dementia CVA Possible clostridium difficile colitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of aspiration and respiratory failure.
