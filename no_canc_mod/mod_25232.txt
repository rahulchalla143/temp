**FINAL REPORT [**2200-7-29**]**     Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2200-7-29**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Probable sinus tachycardia.
Left bundle-branch block with marked left axis deviation.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There is no pneumothorax.
Vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema indicate cardiac dysfunction despite normal heart size.
Bibasilar opacification, more at the left, is either atelectasis or pneumonia.
Blunting of the left costophrenic is most likely a small pleural effusion.
Mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion.
Possible bibasilar pneumonia, suspect aspiration.
No pneumothorax or other complication.
[**7-30**]  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-29**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, small effusions, and bibasilar atelectatic change, more prominent on the left.
The possibility of supervening pneumonia at the bases cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.

Etiology is likely aspiration given h/o recurrent aspiration, bibasilar opacifications with suspicion of aspiration; also with some mild pulmonary edema (was not diuresed due to hyperNa).
Pt weaned to RA without difficulty through admission.
Of note, after receiving records from [**Hospital6 **], pt has h/o recurrent admissions for aspiration PNA's.
Recent h/o several admissions for hypernatremia, as recently as several weeks ago to the [**Hospital6 **], in which pt was again hyperNa to 170 which improved with IVF's.
Likely due to poor PO intake given severe deficits from CVA in 3/[**2200**].
