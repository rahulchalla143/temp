# Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status was most likely due to abuse of [**Month/Day/Year **], complicated by coingestion of MDMA and possibly clonazepam.
Infection and intracranial pathology were ruled unlikely as he was afebrile, and had a negative UA, CXR, and non-contrast CT Head @ [**Hospital3 6592**].
The patient remained intubated until his second hospital day due to prolonged unresponsiveness, which cleared by mid-morning on [**1-5**].
Although [**Month/Year (2) **] is rapidly metabolized, prolonged periods of unresponsiveness can be a complication of coingestion (with agents such as BZDs), which is a strong possibility in his case.
# Airway protection: The patient had initially been intubated @ the [**Hospital3 6592**] ED due to concern over the safety of his airway, as he was agitated and had reportedly had some hematemesis in the field.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient had evidence of dried blood at his mouth, and an NG lavage returned some coffee-ground appearing material, which cleared.
Given that the patient had no evidence of active bleed, and a Rockall score of 0, it was judged that he was unlikely to have a significant source of bleeding beyond possible [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears.
Notably, nausea and vomiting are known side effects of [**Doctor Last Name **].
The patient's extubation was uneventful, and he had no further nausea or vomiting afterward.
He expressed no suicidal or homicidal ideation, and by all accounts his drug overdose (though not his drug use) was unintentional.
# Crush myopathy: The patient was found down and had a mildly elevated creatine kinase, suggestive of a very mild crush myopathy (although elevated CK levels and rhabdomyolysis have been noted in case series of rhabdomyolysis).
His subsequent CK measurements decreased, and he had no complaints of muscle pain at the time of discharge.
# HIV: Per the medical record, the patient has no history of opportunistic infections.
A viral load was also sent with HCP consent.
