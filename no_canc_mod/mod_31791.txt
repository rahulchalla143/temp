[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation V2, TWF avL, V2, V3  TTE [**6-5**]: LVEF>55%, 1+ AR, 1+ MR, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2166-6-6**] IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure with new small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of free intraperitoneal air, drainable fluid collections, or regions of inflammation in the abdomen or pelvis.
Small amount of ascites, small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, bilateral pleural effusions, and subcutaneous edema are consistent with aggressive volume resuscitation.
Consolidation at both lung bases, likely related to compressive atelectasis.
Diffusely low attenuation liver is consistent with fatty infiltration.
[**6-10**] CXR IMPRESSION: Decreasing right lung base atelectasis and smaller right pleural effusion   Brief Hospital Course: In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient received an additional 1unit FFP, and 2 units PRBC (last [**6-4**] at 2 p.m.) with HCT 22,8 -> 24.6.
She was evaluated by gastroenterology, who noted 2 large lacerated external hemorrhoids oozing on rectal exam.
Surgery was consulted, and she underwent an EUA, rigid sigmoidoscopy, and ligation of bleeding internal hemorrhoids on [**2166-6-4**].
Floor course: # Lower GI bleed: This was most likely related to hemorrhoids, for which the patient underwentligation [**2166-6-4**].
She does have multiple other possible sources of UGI bleeding (portal gastropathy, duodenitis, and duodenal ectasias), however, these are unlikely contributors to current presentation, given (-) NG lavage in ED.
The patient was followed by the GI service throughout her hospital stay, who recommended high fiber diet, stool softners, and [**Last Name (un) **] baths [**2-14**] times daily as needed.
# Blood loss anemia: The patients hematocrit, which was 19 on admission, was due to GI bleeding superimposed on chronic iron deficiency (baseline HCT high 20s).
# LLQ/RLQ abdominal tenderness: Following transfer to the general medical floor, the patient developed deep LLQ and RLQ tenderness with voluntary guarding on [**6-6**].
Given concern for possible perforation (recent hemorrhoidal ligation), inflammatory process/abscess, or biliary obstruction (as Tbili was 2.1, elevated from baseline), a CT abd/pelvis was obtained [**6-6**] which showed....
# Bacteremia - Course was complicated by E.coli bacteremia, treated initially with levofloxacin.
However, the patient became delerious one evening and a code purple was called.
# Fever - On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a low grade fever.
# Altered mental status - Occurred 2 nights prior to discharge, and acutely resolved with removal of sedating meds and changing levofloxacin to ceftriaxone.
No infectious etiology of delerium other than bacteremia.
# Alcohol abuse: On admission, the patient denied ongoing alcohol abuse, she was initially maintained on prn ativan for CIWA >10, which was discontinued as patient displayed no symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal.
# NSVT: As mentioned above, the patient had one 16 beat run of NSVT [**6-4**] while in the ICU a transthoracic echocardiogram [**6-5**] showed LVEF >55%, 1+ AR, 1+ MR, 1+ TR, mild PA sys HTN, trivial physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] function tests were obtained, which showed a high normal TSH and a mildly elevated free T4 at 1.8 (normal 0.9-1.7).
# Hypoxia: On transfer to the floor, the patient was noted to be 96% 2L NC (had been 100% RA on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]).
The patient has a reported history of COPD and reported an unchanged chronic non-productive cough.
A CXR PA was obtained [**6-6**] which showed mild CHF and new right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
# Partial complex seizure: The patient remained stable off anti-seizure medications.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**1-13**] puff Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
