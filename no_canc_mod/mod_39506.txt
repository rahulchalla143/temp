Admission Date:  [**2102-12-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-12-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Hydroxyzine / Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / lisinopril / metformin / doxycycline / Latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 5239**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with h/o DM2, HTN, HL, CKD, CAD, breast cancer s/p L mastectomy, and rectal cancer s/p hemicolectomy ~15 years ago, who initially presented to an OSH after an unwitnessed fall at home was found to have RH SDH.
She complained of headaches but denied any other symptoms.
Repeat CT at [**Hospital1 18**] showed an enlarging SDH.
While in the SICU, she developed hematemisis with clots and a drop in HCT.

HEENT: Pupils: 2-1mm, EOMs Appear full, able to track Neck: C Collar in place, no tenderness to palpation Neuro: - Mental status: Awake and alert, semi-cooperative with exam, confused - Orientation: Oriented to person and hospital not date.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
97.9, BP 135/80, HR 76, RR 18, 96% on RA General: resting in bed, appears uncomfortable but NAD HEENT: multiple abrasions/lacerations/contusions on right side of head with dried blood, steri-strips in place, no active bleeding, pupils equal, ~2mm, and minimally reactive, EOMI, sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes Neck: supple, no LAD CV: irregular, normal S1 + S2, no rubs, gallops, faint systolic murmur along lower sternal border Lungs: bibasilar inspiratory crackles, no wheezes, good air movement, respirations unlabored Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, trace-1+ edema bilaterally  Neuro: Alert and oriented x2-3, CN 2-12 intact.
**FINAL REPORT [**2102-12-25**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2102-12-25**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Lung volumes remain low with small layering bilateral effusions and persistent perihilar vascular congestion.
However, no overt pulmonary edema is present on the current examination.
There is a calcified right paratracheal lymph node suggestive of prior granulomatous infection.
Remote fracture of the left humeral head is incompletely visualized on the current examination.
No acute bony abnormality.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Increased congestive heart failure.
New right upper lobe opacity, representing combined edema and consolidation on CT.  KUB [**2102-12-23**]: 1.
No evidence of bowel obstruction or free air.
Questionable right tenth anterior rib fracture seen on the edge of the supine radiograph.
If there is clinical concern for a fracture, further imaging with a dedicated rib series would be advised.
CT head [**2102-12-24**]: No significant interval change in multiple foci of intraparenchymal, subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Unchanged subarachnoid component of hemorrhage overlying the left frontal lobe.
Bilateral subdural hematomas, more pronounced on the right and with moderate mass effect on the adjacent sulci.
Stable small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage with unchanged size and configuration of the ventricular system.
No evidence of new mass effect, hemorrhage, or infarct.
Increasing right frontal hemorrhagic contusions and subgaleal hematoma.
New right lateral intraventricular hemorrhage.
Left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Evolution of acute-on-subacute subdural hematomas, measuring 1.4 cm on the right and 7 mm on the left.
Opacification of the right mastoid air cells and right middle ear- accurate assessment of the density of the contents is limited due volume averaging from adjacent bone; however, not significantly changed from prior- attention on followup or consider dedicated CT Temporal bone study.
Congestive heart failure.
Bilateral dependent consolidation, right greater than left.
This is most suggestive of aspiration, less likely multifocal pneumonia.
Severe atherosclerosis and ascending aortic ectasia.
Bilateral adrenal nodules, statistically adenomas.
Abnormal appearance of left kidney.
Recommend non-emergent renal ultrasound for further characterization   Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with a complicated PMH including DM2, HTN, HL, CKD, CAD, breast cancer s/p L mastectomy, and rectal cancer s/p hemicolectomy ~15 years ago, with R SHD s/p unwitnessed fall, transferred to MICU now in setting of hematemesis, falling Hct, worsening abdominal pain, and developing hypotension.
Imaging reveals b/l SDH, R>L, as well as right frontal hemorrhagic contusions, subarachnoid component of hemorrhage overlying the left frontal lobe, and small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
Repeat imaging with head CT on [**2005-12-21**], showed no evidence of new mass effect, hemorrhage, or infarct.
Ms. [**Known lastname 5239**] was continued on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Ms [**Known lastname 5239**], was subsequently transferred to the floor where repeat head CT on [**2102-12-24**] showed no active changes.
# UPPER GI BLEED: Ms [**Known lastname 5239**] had one episode of hematemesis during her hospitalization with clots noted.
This was most likely due to a stress ulcer or gastritis (on aspirin, no clear h/o NSAID use), however differential diagnoses includes PUD, or [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear in setting of recent N/V.
No history of liver disease to suggest variceal bleed.
She has had no subsequent bleeds since her one episode of hematemesis.
Neurosurgery was okay with restarting ASA and ASA 81 was restarted on the morning of [**2102-12-26**] without incident.
# ABDOMINAL PAIN: Ms [**Known lastname 5239**] complained of RUQ abdominal pain on exam.
This was most likely due to a stress ulcer.
However, differential diagnosis includes gastritis, PUD, [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, pancreatitis, or possible trauma related to recent fall (patient fell onto right side).
Also, given prior h/o breast and rectal cancer, would consider possibility of metastatic disease although unlikely.
LFTs not suggestive of biliary process, and transaminases only mildly elevated.
This pain subsequently subsided when she was transferred to the floor on [**2102-12-23**] and no further investigations was performed.
# NSTEMI: These changes were felt to be secondary to demand ischemia.
Multiple serial EKGs were done which showed inferior ischemia with one isolated ST elevation in III upon admission that later resolved with rate control.
There were also rate related ST depressions in leads I and aVL that improved with time.
The patient never complained of any symptoms of ischemia including chest pain or shortness of breath (although her abdominal pain may have been related to ischemia, this resolved by the time she arrived on the floor).
Her enzyme elevations were strongly felt by the team to be secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of SDH, upper GI bleed, ICU admission, and NOT due to plaque rupture.
# Acute on chronic sCHF: EF 30-35% per report.
However, she still has a slight oxygen requirment (not on O2 at baseline), with bibasilar rales on exam.
This was subsequently restarted on [**2102-12-23**] and her oxygen requirement disappeared as she was 96%RA on day of discharge.
# Encephalopathy: Likely multifactorial in setting of recent head trauma, pain, uremia, N/V and GI bleeding.
# Acute blood loss / iron/B12 / CKD related anemia: Per report, patient has history of iron and B12 deficiency and is on both ferrous sulfate and cyanocobalamin as an outpatient.
# HTN: Patient with decreasing systolic BP in setting of hematemesis.
