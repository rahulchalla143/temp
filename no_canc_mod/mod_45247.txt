She required treatment for her severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for which she is on two liters of home oxygen.
Over her hospital course, she was slowly weaned down to her baseline of two liters nasal cannula oxygen on [**2137-11-21**], however, that evening she became anxious and agitated and desaturated on the two liters down to 60% and required increasing oxygen to four to five liters.
Attempts were made to space these out to every six hours, however, the patient would become bronchospastic and desaturate to the mid to low 80s on her four to five liters nasal cannula oxygen.
At the time of discharge, it is unclear if this represents a new baseline pulmonary status for this 76 year old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and extensive smoking history or whether with time she will slowly return to baseline of two liters nasal cannula oxygen at home with nebulized treatments and MDIs every six hours.

The patient was not maintained on a beta blocker because of her severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
