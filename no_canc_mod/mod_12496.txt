Admission Date:  [**2128-9-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-9-20**]   Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Tetracyclines  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 4223**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo woman with dementia who presents with CHF x 2 day likely due to a three day medication holiday.
Her daughter stopped all of pt's meds after developing a hot red rash on her trunk and back, likely due to addition of glyburide.
Over the weekend, pt's shortness of breath worsened.
Past Medical History: CHF HTN Hypothyroid NIDDM s/p surgery for diverticulitis s/p CCY s/p Appy Multi-infart dementia 'heart murmur'  Social History: lives with daughter at home ([**Name (NI) 714**] [**Name (NI) 4223**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38562**]).
No tobacco or alcohol.
Scooped ST segment depression in leads I and II.
Horizontal ST segment depressions in leads V4-V6.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Scooped depressions suggest the possibility of digitalis effect.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-2-26**] sinus rhythm was previously present with atrial ectopy.
CXR: Moderate left ventricular heart failure.
Increased opacity at the right lung base which may represent an evolving infiltrate.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There are complex (>4mm and/or mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4223**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman presenting with decompensated CHF due to new A fib with RVR, right lower lobe pneumonia, and rash thought to be due to Glyburide.
Protracted stay complicated by recurrent Afib.
1.Pump: Decompensated CHF due to three day drug holiday, causing volume overload and hence atrial fibrillation.
Echo revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with LVEF of 50-55%.
Pt will continue an ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction.
2.Rhythm: New onset A fib on admission with rapid ventricular response to 140's.
Pt was initially rate controlled with a diltiazem drip, and then switched to oral metoprolol.
Digoxin was not started due to left ventricular hypertrophy and 50-55% ejection fraction.
She remained in NSR until [**2128-9-15**] when she had transfusion reaction and dropped her BP.
She was in sinus until [**9-17**], when she converted back to rapid AF with hemodynamic compromise.
3.Coronories: Pt has a history of hypertension, presenting with lateral ST elevations on EKG.
Lungs: Patinet had Right lower lobe pneumonia on admission and was started on Levofloxacin 250mg po qd on [**9-7**] for a seven day course.
During her second Afib episode, she may have aspirated during sedation for DCCV.
CXR could not exclude left basilar infiltrate and she was then started on levoflxacin and flagyl.
7.Drug rash likely d/t Glyburide: Rash was improving on Zyrtec and off Glyburide.
She was started on Repaglinide without adverse effects and with better blood glucose control.
Abdominal pain:Patietn developed acute abdomen.
CT abdomen on [**9-13**] showed hematoma in subcutaneous tissue of left lateral wall, no obstruction, no stool impaction.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Decompensated congestive heart failure New onset AFib with RVR Pneumonia Drug rash Type II diabetes Hypertension Urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Pt was in fair condition.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience chest discomfort, shortness of breath, fever, weakness in your limbs, loss of consciousness.
Please follow up with appropriate physician as detailed below   Followup Instructions: Make an appointment with your PCP on thursday [**2128-9-23**] to have your INR checked.
