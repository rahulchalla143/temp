History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 91391**] is a 57 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for severe hypertension, mild hyperlipidemia, and a family history of heart disease, who presented to his PCP at the end of [**Month (only) **] with two months of exertional sub-sternal chest pain.
His symptoms started at the end of [**Month (only) 205**] when he noticed burning substernal pain while walking his dog briskly.
The pain occassionally radiated to his left arm, but he denies nausea/vomiting or diaphoresis.
Never had symptoms at rest.
He presented to his PCP who sent him to the [**Hospital1 3597**] ED, where he was noted to have hypertension to 244/110.
He also underwent exercise MIBI at [**Hospital3 7362**], during which he went 4 minutes 36 seconds on a [**Doctor First Name **] protocol and developed 2mm ST depressions in the inferior lateral leads.
Imaging showed a large and severe defect involving the mid anterior wall extending to the anterior apex.
In addition there was another defect involving the mid to distal septum.
There was transient ischemic dilation of the left ventricle.
Past Medical History: Primary: Coronary Artery Disease pulmonary embolism (incidental finding pre-operatively)  Secondary: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Hypothyroidism Left femur fracture   Social History: Patient is divorced with three children.
Tobacco: Never ETOH: Rare Recreational drugs: Denies Home services: Denies  Family History: Father died of early MI at age 46.
Mother had some type of cancer and was in remission when she died in retirement home (cause unknown).
Sclera anicteric.
No elevated JVP.
LUNGS: CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective corobary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA is a large caliber vessel with a 30% ostial stenosis.
There is diffuse disease through the mid-LAD to 60%.
The Lx is a large caliber vessel with diffuse plaquing.
There is a moderate OM2 with moderate origin stenosis.
There is a tortuous branching OM4 with mild stenosis at the origin of the lower pole.
The RCA has an ectatic origin with a proximal-mid tubular 50% stenosis.
There is diffuse plaquing throughout with a distal 30% stenosis into RPDA with 50% stenosis at the origin of its first lateral sidebranch.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures with LVEDP averaging 13, max 21 mmHg.
Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation, an LVEF of 70%, and no regional wall motion abnormalities.
Fullness in the right tracheobronchial angle is explained by fat deposition in the mediastinum projecting over a transverse process of the thoracic spine.
There is no good evidence for central lymph node enlargement or pleural abnormality.
TTE [**2115-1-5**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Mildly dilated aortic root and ascending aorta.
Segmental arterial resistive indices within normal limits, ranging from 0.58 to 0.67.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
CTA Coronaries [**2115-1-6**]: Impression:  1.Extensive involvement of the coronary arteries by diffuse and focal abnormalities as described in details in the body of the report.
Those findngs in conjunction with focal areas of coronary arteries dilataions ca raise the suspicion of vasculitis with some degree of atherosclerosis as well.
Given the lack of coronary calcifications in the presence of such an extensive unvolvement of coronary arteries, vasculitis might first diagnostic consideration.
2.Segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolism.
DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2618**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2619**] Approved: MON [**2115-1-7**] 2:11 PM    Imaging Lab  [**2115-1-7**] Intra-op TEE Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The patient is on no inotropes.
Mitral regurgitation is unchanged.
