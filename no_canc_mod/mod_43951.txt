[**3-3**] sputum culture oropharyngeal flora [**3-3**] urine cx no growth [**3-3**] urine legionella negative [**3-3**] and [**3-5**] blood cx NGTD  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3271**] is an 85 yo man with h/o Parkinson's and hypertension who presented in respiratory distress and was found to have a RLL pneumonia on CXR.
He was intubated urgently in the ER in the setting of hypoxia with O2 sat 84% on NRB.
He was also noted to have a change in mental status at that time, being minimally responsive, whereas per his daughter his baseline is quite good.
Sputum culture was repeated on [**3-7**] and showed pan-sensitve serraita and the patient was switched to PO levofloxacin to complete a 14 day course.
During his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course, the patient had an episode of HTN urgency on the evening of [**3-4**] with bp 190/120s.
We avoided beta blockade in the setting of the patient's baseline bradycardia as well as an EKG which was possibly consistent with some form of intermittent AV block.
Discussion with the patient's daughter revealed that he had been intubated 3 years ago and in detailed discussion since then he had expressed to her his desire not to be intubated or resuscitated.
She stated that had she known there was paperwork to be filled out to that effect she would have done so as she is certain these were his wishes.
