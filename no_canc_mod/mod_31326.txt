HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old man with severe coronary artery disease, AICD, hypertension, and a history of alcoholism, who presents unresponsive with a head laceration.
He was able to ambulate at that time, but soon after, he was found unresponsive in a pool of blood.
CT scan of the head showed no hemorrhage or fracture, only significant right-sided soft tissue swelling.
CT scan of the spine showed only stable old C2 fracture and slight anterior C4-C5 listhesis, for which she was put in a collar.
AICD was interrogated by the on call electrophysiology fellow and showed no events.
Dopamine was weaned off and the patient was transiently given an IV nitroglycerin drip for hypertension and fluid overload, as well as Furosemide IV.
His course was also complicated by metabolic acidosis, mixed anion gap and nonanion gap, which was resolving on transfer to the [**Hospital **] Medical Team.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: PROBLEM #1:    Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2190**] (LIMA LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-PDA.
Coronary catheterization on [**7-8**], [**2193**], after loss of consciousness showed three-vessel CAD (LM 50-60, LAD T.O., LIMA-LAD patent with 50% to 60% stenosis and retrograde LAD, LCX 70-80, proximal OM1 high grade times two, OM2 70-8, SVG-OM2 patent, RCA T.O.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2193-6-17**] after loss of consciousness showed LV ejection fraction 25%, septal and apical wall motion abnormalities, moderate MR, tricuspid valve gradient of 37 indicating moderate pulmonary hypertension.
PROBLEM #3:  Ventricular arrhythmia with automatic internal cardiac defibrillator placed.
On [**2193-6-16**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital 21811**] [**Hospital6 **] after loss of consciousness.
No arrhythmia was documented, but EKG showed on incomplete right bundle branch block.
CT angiogram did not reveal pulmonary embolism.
PROBLEM #4:  Aspiration pneumonia diagnosed on hospitalization earlier this month, treated with Levofloxacin and Clindamycin for ten days.
PROBLEM #5:  Peripheral vascular disease with right femoral tibial bypass on [**2193-6-12**], complicated at that time by wound infection requiring prolonged hospitalization.
PROBLEM #6:  Bilateral carotid artery disease.
PROBLEM #7:  Ethanol abuse with past withdrawal episodes.
PROBLEM #8:  Positive PPD in [**2190**] with no related abnormalities on chest x-ray at that time.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has question of reaction to Oxycodone-APAP.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has ethanol abuse with multiple past falls and withdrawal episodes.
HEENT:  Pharyngeal, but no scleral icterus.
Mucous membranes moist with no oropharyngeal lesions.
Facial laceration neatly stapled and sutured with no surrounding erythema or discharge.
CARDIAC:  Very faint heart sounds due to barrel chest.
ABDOMEN:  Normal bowel sounds, obese, soft, with no tenderness other than a mildly tender 2-cm hepatomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Marked bilateral upper extremity edema, mild palmar erythema, no spider angiomata.
Imaging: CT of the head on [**2193-7-4**] showed no intracranial bleeding, midline shift or skull fracture, right sided soft tissue swelling with subcutaneous emphysema.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**7-4**] showed 1.9 cm left kidney cyst, several small right kidney cysts, no fractures or signs of acute injury.
Chest x-ray on [**7-5**] revealed left basilar atelectasis, no pneumothorax, pulmonary artery catheterization correctly placed.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**7-4**] showed bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, right inferior pubic irregularities consistent with old fracture.
Chest x-ray on [**7-5**] showed interval development of mild congestive heart failure.
Chest x-ray on [**7-6**] showed retrocardiac opacification.
He received one extra dose of Diazepam on the evening of [**7-7**] for mild withdrawal symptoms.
Unfortunately, he still complained of insomnia on that evening and required additional zolpidem to sleep.
However, it is notable that the patient adamantly feels that ethanol is not a problem for him and he has no interest in ethanol-abuse treatment.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  With suspicion for ventricular arrhythmias, as noted above, the patient's AICD was interrogated on [**2193-7-5**] and found to have no arrhythmias recorded.
The patient was felt to have suffered a fall in the setting of alcohol abuse rather than a cardiac event.
for bradycardia and hypertension respectively.
Retrocardiac opacification was stable on chest x-ray and felt to be consistent with resolving process.
He has not developed symptoms of pneumonia during his hospitalization.
Swallow evaluation was performed at the bedside and showed no swallow abnormalities.
PROBLEM #5:  METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:  This appeared to correlate well with elevated serum lactate levels and rapid normal saline expansion and had entirely resolved by [**2193-7-7**].
PROBLEM #6:  FLUID OVERLOAD:  This was transient in the setting of aggressive crystalloid repletion, hypertension and prerenal azotemia at the beginning of Mr. [**Known lastname **] hospital stay.
