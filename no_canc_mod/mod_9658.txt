HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The 1,060 gm product of a 28 [**2-12**] week gestation, baby girl [**Known lastname 8389**], [**Name2 (NI) 37336**] #1 was born to a in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization, pregnancy was notable for advanced preterm labor and breech presentation prompting cesarean section.
Treated with betamethasone, magnesium sulfate, indomethacin and nifedipine, the mother experienced rupture of membranes on the day of delivery and this prompted the delivery.
Infant emerged with a spontaneous cry and respirations, given blow by oxygen and bulb suctioning, the newborn had Apgars of 7 at one minute and 8 at five minutes of age.
Admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and stabilization, the baby was transferred to [**Hospital3 18242**] shortly thereafter due to increased census in the NICU.
A non dysmorphic preterm infant, the baby was noted to have coarse bilateral breath sounds that were equal bilaterally.
Cardiac exam had irregular rate and rhythm, without murmur auscultated.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
A three vessel umbilical cord was present.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
The spine was straight without dimples or masses.
Her chest radiograph was consistent with respiratory distress syndrome.
Initially on conventional mechanical ventilation, [**Known lastname **] developed a pulmonary hemorrhage on day of life #2 prompting treatment for a patent ductus arteriosus.
Caffeine was started on day of life #6 for apnea of prematurity and was subsequently discontinued on day of life #45.
She has had no recent apneic or bradycardic spells.
She was treated with one course of Indomethacin for presumed patent ductus arteriosus on day of life #2 in the setting of a pulmonary hemorrhage.
She has had an intermittent flow murmur associated with anemia during her hospitalization.
Zantac and Reglan were started on day of life #83, given concerns for gastroesophageal reflux.
Their evaluation showed a poor coordinated suck, swallow and breathing as well as signs of oral aversion, potentially related to her neurologic status.
Hematology:  Having received multiple red blood cell transfusions in the first week of life as well as FFP in the setting of a pulmonary hemorrhage, [**Known lastname **] was last transfused with packed red blood cells on day of life #54, given a hematocrit of 24% and a reticulocyte count at that time of 7.4.
Infectious Disease:  [**Known lastname **] received 48 hours of antibiotics following delivery due to sepsis risk factors.
Surveillance surface cultures were positive for Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus on [**9-14**].
Neurology:  Head ultrasound on day of life #3 showed a bilateral grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage.
Repeat on day of life #5 showed a grade 4 intraventricular hemorrhage on the right and a grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage on the left.
A progressive increase in her head circumference prompted a follow-up head ultrasound on [**10-9**] which showed increasing ventricular size.
Her last head ultrasound on [**11-19**] showed resolution of the ventriculomegaly and resolution of hemorrhage in the lateral ventricles with a resolving clot in the third ventricle.
The infant is stable in room air and tolerating full volume feedings with a stable temperature and open crib.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for those infants who meet any of the following three criteria: 1) Born at less than 32 weeks gestation; 2) Born between 32 and 35 weeks with plan for DayCare during RSV season, with a smoker in the household, or with preschool siblings; or 3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the Fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
The father has been immunized against influenza and the mother has also been encouraged to do so.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Status post pulmonary hemorrhage.
Post hemorrhage hydrocephalus.
Apnea of prematurity.
