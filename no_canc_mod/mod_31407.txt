Emergency coronary artery bypass graft x5 -- left     internal mammary artery to left anterior descending     artery, saphenous vein sequential graft to ramus and     distal circumflex, and saphenous vein grafts to diagonal     and posterior descending arteries.
History of Present Illness: 81 year old male with 2 months of dyspnea on exertion and exertional chest pain.
A few months ago he noticed weakness if walking greater then 100 feet, and 3 weeks ago developed exertional epigastric pain.
Over the last few weeks symptoms have increased and presented to PCP office and had EKG changes and admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and had elevated troponins.
Found to have left main disease upon cardiac catheterization and IABP placed and sent to OR for CABG.
While this may be due to engorgement of the central pulmonary vasculature, its asymmetry when compared to the left hilum raises concern for a right hilar mass or adenopathy and further evaluation with a contrast enhanced chest CT is recommended.
Mild pulmonary edema.
