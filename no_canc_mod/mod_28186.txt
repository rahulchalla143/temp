States that while in the OSH ED began to have fevers and headaches.
She was found to be febrile to 103.2, tachycardic, hypotensive, short of breath, and have a right lower lobe infiltrate.
Also had a CT head for headache and diszziness that was negative.
She also recieved a dose of Zofran, Ativan, and morphine as well as 30mg Toradol for for pleuritic CP and headache.
Increased diffuse infiltrate on line placement CXR.
C/o right-sided mouth pain from infected tooth.
Denies abd pain, nausea currently.
Diabetes Mellitus 3.
Uterine CA s/p hysterectomy 4.
Chronic gastrointestinal problems including chronic diarrhea 5. h/o Nephrolithiasis 6.
Mother has hepatitis C from a needle stick on her job.
Bibasilar crackles, R > L Abd: soft, ND, mild epigastric tenderness Ext: warm, no edema .
MMM Neck: supple Chest: CTA-B, no w/r/r CV: RR slightly tachycardic, no m/g/r Abd: soft, NT/ND, NABS Ext: no c/c/e  Pertinent Results: Admission Results: .
Bibasilar airspace opacities, right worse than left, concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
Probable mild pulmonary edema.
Again, there is evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure with more focal area of opacification in the right mid and lower lung zones, concerning for pneumonia.
Multifocal consolidation, worse in the right middle and lower lobes, concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
No evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.
Right Ankle XR ([**2151-1-4**]): No evidence of acute fracture.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is abnormal Doppler signal at the right and left ventricular apices, throughout the cardiac cycle (cine loops 36, 37, 54, 55).
Although a Doppler artifact is possible, this may also represent a congenital coronary artery-to-ventricular fistula.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Possible coronary artery-to-ventricular fistula.
CXR [**2151-1-12**]: There is marked interval improvement in the degree of opacity in the right lung and bilateral upper lobe venous diversion, which likely represented right lower lobe pneumonia with associated pulmonary edema.

Pneumonia with Sepsis: Patient presented with productive cough and CXR evidence of RLL pneumonia.
Fevers, bandemia of 40% and tachycardia were consistent with sepsis without evidence of end-organ ischemia.
Patient with no recent concerning health-care contacts so was started on Levofloxacin for CAP coverage, as well as Vancomycin and Cefepime for broader coverage given septic physiology and history of HIV with unknown CD4 count.
There was concern for an HIV-associated pancytopenia but also for DIC, specifically with regard to the anemia and thrombocytopenia, so DIC labs were checked but showed no signs of DIC with fibrinogen always > 200, and coags were slightly elevated on admission but remained stable with no significant elevations.
The PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] for further information who stated that the pancytopenia has been a problem for years.
The patient's leukopenia was attributed to her HIV/AIDS with a possible septic component.
Her anemia was likely anemia of chronic inflammation from her HIV/AIDS.
Thrombocytopenia was attributed to HIV/AIDS.
Stool guaiacs were negative and the change was attributed to vigorous IV hydration with a reported significant blood loss during central line placement.
BMBx was performed on [**2151-1-8**] to rule out pathology or BMInfection.
Pathology was still pending at the time of discharge but prelim results showed no abnormal cells.
The patient was advised of neutropenic precautions and to watch for fevers > 100.5. .
# Orthostatic Hypotension: When out of ICU.
Prior to discharge this remained stable and she was no longer orthostatic .
Prefer to rule out MAC infection prior to HAART if possible to determine need to treat or to prophylax.
# Elevated LDH / Transaminitis:  Could be sign of underlying MAC.
No abnormal imaging and clinically asymtpomatic from hepatobiliary standpoint.
LFTs remained stable but elevated, this should be trended to ensure no worsening.
Candidal Esophagitis (presumed): Patient was complaining of mild odynophagia several days into her hospitalization.
She was initially treated with Nystatin swish and swallow with minimal improvement.
Ankle x-ray was negative for fracture at [**Hospital1 18**].
3. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
5. loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with sepsis from pneumonia and hospitalized in ICU.
You have low blood counts concerning for side effect of sepsis, or due to bone marrow process.
A Bone marrow bx was done and pathology showed preliminarily did not show any abnormal cells.
You were evaluated for causes of chronic diarrhea which may be due to infection or HIV enteropathy.
You met with an infectious disease clinician and will need to be on anti-HIV meds for advanced AIDS.
If you develop any fevers > 100.5, please call your doctor or return to the hospital immediately.
Please avoid contact with people who any upper respiratory illnesses, given your low white count.
Continue loperamide and compazine as needed for diarrhea and nausea, respectively.
