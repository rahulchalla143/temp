History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 951**] is an 81 year old woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p atrialventricular nodal ablation and permanent pacemaker placement in [**2131-10-16**], hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
She has recently been complaining of increasing shortness of breath and therefore was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on heparin for a cardiac catheterization which was negative and a fat pad biopsy to rule out amyloid secondary to a speckled appearance of the myocardium on echo.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 1535**] for surgical evaluation of her mitral regurgitation.
Past Medical History: PAF on anticoagulation s/p AV modal ablation and permanent pacemaker placement in [**10-20**], hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, former smoking smoking, s/p cerebellar ischemia versus vestibulopathy.
Family History: None  Physical Exam: Pulse: 76 Resp:  18 O2 sat: 92 RA B/P  Right: 125/75 Height:5 ft     Weight:126  General: Skin: Dry [x] intact [x] HEENT: PERRLA [x] EOMI [x] Neck:  Supple [x] Full ROM [x] Chest: Lungs clear bilaterally [x] Heart: RRR []  Irregular [x]  Murmur Abdomen: Soft [x] non-distended [x] non-tender [x]  bowel sounds + [x] Extremities: Warm [x], well-perfused [x]  Edema Varicosities: None [x] Neuro: Grossly intactx Pulses: Femoral      Right: 2+  Left:2+ DP           Right: 1+  Left:1+ PT           [**Name (NI) 167**]: 1+  Left:1+ Radial       Right: 2+  Left:2+  Carotid Bruit        Right:-    Left:-   Pertinent Results: [**2135-4-22**] Carotid Duplex Ultraound Impression: Right ICA with no stenosis.
Left ICA with no stenosis  [**2135-4-25**] - ECHO PRE CPB The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium and left atrial appendage.
No definite thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler, though the severity of tricuspid regurgitation prevents complete exclusion..
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
A well seated, well functioning tissue valve is seen in the mitral position.
A prostetic mitral valve strut is seen in the LVOT, with no evidence of LVOT obstruction.
A small perivalvular leak is noted before protamine but not seen after protamine administration.
Heparin was started for anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation in preparation for surgery.
She was worked-up by the cardiac surgical service in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which did not show any significant carotid artery disease.
Her narcotics were discontinued secondary to lethargy.
She was placed on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
Tablet(s)   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 15644**] Long Term Health - [**Location (un) 47**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation s/p Mitral valve replacement Atrial fibrillation AV nodal ablation in past with permanent pacemaker [**10-20**] Hypertension Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Former smoker ?
cerebellar ischemia versus vestibulopathy   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: 1)  Monitor wounds for signs of infection.
These include redness, drainage or increased pain.
In the event that you have drainage from your sternal wound, please contact the [**Name2 (NI) 5059**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1504**].
4)  No lotions, creams or powders to incision until it has healed.
Gently pat the wound dry.
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 80654**] Will need 6 month follow-up with chest CT at PCPs for lung nodules found on chest CT during admission.
