IMAGING/STUDIES: CXR Portable [**4-16**]: No evidence of acute disease.
Left bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of the same date there is no significant change.
The likely etiology of this patients bleeding was diverticular There were no polyps seen.
F/u with PCP for discussion of further colonoscopy for screening which would be in ten years.
Brief Hospital Course: 84M history of CAD s/p coronary stenting x 3, CHF, superficial bladder cancer prior diverticular disease admitted to the MICU for painless BRBPR and hypotension responsive to fluids.
LOWER GI BLEED: Pt admitted to the MICU with 3 total days of what appears to be LGIB with known diverticula and internal hemorrhoids, roughly 10 point crit drop from prior baseline, and transient hypotension to mid-80's systolically in the ED that responded to small volume IVF bolus.
He remained HD stable without tachycardia (although he was initially beta blocked) or alteration in mental status.
He underwent colonoscopy by GI that showed diverticulosis without any active bleeding.
No chest pain or current SOB.
Etiology was likely prerenal from hemorrhagic volume loss.
Patient advised to avoid NSAIDs as may worsen renal function and make recurrent GI bleed likely.
