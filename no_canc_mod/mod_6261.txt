The patient had been having bright red blood per rectum two weeks prior to admission, but this had worsened over several days prior to admission.
No chest pain.
No shortness of breath.
No recent antibiotic use.
In the Emergency Room, she was noted to have continued bright red blood per rectum measuring approximately 300-400 cc.
In the Emergency Room, she was given 1 L of intravenous fluids but no FFP or Vitamin K.  She was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the floor.
Incidentally she had an appointment scheduled for the day after admission with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15505**] for her hemorrhoids.
Sigmoid diverticulosis seen on colonoscopy in [**2144-7-2**].
Atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Status post partial thyroidectomy.
No alcohol history.
General:  The patient was pleasant and in no acute distress.
There was a 1 out of 6 systolic murmur heard at the apex and the left upper sternal border.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 100, right bundle branch block, poor R-wave progression.
There were no significant changes compared to electrocardiogram performed on [**2145-2-28**].
IMPRESSION:  This is a 77-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis, coronary artery disease, St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] AVR, who presented with bright red blood per rectum in the setting of an increased INR.
A colonoscopy was recommended to visualize the possible source of the GI bleed, and because the patient became anxious and went into respiratory distress during the bowel prep for this procedure, it was not reattempted.
In fact, she did not rebleed following her transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and the only further treatment instituted was Anusol HC topically to her perianal area for her hemorrhoids.
Cardiovascular:  It was very difficult to control the patient's rapid ventricular response to her atrial fibrillation during her hospitalization.
Unfortunately this seemed to incite a mild flare of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as described below under pulmonary.
Infectious disease:  The patient was found to have mild pneumonia.
The patient also had a urinary tract infection which was found to be Enterococcus susceptible to Levofloxacin; therefore, Levofloxacin treated both her pneumonia, as well as her urinary tract infection.
Hematology:  The patient's goal INR is 2.5-3.5 given her atrial valve replacement with a St. Jude's valve, as well as her atrial fibrillation.
Several units of blood were transfused given the patient's low hematocrit and documented coronary artery disease, as well as congestive heart failure.
Pulmonary:  As mentioned during the patient's preparation for colonoscopy, she experience acute respiratory distress.
It was actually unclear exactly why this occurred, but it could have been secondary to anxiety and underlying pneumonia, as well as possible contribution from her underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
As mentioned, the patient had a pneumonia that was treated with Levofloxacin successfully.
When she was extubated, she had a little bit of difficulty swallowing, so we consulted the Speech and Swallow Service which helped us in performing a video swallow study.
Endocrine:  The patient had good glucose control with Glyburide, Glucophage, and regular Insulin sliding scale.
The reason she is having some difficulties swallowing is that she is status post intubation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
Urinary tract infection.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
