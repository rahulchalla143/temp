His WBC had trended down to 8, but yesterday he had a fever to 100.7 and his WBC increased to 12.1.
Of particular note, pt was previously admitted in [**Month (only) 359**]/[**2101-12-6**] after he sustained a fall complicated by C1/C2 fractures and bilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhages, now s/p G-tube placement.
This hospitalization was also complicated by bradycardia to the 30s, with baseline HRs in the 50s in atrial fibrillation.
Repeat labs showed a leukocytosis to 13.8 without a bandemia and a mild transaminitis.
RUQ U/S showed 2cm non-obstructing gallstone without gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid (CBD not visualized).
CXR was without consolidation concerning for PNA.
U/A showed significant blood, but only 14 WBCs and small leuk esterase with no bacteria (on levofloxacin).
On the floor, he is non-verbal and is difficult to assess any pain or discomfort.
The patient developed increasing secretions on the floor complicated by cardiopulmonary arrest.

The lungs appear clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: No signs of pneumonia  CT Head w/out contrast [**2-14**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Focal area of increased attenuation in the left temporal region, extra-axial in location, which may relate to the adjacent part of the left transverse sinus or small subdural hemorrhage.
Consider close followup to assess stability and to exclude hemorrhage in this location.
Study limited due to motion-related artifacts.
No pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall thickening seen.
Aside for gallbladder distention, no definite secondary signs of acute cholecystitis, but exam is suboptimal.
EEG [**2102-2-22**] This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of continuous spike and wave and polyspike and wave discharges, ranging from [**4-11**] Hz, some of which correlate with myoclonic jerk of the body on video.
These findings are consistent with myoclonic seizures, and in the setting of post-anoxia, portend a very poor prognosis.
No acute infarct.
Generalized cerebral volume loss with changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Numerous microhemorrhages in bilateral cerebral hemispheres, which likely represent changes of amyloid angiopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 6504**] is a 79y/o gentleman with Parkinson's dementia s/p recent fall with intraparenchymal hemorrhage and C1/C2 fractures who presented with persistent leukocytosis and isolated fever, likely due to urinary tract infection.
Neurology was consulted for myoclonic movements and EEG confirmed that these were likely myoclonic seizures in the setting of anoxic brain injury, with a dismal prognosis.
