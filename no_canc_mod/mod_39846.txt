Mr [**Known firstname 93876**] previously had a 3-hole esophagectomy in [**2104**] for Esophageal CA and on [**2119-8-2**] underwent repair of tracheoesophageal fistula at [**Hospital1 18**].
He was readmitted on [**2119-9-13**] for GNR positive blood cxs, renal failure, and leaking from J-tube.
He had multidrug resistant klebsiella and proteus bacteremia and was placed on Meropenem.
This evening the patient presented from his facility with hypotension (SBP in 70's), tachycardia (110-130), and increasing respiratory rate and oxygen requirment.
He was noted to have increasing secretions and a thickening of the secretions.
Patient is also complaing of chest pain, which appears to be chronic, and abdominal pain which is apparently a new complaint.
Patient reports some nausea today, but no vomiting.
Reports fevers and chills over the past two days.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension -Hypothyroidism -Prostate cancer s/p XRT -h/o esophageal CA s/p XRT with 3-hole esohagectomy in [**2104**] at [**Hospital1 112**].
Recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for PNA and found to have stricture near cricopharyngeus, with evidence of TEF.
EGD showed no cancer recurrence.
J-tube placed [**4-/2119**] -Small bowel obstruction -Cognitive deficit NOS vs limited safety awareness -Orthostatic hypotension - hospitalization [**1-/2119**] after fall -DVT of the L subclavian and L axillary vein -R hip fracture s/p ORIF by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] @ [**Hospital1 112**] -RLL PNA [**1-11**], treated with levofloxacin -multiple stab wounds to the abdomen in the [**2079**] -right sided PTX after bronchoscopy s/p CT placement -Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy -R wrist and hand surgery   Social History: Originally from [**State 9512**].
One daughter lives in [**State 4260**], another is in [**Name (NI) 86**], [**First Name3 (LF) 2184**] who is very involved.
Retired construction worker and plumber  Family History: Mother died of a blood clot.
Sister died of obesity and "fat around her heart"  Physical Exam: VS: T: 97.5  HR: 80-90's Sr  BP: 110-130 RR 15-19  Sats: 100% 40% TC Overnight CPAP 40% 7/5 General: sitting up in no apparent distress HEENT: mucus membranes moist Neck: Trach in place Cardiac: RRR Resp: clear breath sounds, strong/productive cough GI: J-tube in place Wound: Vac dressing in place, changed [**2119-11-7**] site with good granulated tissue.
IV: Right PICC site clean no erythema Neuro: awake alert, oriented.
There is little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs and monitoring and support devices.
Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis are again seen.
Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels again is consistent with some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 93756**] was admitted from the ED on [**2119-10-3**] with hypotension and tachycardia.
While in the ED he was given a fluid challenge with a good response He was re-started back on his previous antibiotics meropenum for multidrug resistant Klebsiella bacteremia and Proteus bacteremia, and Linezolid for VRE UTI.
RUQ ultrasound showed a dilated gallbladder.
CT Torso showed small bowel which has herniated through the diaphgragmatic hiatus adjacent to the gastric pull-up.
On [**2119-10-7**] he had Flexible upper endoscopy with endoscopic placement of nasogastric tube (which he pulled out and was later replaced).
A fistula could not be visualized but we could clearly see the Jagwire as it entered the stomach about a centimeter below the esophagogastric anastomosis, therefore identifying the fistula location.
Pt's white count and fever curve improved over the next week and a half, and his antibiotic regimen was then stopped on [**10-17**].
On [**10-27**], the patient was thought to have aspirated some of his bilious NGT secretions, and a WBC to 14 was noted.
The patient has been afebrile since with a normal WBC count.
colonic obstruction in the setting of large amounts of NGT output.
An abdominal CT scan showed herniation of the transverse colon and part of the pancreas into the thoracic cavity.
The abdomen was left open after this operation due to concerns that his large amount of ascites and increased abdominal pressure would not allow for adequate closure.
On [**10-17**], a [**State 19827**] patch was placed to facilitate stepwise abdominal closure.
After hernia repair and [**State **] patch placement, the patient continued to have copious bilious drainage from the NGT placed in the gastric conduit and intolerance of NGT clamping.
A SBFT study was obtained on [**10-27**] which showed no contrast movement through the pylorus.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**11-1**] for an EGD, which showed that the likely source of the patient's obstructive symptoms was a "hairpin turn" like kink in his proximal duodenum, just after the pylorus.
During the same operation on [**11-1**], the patient's midline abdominal wound was assessed.
It was concluded that the [**State 19827**] Patch was no longer able to preserve the patient's abdominal domain, and it was exchanged for a wound vac.
The wound vac was changed every 3 days following it's initial placement with no issues.
Nutrition: Tube feeds were intially stopped due to bilious NG output.
Heme: Pt received a total of 6U PRBC and 6 vials of albumin over the course of his hospital stay for both low hematocrit and low intravascular volume.
