He had difficulty putting his pants on, which is different for him, and complained of abdominal pain, possibly in the RUQ, but the history is not very specific.
They went to BIDN where he had an RUQ ultrasound which showed pericholecystic fluid that was concerning for GB carcinoma.
No abdominal pain here.
Ultrasound done at the bedside in ED was conerning for GB stone and sludge and incidentally noted a pericardial effusion with RV collapse.
He was given a nicotine patch and 5mg Zyprexa for agitation  AT [**Hospital1 18**], he was noted to have [**Last Name (un) **] which was thought to be hypovolemic and creatinine improved with intravenous fluids.
He was given vitamin k 5 mg po x for elevated INR and subsequently underwent pericardiocentesis.
TTE pre-pericardiocentesis showed wire/catheter in anterior pericardial space but EKG showed few ventricular pacing capture beats.
Post-pericardiocentesis TTE showed no residual pericardial effusion.
EOMI, no scleral icterus noted Mouth and lips appear very dry but no clear lesions noted JVD not noted CTAB with light dry sounding crackle at R base, o/w CTAB S1/S2 very faint, almost inaudible, best heard at the apex Abd soft, nontender in any quadrant, no hepatomegaly No BLE edema but with prominent chronic venous stasis changes.

Bilateral pleural effusions are small to moderate associated with bibasilar consolidations that based on their size most likely represent atelectases and are unlikely to represent infectious process.

There is a focal opacity noted at the left apex, 2:9, which might represent infectious process that should be further followed to exclude the possibility of neoplasm.

Pericardial Effusion: TTE in MICU showed tamponade physiology with right ventricular diastolic collapse.
He was taken to cath lab for pericardiocentesis which revealed pericardial pressure of 18 mm Hg concerning for pericardial effusion due to pacemaker lead perforation.
He had only 50 cc of pericardial fluid drainage over next day with repeat TTE showing no change in residual pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology.
CXR showed appropriate location of right atrial and right ventricular pacemaker leads.
Surgery evaluated the patient and thought that further outpatient evaluation was appropriate as the patient did not have an obstructive pattern in LFT elevation.
Simvastatin was held with concern for transaminitis.
RUQ and CT abdomen showed no liver patholgoy.
Atiral fibrillation s/p dual chamber PPM on Coumadin: INR supratherapeutic on admission.
No source of infection noted.
He was discharged on Olanzapine prn for agitation although it is noted by nursing that this has not been a very effective medicine.
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure with EF of 35% (TTE [**4-/2203**]) and severe aortic stenosis.
He was noted to be tachypnic and hypoxic on [**2203-5-13**] with bibasilar crackles on exam.
He has bibasilar crackles, 1+ peripheral edema but no O2 requirement on discharge.
He should have a low Na diet.
Peripheral vascular Disease: Discontinued home Cilostazol since it could affect systolic heart function and likely has no benefit for the patient's peripheral vascular disease.
Hypertension: Home amlodipine and moxepril were held on admission with concern for pericardial effusion but restarted on [**2203-5-14**].
12. olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO once a day as needed for agitation.
Pericardial effusion due to right atrial pacemaker lead perforation of right atrial wall 2.
Discharge Instructions: You had some dizziness and abdominal pain and was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after an ultrasound showed some fluid around your gallbladder.
An echocardiogram of your heart showed that there was some fluid there as well and a drain was placed to drain the fluid and keep it from reaccumulating.
You also had a different heart rhythm called aflutter that needs to be evaluated by an electrophysiologist in a few weeks.
FOLLOWING MEDICATION CHANGES WERE MADE TO YOUR MEDICAL REGIMEN STOP CILASTAZOL with concern for its adverse effect on your heart START LASIX 20 mg by mouth once a day START CLINDAMYCIN PILLS TO PREVENT AN INFECTION AT THE PACER SITE.
