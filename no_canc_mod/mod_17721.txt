Brief Hospital Course: OVERALL SUMMARY OF COURSE OF ILLNESS 78 year old woman with history of CAD, afib, smoking, alcoholism, GERD w/esophageal strictures, osteoporosis s/p hip fracture ([**2119**]), poor nutritional intake, presents as transfer from CCU after prolonged hospitalization at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital and [**Hospital1 **] for chest pain that included cardiac catherization (complicated by brachial artery thrombosis), heart failure, remeron-induced delirium, iatrogenic renal failure, and finding of an incidental mass of kidney.
The patient was in the midst of a 1-month long program supervised by her primary care doctor to improve her nutritional intake when, one morning in early [**Month (only) **] she developed nausea and pain up and down her arms.
Upon admission to the OSH, patient was in Afib with RVR and reported ST changes concerning for digitalis toxicity.
She developed ST elevations thought secondary to demand ischemia.
She was felt to be in heart failure with and was aggressively diuresed with furosemide.
The patient was admitted to the ICU for her renal failure.
UA demonstrated 10-25 WBCs with 2+ bacteria and she was started on levofloxacin.
Additionally, an echo demonstrated EF 20%, akinesis except base and inferior-lateral wall.
She also became hypotensive and was started on dopamine.
She was transferred to the CCU team for further management of her CHF and likely cardiogenic shock.
She had a moderate diuresis with improvement in both her blood pressures and her creatinine.
She has had occasional episodes of hypotension with low urine output for unclear reasons.
Differential includes persistent CHF and poor PO intake.
As a complication of the catheterization, she developed a femoral thombus.
She underwent emergent thrombectomy and as a complication developed brachial thrombus as well.
Following surgical thrombectomy, the patient complained of pain her abdomen and was found to incidentally have a growth on her kidney on renal ultrasound.
While the abdominal pain resolved, the patient was felt to have a depressed appetite and was started on a trial of the antibiotic Remeron.
The patient's hospitalization was further complicated by a fall for which she had head imaging that was not concerning for an acute bleed.
Over the past week, the patient and family underwent consultation with palliative care physicians because of her overall failure to thrive and the patient was awaiting placement to a rehabiliation facility when she develoepd an elevated white count (13).
A chest x-ray showed a question of a consolidation and she was started on treatment for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.
OTHER ISSUES DURING ADMISSION -Apical Thrombus Her echo on admission demonstrated a possible apical thrombus and she was maintained on anticoagulation for this (in addition to her atrial fibrillation) - E.coli UTI and possible pyelo - she was started levofloxacin on [**2131-11-12**] for an E.coli UTI and then transitioned to cipro.
The patient developed abdominal pain and an elevated WBC on [**2131-11-8**] raising the concern for pyelonephritis; however her pain and leukocytosis improved.
Initial nutrition assessment on [**11-15**] recommended NGT with tube feeds, supplements, and a bedside speech and swallow on [**11-15**] demonstrated no aspiration but concerns of stricture causing her poor intake.
She received a short course of TPN ([**Date range (1) 65265**]) for poor PO intake but after she pulled her NGT.
- Acute renal failure - Patient was admitted with elevated creatinine.
Her creatinine improved steadily with diuresis, making pre-renal renal failure secondary to poor forward flow most likely.
- EtOH - Patient's malnutrition and many of her medical problems are thought most likely secondary to her alcoholism.
- s/p fall and hypotension - On [**2131-11-27**], she triggered after she fell and also for hypotension with SBP in the 80s.
An echo that day demonstrated elevated PA pressure concerning for PE.
Differential for her fall and hypotension were concerning for PE, decreased PO, and infection.
- thoracentesis on [**2131-12-4**] - Patient has been noted to have persistent bilateral pleural effusions and she underwent a thoracentesis on [**2131-12-4**] without complication.
- altered mental status - On the day of transfer to medicine ([**2131-12-11**]), patient developed hypoxia requiring 2L nasal canula and leukocytosis to 15, raising concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Echocardiography showed a decresed ejection fraction (30%) with distal akinesis of LV and RV.
Also noted a mural thrombus.
She was previously on anticoagulation via heparin drip for her atrial fibbrilation and that was continued.
Cath was deferred initially due to increasing WBC count and flank pain concerning for possible pyelonephritis.
Ua c/w persistent UTI although not overly suggestive of pyelonephritis.
Renal USD was obtained that showed no evidence of perinephric abscess, stones or hydronephrosis.
Patient remained afebrile, and cardiac cath was performed on [**11-21**] demonstrating peripheral arterial disease without significant coronary disesase, she developed a brachial artery thrombus post procedure and required surgical exploration and successful removal of thrombus from the brachial artery.
Her initial two echocardiograms revealed a depressed LVEF and a Takatsubo pattern to her contractility, this resolved, also consitent with this entity.
She developed pleural effusions which were large (especially on the left) during her stay and responded slowly to diuresis, she had a left thoracentesis and subsequently was sating 100% on room air, though this rapidly reaccumulated secondary to her low albumen and poor nutritional status.
In consultation with the pulmonary team, her pleural effusions were thought to be worsened by recurrent mucous plugging causing left lung collapse.
CXR prior to discharge showed persistent bilateral effusions.
Her chronic atrial fibrillation was rate controlled with metoprolol throughout her course.
She had one episode of afib with RVR 2d prior to discharge which was quickly rate controlled with the administration of 10mg of IV diltiazem.
Given her lack of response in terms of appetite (although she was more alert and awake), it would be advisable to stop this medication should she experience another episode of rapid ventricular respose to her atrial fibrillation.
GU/Renal:  Patient initially with UTI (E-coli which was pan-sensitive), treated with Levofloxacin, treatment complete, follow up urine cultures neagtive.
Creatinine increased to 2.3 upon admission, likely ATN, cardiogenic shock possibly post cath and contrast nephropathy in the setting of heart failure, with improvement of heart failure her renal function improved.
Renal USD demonstrated a probable angiomyolipoma and radiology recommneded rec'd CT abdomen or MRI for further evaluation, she should have this as a follow up as an outpatient in the future.
GI: Patient with poor PO intake (200 cal/day), and dysphagia, she states she doesn't eat because she has a poor appetite, not because of the dysphagia or because of dyspepsia or any other reason.
During hospitalization it was learned patient has history of esophageal dilation in past (x2).
As far as her diet, she was repeatedely encouraged to eat and with some encouragement she does make small steps and take in some PO and some ensure, her family members were helpful in this regard.
No signs of ETOH withdrawal during admission.
Both she and her family refused any more definitive treatment such as PEG or NGT for increased nutritional repletion.
She was given TPN for approximately one week, however, began to exhibit signs of volume overload, therefore this was discontinued.
Patient also had a trial of methylphenidate with minimal improvement in oral intake (but increased wakefulness and interaction with family and staff).
Mental status: the patient had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status for the majority of her stay, she would become delerious (disoriented and somnolent) without any clear cause, toxic / metabolic causes were ruled out and appropriate head imaging was performed with no yield.
The patient was back to her baseline AOx3 with mild dementia upon discharge.
Infectious disease: Prior to transfer to the medicine service, the patient developed an increasing productive cough with a leukocytosis.
Given her [**Hospital 5610**] hospital stay, her CXR appearing and her clinical status, she will be treated for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn for a 7 day course.
She completed this course on [**12-17**] and was afebrile for several days prior to discharge.
