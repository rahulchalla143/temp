Admission Date:  [**2198-7-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2198-7-15**]   Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with severe end-stage Alzheimer's dementia with severe cognitive impairment who has been nonverbal for the past two years, with a history of aspiration pneumonia in the past, and a known inability to manage her secretions.
She then became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 60/palp and was started on a dopamine drip at 24 mcg/kg and given a 500-cc bolus of normal saline times six.
A urinalysis showed moderate bacteria, positive nitrites, 0 to 2 white blood cells, 6 to 10 epithelial cells, and trace leukocyte esterase.
An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 88 beats per minute, with left axis deviation, no new ST-T wave changes.
A chest x-ray showed slight cardiomegaly and a question of a left lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient was thought to have systemic inflammatory response syndrome secondary to pneumonia or urosepsis and was aggressively hydrated and switched to Levophed which was quickly weaned off.
The patient had a head, chest, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography to investigate the source of the infection which revealed a possible left lower lobe pneumonia with air bronchograms and a left thickened kidney urothelium.
A follow-up ultrasound showed a stone at the ureteral pelvic junction of 4.5 mm with no hydronephrosis.
A computed tomography of the head showed opacification of the mastoid air cells with mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinus and air/fluid levels in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
History of aspiration pneumonia in [**2197-11-22**] and in [**2198-2-20**].
History of Clostridium difficile colitis.
History of stroke with a subdural hematoma in [**2191**]; which was treated surgically with excavation.
Left hip fracture; status post open reduction/internal fixation in [**2183**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Lung examination revealed coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Extremity examination revealed edema in the right arm.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was thought to have septic shock versus hypovolemic shock.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
She remained euvolemic and with good blood pressures for the remainder of her hospital stay.
FEVER/WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT/BANDEMIA ISSUES:  The patient was thought to have either a pneumonia or urosepsis.
A chest computed tomography showed a possible left lower lobe infiltrate, and the patient was a known aspiration risk.
As there was no hydronephrosis and no signs of blockage, there was no surgical intervention.
ANEMIA ISSUES:  Anemia likely due to chronic disease with an initial drop on admission due to the dilutional effect of fluid resuscitation.
Although dressings were continually changed, this bile had caused severe erythema and excoriation and skin breakdown around the area of the gastrojejunostomy tube.
There were many conversations with the patient's son regarding this issue, as he was quite distraught at her tube feeds being stopped for any number of hours.
This was thought to be due to her pneumonia which was compromising her airway.
In addition, it was noted that she had lots of secretions which she was unable to mobilize without aggressive suctioning.
There were several sessions with the son about the code status with the attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; however, the son insisted absolutely that the patient remain a full code status even though he agreed that this would be harmful to his mother.
The medical team was very uncomfortable with the patient's code status especially considering that the son had not seen his mother since [**Month (only) 359**] and that she seemed to have a very limited quality of life.
However, upon discussion with other physicians, he did agree that she could stay until the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was replaced and until her respiratory status returned to baseline.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Urinary tract infection with signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
Dementia and conditions classified elsewhere without behavioral disturbance.
