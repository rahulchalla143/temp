Admission Date:  [**2143-3-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2143-3-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-6-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 39-year-old African- American female with history of HIV, whose last CD4 count is approximately 260 with a viral load of less than 50, end-stage renal disease secondary to HIV nephropathy, who presents with fever and hypotension.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] for right middle lobe pneumonia several weeks prior to admission.
Several days prior to admission, patient also experienced a seizure.
She states that she has not felt well since having a seizure.
Patient presents to the Emergency Department with complaints of increased generalized pain, dry cough, and fever to 105.
The patient does complain of pain in her left knee and thigh.
End-stage renal disease secondary to HIV nephropathy.
Severe mitral regurgitation per echocardiogram in [**2141**].
There is no lymphadenopathy noted.
Cardiac examination revealed a normal S1, S2, the rate was tachycardic, there was a [**2-14**] holosystolic ejection murmur throughout the precordium.
There was no costovertebral angle tenderness appreciated.
There is a failed A-V fistula in her left forearm with a working fistula on the right side.
There are no focal deficits and the patient is moving all extremities.
ASSESSMENT:  Patient is a 39-year-old female with HIV, end-stage renal disease, recent pneumonia, and new onset seizure, who presents with fever, dry cough, and hypotension without alteration in mental status.
Given patient's hypotension and concern for sepsis:  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
Hypotension:  Within three days of admission, the patient had resolution of her hypotension.
Although the initial etiology was thought to be secondary to sepsis, patient failed to develop fever, white count, and all culture data remained negative.
Thus, it was thought that patient's presentation of hypotension was indeed secondary to a clonidine patch that was unbeknownst at time of admission.
By hospital day #3, patient's hypotension resolved completely, and she was transferred to the General Medicine floor.
Infectious disease:  Given patient's immunocompromised status, history of recurrent pneumonia and complaints of pleuritic chest pain.
The patient was initially started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible sources of recurrent pneumonia.
Given that patient's culture data remained negative, though with continued right middle lobe consolidation on chest x-ray, antibiotic therapy was adjusted to include only ceftazidime.
Given persistent right middle lobe infiltrate on CT scan with slight hemoptysis, Pulmonary was consulted.
HIV:  Patient was continued on HAART therapy throughout this hospital stay without complication.
Given negative blood cultures, there is no concern that her presentation could be consistent of that of a line infection that would possibly compromise her hemodialysis.
History of seizures:  Patient remained asymptomatic throughout this hospital stay.
Human immunodeficiency virus.
End-stage renal disease.
