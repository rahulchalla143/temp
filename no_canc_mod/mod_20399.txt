Admission Date:  [**2185-3-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-3-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2140-9-1**]       Sex:  M  Service:  GENERAL SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44-year-old male, transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] diagnosed with ischemic bowel, portal veinous air and pneumatosis of the colon and stomach who had presented with complaints of nausea, melena, diarrhea and abdominal pain.
Positive for acute renal failure- creatinine 2.5, acidosis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY/SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for mental retardation/autism.
Cardiac exam revealed a regular rhythm with tachycardia, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, but distended with very mild tenderness upon palpation, right lower quadrant greater than left lower quadrant.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 44-year-old male, with a question of a diagnosis of bowel ischemia at outside hospital, transferred here with bradycardia, though the patient appeared to be making improvement with systolics of 120, and he was clinically stable.
No obvious evidence of clinical peritonitis, or urgent need for the OR since the resuscitation.
The patient was taken to the operating room after CT abdomen was reviewed with radiology which revealed dilated small bowel with pneumatosis, and some portal venous air, colon with thickening, some free-fluid in the abdomen, as well.
The patient had a baseline exam of abdominal distention, which though at first was worrisome, but when correlated with the clinical picture of the patient tolerating his diet and not having any recurrence of his nausea or vomiting, it was felt safe to proceed to advance the patient's diet.
Hypovolemia with acidosis 3.
