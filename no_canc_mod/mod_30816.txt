The mucosa was heaped up around this adherent clot but no discrete ulceration was seen.
in the stomach (injection, endoclip) Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 23081**] is a 60 yo F with a past history of CAD s/p CABG, PVD s/p recent SFA stent, Carotid steonsis s/p CEA, DM, CKD, CHF presented with weakness, dizziness and was found to be anemic with HCT 22 from baseline 35.
She was found to have a clotted vessel in antrum on EGD which was subsequently injected and clipped.
This bleeding vessel likely due to PUD in the setting of antiplatelet medications (Plavix and ASA.)
# Anemia: Secondary to acute blood loss.
Plavix and aspirin, and hypertensives were initially held given blood loss and relative hypotension.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: initial Cr 2.3 that improved to 1.3.
This was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor forward flow and hypovolemia from GI bleed.
# Asymptomatic but culture + UTI: Patient has a history of pan-sensitive Klebsiella UTIs with sulfa/cipro/levo allergy.
We did not want to give nitrofurantoin with renal failure and so began treatment with Ceftriazone (1 day) which was switched to Cefpodoxime for a 6 day course (day 1 [**2134-7-17**]).
# Diabetes Type 2: Before admission, the patient reported difficult to control blood glucose levels at home over the past 2 days.
BS continued to be high- given HgA1C 12.4 [**2134-6-4**], we increased Lantus to 23 U for discharge.
We recommend that this patient be followed by a NP[**MD Number(3) 18184**] PCP's office for close diabetic F/U.
# HTN:  Patient is normally treated for hypertension with Metoprolol, Amlodipine, Lasix, Spironolactone and Losartan.
# Chest Pain: She did complain of mild chest pressure once during admission, but ruled out for MI with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes, serial EKGs were unchanged, pain resolved spontaneously.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper GI bleed causing anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you felt dizzy and we found that you had very low blood levels (low hematocrit.)
When you arrived, your creatinine was higher than normal, which indicated kidney problems, most likely due to your low blood levels.
Your bleeding vessel could have been due to an ulcer which then exposed a blood vessel; ulcers can be made worse by NSAIDs (ibuprofen, motrin, alleve) and alcohol so you should avoid these things as well as follow up with your primary care doctor.
It could also just be a blood vessel very close to the stomach's surface.
Because low blood volume causes low blood pressure, we stopped your antihypertensive medications while you were in the hospital.
Finally, we treated you for a urinary tract infection while you were in the hospital.
You did not have any symptoms but you did have bacteria in your urine.
You should make an apppointment in 6 weeks to followup with a GI doctor.
