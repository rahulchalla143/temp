Admission Date:  [**2121-12-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-1-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-6-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: Found down  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: 64 yo F hx DM II (on lantus and lispro) presented after being found unresponsive by landlord in [**Hospital3 **] facility.
The patient was initiatilly in atrial fibrilattion with occasional PVCs, initially hypotensive to 70's/palp, although after initial bolus HR was 79 and BP 165/117.
Pt was noted to become hypertensive to 220's and given nitro paste.
Past Medical History: DM II, insulin dependent on lantus 40 Units qAM and lispro sliding scale, HgbA1C 5.2 on [**2121-11-21**] (improved from 15 in the past) HTN Leg pain (EMG suggestive of demyelinating process), seen by neuro [**10-22**], who recommended LP.
Comedone nodule below xiphoid process   Social History: lives at [**Hospital3 **] facility, divorced, no children.
Family History: father died at 46 from complication of DM mother died at 86, hx HTN brother with ESRD [**3-20**] HTN, s/p renal tx, died from ICH   Physical Exam: Vitals: Temp 96.1, HR 103, BP 114/100, O2 sat: 100% on AC Gen: elderly female, intubated, sedated, unresponsive, hair with feces remnants HEENT: R eye with surroundin ecchymosis, ET tube in place, loose teeth and poor dentition Resp: CTA b/l with good BS, no crackles or wheezes CV: RRR nl s1, s2, II/VI SEM at LUSB, + carotid bruit on R Abd: soft, NT, ND, no HSM, + BS Extr: areas of ecchymoses with some skin excoriation on anterior dependent portions, no edema, 2+ distal pulses Neuro: moves all extremities spontaneously, PERRL, eyes move laterally spontaneously in rhythmic fashion.
CT head IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Echogenic renal cortex.
Unusual appearance, including relatively acute infarcts in the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere and left frontal cortex and subcortical white matter.
Their dispersed location and apparent slight difference in age, as well as the relatively normal cranial MRA, raise the possibility of embolic events from a central (i.e., cardiac or aortic) source.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
Less marked and discrete decreased diffusion in the left posterior parietooccipital cortex, without correlate on the other sequences, which may represent transient diffusion abnormality related to the given history of status epilepticus (though such process often demonstrates enhancment).
No mass or pathologic focus of enhancement.
Extensive acute-on-chronic inflammatory change in the sphenoid sinus.
Unremarkable cranial MRA, with no flow-limiting stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the MICU with altered mental status and hypoglycemia (in field), hypothermia after being found down.
Persistent coma- Patient initially presented with both hypothermia and hypoglycemia and was obtunded.
The patient was found to have seizures on the second day of hospitalization on EEG and was treated with ativan and dilantin.
Further eval by neurology revealed no obvious reversible causes of the patient's diminished mental status.
LP showed no signs of infection and MRI showed small infarcts.
Per neurology there were no obvious reversible causes and with the progression to decerebrate posturing the prognosis was poor.
Hypothermia - pt initially hypothermic to 30 degrees C. No clear environmental factors to explain such degree of hypothermia as pt was indoors.
Decreased heat production from hypoglycemia or other endocrine abnormalities a possibility.
Hypoglycemia - pt with extremely low BS on presentation.
Causes for profound hypoglycemia were likely a combination of being found down as well as prolonged action of lantus.
VAP- Patient found to be febrile with high WBC as well as increase in pulmonary secretions, the patient was kept on vancomycin.
Pain was controlled with concentrated morphine elixir and respiratory distress was controlled with sublingual lorazepam.
