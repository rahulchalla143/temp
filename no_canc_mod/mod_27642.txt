During her ICU course she had afib with RVR and was placed on diltiazem drip.
She an episode of possible aspiration and was treated with hydrocortisone lavage.
Her tube feeds were gradually increased and G tube was to gravity putting out thick bilious fluid.
She was treated with prokinetics with minimal decrease in G tube output.
There was no obvious obstruction but she did have a 5cm stricture at the colostomy site.
Post cscope she had significant increase in her ostomy output with subsequent decrease of the Gtube output.
Her pain was initially controlled with IV pain medications but was transitioned to fentanyl patch at 75mcg.
This was weaned off over the last 3 weeks of her hospitalization and at discharge was on no narcotic pain medications.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and EKG showed no ST changes.
She had some respiratory distress early in her hospitalization due to aspiration and was treated with hydrocortisone lavage.
She developed multiple UTI's and was treated intermittently with IV abx for these infections.
