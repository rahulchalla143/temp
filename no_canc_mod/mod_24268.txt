Liver Ultrasound to rule out hepatic vein thrombosis, [**2162-7-4**]: IMPRESSION:  Patent hepatic vessels as described above.
Cirrhotic liver with moderate amount of ascites.
Mild wall thickening of the ascending, transverse and sigmoid colon without significant inflammatory stranding and no mural gas.
Findings are consistent with nonspecific colitis with infectious cause such as C. difficile colitis more likely.
Two small hepatic hypodense foci, which are too small to definitively characterize but probably cysts.
Mottled appearance of the pelvic bones and proximal femurs without expansion or periosteal reaction.
Overall has a nonaggressive appearance and may represent the lytic phase of Paget Disease or less likely an infiltrative process.
EGD [**2162-7-4**] Grade 3 esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction Erosion in the stomach body Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 65312**] is a 55 year old male with h/o EtOH cirrhosis, esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, varices, and gastropathy with multiple previous UGIB's presenting with UGIB .
# UGIB: Mr. [**Known lastname 65312**] has a known history of esophageal varices from alcoholic cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia likely from chronic EtOH use and splenic sequestration.
He presented from an outside hospital with an UGIB with hemodynamic instability with an INR 1.9, and platelets 16K and was admitted to the MICU.
# Thrombocytopenia: Mr. [**Known lastname 65313**] thrombocytopenia is likely due to cirrhosis and chronic EtOH use.
# Coagulopathy: Mr. [**Known lastname 65313**] coagulopathy is likely due to hepatic synthetic dysfunction.
He has no known history of withdrawals.
# Elevated LFTs: His transaminases and bilirubin are elevated from baseline.
His AST > ALT is suggestive of acute alcoholic hepatitis, but his AST:ALT <2.
His LFTs are Also with obstructive picture as his bilirubin elevated.
A RUQ ultrasound was perfomed while the patient was in the MICU to rule out a hepatic vein thrombosis.
# Abdominal Pain, Diarrhea: Shortly after Mr. [**Known lastname 65312**] was transferred out of the MICU, he began to experience fever spikes (100-103), abdominal pain and diarrhea.
A CT scan was obtained for concern of an acute process but the CT scan was negative for obstruction or an acute process.
Some thickening of the colonic wall was seen on CT scan, throught to be consistent with a colitis such as C dif colitis.
# CT Findings, Mottled appearance of the pelvic bones and proximal femurs without expansion or periosteal reaction.
Overall has a nonaggressive appearance and may represent the lytic phase of Paget Disease or less likely an infiltrative process.
