History of Present Illness: 88 yo M with PMH significant for HTN, h/o stroke [**2156**] and DVT on coumadin, dementia presents with chest pain.
The patient is a poor historian due to his dementia and thus history of taken with the help of his wife.
The patient was in his normal state of health until last night when he complainted of chest discomfort to his wife.
The episode resolved until the AM when he woke up and complainted of severe chest tightness to his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] also was slightly diaphoretic, but denied SOB, nausea or vomiting.
The patient had ECG changes consistent with anterior STEMI and Code STEMI was called.
CXR showed early interstitial pulmonary edema.
The cath revealed 80% thrombotic mid-LAD lesion that was stented with a 3.0x15mm BMS, post with 3.0mm NC balloon.
He also had 80% lesions in ramus and mid RCA and a 90% stenosis in a small distal LCx.
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout and without complications.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

He was taken to cath and s/p BMS to 80% mid LAD lesion without further complication.
Patient with 80% lesions in ramus and mid RCA and a 90% stenosis in a small distal LCx that were not intervened as they were not likely the cause of his CP.
Pt developed another episode of chest pain, back discomfort and shoulder pain the following morning with no significant ECG changes.
He had no evidence of heart failure.
Follow up ECHO showed EF 35% with LV systolic dysfunction with akinesis of mid and distal anterior wall and septum, apex and distal inferior segment consistent with mid LAD infarct.
No intervention given pt already therapeutic on coumadin for h/o DVT.
Further intervention of mid RCA and ramus lesions should be considered as outpt.
