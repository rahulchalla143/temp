She was intiially at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and was started on Vanc/Gent and TTE revealed thickened mitral valve with vegetation.
She then became hypotensive to 70/50 requiring a low dose levophed and was transferred to [**Hospital1 2177**] ICU on [**4-22**].
She had some loose stools, was empirically started on flagyl, but then C. dif neg X 1 and flagyl stopped.
U/S of AVF negative for abscess; however, renal felt that if she peristantly spiked temps, then she should have tagged WBC scan to rule out AVF infection.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she has no complaints, answering only yes/no answers.

FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Inferior wall myocardial infarction probably old.
Poor R wave progression - cannot rule out old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2169-8-26**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
TEE [**2173-4-24**] No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %).
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a large vegetation with calcifications on the mitral valve (1.7cm in length) extending from the anterior mitral annulus.
No mitral valve abscess is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Large mitral valve vegetation consistent with endocarditis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation is present.
No abscess was apparent.
No acute intracranial process; specifically, no evidence of abscess or enhancing mass.
Ill-defined low-attenuation in right more than left periventricular white matter, likely representing chronic microvascular infarction.
No pathologic focus of enhancement.
Slowly progressive patchy and nodular consolidations predominating in the right upper lobe most likely represent an indolent granulomatous process, possibly sarcoidosis though granulomatous infection/bronchiolitis are other diagnostic considerations.
Prominent retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph nodes, more prominent compared to [**2164-1-24**] but of unclear etiology.
Massive right hydronephrosis and cortical thinning likely secondary to chronic right UPJ obstruction.
Findings raising the question of chronic pancreatitis.
Anasarca with bilateral small effusions and small ascites.
Doppler LE [**2173-4-28**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower legs.
___________________________________ MRA/MRI of brain [**2173-4-28**] IMPRESSION: Multiple infra- and supratentorial foci of restricted diffusion as described in detail above likely consistent with thromboembolic ischemic events.
MRA OF THE HEAD: There is evidence of vascular flow in both internal carotids, the left vertebral artery is patent and also the basilar artery, the right vertebral artery is not completely visualized and possibly ends in PICA, however occlusion secondary to arteriosclerosis cannot be completely excluded, diffuse lack of signal is visualized in the distal branches also possibly representing atherosclerotic disease, this is a limited examination secondary to motion artifacts, therefore the distal branches of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are not completely evaluated.
_______________________________________ TEE on [**2173-4-29**] No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There are 2 large vegetations (1.7cm and 1.4 cm in lengths) and a third smaller vegetation (0.3 cm) arising from the base of the anterior mitral valve leaflet.
Also seen is a possible small vegetation associated with the right cusp of the aortic valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Due to acoustic shadowing, this study was not adequate to exclude an abscess.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
No definite abscess seen, but cannot be excluded with certainty.
IMPRESSION: Large vegetations consistent with endocarditis of the mitral valve.
No abnormal tracer uptake.
Massive right hydronephrosis and cortical thinning consistent with a classic longstanding ureteropelvic junction obstruction dating back to at least [**2163**].
Possible chronic pancreatitis.
___________________________________________ MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2173-5-7**] FINDINGS: Again multiple areas of slow diffusion are identified in the white matter in the periventricular region including involvement of the corpus callosum.
Small focus of signal abnormalities seen in the right cerebellum and also in the left side of the brain stem.
Overall the foci have evolved since the previous study and no definite new abnormalities are seen.
There is no midline shift noted.
Mild brain atrophy identified.
IMPRESSION: Evolution of previously noted acute subcortical infarcts in the supra and infratentorial regions.
No new signal abnormalities are seen.
EEG [**2173-5-9**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG recording in the awake and sleeping states due to the slow background suggestive of a mild encephalopathy.
There were no lateralized or epileptiform features seen.
Brief Hospital Course: #Methicillin-senstive staph aureus mitral valve endocarditis - OSH blood cultures showed high-grade MSSA bacteremia and echo demonstrated mitral thickening with 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 61539**] densities prolapsing into the left atrium LA.
Ultrasound and tagged WBC scan did not reveal a source of infection in the LUE AV graft.
She was had transient hypotension requiring levophed prior to transfer.
TEE [**2173-4-24**] showed a 1.7 cm mitral valve vegetation, moderate MR but no apparent abscess.
Daily EKGs and telemetry monitoring did not show any evidence of conduction abnormality.
Given their preferences, as well as high operative morbidity, that the patient defervesced on antibiotic therapy, and that a repeat MRI did not show further evidence of cerebral septic emboli, the medical team agreed to continue with 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy (through [**2173-6-4**]).
#Endogenous staph aureus endophthalmitis, right eye - The patient was evaluated by ophthalmology for right eye visual complaints.
She was found to have evidence of endophthalmitis on exam and was treated immediately with intravitreal vancomycin and then with PPV on [**2173-5-10**].
#Cerebral septic thromboembolic disease - MRI of the brain on [**2173-4-28**] showed multiple infra- and supratentorial foci of restricted diffusion consistent with thromboembolic ischemic events.
There were no focal neurological findings on examination.
Repeat MR on [**2173-5-7**] showed evolution of these previously noted acute subcortical infarcts but no new signal abnormalities.
EEG showed mild non-specific encephalopathy.
#End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis - Continued HD Tu/Th/Sa with vancomycin given per HD protocol.
Patient did not have fever, nausea, abdominal pain or tenderness.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
