Admission Date: [**2142-5-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2142-5-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-10-5**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 60971**] is a gentleman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was evaluated by the cardiology service after a syncopal episode on [**2142-4-10**].
He did not have any associated chest pain or palpitations, but an EKG done at his primary care's office revealed evidence of an old myocardial infarction.
Because of this syncopal episode he underwent a stress test which demonstrated some ST and T wave abnormalities in the inferior and lateral precordial leads which increased with exercise.
He did have nuclear imaging which revealed a large severe inferolateral wall defect that was reversible and an inferolateral wall hypokinesis.
He was then referred to cardiology for catheterization and was found to have 3-vessel disease, and then he was brought to the cardiac surgery service for definitive treatment.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His father had coronary artery disease and a MI in his 60s.
His grandfather died of a MI in his 70s.
His mother had symptoms consistent with angina in her 50s.
He has no JVD and no carotid bruits.
His heart is regular with no murmurs.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  An echocardiogram done at an outside hospital in [**Month (only) 958**] demonstrated inferior and posterior hypokinesis, an EF of 45%, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
The stress test on [**2142-4-17**] demonstrated increased ST segment depression in the inferior and lateral precordial leads, large severe inferolateral wall defect reversible at the base which was fixed at the apex, and inferolateral hypokinesis with an EF of 40%.
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a hypokinetic inferior wall, a 100% RCA occlusion, a 70% LAD occlusion, a 95% proximal circumflex occlusion and a complete distally.
His preoperative EKG showed a sinus rhythm with left shift of his axis and lateral ST-T wave changes, consistent with an old MI.
Intraoperative events included a difficult intubation and an intraoperative bronchoscopy by the interventional pulmonary team.
This showed significant supraglottic swelling and epiglottitis with the 2 vocal cords normal.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  He is going to be discharged to home with home services to follow vital signs, and medications, and sternal wound which has remained clean, dry, and intact.
Coronary artery disease.
Supraglottic swelling and difficult airway.
