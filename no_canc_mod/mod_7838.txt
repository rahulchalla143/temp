Her postoperative course was complicated by suicidal ideations requiring a one-to-one sitter.
The patient was subsequently transferred to Medical Intensive thought to be a combination of uremia secondary to acute on chronic renal failure and necrotic infection.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the EKG showed new inferior ST elevations and the patient subsequently ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction with peak CK of 369, MB of 23 and troponin of 38.5.
Preoperative stress MIBI on [**6-26**], had shown moderate defects anteriorly, inferiorly, laterally and apically, with marked diffuse hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 20%.
The patient was initially treated conservatively for an myocardial infarction with heparin, beta blocker, aspirin, ACE inhibitor.
In the catheterization, the patient was discovered to have three-vessel disease and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of Obtuse marginal 1 lesion with good results.
Post-catheterization, the patient did not have any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, vomiting or other complaints.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction on [**7-9**]; catheterization on [**7-12**] with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to obtuse marginal.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for four years.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency which is now acute renal insufficiency on hemodialysis.
History of anti-phospholipid antibody.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination revealed a pleasant 51 year old woman in no acute distress.
There was no jugular venous distention.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs:  There were bilateral inspiratory and expiratory mild wheezes centrally more than peripherally consistent with tracheal stenosis.
Right foot ulcer is not necrosed and not cellulitic.
EKG post-PTCA shows normal sinus rhythm, inferior Qs consistent with inferior myocardial infarction, normal intervals, borderline left anterior descending, T wave inversions in leads I and AVL.
Per catheterization report, the patient has a severe three-vessel coronary artery disease, moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension, and successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the obtuse marginal 1.
Left anterior descending was diffusely diseased throughout its course to a 30% in proximal segment with serious lesions of up to 80% in the mid segment and 90% in the distal vessel.
Cardiac output was severely reduced with mildly elevated right sided and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
The patient did not have any complications post catheterization.
There is no groin hematoma.
The patient did not have any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting.
The patient had hemodialysis today on [**2130-7-13**].
Per Renal consultation, AV fistula was most likely needed.
The patient's renal issues:  The patient continued to have acute on chronic renal failure and will require hemodialysis at the rehabilitation facility.
Hematologically, the patient's anemia has been stable and hematocrit post-catheterization was unchanged.
In the rehabilitation, the patient will need PET and Conair bed for her sacral and decubitus ulcers.
The patient is not on an ACE inhibitor secondary to her renal failure.
