Admission Date:  [**2142-5-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-6-4**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: nausea, abdominal pain, and bilious emesis consistent with small bowel obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 4/16 L inguinal hernia repair [**5-17**] thoracentesis [**5-23**] tracheostomy/PEG placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is an 85 y/o F with abdominal pain X3 days with nausea and vomiting nonbloody bilious emesis.
Her pain is global and crampy in nature.
Virtual colonoscopy in [**Month (only) 958**] revealed 3.2 x 2.4 cm polypoidal villous-type adenoma in the right colon.
Past Medical History: Pancreatic cyst, Mitral valve disease, Severe tricuspid regurgitation, Aortic regurgitation, History of rheumatic fever, MVR, Chronic atrial fibrillation, Congestive heart failure, Iron deficiency anemia, Hypertension, Seizure disorder, CCY, Left inguinal hernia, Cerebellar infarcts  Social History: No alcohol.
No cigarette smoking.
She is accompanied by her son at the time of presentation   Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: At the time of discharge:  - Vitals stable (afebrile, HR in 70s, SBP ~120), maintaining adequate oxygenization on trach collar during the day, CPAP overnight - sleepy but arousable, alert, and conversant - lungs with crackles and diminished breath sounds bilaterally - heart irregular - abdomen soft but distended, G-tube in place without erythema or drainage; midline incision clean, dry, and intact with steri-strips intact; no significant tenderness to palpation - 1+ peripheral edema  Pertinent Results: At the time of discharge:  - her INR was therapeutic on oral coumadin with a level of 3.6 on [**6-4**] - her WBC was normal, and was 6.8 on [**6-4**] - her hematocrit was stable and 27.8 without evidence of bleeding - of note, her serum bicarbonate had increased slowly to a level of 45 on [**6-4**], with current plan to begin acetazolamide to normalize her labs  Brief Hospital Course: The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, and underwent a KUB which demonstrated multiple dilated loops of small bowel consistent with a small bowel obstruction.
Her bowel obstruction did not clinically improve, and she was therefore taken to the operating room on [**2142-5-10**] for lysis of adhesions and L inguinal hernia repair.
There was no evidence of intestinal ischemia at that time, and no bowel was resected.
She was found to have pleural effusions, and given the tenuousness of her respiratory status, she underwent thoracentesis on [**5-17**] where 700 cc of fluid was removed.
Neuro: the patient's mental status at the time of discharge was good - she is awake, alert, and responding appropriately to commands (speaking with use of a PMV).
Her pain was well controlled peri-operatively, and she is experiencing no pain at the time of discharge, requiring only occasional tylenol for relief.
CV: She remained in atrial fibrillation throughout her hospital course, and was appropriately rate-controlled with digoxin.
She had no significant hemodynamic events during her ICU stay.
She remained anti-coagulated and was on coumadin at the time of discharge for her mechanical valve.
Her home lopressor and lisinopril doses had not been resumed, although should she develop hypertension this can be re-started at rehab.
She was treated for pneumonia transiently with vancomycin/zosyn but was off all antibiotics at the time of discharge.
Her ventilatory support was weaned slowly, and at the time of discharge she was tolerating trach collar during the day and was being rested overnight on CPAP [**10-29**] for mild tachypnea.
She began to pass flatus and have BMs, and continued to do this at the time of discharge.
Of note, the patient failed speech and swallow on [**2142-5-31**] largely because of her respiratory status at the time.
At the time of discharge, the patient was tolerating her tube feeds at goal (nutren pulmonary at 35cc/hr), and although she had mild abdominal distention she had no nausea or vomiting.
Her abdominal incision was clean, dry, and intact without breakdown, erythema, or discharge.
At the time of discharge, she had developed a metabolic alkalosis and was receiving acetazolamide and holding her home dose of lasix, although this can be re-started at rehab if her bicarbonate normalizes.
ID: The patient was empirically treated for pneumonia during her hospital stay but by the time of discharge was afebrile, off all antibiotics, and with a normal WBC count.
She had no evidence of any infectious process at the time of discharge.
