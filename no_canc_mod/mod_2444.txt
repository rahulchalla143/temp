Admission Date:  [**2116-9-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-9-23**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension and transfer from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital for cardiac catheterization  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with placement of stent in LAD.
[**9-10**]: failed PTCA attempt (RCFA 8F) [**9-11**]: PTCA of LAD (RCFA 6F) [**9-15**]: R fem-plantar thrombectomy   History of Present Illness: 85 y/o male with h/o CAD s/p 4VCABG in [**2106**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D2 with jump graft to OM, and SVG to RCA), CHF (EF 45%), T2DM, HTN, and PVD, with multiple recent admissions for cath with stenting, last from [**Date range (1) 14629**] at which time cath revealed known occluded LIMA-LAD with non-flow limiting lesions in other grafts, and a discrete 90% stenosis of D1 that was ballooned, presenting from [**Hospital 882**] hospital with concern for STEMI.
He was recently discharged on [**9-2**], with hospital course notable, in addition to POBA of D1, for persistent CK elevation with normal MBI, thought to be myositis secondary to statin use and his statin was discontinued.
He also had an episode of AVNRT and was loaded on digoxin, however this was discontinued on discharge.
An EKG reportedly revealed ST depressions with TWI in V2-V3.
Labs were notable for mildly elevated creatinine of 1.2, hct 28.9, mild leukocytosis at 11.
A UA was positive and he was given unasyn as well as gentamicin due to concern for urosepsis.
The heparin drip was discontinued as ischemia was felt to be less likely at that point.
However, on the morning of [**9-10**], the patient was still hypotensive, with new ST elevations in V1-V3, as well as a troponin elevation to 5.7.
Catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] on the day of transfer revealed markedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures (PCWP 32, PA 60/28), as well as new 100% in stent stenosis of the LAD.
He denies any recent chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness.
COR:  RR, normal rate, very distant heart sounds.
EXTR:  Right foot with transmetatarsal amputation.
There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or heart failure.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process, unchanged compared to previous study.
No pneumonia or heart failure.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  demonstrated severe three vessel native coronary artery disease.
The left main demonstrated an ostial 30% lesion unchanged from prior  catheterization.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated right and left heart filling pressures (RVEDP = 18 mmHG and LVEDP = 29 mmHg).
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback from the left ventricle to the aorta.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction.
Successful angioplasty and stenting of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery with a 2.5x8mm MicroDriver bare metal stent.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic root.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Distal septal and apical akinesis and inferior hypokinesis are present.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[**9-14**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ARTERIAL NONINVASIVES AT REST.
There is a flat trace on the right and minimal deflection noted on the left.
IMPRESSION:  Significant bilateral lower extremity arterial occlusive disease.
There is no flow seen in the bypass graft.
CAD: Patient pmh included CAD status post CABG in [**2106**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D2 with jump graft to OM, and SVG to RCA), CHF (EF 45%), with 2 recent stents to LAD and D1, and he was transferred from OSH with concern for new ST elevations and increase in cardiac enzymes.
At [**Hospital1 18**], catheterization on [**9-10**] showed 100% in stent restenosis of the LAD stent, which could not be easily passed by balloon.
Due to length of procedure and concern for overexposure to fluoroscopy and dye-load, procedure was stopped and repeated on [**9-11**] with different fluoro angle.
Statin had been discontinued following last hospital stay (discharged [**9-4**]) due to concern about increased LFTs.
Hypotension: Patient had low blood pressures during hospital stay with systolic dipping below 80s during sleep.
Patient did not demonstrate symptoms of altered mental status or lightheadedness during these epidsodes.
Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors were held during stay due to low blood pressure.
UTI: Urinalysis at outside hospital was positive and patient was placed on levoquin.
Subsequent culture with sensitivity demonstrated resistance to levoquin and patient switched to piperacillin-tazobactam.
After confirming with the OSH laboratory, there was felt to be no concern for ESBL and he was discharged on Augmentin given sensitivity to Unasyn.
CHF: Echo this admission demonstrates an EF of 40% with apical akinesis and distal septal akinesis.
Notably echocardiograms from last two admissions this year included echos with dyskinesis, but not apical akinesis.
Patient was started on coumadin and bridged with heparin to prevent clot formation.
Amiodarone was briefly stopped during admission and patient had some runs of asymptomatic SVT.
[**Month/Year (2) **] Pt had an acute occlusion of Left Lower extremity BPG, post cardiac catherization.
Pt brought to OR had thrombectomy performed.
there were no complication.
ST elevation myocardial infarction with placement of LAD stent x 1.
Urinary tract infection 3. right fem to pantar thrombus .
Secondary: CAD HTN Hyperlipidemia T2DM Dementia   Discharge Condition: The patient was discharge hemodynamically stable, afebrile with appropriate follow up.
