Pt has a complicated PMH, including [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut Syndrome, mental retardation, and seizure disorder He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2164-5-4**] to [**2164-5-18**] and then subsequently to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation status post ex lap,open chole, J-tube placement and venting decompressed colotomy for abdominal pain.
It was unclear if the emesis was bilious or bloody.
No fevers recorded at living center.
No other focal complaints.

HEENT:  Oropharynx notable for somewhat dry membranes.
LUNG:  Complicated by poor effort, but no crackles are appreciated.
CARDIAC:  Notable for mild tachycardia.
There is no discharge.
No palpable organomegaly.
Neuro Exam very limited since pt is non-verbal at baseline and unable to cooperate with exam: MSE: Awake and alert; non-verbal CN: Pupils round and reactive equally (5-->3mm), EOMI intact (pt tracks in all directions), face symmetric and responds to sounds.
Large amount of fecal packing within the colon throughout the colon.
Mild to moderate dilitation of several loops of jejunum with concern for partial obstruction.
Complete obstruction is not present as some contrast travels into the proximal colon.
Large fluid distention of the stomach with reflux of fluid into the distal esophagus.
There are dilated loops of small bowel within the abdomen as well as air and stool seen throughout the colon.
There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 4.7 cm above the carina appropriately sited.
The left-sided IJ central venous catheter has the distal tip in the proximal SVC and is also unchanged.
Since the previous study, there has been development of diffuse airspace opacities, mostly at the lung bases, which can be compatible with the suggested history of aspiration.
Significant small bowel dilatation.
with narrowing of a single segment, concerning for obstruction.
Interval development of ascites may also support small bowel obstruction.
Bilateral airspace consolidation.
Ischemic enteritis with stricture.
Proximal dilation and focal hemorrhage.
Apparant 2.1 X 4.4 cm loculated fluid collection as described above could represent a fluid filled pelvic ileal loop.
Short term follow-up pelvic CT with oral contrast to evaluate for change or filling is suggested to aid differentiaion.
Improved bibasilar atelectasis and patchy ground glass and tree-and-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities suggesting resolving infectious process.
New small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
CT Pelvis ([**7-11**]): IMPRESSION: The previously described possible fluid collection on today's study appears to be a loculated pocket of ascites or intrapelvic abscess measuring 2.7 x 4.8 x 2.2 cm (AP, transverse, craniocaudal).
No other short term interval changes.
SBO: Pt was initially found to not have an obstruction or intra-abdominal free air.
The patient pulled out his NGT and was subsequently placed on UE restraints.
The NGT was not replaced as the patient subsequently had copious large bowel movements initially.
However, over the next few days, he continued to have trouble with SBO, and a significant high-grade bowel obstruction distal from the J-tube site was found on Abd CT on [**6-25**].
We tried to care for this with 2 days of conservative therapy, including venting of the J tube and NG decompression.
There was clearly no progression of his distention, and he was not making bowel movements, and since he is noncommunicative, the decision was made to not delay any further and operate on him.
He did have some anemia to 20.8 on [**7-3**], and was given 2URBCs which he responded well to.
The patient seemed to be more somnolent and less responsive on [**7-10**], and he had a repeat CT abdomen/pelvis which showed interval improvement in his SBO, but also a 2.1 X 4.4 cm loculated fluid collection as described above could represent a fluid filled pelvic ileal loop.
A subsequent Pelvic CT with PO contrast showed a loculated pocket of ascites or intrapelvic abscess measuring 2.7 x 4.8 x 2.2 cm.
The surgeons (including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] reviewed the films and determined that this was unlikely to be an abscess, and there was no need to take him for CT guided drainage or back to the OR.
Pt completed his course of PO vanco on [**7-1**], and was not having diarrhea at that time.
Seizures: The patient was found to be tachycardic and hypertensive on HD 2.
In context of his PMH, it was believed that he likely had a seizure.
While on neuro service, he had no increase in his usual seizure frequency.
Upper GI Bleed: On [**6-22**], pt had black vomitus which was guaiac positive hence NGT was placed and pt had copious black fluid output which was once again guaiac positive.
Pt did not have any IV access and peripheral access could not be obtained hence L IJ central line was placed per medical procedure team.
Pt had stat CBC, type and screen and IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] was started and GI was consulted who recommended CT scan to rule out obstruction.
Pt became hemodynamically unstable with decreasing BP and tachycardia plus decreased urine output, pt was transferred to MICU for intensive care.
Aspiration Pneumonia: While in the MICU, he developed respiratory failure, which was likely aspiration given significant amounts of gastric contents from OG tube after intubation.
CXR [**6-25**] showed increased prominence of the airspace consolidations at both bases, consistent with pneumonia.
Repeat CXR on [**7-10**] showed marked improvement compared to 10 days prior with small residual right lower lobe consolidation  6.
He has a history of hyponatremia secondary to Trileptal use.
This was thought to be a reactive thrombocytosis secondary to an underlying process, and not a primary bone marrow disorder.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: C. difficile colitis SBO from adhesions Ischemic bowel GI bleed Hyponatremia likely secondary to Trileptal Reactive Thrombocytosis  SECONDARY: [**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut syndrome Mental retardation s/p recent J-tube placement   Discharge Condition: Stable, nonverbal, moving all extremities against gravity, tracks eyes past midline, no obvious abdominal pain   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital with C. difficile colitis, and this treated with antibiotics.
You then had hematemesis and your blood pressure became low, consistent with an upper GI bleed.
You had an exploratory laparotomy, and were found to have an SBO secondary to adhesions and ischemic bowels s/p resection and primary anastamosis.
Your sodium remained low (130 at the time of discharge) during this hospitalization which is likely secondary to Trileptal use.
If you develop increased frequency of seizures, decreased responsiveness, abdominal pain, increased frequency of diarrhea, fevers/chills, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 850**], or return to the ED.
