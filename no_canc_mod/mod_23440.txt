Infant has been feeding well, voiding, stooling, normal newborn course until murmur was noted at the time of discharge examination today.
In the NICU, the infant appears healthy, pink, well perfused in no distress.
Due to  wide discrepancy in upper and lower extremity pulses and murmur, cardiovascular consult was called.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He generally appears healthy in no acute distress.
Equal breath sounds, no increased work of breathing.
Grade 2 systolic murmur in the left precordial parasternal area.
Murmur appears shorter, brisk compared to the systolic murmur noted in the left upper chest and left axilla.
Soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen.
ASSESSMENT:  Congenital heart disease, concern about possible coarctation and possible ventricular septal defect or aortic valve abnormality.
We just received history that the mother's father and his brother have a history of bicuspid aortic valve.
Both share the concern that the infant may have possible aortic arch abnormality consistent with coarctation.
The infant was transferred without incident.
