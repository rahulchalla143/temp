Admission Date: [**2186-6-21**]        Discharge Date: [**2186-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-7-20**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old Caucasian male patient with a history of peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery stenosis, status post a right carotid endarterectomy in [**2183**], complicated by cerebrovascular accident, and diverticulosis, who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2186-6-18**], with a several day history of black and bloody stools in addition to a six to twelve month history of lightheadedness and shortness of breath.
On admission to the outside hospital, the patient denied chest pain or pressure, jaw or arm pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, back pain, abdominal pain or orthopnea.
He described shortness of breath as progressive dyspnea on exertion over the last six to twelve months prior to admission.
A diagnostic cardiac catheterization showed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 1444**], the patient denies chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, palpitations, syncope, but does report mild chronic shortness of breath and lightheadedness on standing.
Cerebrovascular accident as a complication of his right carotid endarterectomy in [**2183**], manifested as dysarthria and ataxia.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Status post a fall in [**2185-7-19**], resulting in a broken shoulder, status post a second fall several days later resulting in a broken hip, status post pin placement.
In general, a well appearing elderly man, mildly confused in no acute distress.
There are no audible carotid bruits bilaterally.
Lungs - bibasilar crackles but otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm with multiple ectopic beats, normal S1 and S2, I/VI holosystolic murmur appreciated over the apex.
There is no evidence of edema.
Extremities - no evidence of cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
His cranial nerves II through XII are intact aside from dysarthria, hypophonia and a mild left sided facial droop.
The patient's motor examination is significant for [**5-24**] muscle strength throughout all muscle groups except for five minus out of five strength in the left triceps, left hip flexors with mildly increased tone on the left.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Coronary artery disease - The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with three vessel coronary artery disease as demonstrated on a diagnostic cardiac catheterization performed prior to transfer.
The patient had no complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath throughout his hospitalization and his beta blocker and ace inhibitor were titrated up as tolerated by his heart rate and blood pressure.
Congestive heart failure - The patient was evaluated with an echocardiogram on admission which demonstrated an ejection fraction of less than 20 percent, moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The patient had no signs or symptoms of volume overload on physical examination.
He had occasional episodes of premature ventricular contractions that were asymptomatic.
Gastrointestinal bleed - The patient was transferred from an outside hospital with a history of melena and hematocrit of 23.0 on initial presentation to the outside hospital.
The gastroenterology consult service was consulted and performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2186-6-22**], that was significant for patchy superficial erythema in the fundus but an otherwise normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy to the third part of the duodenum.
There was no source of bleeding identified.
Given a positive serum H. Pylori antibody test, the gastroenterology consult service recommended treatment with Metronidazole, Amoxicillin and Pantoprazole.
Neurology - The neurology consult service was consulted for preoperative stroke clearance given the patient's history of a cerebrovascular accident.
The patient also had a MRI/MRA which showed no acute ischemic changes and was only significant for chronic small vessel disease with old lacunar infarcts.
At the time of dictation, the neurology consult service has not specifically commented on the patient's stroke risk for a potential upcoming coronary artery bypass graft.
Psychiatry - The patient was admitted with a history of depression and possible dementia.
Throughout his hospitalization, the patient was noted to become mildly confused at night consistent with potential sundowning.
The etiology of the patient's elevated INR is considered potentially related to a poor nutritional state.
