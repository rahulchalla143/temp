The patient reported falling in his home after an episode of lightheadedness saying "I was unsteady on my feet" and was found down by a neighbor.
[**Name (NI) **] denied head trauma but remembers little of the incident.
He had increased difficulty walking over the past two to three days and lower back pain.
He reports a long history of balance problems that he attributes to "drinking too much".
He denied recent illness, fevers, chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, headache, numbness or tingling, or urinary symptoms or incontinence.
On admission, the patient was found to be confused, inattentive and had an unsteady gait.
He was not able to provide an address, phone number, or prior employment.
He did not recall if he had lost consciousness and could not recall the date of his last drink.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop.
Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended with protruding umbilicus which the patient says is chronic.
Extremities:  No edema, no cyanosis.
Neurologic:  The patient was oriented but with poor attention.
Tox screens were negative including negative for ethanol, negative for benzodiazepines, negative for opiates, negative for cocaine.
Chest x-ray showed no acute infiltrates, no cardiomegaly.
CT scan of the head showed no hemorrhage, chronic ischemic white matter changes, possible old lacunar infarcts in the right insula, left cerebellar peduncle, the pons, right parietal, cystic structure in the right nuchal region, question of sebaceous  cyst.
MRI of the head showed no acute infarction, diffuse brain atrophy with chronic microvascular ischemia.
EEG showed mild encephalopathy without ongoing seizure activity.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 61-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, hypertension, and alcohol abuse who was found down by a neighbor and on admission was found to be hyponatremic with change in mental status.
An LP was performed and although it was bloody it did not reveal any infection and cultures remained negative.
The patient was on the Medicine Floor for a couple of days when he underwent an aspiration event, went into respiratory distress and was then transferred to the ICU.
At the time of discharge, he was able to eat a diet under supervision with instructions for his swallowing.
HYPONATREMIA:  The patient was felt to have hypovolemic hyponatremia with a possible component of SIADH.
It is not clear if he has a chronic underlying condition leading to his hyponatremia or if it was just in the setting of being volume depleted and found down.
TRANSAMINITIS:  On admission, the patient was found to have a mild transaminitis.
His LFTs normalized and he was without abdominal pain on examination.
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:  On day number two of admission, the patient was found in respiratory distress with low oxygen saturations, increased respiratory rate.
He was started on ceftriaxone which had been started to cover for possible meningitis and was continued.
The patient recovered gradually from his aspiration event with a decrease in his white blood cell count.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation and a small left effusion.
The clindamycin was then changed to Flagyl to also cover for possible C. difficile as the patient was having diarrhea, although did not have a positive C. difficile toxin test at this time.
HYPERTENSION:  The patient presented with hypertension which was somewhat difficult to control during the admission.
ANEMIA:  The patient experienced a drop in hematocrit during the admission.
His iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease with a low iron, high ferritin, and low-normal TIBC.
Initially he required some Ativan for possible withdrawal symptoms but at discharge he was requiring no benzodiazepines.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient presented with a decreased nutritional status, abnormal B12 and folate levels.
His swallowing abilities slowly returned and he was transitioned over to a p.o.
diet with monitoring and aspiration precautions which he was tolerating well at the time of this dictation.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As noted in the above sections, the patient was worked up for meningitis and there were never any positive cultures.
He should complete a total two week course of levofloxacin and Flagyl, at which time these antibiotics can probably be stopped if the patient is afebrile without a white count and without diarrhea.
You should contact your primary doctor with any chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, dizziness, or agitation.
Aspiration pneumonia.
