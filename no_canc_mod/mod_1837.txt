Admission Date:  [**2133-3-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2133-3-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2072-12-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  NEURO/NMED HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old right-handed gentlemen with coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease who was having difficulty speaking after a left carotid endarterectomy.
The patient has had high grade bilateral carotid stenosis for at least [**2-21**], while he was sitting in a chair, he developed sudden onset of right arm and leg numbness, followed by right arm and leg weakness.
He had also had difficulty speaking.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] and underwent a left carotid endarterectomy on [**2-26**] and afterwards began having a severe left-sided headache behind his left eye that could last for hours and was constant.
Never the less, he visits to [**Hospital1 2436**] for continued headache and nausea and vomiting.
During one of his visits, he had contortion of his right face and bilateral arm jerking and was started on Dilantin.
On [**3-13**], he presented yet again for persistent headaches, confusion and inability to talk.
The wife reported an incident before they went to [**Hospital1 2436**] in which he asked her to bring him his Dilantin, but when she brought it, he said "that is not the pills, then went to a dresser draw and pulled out a handkerchief and said this is what he was referring to."
Head CT showed a linear hyperintense region in the left central temporal lobe but also other lesions in the left posterior parietal hyperintensity spanning 10 images and slight surrounding hypointensity and a left frontal cortical hypointensity with a small surrounding region of hyperintensity.
There was slight increase focal effacement on the left with hypointensity in the left corona radiata as well.
Coronary artery disease.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Patient had amaurosis fugax in [**2114**] which lead to a bypass on the innominate artery.
In [**2122**], he was found that he had right carotid 100% occlusion and a high grade stenosis on the left.
Oropharynx was clear without lesions.
Neck was supple with left carotid bruit.
No gallop or rub.
Extremities:  Warm, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
He did have weak pedal pulses.
Object naming was impaired for low frequency objects, said F for feather and he said flower for cactus.
He interpreted portions of a complex visual seen appropriately.
On speech, he had slightly soft and slurred speech.
He had paraphasic errors.
Funduscopic exam revealed normal vasculature with sharp optic discs.
Reflex testing revealed symmetric reflexes throughout with an upgoing toe on Babinski testing on the right.
There was no angle clonus.
Cerebellar exam: Finger to nose, finger to heel to chin were difficult for him to perform but no dysmetria.
Rapid alternating movements slightly slow in the right hand.
He had visual spatial abnormalities and ideomotor apraxia on the right.
An MRI showed left MCA/ACA and left MCA/PCA watershed strokes with acute and subacute hemorrhagic conversions.
It was thought that he had extended his watershed infarcts after carotid endarterectomy leading to a carotid hyperperfusion syndrome.
His Intensive Care Unit course was notable for labile blood pressure requiring labetalol, other times requiring Neo-Synephrine to achieve a blood pressure in the range of 120-150.
His blood pressures from the arm were unreliable requiring a thigh cuff and arterial line.
It was then subsequently determined that he also had a left ACA stroke one to two weeks prior to his operation.
Given that his blood pressures were under better control, he was transferred to the Neurology [**Hospital1 **] Service, however, he developed intermittent episodes of atrial flutter which might have been old or related to underlying coronary artery disease.
He had no further seizures while in house.
He will receive outpatient Holter monitoring and also an outpatient transthoracic echocardiogram.
