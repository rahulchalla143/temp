She reports progressive dyspnea on exertion and denies and angina.
History of Present Illness: This is a 86 yo female patient diagnosed with aortic stenosis this past year.
Cardiac cath on [**2182-5-31**] revealed [**Location (un) 109**] 0.63 cm2, mean gradient 42.3, 30% LAD stenosis, 70% mid-LCX stenosis, 70% prox and 90% mid RCA stenosis, no LM disease.

Aortic stenosis.
60% right renal artery stenosis.
Family History: Mother deceased with MI at age 60.
Positive carotid bruits versus radiated murmur.
No varicosities.
The procedure was then cancelled due to findings of a severely calcified aorta extending to the arch.
On post-operative day three her standard paced rhythm was overridden by a rapid atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 140s.
She was seen by EP whom concluded that her pacemaker was functioning appropriately, that she was experiencing post-operative atrial fibrillation, and their recommendations included amiodarone and possible heparin with continued atrial fibrillation.
On post-operative day four she was diuresed with lasix due to fluid overload.
The diuresis left her with a relative hyponatremia corrected with fluid restriction and diuresis.
She did not continue in atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was continued but heparin was not started.
On [**2182-7-2**] (day of discharge) her fluid status was better with a decrease in edema and improved oxygenation.
Coronary artery disease.
60% right renal artery stenosis  Discharge Condition: Stable.
