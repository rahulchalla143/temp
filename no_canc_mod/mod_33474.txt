CT obtained at OSH c/w SDH and SAH.
Currently only complains of occipital headache.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Short-interval increase in subarachnoid blood in the interhemispheric fissure, with subarachoid blood also again noted in the parafalcine sulci and basal cisterns.
The pattern of hemorrhage is highly concerning for a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm, and the short-interval increase in hemorrhage indicates ongoing bleeding.
Stable ventricular enlargement, which could be secondary to cerebral atrophy.
However, an element of communicating hydrocephalus cannot be excluded, and close follow-up is recommended.
While no intracranial aneurysm is identified, the pattern of subarachnoid hemorrhage remains suspicious for an aneurysm in the region of the anterior communicating artery.
Since a small aneurysm may be obscured or compress subarachnoid hemorrhage, a conventional cerebral angiogram should be considered  [**2140-7-16**] Angiogram: negative for any aneurysm or vascular malformation  [**2140-7-17**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Minimal progression of interhemispheric hematoma along with a small subdural hematoma along the falx.

The EEG showed a slow and mildly disorganized background throughout with intermittent delta slowing in a generalized distribution.
Occasionally, there was some additional delta slowing in the right hemisphere, but this was brief, infrequent, and not reliably indicative of an additional problem.
There were no epileptiform features, electrographic seizures, or other signs of seizure.
No change in the anterior interhemispheric fissural and other subarachnoid hemorrhage, with no new focus of hemorrhage.
No evidence of acute infarct.
Junction between the A1 and A2 segments of the left ACA and the ACom vessel is bulbous, as before, but there is no discrete aneurysm at this site or elsewhere in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
[**2140-7-20**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The background remained disorganized and mildly slow throughout, with some additional bursts of generalized slowing or even 1 second episodes of suppression.
Medications and metabolic disturbances are among the most common causes.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities.
There were some sharp features but no evidence of ongoing seizures.
[**2140-7-22**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  There is no new hemorrhage seen or evidence of infarct.
The degree of interhemispheric and right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage is reduced.
Subdural hematoma along the falx is essentially unchanged.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or mass effect.
There is no evidence of herniation.
There is stable mild ventriculomegaly with no evidence of hydrocephalus.
No change in interhemispheric fissural subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Slight decrease in amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage seen in the frontal lobe and subdural hematoma.
No clinically significant changes since prior study.
[**2140-7-23**] Head CT: There is no significant interval change in the hemorrhage within the anterior interhemispheric fissure, intraventricular blood, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is a lesion in the genu of the corpus callosum which demonstrates restricted diffusion.
This could represent a focus of artifact from hemorrhage in the anterior interhemispheric fissure.
No large territorial infarction is seen.
Fluid in the left lateral recess of the sphenoid sinus is noted.
There is mild venous hyperemia on the post-gadolinium images.
IMPRESSION:  Overall extent of intracranial hemorrhage is unchanged compared to the prior study.

[**2140-7-24**]: CHEST Xray FINDINGS: Compared to the prior study, there is no significant interval change.
There is no new infiltrate.
[**2140-7-24**] Brain MRI: There is no significant interval change in the hemorrhage within the anterior interhemispheric fissure, intraventricular blood, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is a lesion in the genu of the corpus callosum which demonstrates restricted diffusion.
This could represent a focus of artifact from hemorrhage in the anterior interhemispheric fissure.
No large territorial infarction is seen.
Fluid in the left lateral recess of the sphenoid sinus is noted.
There is mild venous hyperemia on the post-gadolinium images.
IMPRESSION: Overall extent of intracranial hemorrhage is unchanged compared to the prior study.

Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2140-7-24**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It continued to show an encephalopathic background with occasional sharp features, more on the right, but with no definitely epileptiform  abnormalities.
It also showed very infrequent additional slowing in the right temporal region.
Background frequencies were a bit higher than they were two to three days ago but not much changed from the previous day.
There were no electrographic seizures.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2140-7-25**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The recording showed a mild encephalopathy throughout.
There were no  prominent focal features, and there were no overtly epileptiform  abnormalities or electrographic seizures.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2140-7-26**] 2:55 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2140-7-26**] FINDINGS: CONTINUOUS EEG: Began at 6:41 on the morning of [**7-26**] and showed a low voltage theta background in most areas.
That afternoon, the background appeared more regular, with the theta to alpha frequency more prominent posteriorly, but still a bit slow on the average.
There was more muscle artifact and eye movement artifact.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed no significant sharp waves.
There were no epileptiform features.
There was some muscle artifact.
There were no electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.

On examination at OSH, patient reported occipital headache, but was otherwise nonfocal.
When evaluated in [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was seen to have R pronator drift and R ptosis as well as lethargic.
Due to the appearance and location of hemorrhage, a CTA was done to evaluate for aneurysm or AVM.
A repeat head CT was done which showed improvement of the hemorrhage and stable ventricle size.
Labs Repeat CTA was unchanged and negative for aneurysm.
TCD was limited due to poor windowing and could not evaluate MCA, ACA, or PCA; there was no evidence of vasospasm in the vessels seen.
She continued to be lethargic with somewhat fluctuating mental status.

She developed a leukocytosis and was treated for C. diff.
EEG again showed diffuse slowing with no epileptiform activity.
MRI was unremarkable, demonstrating stable intracranial hemorrhage and ventricular prominence.
On [**7-29**], The patient continues to be lethargic and non-verbal.
Her stomach was noted to be mildly tender and distended on [**2140-8-1**] so a KUB was obtained.
A small amount of air was also noted under her diaphragm, but this is an expected finding given her recent PEG placement.
Her hyponatremia improved with a NA of 143 on [**8-1**].
