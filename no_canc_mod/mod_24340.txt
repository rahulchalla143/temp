Her husband recalls that, at that time, she ambulated independently and did not appear to have weakness or facial droop.
He apparently witnessed the subsequent development of right facial droop and hemiparesis between 4 am and 4:30 am.
The family maintains that Ms. [**Known lastname **] has not been herself since the stroke(s) eight months PTA but deny specific illness and discomfort in the recent past.

HEENT: Normocepahlic, atruamatic, no scleral icterus noted.
No carotid bruits appreciated.
Skin: no rashes or concerning lesions noted.
Motor: * Bulk: No evidence of atrophy.
Abrupt cutoff of flow within the left M1 segment, associated with hyperdense vessel and in this patient with acute onset of right sided symptom is concerning for an acute embolus.
No significant cortical edema is appreciated at this time.
Normal variant origin of the vertebral arteries from the external carotid arteries.
Chronic right hemispheric infarcts.
Focal gas collection anterior to the esophagus likely represents an esophageal diverticulum though it is incompletely evaluated and should be correlated with patient's clinical course.
Angio [**2128-11-19**] ...  CT head [**2128-11-19**]: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no definite low-attenuation region in the left hemisphere.
Hypodensities in the right frontal and parietal lobes with associated mild volume loss is unchanged.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
No evidence of significant cortical edema.
Unchanged appearance of chronic right hemispheric infarcts.
Echo [**2128-11-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year-old right-handed [**Location 7972**] woman with a presumed past medical history including DM II, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and prior right parietal and external capsule strokes who presented with sudden onset of aphasia, right facial droop, and right-sided weakness.
Clinical examination was notable for minimal, dysarthric speech, right facial droop, right upper extremity plegia and spasticity, right lower extremity paresis with increased tone, and diffusely brisk reflexes.
She was given a total of 9mg of ia tPA and started to open up the MCA stem.
It was decided not to go after the inferior MCA division, since the patient was getting out of a reasonable time window and because she had already 9mg of ia tPA on board.
she was monitered continously on telemetry in setting of acute stroke and A fib.
She had an episode of rapid afib lasting for few seconds on [**11-24**] night.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
