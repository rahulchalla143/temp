Today, the baby is returned to [**Hospital3 1810**] for continued management of prematurity and complications of ileostomy.
[**Known lastname **] developed a spontaneous ileal perforation with a volvulus, which was repaired at [**Hospital3 1810**] on day of life #5.
On     [**2-28**], he was reintubated because of increased apnea     and desaturations during a decompensation.
His chest x-ray was     notable for a right upper lobe collapse and intermittent     right lower lobe collapse as well.
He has had moderate secretions.
He had 1 episode of a mean [**Month (only) **] pressure in     the 60s earlier today, responding to a dose of fentanyl     for presumed discomfort.
On [**1-25**], secondary to     lethargy and a decreased urine output, a workup revealed     a serum sodium of 118, a serum potassium of 8.9;     necessitating a normal saline bolus and a sodium     replacement infusion.
He was     presumed to have renal insufficiency secondary to     dehydration.
His glucose was noted to be     elevated during the initial presentation with the frank     bloody stools, peaking at 343.
There were     multiple changes in his bag over time secondary to skin     breakdown.
He had breakdown from 9 o'clock until 3 o'clock,     graphically speaking, around his stoma which is being     treated.
On [**2-28**], when [**Known lastname **] was noted to have frank [**Known lastname **]     in his [**Known lastname 9341**], a KUB was obtained which showed dilated     loops of the small bowel proximal to the stoma.
Serial     KUBs revealed nonspecific distention of several loops of     bowel.
On [**2-28**] at 18:00 hours, he continued to     have moderate distention of loops of bowel, mid abdomen,     with a string-of-pearl appearance of bubbles seen in a     concentric pattern in the left lower quadrant; suspicious     of pneumatosis intestinalis.
There was no free air     identified in any of the serial films.
His [**Last Name (un) 37079**]     drains with scant amounts of bilious drainage.
He was     noted to have overlying erythema medial to the stoma of     the skin.
Currently,     there is minimal drainage from the stoma.
[**Known lastname **] is being transferred to the surgery service for     continued management of his abdominal process at this     time.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On [**1-26**], during the     decompensation secondary to electrolyte imbalance, [**Known lastname **]     had a sepsis evaluation - including [**Known lastname **], stool and     urine cultures - all of which remained negative.
On [**2-28**], at the time     of this abdominal process, [**Known lastname **] again underwent a     sepsis evaluation.
Due to the     concern for cellulitis in the abdomen, vancomycin was     also added.
There has been no further     clinical evidence of active bleeding.
Initial head ultrasound done at [**Hospital3 1810**]     was notable for some echogenicities in the subependymal     region of the frontal horns, and recommendation for MRI     at term was recommended by the radiologist at that time.
On [**2-28**], because of the     acute abdominal process, [**Known lastname **] was started on bolus     doses of fentanyl at 2 mcg/kilo every 2 to 4 hours.
OPHTHALMOLOGY:  An ROP screen performed on [**2-9**]     showed immature retinae to zone 2.
SOCIAL:  Parents are involved and concerned about the     changing condition of [**Known lastname **] at this time and have     accompanied him to [**Hospital3 1810**].
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Respiratory distress, sepsis suspect, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, anemia of prematurity.
