History of deep venous thrombosis.
INDICATIONS FOR ADMISSION:  Mr. [**Known lastname 44633**] was a 74-year-old gentleman who had increasing shortness of breath over the past two years with a known murmur.
He had significant aortic stenosis and was symptomatic, and therefore, referred for surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  In general, no weight changes.
Skin showed some mild keratoses.
Heart revealed a regular, rate, and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating to his neck and throughout the chest.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with active bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities revealed 2+ pedal edema with some mild varicosities.
At the end of the case, attempts to initially wean the patient from bypass were successful, and the patient manifested right heart failure despite multiple maneuvers and medications, a right ventricular assist device needed to be placed emergently to facilitate weaning from extracorporal bypass.
On the first postoperative day, the patient's condition was stable, but critical, and there was some difficulty with venous return.
The patient was therefore taken back to the operating room for repositioning of his venous cannula.
Despite making the patient negative, there were increasing difficulties with ventilation and oxygenation.
Maneuvers including chemical paralysis and optimizing the ventilator in regards to oxygenation proved progressively insufficient.
His oxygenation improved dramatically for a short period of time.
There is no evidence of significant bleeding or tamponade.
