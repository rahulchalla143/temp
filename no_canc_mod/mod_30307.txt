Admission Date:  [**2107-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-8-20**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aldomet / Actos / Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: STEMI/ chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary angiography with 3 bare metal stents placed in the LAD on [**2107-8-16**]   History of Present Illness: This patient is a 87 year old female who experienced sudden epigastric/left sided chest pain.
She has been experiencing bilateral upper back/shoulder and neck "aches" intermittengly for the past year.
It is described as "crampy/achy" and [**2107-4-25**] out of a pain scale.Last night it was described to be [**2107-6-27**] and the "worse it has ever been."
This back pain continued until the morning when she experienced a  sudden onset C/P starting at 10 AM.
The chest pain was localized to the left side which radiated along the mid-axillary line to the epigastric area.
The pain was associated with SOB because of increased pain when she inspired.
On arrival to the floor she stated that her back pain is gone and that her left sided chest pain is still present but "better."
She also said she is breathing easier and has no other complaints or pain.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain, but is mobile only with a walker.

Chronic venous edema 10.
Systolic HF .
Social History: The patient is widowed and lives in an elevated senior housing.
Family History: Father died age 81 of malignant hypertension and stroke.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

Reports- 7/28EKG Atrial fibrillation.
Anterior wall myocardial infarction pattern is unchanged from prior.
Possible inferior myocardial infarction, age indeterminate.
ST segment elevation in leads V2-V5 with Q waves in leads V1-V4.
Consider anterior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age versus left ventricular aneurysmal formation.
Lateral ST-T wave changes.
[**8-17**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypo/near akinesis of the septum and anterior walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2098-9-22**], the left ventricular cavity is now dilated with an aneurysmal apex and more depressed global systolic function.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
CXR [**8-17**] FINDINGS: Comparison to radiographs dated [**2107-3-18**] indicates a new small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe consolidation.
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and moderate cardiomegaly are stable.
IMPRESSION: Interim development of left pleural effusion and left lower lobe consolidation.
[**2107-8-16**]- 100% LAD occlsuion , with no other disease in other vessels.
of DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, chronic systolic HF and  chronic venous insufficiency presenting with sudden onset of left sided chest/epigastric pain and found to have antreior STEMI and treated with cardiac catherization and 3 bare metal stents to the LAD.
# Chest Pain - Given her EKG ST elevations in V1-V4 the patient experienced a anterior STEMI which was treated with emergent cardiac catherization and LAD stent placements.
She also had experienced some upper back/neck achiness which has been chronic.
BP, pulses in both upper and lower extremities and therefore no clinical signs of aortic dissection.
The presence of apical and anterior hypokinesis on an echocardiogram in [**2098**], it is possible the patient had chronic decreased flow to the LAD terriotory.
She also has an apical aneurysm suggesting a prior LAD territory ischemic event.
Q daily ECG's showed persistent ST elevations V1-V5 and consistent with aneurysmal apex found on echocardiogram.
Sh had no further chest pain whilst an inpatient.
She does not have a history of pulmonary disease or need for supplemental oxygen.
It could be possibly caused by an acute exacerbation of her chronic systolic heart failure and associated pulmonary edema.
She is clinically fluid overloaded in that she has bilateral lower extremity edema and bibasilar crackles.
It could also be due to left sided chest pain which increases with inspiration and movement, which is preventing her from fully inspiring.
A CXR [**8-17**] AM showed interim development of left pleural effusion and possible left lower lobe consolidation.
Any potential infection remained on the differential however the patient had no clinical signs of infection including fever or cough and no leukocytosis but this shouldbe considered if she is febrile etc.
# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure- The patient's last echocardiogram was in [**2098**] when she had a EF on 30-35 % and anterior/apical regional wall hypokinesis.
Started 5mg Coumadin daily which will  provide thrombus prophylaxis given her apical hypokinesis and apical aneurysm.Followup echocardiogram showed left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was also seen.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2098-9-22**], the left ventricular cavity is now dilated with an aneurysmal apex and more depressed global systolic function.
#Acute renal failure- Most probably mutlifactorial given her recent cardiac catherization and dye load.
Also could be due to hypoperfusion given her diminished cardiac output according to echo which is most probably chronic , however could have worsened given her recent ischemic event.
# Diabetes mellitus.
Continued home dose of Gabapentin 300mg at nighttime for neuropathic pain.
Started on 5mg Coumadin daily, after patient agreement, which will  provide thrombus prophylaxis given her apical hypokinesis and apical aneurysm.
# Hypothyroidism.
# Hypertension.Started on Metoprolol Succinate today 150mg daily  and started on Losartan 25mg daily today, standing oral lasix.
#  Bilateral edema of the legs/ Venous stasis- The patient has a chronic venous insufficiency problem with a recent lower extremity ultrasound which showed: From the popliteal vein to the common femoral vein, there is no evidence of thrombus or obstruction.
There is no deep venous reflux.There is no greater saphenous vein reflux.

You were given aspirin in the ambulance by the emergency services and on arrival, your cardiac tracing (ECG) showed evidence of a heart attack.
Your chest pain eased and you were given medication to dilate your arteries to increase blood supply to the heart and medication to lower your heart rate (to reduce strain on the heart) and lower your blood pressure.
You were stable following your procedure and we increased the amount of diuretic we gave you to improve your oxygen levels and shortness of breath.
You had an ultrasound scan of your heart which showed a dilated area at the top of the heart which is suggestive taht you may have had a previous small heart attack in this same area that had been unnoticed.
You were started on warfarin for your atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and in addition to other risk factors including your diabetes and recent heart attack that would otherwise greatly increase your yearly risk of stroke.
There are also risks of bleeding and if this were to happen you should seek medical attention.
6) We increased your aspirin dose to 325mg daily and added another medication called clopidogrel (another blood thinner which acts on platelets, components of the blood) at 75mg daily 7) We increased your fuurosemide to 80mg daily (water tablet) 8) We started you on warfarin to thin the blood and reduce your risk of stroke 9) We will continue the heparin injections until you are walking and your warfarin level is in the correct range  Discharge instructions: 1) You should have your INR level checked daily at rehab until it is in te right range and regularly at home following discharge 2) Should you have further chest pain or feel unwell you should immediately seek medical attention and proceed to teh ED 3) You will need to be careful when walking given your several blood thinners and you will be far more prone to bruising.
4) You will need to have your kidney function tests checked to make sure they are heading in tehright direction 5) With your new blood pressure medications, you will need to have your blood pressure checked regularly 6) your Foley catheter was removed on [**8-20**], you may have difficulty passing urine after this and this may have to be replaced if you are unable to pass urine  You should weigh yourself daily and see your PCP if your weight changes by >3lb.
