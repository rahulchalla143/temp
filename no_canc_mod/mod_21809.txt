Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the interventional radiology service saw the patient regarding vertebroplasty for her lumbar compression fracture.
An MRI was obtained, which demonstrated a compression fracture of the anterior aspect of the L2 vertebral body, with minimal associated T2 and STIR signal abnormalities.
There were no epidural collections seen.
The conus medullaris ends at L1-L2, and there was no spinal cord narrowing.
Also noted on the scan was a large left retroperitoneal hematoma in a patient who is status post thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
There was some edema in the muscular soft tissues posterior to the lumbar spine at the levels of L2 to L4.
The patient in the next 24 hours developed onset of abdominal pain and diarrhea.
This CT of the abdomen and pelvis did not show any evidence of thoraco- aortic dissection.
There was a persisting small bowel obstruction, which had partially decompressed, and the left abdominal wall had a surgical site seroma.
The appearance of the stenosis of the origin of the SMA, celiac and right renal arteries was stable.
The patient then proceeded to surgery on [**2200-5-16**], and underwent abdominal aortogram with selective celiac angiogram, angioplasty, and stenting of the celiac artery through a left brachial artery access.
The patient's postoperative day 1 from her angioplasty and stenting of the celiac artery was hemodynamically stable.
The patient's head CT scan was remarkable for periventricular white matter changes and an old right insular infarct.
Psychiatric felt that the patient's [**Last Name 16423**] problem was delirium, which was mild and which was related to surgery and all the perioperative events in an older woman with underlying structurally abnormal brain.
There was no evidence of anxiety present.
for anxiety or confusion, minimize the use of Dilaudid, or replace with a non narcotic analgesic.
