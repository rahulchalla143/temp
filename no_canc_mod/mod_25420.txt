Then about 10 to 15 minutes later, patient was yelling for help and the daughter found the patient fallen forward in the bathroom with L sided weakness hence EMS was called.
Head CT revealed no acute issues including hemorrhage but because patient appeared to improve, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] without intervention.
Code stroke was activated 12:44pm and initial evaluation showed L sided numbness, mild neglect and L field cut totaling NIHSS of 6.
ROS reveals that patient was discharged from OSH just yesterday with a new diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and started on Sinemet.
Patient also reports that she had about 20~25lb weight loss in the last 2 months.

**FINAL REPORT [**2144-2-22**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2144-2-22**]):    NO GROWTH.
Right MCA distribution acute ischemic infarct with thrombus extending from right MCA bifurcation into M2 and M3 segments with apparent distal reconstitution.
Ischemic infarction is evident on CT perfusion as matched increase of mean transit time and decreased blood volume blood flow to the right MCA distribution.
Mild atherosclerotic disease involving aortic arch, great vessel origins, and right common carotid bifurcation without significant stenosis or occlusion.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR [**2-22**] There is no focal consolidation, the CP angles are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
X ray abd (supine and erect) [**2-24**] IMPRESSION: Moderate fecal retention throughout the entire colon, likely secondary to constipation.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s).
A secundum type atrial septal defect is seen by color Doppler with right-to-left flow.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: Aneurysmal intraatrial septum with secundum atrial septal defect and right to left flow at rest.
No LA/LAA/RA/RAA thrombus seen.
The posterior tibial veins on the right demonstrate non-compressibility and decreased color flow.
One of these veins appears to be completely occluded while the other has some nonocclusive thrombus within it.
IMPRESSION:  Thrombosis of paired right posterior tibial veins.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to neurology service for evaluation of sudden onset weakness on the left side of body.
In the ED, she was found to have right MCA stroke, most likely as a result of occlusion form embolus and was treated with IV tPA after code stroke was activated.
Her initial physical examination was suggestive of significant left sided weakness with left heminegelct, however, post IV tPA , she showed consistent steady improvement and has very mild left sided weakness with no neglect on the left side at discharge.
She underwent TEE for finding out the source of potential embolus as vessel imaging did not show any evidence.
TEE showed ASD with PFO and septal aneurysm, she underwent ultrasound of legs which showed DVT in right posterioir tibial veins.
She had episode of nausea and vomiting on [**2-24**] as well as [**2-25**].
after careful review and GI consult, it was found that nausea was related to sinemet dose and she was started on carbidopa additional dose.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: acute Right MCA stroke, s/p IV t PA with improvement in left hemiparesis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of weakness on the left side of body.
You underwent CT scan of head with CTA head/ neck which showed acute infarct in right MCA.
You underwent TEE (transesophageal cardiac ultrasound) which showed a hole in septum of heart called PFO, ASD with a small septal anerysm.
You had ultrasound of legs which showed small blood clot in veins of right leg.
You had nausea and vomiting in the hospital, you were seen by GI specialist who felt that this is related to sinemet.
