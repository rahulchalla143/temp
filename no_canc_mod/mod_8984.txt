There has been interval extubation and removal of the [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube.
The pulmonary edema has resolved.
IMPRESSION: Resolution of pulmonary edema and decreased left basilar atelectasis.
The right coronary artery appeared to have a severe ostial stenosis despite the presence of the previously placed multiple stents.
The LMCA, LAD and LCx had no angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease.
Distal aortography was also performed.
There was mild-moderate arterial disease in the right and left iliac arteries and mild arterial disease in the right common femoral artery.
An echocardiogram on [**1-1**] was notable for 2+ mitral regurgitation and depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 30%.
On [**1-2**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting along with a mitral valve repair.
Given her cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease, her SBP was maintained between 120-140 mmHg.
Very briefs episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were noted on telemetry, most likely in the setting of hypokalemia.
She remained in a normal sinus rhythm without further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Over several days, she continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis and made steady progress with physical therapy.
At discharge, her chest x-ray showed resolution of pulmonary edema with decreased left basilar atelectasis.
All surgical wounds were clean, dry and intact without evidence of infection.
