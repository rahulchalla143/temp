The patient reports that he awoke yesterday with numbness in his entire left hand, left fingers curled, difficulty moving his left arm and poor coordination with his left arm.
Specifically, he had numbness and an inability to hold his pants while trying to button them.
These symptoms lasted several minutes but resolved on arrival at the ED.

He did endorse transient numbness in left upper lift and left side of his tonque that lasted several minutes, occured once and did not return.
A neurology consult was obtained and was concered for acute stroke vs right carotid stent dysfunction w/impaired cerebral perfusion.
He had a head CT, which showed no hemorrhage or acute stroke.
He had carotid artery tenting in [**2131**] for symptoms of UE numbness.
Prior to the revascularization procedure he had two episodes of right sided numbness and tingling.
It was thought that he had a symptomatic [**Doctor First Name 3098**] lesion by symptoms as well as ultrasound.
However, angiography revealed non-significant disease in the left carotid system with an 80% lesion in the right.

# Left arm numbness: Neuro consulted who found L hand weakness and a small L pronator/parietal drift but no other parietal signs.
This would be consistent with an embolic stroke to the R subcortical area.
No MRI secondary to pt too anxious and refuses MRI.
R CCA disease is likely the source.
Echo study neg for ASD or thrombus.
Pt had multiple transient episodes of L hand numbness/weakness and left upper lip numbness during hospitalization.
Pt had one episode of decreased BP and was given bolus and laid flat.
Procedure occured without complication.
Neuro exam notable for only slight weakness of LUE compared to RUE.
CAD: Patient is s/p balloon angioplasty years ago and MI ruled out at OSH.
He refused MRI while in hospital to look for stroke secondary to anxiety.
Blood pressure medicines should be held for SBP less than 110  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] SKILLED NURSING & REHABILITATION  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis Right subcortical stroke 40% stenosis of right common carotid with plaque in place PVD .
Secondary Diagnosis: CAD s/p balloon angioplasty PCI renal and iliac   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted from an OSH with new symptoms of numbness and weakness in the left hand that came and went.
You also had transient numbness of your left upper lip and left tongue.
Neurology came and saw you and you likely had a right subcortical stroke.
We would normally do an MRI but you refused because it makes you too anxious to be in an enclosed space.
We did a CT scan of your head and found no bleed or evidence of tumor.
We did a CT angio and an ultrasound of your neck vessels.
You had some stenosis and plaue in your right common carotid artery.
There were no complications.
If you develop an inability to speak or move normally you should return to the hospital immediately.
