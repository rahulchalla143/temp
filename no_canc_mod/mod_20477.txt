LAD - prox calcification without critical lesions LCX - 60% lesion, modest calcification.
Occ mid OM1 at prev stent location RCA - Dominant vessel 90% lesion at origin, TIMI 3 flow, stent patent.
- LCx stent with 3x23 cypher -> 0%   Past Medical History: DM2 Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia CAD s/p RCA and LCx stent History of subdural hemorrhage after MVA  Social History: Nonsmoker.
Family History: Non Contributory  Physical Exam: VS: Afebrile, BP 140/73, P71 R16 SpO2=97% Gen: Alert, oriented, no distress.
CV: S1 S2 with no MRG.
Lungs: Clear anterior Abd: NT/ND Groin - R catheteriztion site with no hematoma Ext - 1+ pitting edema bilateral ankle   Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: .
CXR [**9-30**]: Marked engorgement of the superior mediastinal veins may be due in part to supine positioning, alternatively right heart dysfunction and/or pericardial effusion.
Leftward displacement of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is probably due to an enlarged thyroid gland or other mass.
Lungs are low in volume but clear, free of pulmonary edema and there is no appreciable pleural effusion.
Axis 0 EKG 2 AM - SB 47 bpm, submm STE lead 2, TWI AvL and AvR.
Stress at OSH: MIBI [**9-28**]: 5 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] protocol with suboptimal HR response and stopped due to fatigue.
<1mm ST depressions laterally.
Small fixed defect in inf.
and inflat wall c/w prior infarct.
Mild lateral ischemia.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery was mildly calcified and there was distal tapering of the vessel to 30%.
The left anterior descending artery had no angiographic  evidence of coronary artery disease.
There was proximal calcification of the LAD.
The left circumflex artery had a 60% stenosis at the ostium of the vessel.
The OM1 was a large vessel with occlusion in the mid-segment.
The RCA was a dominant vessel with a 90% lesion at the origin of the vessel.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right sided pressures.
Left heart catheterization revealed systemic hypertension.
Successful predilation using a 2.0 X 15 Maverick balloon, stenting using a 3.0 X 23 Cypher stent and post dilation using a 3.5 X 15  Maverick balloon of the acutely occluded mid Cx with lesion reduction from 100 % to 0%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection or embolisation.
Elevated PCWP.
Successful acute MI angioplasty of the mid Cx  .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded (inferior wall and apex were not well visualized).
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2412**] is a 70 year old man with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia., who had been stented in the past.
He r/o'd for MI at OSH and had a positive stress then developed chest pain and was found to have ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF on EKG.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath for his inferior STEMI on a heparin drip, integrillin drip, and nitro drip.
A very large OM1 had a total occlusion in the mid section in the area of a previous stent.
The dominant RCA was found to have an ostial lesion of unknown clinical significance estimated to be 90% but with TIMI 3 flow and a patent stent in the RCA.
He was observed in the CCU for monitoring and had no evidence of hematoma or vascular compromise at the femoral artery.
Nor did he exhibit further symptoms, EKG changes, or arrhythmias.
Echo showed a preserved EF after catheterization.
In addition, his diabetes was managed with RISS throughout his stay with moderate control of his blood glucose.
Prior to cardiac rehab, he would likely benefit from a stress test to evaluate the physiologic significance of the ostial lesion in the RCA 3.
The ostial lesion was not stented at this hospitalization as it was thought to have played no part in the patient?????
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual as needed as needed for pain: Take one tablet if chest pain occurs, wait 5 minutes and repeat up to 3 times or until the pain disappears.
Disp:*20 tabs* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation MI now s/p stenting  DM2 controlled CAD HTN   Discharge Condition: Good.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for an MI or "heart attack."
- he will enroll you in cardiac rehabilitation classes after you have an exercise stress test to evaluate the function of your heart.
- you continue to have some narrowing on the right side of your heart that did not cause your current MI.
If you develop pain in your groin, bleeding or swelling in your groin, lightheadedness, new chest pain, severe new back pain, or other worrisome symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention.
