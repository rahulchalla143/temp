The pregnancy was complicated by hyperemesis and cholecystitis.
An ultrasound five days prior to delivery showed severe oligohydramnios with rupture of membranes.
Other past surgical history was notable for bilateral breast reduction.
Chest, mild retractors, coarse crackly breathsounds bilaterally.
With a change in her clinical status due to necrotizing enterocolitis on day of life #7.
She developed oxygen requirement and subsequent apnea and required intubation for four days.
She required treatment for apnea of prematurity with caffeine.
Her last episode of spontaneous apnea and bradycardia occurred on [**2145-7-9**].
A soft murmur has been noted intermittently and is thought to be consistent with peripheral pulmonary stenosis.
On [**2145-6-16**], she presented with abdominal tenderness and x-rays were consistent with necrotizing enterocolitis.
She had a short trial of Enfamil AR and then was changed to Nutramigen which has been well tolerated since [**2145-8-27**].
Infectious disease - Due to the prolonged premature rupture of membranes for four days prior to delivery, [**Known lastname 52176**] was evaluated for sepsis.
On day of life #7, with the onset of abdominal tenderness and x-rays consistent with pneumatosis and necrotizing enterocolitis, [**Known lastname 52176**] was again evaluated for sepsis.
This was felt to be consistent with meningitis.
No organisms were cultured from blood, urine or cerebrospinal fluid.
The only other infectious disease issue has been oral thrush which was first noted on [**2145-8-30**].
Gastrointestinal - [**Known lastname 52176**] required treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
As previously noted, [**Known lastname 52176**] had necrotizing enterocolitis.
As previously noted she was treated for meningitis.
Carseat position screening - Performed and [**Known lastname 52176**] was observed for 90 minutes without evidence of heartrate or oxygen desaturation.
Study on [**2145-6-25**] showed a borderline low T4 level.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for daycare during respiratory syncytial virus season, with a smoker in the household or with preschool siblings; or C. With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Prematurity at 29 weeks gestation 2.
Respiratory distress syndrome, consistent with transient tachypnea of newborn 3.
