CAUSE OF DEATH:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage with brainstem herniation and subsequent respiratory arrest.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year old Caucasian woman with a past medical history significant for pneumonia and diverticulitis, who, on the evening of admission, was at home and was noted by her husband to call out in pain, complaining of the acute onset of a headache.
Upon arrival of paramedics, patient was noted to have a weak and thready pulse and CPR was administered and patient was intubated.
At [**Hospital3 3834**] head CT was performed which showed significant subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern, the perimesencephalic cisterns as well as intraventricular hemorrhage in the frontal horns and within the third ventricle.
Diffuse cerebral edema was also noted.
HEENT: no evidence of head trauma.
Abdomen was nontender, nondistended with decreased bowel sounds throughout.
There was no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
She had no gag or cough reflexes.
Ocular cephalics showed no evidence of vestibular function.
.................... were performed which showed no nystagmus.
Musculoskeletal examination showed no evidence of trauma, ecchymosis or abrasions.
LABORATORY DATA:  EKG showed normal intervals, normal axis with a mildly prolonged QT interval and mild ST elevations in 1, aVL, V2 and V5 through V6.
Cardiology was consulted initially because of concern over ST elevations apparent on her admission EKG.
Cardiology consult felt that the diffuse nonspecific changes were most likely due to cerebral catastrophe.
Neurosurgery was also consulted and felt that patient was clearly without brainstem reflexes with an extremely poor prognosis.
Patient continued to have absent brainstem reflexes even after rewarming and volume resuscitation.
Patient then began to exhibit increasing metabolic acidosis by her arterial blood gas and this precluded the diagnosis of brain death.
