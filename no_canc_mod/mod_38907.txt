Admission Date:  [**2146-3-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-4-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-8-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**] Chief Complaint: Aortic intramural thrombus  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 75 M presents from OSH with concern for aortic dissection seen on CT abdomen.
Around 7 PM today he had sudden onset mid abdominal pain radiating to his back.
He denies having pain like this before.
His pain has resolved since he presented to [**Hospital3 **].
He did have 2 bouts of non-bloody, light brown emesis at the OSH after getting pain medication.
CT abdomen at [**Hospital3 **] demonstrates concern for an aortic dissection.
On review with radiology there is thrombus extending from just distal to the left subclavian artery and extends to the level of the SMA.

Pt is uncooperative with further questioning, but will follow some simple commands, like "lift your arm" CN - PERRL 2.5-->1.5, EOMI, tongue midline, no facial droop MOTOR - pt is uncooperative with formal strength testing, but is easily antigravity in his UE's bilaterally, and is [**6-4**] in grip bilaterally.
REFLEXES - pt has intact and symmetrical reflexes in UE's.
SENSORY - pt is uncooperative with sensory exam, and responds "yes" to if he feels very sensation even when examiner is not touching him.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2146-4-1**]):  NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..  FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2146-4-4**]):    NO GROWTH.
There is a widened mediastinum and rightward bowing of the trachea, correlating with aortic intramural hematoma evident on [**2146-3-31**] CT. Cardiac and hilar contours are normal.
Minimal bibasilar atelectasis evident.
Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely reflects small right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax identified.
No pneumothorax.
Stable widened mediastinum correlating with known aortic intramural hematoma.
Small right pleural effusion.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO VIRUS ISOLATED.
Similar to the prior examination, there is extensive intramural hematoma, beginning just beyond the level of the left subclavian origin and extending along the descending thoracic aorta.
The overall extent of intramural hematoma in the descending thoracic aorta appears similar to the prior examination.
Active contrast extravasation into the intramural hematoma at the aortic arch (2:40), now currently measures 25 x 17 mm, increased since the previous examination (11 x 8mm previously).
However, the extent of aortic caliber and intramural hematoma is little changed.
Above the diaphragmatic hiatus at approximately the level of T10 is an 11 x 5 mm new focus of contrast within the intramural hematoma.
Intramural hematoma extends to the upper abdominal aorta.
Contrast opacification in the upper abdominal aorta has increased compared to the [**2146-3-30**] study.
The infrarenal abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and there is little intramural thrombus.
CHEST: New small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar dependent atelectasis are present.
Apical emphysema is present.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present in the axilla, hilum, or mediastinum.
A 9-mm nodule is present in the left lobe of the thyroid.
Numerous gallstones are present in the gallbladder with minimal wall hyperenhancement which may suggest chronic inflammation, but this is little changed from the prior study.
The enhancement of the liver appears homogeneous without arterial enhancing lesions.
Bilateral hypodense lesions which are too small to characterize are present.
No free air or free fluid is present.
Stomach and abdominal loops of bowel appear normal.
BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are present in the thoracolumbar spine and at the right hip, but no suspicious bone lesions are present.
Intramural thrombus of the thoracic aorta.
While the diameter of the aorta and the extent of intramural thrombus appears similar, there is one area of increased contrast extravasation into the intramural hematoma at the level of the aortic arch, and a new area of contrast extravasation into the hematoma at the level of T10.
No specific findings to explain the patient's parasthesia noting lack of spinal artery delineation by this type of study.
A spinal MRI may be helpful to further evaluate for spinal cord abnormalities including dedicated MR angiography of spinal vessels if clinically indicated.
New bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions with dependent atelectasis.
Gallbladder findings may be due to chronic cholecystitis.
Small amount of new ascites fluid in the pelvis, which could be due to third spacing.
Medialized common carotid arteries.
Left thyroid nodule.
There is no definite intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study secondary to patient motion.
No definite acute intracranial process.
No focal liver lesion is seen.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation is seen.
No wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid is seen.
No free fluid is seen.
ECHO:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Consequently the mitral leaflets and chordae are pulled towards the hypertrophied upper septum during systole and a moderate LVOT gradient develops.
There is no LVH seen.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Neuro: HD # 3 pt had new found parapalegis.
Sensory examination could not be performed due to agitation & non-cooperation.
Probable cause of paralysis is spinal infarct.
Pt had strict BP contraol.
HD # 3 with new onset paralysis.
Yhis has been an ongoing problem since admission.
BS stable on DC  ID:  The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge on POD#8 the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled Has appropriated follow-up.
10. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
14. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram Powder in Packet Sig: One (1) Powder in Packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
15. lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO ONCE (Once): prn for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Large Type B aortic dissection extending from the left subclavian to the level of the SMA with new significant leg weakness and sensory deficit concerning for spinal cord infarction   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Pt with new paraparesis (left much greater than right).
His presentation is suggestive of a spinal cord ischemia/infarct.
