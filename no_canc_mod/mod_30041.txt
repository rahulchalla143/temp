Patient was in USOH until ~ 1mo ago when he noted increasing SOB w/ exertion that was intermittent.
This was a progressive change and he had no orthopnea or PND.
In addition, noted increasin LE edema and weight gain (states subjectively going from 230->250s).
On [**2-24**] he had a mechanical fall from the wheelchair and upon returning felt worsening SOB to the point that he had a difficult time moving in the chair.
He was admitted to [**Location (un) **] on [**2-24**] and was treated for CHF with IV diuresis (amt of weight loss unknown).
He underwent a stress showing a fixed inferoposterolateral defect w/ dilated cavity and 19% EF.
Overnight [**2-26**] -> [**2-27**] he developed chest pressure anteriorly more focused on the left subareolar space.
This was tightness, not pain, w/o SOB but w/ diaphoresis.
Upon return to [**Location (un) **] ED today, EKG reportedly showing ST depressions in V3, V4, and V5.
He denies any recent dietary indiscretions (though noted in H/P from OSH), skipping medication doses or preceeding CP or pressure.
CXR showed cardiomegaly and pulm edema, EKG w/ SR and RBBB w/ inferior TwI and STd V3, 4, 5.
