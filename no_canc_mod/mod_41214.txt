Admission Date:  [**2144-6-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-6-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-1-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 19F w/ hx of polysubstance abuse including heroin abuse p/w altered mental status.
The mother also noted redness on the patient's arm the day prior to admission.
On arrival at OSH she was noted to be diaphoretic with fever to 103F.
She also has pain in her mid-abdomen, which she thinks is from constipation.
She denies suicidal ideation.
Toxicology was consulted who concluded, "given that the patient has had a clearing sensorium and without any significant metabolic abnormalities at this time (ie.
no evidence of an anion gap, renal failure or complaints of blindness to suggest a toxic alcohol ingestion) we would recommend supportive care at this juncture".
In regards to her reported drug use - heroin is an opiate and we would expect sedation and respiratory depression with this drug as opposed to tachycardia and hyperthermia.

Poor image quality.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is probably moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35%?)
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No valvular vegetations seen.
Brief Hospital Course: relevant DATA: micro reviewed: fusobacterium growin in OSH blood culture CBC, chem7, LFTs, HIV, viral serologies, hepatitis serologies all reviewed elevated ESR earlier in the hospital course trop 0.06, ntBNP 5000 imaging studies included CXR, arm ultrasound shows hematoma surrounding a thrombosed vein, MRI neck/head reviewed, TTE x2 reviewed, most recent EF 45% micro including serial blood, urine cultures neg, neg lyme serology, CMV, EBV serologies neg  [**Known firstname 8254**] [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 19 yo F with a history of polysubtance abuse presenting to OSH with altered mental status, complicated by fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia.
#Encephalopathy: She presented with altered mental status in the setting of fever to 107 recorded by her mother, lethargy, and vomiting.
The etiology is unknown, but may include infection/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, substance abuse, and fever, in the setting of underlying psychiatric illness.
There was concern for possible CNS infection, however there was no evidence for meningitis or encephalitis based on LP.
Substance withdrawal was also a possibility, however urine tox was negative for ASA, Acetmnp, Bnzodzp, Barbitr, Tricycl.
Heroin withdrawal is a possibility.
A head MRI showed limited due to motion artifact but revealed no gross abnormalities.
EEG revealed no seizure.
She had occasional episodes of agitation which were controlled with haloperidol.
At the time of discharge, her mental status was much improved with treatment of her infection (see below).
On the [**Hospital1 **], she triggered for altered mental status - she appeared sedated and intoxicated and was tachycardic.
Urine tox returned positive for opiates.
She presented with a high fever 103F.
Exam showed bilateral crackles R > L. Her left arm was swollen and warm.
In the setting of recent IVDU, her L arm erythema was treated with IV vancomycin.
She received a x-ray of the L forearm and wrist, which ruled out any fractures.
She had evidence of fluctuance in L forearm and ultrsaound revealed a 2x2x1 cm fluid collection which was drained by U/S guidance.
The ID attending recommends a minimum of 2 week course of IV antibiotics with clindamycin as she has an intra-vascular infection with thrombus in her L arm vein.
#Acute Systolic CHF: suspected eitology is acute sepsis, with depression of stroke volume/EF, negative viral serolgoies inclding EBV/CMV, lyme, HIV: She presented with high heart rate and resp rate likely [**1-16**] to a combination of infection and withdrawal.
TTE shows evidence of cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) without evidence of LV dilatation or hypertrophy.
She was treated with IV fluids, and her tachycardia improved.
# Vomiting/diarrhea: Her n/v on presentation was likely secondary to heroin withdrawl, and less likely infectious etiology.
At the time of discharge, her vomiting / diarrhea was much improved.
# Rape crisis: Pt claims to have been sexually assaulted prior to admission, and per sexual assault protocol, she was started on doxycycline.
She was consented and sent for HIV testing.
Her blood cultures grew positive for Fusobacterium, and was treated with clindamycin (day one [**6-23**]).
# Mental status: her mental status was much improved from the time of admission.
Please encourage her to stop IV drug use, as this likely contributed to her infection and hospital course.
5. hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg tablet Sig: One (1) tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: fusobacterium septicemia cellulitis L superficial vein thrombus, arm IVDU, heroin use acute systolic CHF  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with a serious blood stream infection called bacteremia.
This is probably an effect of bacteria in your blood that should improve over time but you will need a followup visit with a heart specialist and additional tests.
