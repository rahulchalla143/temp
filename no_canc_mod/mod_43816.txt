Controled symptoms with anti-emetics including compazine, zofran, and ativan.
# Electrolyte imbalances: During the admission the patient was noted to have low phosphate, low potassium, and low magnesium.
While diarrhea and vomiting can cause this, there was concern that it was out of proportion to her acute illness.
An email was sent to her PCP with concern for alcohol abuse or eating disorder as an underlying etiology of these deficiencies.
