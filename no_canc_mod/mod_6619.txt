Consider left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage.
Prolonged QTc interval is non-specific  [**2167-12-10**]: chest xray - Pulmonary vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness as well as fluffy opacities throughout the lung fields are consistent with moderate CHF.
There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 59 year old man with hx of diastolic CHF, DM2, HTN, Hep C, ESRD on HD, p/w shortness of breath likely due to volume overload due to extra day without HD.
Acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation: This was felt likely due to extra day without HD due to holidays worsened by hypertension.
There was no evidence of cardiac ischemia.
There was no evidence of infection.
His TTE was notable for normal systolic function without significant valvular pathology.
Chest pain: The patient had transient chest pain on admission that resolved with control of his blood pressure and fluid removal via ultrafiltration.

Discharge Instructions: You have been evaluated and treated for shortness of breath and fluid overload.
This was most likely related to not having enough dialysis to match you intake.
As you had dialysis you improved your breathing significantly.
