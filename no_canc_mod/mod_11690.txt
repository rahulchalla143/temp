CXR: [**11-18**] FINDINGS: There is dense consolidation in the right lower lobe.
No pleural effusions are identified.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia.
There is a small improved right-sided layering pleural effusion.
Right basilar consolidation may represent atelectasis or aspiration pneumonitis.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Small stable right effusion with right basilar consolidation which may represent either atelectasis or pneumonia.
CXR: [**11-23**] FINDINGS: There is a small right apical pneumothorax, which has decreased in size in the interval from approximately 18 mm to 11 mm of maximal visceral and parietal pleural separation.
There is no tracheal deviation or other findings suggestive of tension physiology.
There is interval clearing of a right lower lobe opacity previously described.
No further consolidation is identified.
There is no superimposed edema.
A mildly tortuous atherosclerotic aorta is again noted.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size with a mild left ventricular configuration.
There is no definite effusion.
There is a levoconcave curvature of the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Right apical pneumothorax decreased in size.
No evidence of underlying tension  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 90-year old female with MMP admitted for fevers and cough, initially on the floor, transferred to the unit, and transferred back to the floor prior to discharge.
# Cough: The patient had a history of aspiration pneumonia and also had a history of COPD and is oxygen dependent.
Due to the location of the infiltrate on radiographs and the quick decompensation, the clinical picture seemed to fit an aspiration pneumonia.
Blood cultures, [**2-8**], returned positive for strep pneumoniae sensitive to ceftriaxone.
It was also noted that the patient had a small right apical pneumothorax on CXR noted on [**11-22**] amenable to monitoring.
This was likely secondary to a bleb bursting from her ICU stay.
She will need follow up CXR in [**6-9**] days to assess for resolution    The day prior to discharge, the patient's white count showed a mild elevation.
A UA and urine culture were sent to ensure no urinary tract infection was the cause.
Consideration was given to restarting an additional abx, possibly flagyl, to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia.
She remained entirely asymptomatic with no localizing signs.
Her steroids may also have contributed to her lymphocytosis .
# UTI: The patient had no urinary complaints, but the UA was positive for a UTI and her urine culture grew E-Coli, sensitive to ceftriaxone.
# ARF: Initially, the patient's renal function was impaired with a slight elevation in her creatinine level, which was up from baseline.
# Psych: As per the daughter, the patient has history of depression and anxiety.
# HTN: Patient has history of hypertension, but had below normal levels during this stay, often remaining in the high 80s and 90s despite fluid boluses.
# CHF: Initially, due to her underlying diastolic cardiac dysfunction and her hypovolemic status initially, diuresis was implemented.
But once the patient's vital signs stabilized and the her clinical illness began to improve, gentle diuresis was attempted to help with her respiratory status.
# TIA history:  Not a clinical issue during this stay, but the patient was continued on her aspirin.
# FEN/aspiration risk: Patient was placed on a nectar thickened liquid diet for aspiration risk.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical  TID (3 times a day) as needed for perineal redness.
Metronidazole 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) for 9 days: To complete 10 day course (last day [**12-3**]) for empiric coverage against possible aspiration component of pneumonia.
Pneumonia 2.
COPD 3.
Hypothyroidism 5.
Depression and anxiety requiring hospitalization 6.
Hypertension 7.
Diabetes mellitus II 8.
Discharge Instructions: Patient advised to return to the emergency department if she acquires chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or pain that is out of the ordinary for her.
Will need follow up Chest X-Ray to re-assess for resolution of infectious processes/pneumothorax
