HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is 50 year old white female with congestive cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, anemia, and tracheal stenosis, who developed severely swollen legs in [**2130-2-7**], during an episode of congestive heart failure.
However, the patient developed ulcerations of her legs secondary to the swelling and was admitted to the Vascular Surgical Service from [**2130-3-7**] until [**2130-3-11**].
Cultures of the patient's left heel during that admission showed no growth.
Non-invasive arterial studies showed tibial disease, right greater than left.
The patient complained of severe leg pain, [**1-16**]), which had been a problem since discharge home.
However, the patient still had severe pain in her legs.
Most recently, the patient was using aspirin for pain and Darvocet prior to that without any significant pain relief.
Congestive cardiomyopathy:  Echocardiogram in [**2130-2-7**], showed severe global biventricular contractile dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20%; catheterization in [**2119**] in [**State 2748**] showed no coronary artery disease.
Myocarditis in [**2119**].
Diabetes mellitus since age 11, with triopathy; F/P laser treatment.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome.
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of arterial embolus to the right first toe, right fifth finger.
Tracheal stenosis following tracheostomy for respiratory failure in [**2126-10-8**]; requires CPAP.
In general, alert, cooperative white female complaining of severe leg pain secondary to ulcers.
Mouth with no lesions.
Neck:  Range of motion within normal limits; no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Chest:  Lungs with decreased breath sounds throughout.
Extremities with no ankle edema.
Large necrotic ulcer present on the right lower anterior leg.
Multiple small dry ulcers on the right leg.
Left lower extremity:  Dry gangrene of the entire heel present.
Abdominal aorta nonpalpable.
Urinalysis negative.
Portable chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly without congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
EKG shows a normal sinus rhythm at 87, left axis deviation, poor R wave progression, nonspecific ST-T changes.
Possible old inferior myocardial infarction.
No significant change since previous EKG.
Right anterior leg ulcer was cultured.
She was extremely fearful of taking pain medications which might affect her respiratory function which was already affected by residual tracheal stenosis after a tracheostomy in [**2126**].
for pain until the Pain Service could be consulted in the morning; the patient had moderate pain relief with one dose of Ultram.
She was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21321**] of the Renal Service.
The one-to-one sitter was maintained until [**2130-7-1**], when Psychiatry felt that the patient no longer had any suicidal or homicidal ideations.
The study showed several moderate fixed defects, with diffuse hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 19%.
Because of the patient's worsening renal status, she underwent an MRA of her legs rather than an arteriogram.
The MRA done on [**2130-6-27**], showed moderate stenosis in the right superficial femoral artery, two-vessel runoff and a good quality dorsalis pedis with distal attenuation.
There was two-vessel runoff into the foot with a high-grade stenosis in the mid-portion of the dorsalis pedis artery.
The patient had forefoot pulse volume recordings done on [**2130-6-28**], which showed a 6 millimeter deflection on the right and a 16 millimeter deflection on the left.
Her postoperative pain was managed with Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg p.o.
The shin ulcer is to have a saline dressing wet-to-dry q. a.m. and a Regranex dressing in the evening per protocol.
Worsening renal failure, no hemodialysis at this time.
Chronic anemia, status post transfusion.
Tracheal stenosis requiring CPAP.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus with triopathy.
