Admission Date:  [**2103-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-1-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy and GJ feeding tube placements Total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy ([**2103-5-3**])  History of Present Illness: 52 yo female with history of [**Location (un) 805**] Syndrome, atrial fibrillation, CHF (?
diastolic, last EF 70%), history of MVR s/p valvuloplasty [**2100**], recent recurrent PNAs (last [**1-12**] w/MSSA PNA s/p intubation), and severe COPD, who presents with shortness of breath.
Has had body aches for the last 2 days.
She reports increased SOB, but denies cough, sputum, fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, or dysuria.
Because of the shortness of breath and fever, she was sent to the ED.
The patient was given 2L of NS thinking she was tachycardic from dehydration.
She was also given combivent, and morphine 2mg IV x 2 and tylenol 1gm PO ONCE for body pain and dyspnea.
In the MICU, she arrived in acute respiratory distress and tachypneic with heart rate in the 130s in a fib with RVR, and hypoxic to the 80s on 6LNC.
Past Medical History: PMH: [**Location (un) 805**] syndrome, developmental delay, steroid-induced diabetes, afib with left atrial clot, diastolic CHF, COPD, diverticulitis, MR, malnutrition  PSH: mitral valvuloplasty ([**2100**] - [**Hospital1 112**])   Social History: She was at Bostonian [**Hospital1 1501**] after last discharge.
No other congenital abnormalities in the family  Physical Exam: On admission: GEN: Small, pale, woman with [**Last Name (un) **] facies, tachypneic, using excessory muscles to breath HEENT: Anisocoria (old), anicteric, dry MM, op without lesions, mildly elevated jvd, RESP: Bibasilar rales R>L, moderately reduced airflow, no wheezes, positive egophony at right base CV: Tachycardic, irregular, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: AAOx3.
The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
There is also blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles concerning for small pleural effusions with possible pleural thickening.
Minimal superimposed pulmonary vascular congestion may also be present.
Large right base opacity and possible small left base opacity, worrisome for pneumonia.
Possible small bilateral pleural effusions and/or pleural thickening.
The lungs are hyperinflated consistent with patient's known COPD.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
There are no other interval changes.
The lungs are stable in appearance with background emphysema, bilateral pleural effusions and extensive consolidations which are greater on the right.
Probable atrial fibrillation with moderately controlled ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes persist.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
diastolic, last EF 70%), history of MVR, recent recurrent PNAs, and severe COPD, who presents with shortness of breath, leukocytosis, bandemia, and RLL infiltrate.
#Lactic acidosis: Patient developed abd pain and required pressors overnight on [**5-3**].
Dyspnea/hypoxia: Patient with a white count of 29 with bandemia, and dense RLL consolidation, which raises the concern for acute bacterial pneumonia.
She has a history of MSSA but also given her stay at a rehab facility, healthcare associated pneumonia and hospital acquired pneumonia were also considered.
Also there was a component of acute pulmonary edema and COPD.
PE is unlikely given clear precipitant for dyspnea/hypoxia and that patient has been therapeutic on coumadin.
Patient treated with Vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin given her recent hospitalization within 90 days, her stay at rehab, and severity of illness as well as MRSA positive in her Nares.
Due to lack of clear improvement and concern for increasing sputum, she had a bronch (awake) which showed minimal secreations but significant airway collapse.
She was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and afterwards, significant secretions suctioned out.
Of note, the patient's CT chests document very little apical parenchymal reserve and significant blebs.
Spontaneous breathing trial on [**4-22**] was uneventful and patient was extubated on [**2103-4-22**].
On [**4-23**], she was weaned down to 5 L nasal cannula, but that same night, she developed an increasing O2 requirement.Intermittantly she was having mucuous plugging.
On [**4-25**], the patient developed incrasing hypoxia and was reintubated.
However, interventional pulmonology was unable to place a PEG due to esophageal stenosis.
She was put on pressure support once trached which she tolerated initially but would pull low tidal volumes and needs resting at night or after oxycodone.
On [**4-26**], she tolerated trach collar for many hours but became hypercarbic to pCO2 of 57 and was put on the vent to let her rest.
# Nutrition: Patient with very poor PO intake during hospitalization, albumin low at 2.9.
Interventional pulmonology attempted to place a PEG on [**2103-4-26**] but was unsuccessful due to esophageal stenosis.
- Continue tube feeds: Nutren 2.0 Full strength; Starting rate: 30 ml/hr; Advance rate by 10 ml q12h Goal rate: 30 ml/hr Residual Check: q4h Hold feeding for residual >= : 200 ml Flush w/ 30 ml water q6h - Continue multivitamin, Vitamin B12 50mcg daily and Vitamin D 400mg daily - Continue lansoprazole, simethicone and zofran for GI upset, nausea .
Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive overnight on [**4-30**] likely related to escalating doses of metoprolol amd small doses of narcotics and ultram which she seems sensitive to.
Cortisol levels could not be checked in setting of recent prednisone.
BPs ranged from hypotensive (thought [**1-3**] meds) to hypertensive (possibly pain related) and normalized on their own.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Most likely precipitant is infection, hypoxia, and dyspnea.
Rate well controlled on PO diltiazem and home digoxin - this was later decreased to 30mg QID and her metoprolol decreased from 12.5 mg TID to [**Hospital1 **] given bradycardia into HR50s (asymptomatic), especially when intubated.
Coumadin was held for supratherapeutic INR and the patient started on lovenox bridge.
Metoprolol was uptitrated again briefly for BP and HR control, but subsequently was downtitrated due to bradycardia.
Metoprolol was increased to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**4-29**] but held for hypotension and then decreased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
History of dCHF: Patient with MVR s/p valvuloplasty in [**2100**].
The patient was felt to be overly diuresed eventually and received a few small fluid boluses while intubated, for lower urine output.
Gentle diuresis was resumed when she developed lower extremity edema ([**12-3**]+).
ECHO was obtained with showed 3+TR and severe pulmonary hypertension.
Diabetes Type II: Steroid exacerbated.
As the patient's steroids were tapered, her insulin requirement decreased.
Glargine was stopped on [**4-29**] for hypoglycemia and her sliding scale was made more conservative to only cover glucose >200.
She developed fulminant c.difficuile with a dramatically elevated WBC (18), INR (6.1) and lactate (14) with an increasing pressor requirement and concern for abdominal compartment syndrome.
She was taken emergently to the OR for a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy.
Echo findings demonstrated dramatic pulmonary hypertension and left-sided heart failure.
She required CVVH for anuric renal failure and dramatic volume overload.
She was treated with zosyn, flagyl and vanco enemas for her rectal remanant but remained floridly septic with hypotension, hypothermia and profound acidosis.
11. levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Q4hrs  as needed for wheezing,  12. trazodone 50 mg PO HS as needed for insomnia.
13. lorazepam 0.5 mg PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
