There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No evidence of recent or previous bleeding noted up to the cecum.
Mosaic appearance in the fundus and stomach body compatible with portal gastropathy.
No acute cardiopulmonary process observed  Brief Hospital Course: 46-year old woman with cirrhosis [**3-17**] to Hep C (Ab+, VL-), hepatic encephalopathy, CHF (right heart failure secondary to pulm HTN), h/o EtOH abuse, recent admission for LGIB p/w lightheadedness and DOE x 2 days.

Colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, there was no evidence of recent or previous bleeding noted up to the cecum.
EGD revealed erythema in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with esophagitis, Mosaic appearance in the fundus and stomach body compatible with portal gastropathy and Hypertrophied duodenal folds.
