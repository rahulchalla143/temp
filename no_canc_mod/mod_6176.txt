The patient was recently treated at [**Hospital1 18**] for an NSTEMI and question of LV thrombus.
He had a cardiac catheterization which showed three vessel disease and a suspected subtotally occluded D1 and /or hazy mild lesion in the proximal-mid LCX at OM2 as the target lesion for his NSTEMI.
An echo during the admission was not able to rule out an LV thrombus.
It showed a pericardial effusion and echo signs of tamponade.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Currently, the patient feels well with no chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, light-headedness.

REPORTS Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2134-9-9**] BRIEF HISTORY:   62 y/o male who was transferred from out-patient facility with moderate-large pericardial effusion with early echocardiographic features of temponade.
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Pericardial effusion with early pericardial temponade PROCEDURE: Pericardiocentesis: was performed via the subxyphoid approach, using an 18 gauge thin-wall needle, a guide wire, and a drainage catheter.
Cardiac Cath Supplies Used:           - [**Company **], PERICARDIOSENTISIS SET           - ALLEGIANCE, CUSTOM STERILE PACK           - MERIT, LEFT HEART KIT COMMENTS:     Pericardiocentesis performed via subcostal approach.
Repeat echo showed no residual fluid.
TTE [**9-9**] 1600 There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex, apical segments, mid anterior, anteroseptal and lateral walls.
A moderate sized thrombus is seen in the apex of the left ventricle.There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-9-1**], there is now a small to moderate pericardial effusion.
There is no clear-cut evidence of tamponade but both [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] appear more compressed than on prior study.
There appears to be a moderate sized thrombus in the left ventricular apex (may have been present on prior but not seen as clearly as on current study).
TTE [**9-9**] 1658 There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex, apical segments, mid anterior, anteroseptal and lateral walls.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
A trivial amount of fluid near the right atrium remains.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o male with PMHx CAD s/p MI in '[**13**] and recent discharge for NSTEMI on [**9-2**], VT s/p AICD placement who presents s/p pericardiocentesis with drain placement after routine echo at cardiologist office showed effusion with echo tamponade.
# Pericardial effusion - s/p pericardiocentesis with drain placement.
Follow-up ECHO post-procedure showed trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
# Hypertension - Normotensive on admission.
Patient had been having cough so switched his ACE-I to [**Last Name (un) **].
# CORONARIES: s/p NSTEMI with discharge on [**9-2**].
EKG on admission showed no ST-T wave changes.
# PUMP: Recent cath on [**9-1**] showed evidence of mild to moderate chronic diastolic heart failure as well as chronic systolic heart failure, EF 20-25%.
No clinical signs of heart failure during admission.
# Hyperlipidemia - Recent lipid panel [**9-1**] showed total cholesterol of 164, LDL 85, HDL 61.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual PRN as needed for chest pain: If you need more than two pills to relieve your pain, you should call an ambulance as this could be a sign of a heart attack.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Cardiac tamponade  Secondary: coronary artery disease, hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Because of the chronic cough you've had, we discontinued your lisinopril as that can be a side effect.
We started a medication called losartan which also lowers your blood pressure without the cough as a side effect.
Please follow-up with your cardiologst, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], to have the echo and for a check-up.
The office will call you on Monday to schedule your appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and your ECHO to rule out pericardial effusion.
