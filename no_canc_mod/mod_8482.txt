Her symptoms improved after [**2175-5-21**].
On that prior admission, the patient continued to have fevers for 24 hours after admission but then she became afebrile after day two.
Blood cultures drawn during that admission subsequently grew Enterococcus and the patient was given Vancomycin and Gentamycin.
The patient returned home, but has been feeling lethargic and unsteady on her feet.
Transesophageal echocardiogram on the day of admission confirmed vegetations on the mitral valve and possible clot in the superior vena cava.
End-stage renal disease.

The patient developed intermittent Mobitz I block and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit briefly where she had no events.
She was evaluated by the Electrophysiology Service who felt that she has a chronic history of conduction system disease with first degree AV block and has likely had intermittent Mobitz I from time-to-time, that is unrelated to her acute endocarditis.
