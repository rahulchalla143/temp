Admission Date:  [**2108-2-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-2-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-1-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: L medullary bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 66 year old right handed woman with a history of mechanical MVR on Coumadin, atrial fibrillation s/p PPM, DM on insulin pump, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF, and COPD who presents with left upper and middle back pain and SOB s/p fall Saturday morning with head CT showing hemorrhage in the left medulla and small focus of SAH.
She woke up Saturday morning, and had left sided mid back pain which was [**3-9**] in intensity and worse with movement.
She woke up Sunday morning with worsened back pain which was up to [**7-9**] in intensity.
She also noticed a contusion in her left posterior head, which she had not seen before.
She complained of being more short of breath than usual, so her daughter called urgent care and took her to the ED.
On ROS, she denied headache, lightheadness, dizziness, nausea/vomitting, weakness/numbness, diplopia/blurry vision, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
Her exam was "speaking in full sentences, contusion in left occipital region, tenderness to palpation of left posterior chest wall, no vertebral point tenderness or step-offs, cranial II-XII wnl, motor, sensory and cerebellar functions normal."
Per report, head CT showed an 8 mm bleed in the left medulla.
CT abdomen/pelvis was ordered to rule out retroperitoneal bleed which was preliminarily negative.
At [**Hospital1 18**], Head CT wet read showed similar appearing hemmorhagic posterior medulla focus, possible slightly increased anterior medulla hemmorhagic focus.
no evidence of herniation, and small focus of subarachnoid hemmorhge likely unchanged.
Neurosurgery was consulted who thought that the bleed was due to a cavernous malformation in medulla with acute blood.
She did complain of nausea after laying down for the head CT. She currently denies back pain.

She denies a family history of stroke and DM.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 66 year old right handed woman with a history of mechanical MVR on Coumadin, atrial fibrillation s/p PPM, DM on insulin pump, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF, and COPD who presents with left upper and middle back pain and SOB s/p fall Saturday morning with head CT showing hemorrhage in the left medulla and possible small focus of SAH.
Head CT there showed an 6 mm medullary hemorrhage, and she received 2 U FFP for INR 2.6.
Her INR on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] was 2.2 hence received 2 more units of FFP and repeat head CT showed no change.
She had no lateral medullary finding including vertigo, hemisensory findings (ipsilateral face and contralateral hemibody for pain and temperature) or ataxia.
She does have slight L sided dysmetria with FTF and HTS.
She also had no nausea or headache but did have significant left sided back pain.
She was initially admitted to ICU where she remained stable with no further deterioration and CTA (MRI unable to be obtained due to pacemaker) showed no obivous vascular malformation.
Her hemorrhage most likely cavernoma with bled due to trauma and the fact that she is anticoagulated hence more prone to bleed.
Patient also had significant hematocrit drop from admission (35 at [**Hospital1 **] then 27 here on [**2-20**]).
Given risk factor for possible hematoma since she had a fall and was anticoagulated, CT torso was obtained which showed no evidence of hematoma.
Her course was also complicated by a one-time fever to 102 F. Her urine was mildly dirty and she was started on Bactrim for 10 days given her prior indwelling foley.
Her course was also complicated by mild ARF (Cre 1.4) which we felt was the product of over-diuresis in the setting of decresed PO intake.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospice and VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: left medullary bleed   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a small medullary bleed in the context of being on coumadin after a fall.
Fortunately you have had little deficit on your neurological exam.
Please return to the ER if you experience any focal weakness, change in sensation, vision, language, or cognition, develop any severe headaches, vertigo, limb clumsiness, or anything else that concerns you seriously.
