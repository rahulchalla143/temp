Admission Date:  [**2193-1-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-1-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-5-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Avelox / Omeprazole  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 663**] Chief Complaint: SOB, cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right pleurex drain insertion [**2193-1-11**]   History of Present Illness: 85 year old female with COPD on home O2 and recent left exudative pleural effusion who presents with cough, SOB and palpitations.
She reports 1 week of worsening cough productive of yellow sputum.
Also has shortness of breath.
Endorses occasional feelings of her heart double beating after a coughing spell.
In late [**11-18**] she had a mild COPD exacerbation and her Symbicort was increased and she was given azithromycin.
In [**12-19**] she was admitted to the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital with a new left pleural effusion.
She was found to have an "undiagnosed lymphocytic, exudative effusion with negative cytology, AFB, bacterial and fungal cultures."
She also had a [**Hospital1 882**] admission in [**10-19**] and she had a sputum culture that reportedly grew cephalosporin-resistent pneumococcus.
She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1632**] (pulm) last week and had an echo that was unchanged from prior with normal EF >55% and boderline pulmonary hypertension.
Labs were significant for an elevated lactate to 3.1.
Endorses 3 episodes of bowel incontinence thought to be due to her Glucerna.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.

Trace bilat ankle edema.
BC [**1-6**] no growth .
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2193-1-7**]):       Negative for Influenza B. .
Lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and increased AP diameter ofthe chest on the lateral view, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are again seen.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis are again seen.
Superimposed bibasilar consolidation cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.
Mild anterior wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying bibasilar atelectasis.
Underlying consolidation not excluded, particularly in the medial right lower lobe and infectious process not excluded.
There is minimal amount of left pleural effusion and moderate-to-large amount of right pleural effusion demonstrated on the decubital views.
XR CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2193-1-10**] 4:31 PM In comparison with the study of [**1-5**], there is no change in the  degree and extent of the bilateral pleural effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis.
Findings of chronic pulmonary disease persists.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
Anteroseptal ST-T wave changes consistent with possible ischemia.
Intervals                 Axes Rate PR  QRS   QT/QTc     P QRS T 99   140  78   362/430    69 0 48  Brief Hospital Course: 85 year old female with COPD on home O2 and recent left exudative pleural effusions, who presents with cough, SOB and questionable palpitations and orthopnea.
Continued episodes of tachypnea, SOB and anxious ++ re these.
Right Pleurex drain was inserted [**1-11**] for symptomatic relief of effusions.
She complained of pain at the drain.
Shortness of breath: Has increased cough production without fevers and worsening shortness of breath.
Feel that this is most likely a bronchitis triggering a mild COPD exacerbation.
Currently patient with baseline O2 requirement and appears comfortable and minimally wheezy.
Also with recent h/o pleural effusions that were by report exudative.
Always concern exists for empyema given this history, but CXR shows only small bilateral effusions and patient doesn't have leukocytosis or fever.
There was no xray or clinical evidence of pneumonia although this could not be excluded on imaging.
Also had a history of SOB worse when lying flat, although did not appear volume overloaded on physical exam and has had recent echo without evidence of CHF (JVP not elevated and trace akle edema).
She had  lateral decubitus CXR on [**1-6**] which showed a minimal left and moderate-large right pleural effusion.
She was noted to have a rising lactate which was thought related to poor po intake.
Her ABG showed a respiratory alkalosis with a low pCO2.
She was then started on IV ceftriaxone to cover for possibel infection although her WBC were notelevated, she remained afebrile and had no radiographic evidence of infection.
Her high lactate max 4.7 and was felt likely due to effort of breathing and some dehydration.
Sh was seen by palliative care on [**1-8**] who recommended oral IR morphine 7.5mg Q4 PRN to as treatment of her anxiety regarding her pulmonary symptoms.
She was seen by her pulmonologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] on [**1-10**] who felt that a Pleurex drain may be of value to symptomatically treat her effusions as these effusions essentially excluded her best functioning lung tissue and were a considerable reason to account for her symptoms.
She agreed to drain insertion and interventional pulmonology inserted a right Pleurex catheter on [**1-11**] and post procedure there was no evidence of pneumothorax on CXR but she did note pleuritic chest pain.
Pleural effusions: Currently with small bilateral pleural effusions on CXR and recent admission for exudative effusion of unclear etiology.
DDx is broad but culture and workup have all been negative so far.
Recent CT chest does show multiple pulmonary nodules but none changed from previous or suggesting malignancy.
She was resistant to the idea of diagnostic pleuroscopy on [**1-7**] when seen by interventional pulmonology following a brief stay in the ICU for a respiratory decompensation greatly worsened by extreme anxiety regarding her shortness of breath.
She was changed to a regime to tackle her anxiety with breathing as above.
750ml was drained and limited by chest pain.
Post procedure CXR showed no pneumothorax.
She had pain at the site and this was relieved by oxycodone and a lidocaine patch can also be used.
This was felt most likely due to volume depletion in setting of poor po intake and increased work of breathing.
# Poor po intake: She noted little po intake past 2+ weeks.
Anxiety and Palliative Care: We continued home mirtazepine and increased lorazepam to 1mg PRN Q6H and she was seen by palliative care on [**1-8**] and they followed her during the rest pof her admission.
They recommended adding morphine sulfate IR 7.5mg Q4H for anxiety regarding breathing.
She had a Pleurex drain placed on [**1-11**] for symptomatic relief of recurrent exudative effusions of unknown cause.
In addition, her wish was that if she were to have another exacerbation again that she would re-present to hospital as this would make her feel safe.
