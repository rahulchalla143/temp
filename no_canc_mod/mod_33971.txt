She was taken directly to the operating room where she underwent and aortic valve replacement using a tissue valve.
On POD#1 she was extubated and noted to be lethargic with left sided weakness.
She had a short burst of atrial fibrillation, but was hemodynamically stable and did not require intervention.
On POD#2  a head CT scan was negative for an acute neurologic event.
Neurology was consulted and thought the patient may have had small frontal infarct that was not evident on CT scan.
An MRI revealed no acute abnormality.
Her neurologic status slowly improved over the ensuing days and her left upper extremity strength improved but did not fully return to baseline.
She completed a course of ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection.
Her beta blockade was stopped for bradycardia.
The bradycardia abated after the lopressor was discontinued.
