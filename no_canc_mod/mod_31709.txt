Serial echocardiograms have shown worsening mitral regurgitation and mitral valve prolapse and increased pulmonary hypertension.
In preparation for mitral valve surgery, she underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant coronary artery disease.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-14**], there has been placement of a pacemaker device with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Other than somewhat better lung volumes, there is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Mitral valve disease.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets.
Eccentric MR jet.
Conclusions Pre-bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position with good leaflet excursion.
There is no paravalvular regurgitation.
There is a very small jet of transvalvular regurgitation.
Left ventricular systolic function post-MVR is mildly depressed (LVEF 45%).
All other findings are consistent with pre-bypass findings.
