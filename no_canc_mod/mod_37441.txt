Admission Date:  [**2122-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-7-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-12-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: SOB, "Sweating"  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization with LAD angioplasty and stenting Endotracheal Intubation   History of Present Illness: The patient woke up this morning severely dyspneic and diaphoretic.
An EKG showed acute ST elevations in V2-V4, and she was taken directly to the cath lab.
She was found to have diffuse multivessel disease, with the most [**Last Name **] problem in her LAD.
She had several episodes of hypotension in the cath lab and a balloon pump was placed.
: Mild pretibial edema bilat., Good pulses on L, Good p.t.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include apical, mid and apical anteroseptal and apical anterior hypokinesis.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Elevated right and left heart filling pressures.
Acute myocaridal infarction managed by primary PTCA and stenting of the proximal and mid LAD.
Successful insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump.
1.CAD: Her LAD lesion was stented.
Further review of the cath films showed diffuse disease in her RCA and OM-1.
She had no more cardiac chest pain while here, and daily ECGs did not show any new ischemia/infarction.
She was initially on heparin due to akinetic apex.
2.Pump: She was initally on a balloon pump, but this was removed in the morning after admission, as she was holding her own BP without issue, and tolerated weaning trials.
She had one episode of non-sustained VT, but it was asymptomatic.
Her initial pulm edema was improving on CXR.
It was likely acute CHF due to her anterior MI.
She did have some blood tinged sputum, but this was likely the result of ET tube trauma, and gradually faded.
5.Anemia:  She had a decrease in hematocrit during the stay.
Retroperitoneal bleed was a question, so she had an abdominal CT which was negative for this.
She continued to have a low Hct, but it was stable.
It is likely due to combination of dilution by fluids and bleeding from procedures.
If this persists as an outpt, she can have her anemia worked up further.
She will follow-up with her PCP and with Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 171**] in 1 month to arrange for a stress test.
She was also put on Plavix and understands the need to keep taking this for 6 months no matter what.
