Currently, there is no evidence of pneumothorax but a small pleural air inclusion at the right aspects of the lateral chest wall has slightly decreased in extent.
[**2148-8-19**]: Severe right lower lobe atelectasis and left lower lobe collapse with concurrent loculated pleural effusions.
Interval improvement of a small area of radiopacity lateral to the aortic knob is resolving atelectasis, or less likely pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, at least partially loculated, not increased on neither right nor left side.
Bibasal consolidations are unchanged as well as there is no change in the mediastinal appearance.
Interval decrease in the now small air and fluid collection in the right pleural space with a thickened enhancing pleura consistent with empyema.
New adjacent ground-glass parenchymal opacity could represent infection.
Unchanged left small nonhemorrhagic effusion with associated pleural thickening and enhancement.
NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
MODERATE GROWTH.
