PEG tube placement   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 73 year old male with atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD, DM type 2, prior CVA, who presents to the ED after falling in his bathroom at home.
His wife reports she heard a thump, and found the patient on the floor with a large laceration on his head, awake.
He had imaging of his neck, which showed an acute C3 fracture, as well as C4/C5 osteophyte with cord compression.
Neurosurgery was consulted, as well as trauma surgery.
CT chest showed a non-calcified nodule, and there was a renal mass seen on CT abd.
He was admitted to ICU for monitoring of neuro status, and to medicine due to multiple co-morbidities.

ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2123-10-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
Apparent blockage of the intrathecal contrast especially ventrally at the C4/5 level due to a large disc osteophyte complex which appears to be causing severe canal stenosis.
At C3/4, there is a disc osteophyte complex which appears to be causing moderate canal stenosis.
At C6/7, there is a disc osteophyte complex which is causing mild canal stenosis.
No high-grade canal stenosis of the thoracic or lumbar spine although evaluation of the lumbar spine is somewhat limited by suboptimal filling of the thecal sac by contrast.
Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.
Slightly larger area of ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe may represent contusion.
2) Bilateral renal hyperdense and hypodense lesions, which may represent simple and hemorrhagic cysts though evaluation is incomplete on this noncontrast study.
Cystic structure inferior to left kidney may represent exophytic cyst.
5) Degenerative changes with large posterior osteophytes of the spine as described above.
Extensive left frontal scalp and left periorbital and preseptal soft tissue swelling and hematoma.
Within the context of this severely limited scan, there does not appear to be an intracranial hemorrhage or acute fracture.
[**2123-10-8**] ECG - Ventricular paced rhythm.
There are very large anterior osteophytes at C5-6.
There is diffuse disc space narrowing at all levels.
There is a bridging osteophyte at C6-7.
There is a new anterior fixation plate with two screws through the bodies of C4 and C5.
There is no evidence of hardware breaks.
There has been partial resection of the posterior corners of the vertebral bodies adjacent to the C4/5 disc.
The previously seen posterior osteophytes have been largely resected with some minimal osteophytes remaining at the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.
Bilateral foraminal stenoses are again seen at this level.
There is new soft tissue emphysema of the anterior neck, especially extending along the right side of the neck and along the esophagus.
Since [**2123-10-8**], new ACDF of C4 and C5 with no evidence of hardware breaks.
The previously seen posterior disc osteophyte complex has been resected with residual osteophytes of the uncovertebral joints bilaterally remaining.
Again visible is a non-displaced fracture of the anteroinferior corner of C3.
Multilevel degenerative changes as previously described.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2123-10-18**] 9:00 AM In comparison with the study of [**10-14**], there is no interval change.
Specifically, no evidence of new pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 year old male with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and ESRD on HD, who presents after mechanical fall with C3 fracture and cord compression.
He denies any complaints of chest pain, palpitations, and seizure activity.
Regarding structural heart disease, patient has had an echocardiogram on [**11-4**] which had no evidence of aortic stenosis or other structural defect.
No evidence of ischemia/MI, CE's stable.
ECHO [**11-4**] no evidence of AS or other structural defect that could explain syncope.
Infection appeared unlikely given that patient remained afebrile and no history to suggset infection.
CT showed no evidence of bleed to suggest hemorrhagic stroke.
Cannot get MRI to r/o acute embolic stroke, though pt was supratherapeutic so less likely.
Acute fracture of C3 and cord compromise.
Patient was found to have an acute C3 fracture with evidence of cord compromise.
He has been using standing tylenol and prn morphine for pain control.
Coronary Artery Disease Patient's cardiac enzymes were negative and his ECG remained unremarkable.
4 CHF: Patient has a history of a depressed ef (~30%) and he remained stable from that standpoint during his admission.
New renal mass in L kidney.
# Anemia: He has anemia associated with CKD and receives EPO.
# PPX: pneumoboots, aspiration and fall precautions, bowel regimen, ppi for steroids # Code: full.

Discharge Condition: Stable - Patient continues to be NPO due to poor swallowing function.
You were found to have fractured a bone in your neck and that small fragments of bone were compressing your spinal cord.
While you were hospitalized, you were also found to have a urinary tract infection and were treated with an antibiotic called vancomycin for a five day course.
We also held your coumadin in the setting of your recent injury and surgery.
- Senna and bisacodyl - we added these medications to maintain regular bowel movements.
- Tylenol - We added scheduled tylenol to treat post-operative pain.
- Morphine - We added morphine as needed for pain breakthrough - Pantoprazole - We added pantoprazole to prevent stress induced esophagitis or ulcers.
