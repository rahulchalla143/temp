She states that she has chronic pain near her right upper quadrant, felt to be related to her ulcer disease.
2 weeks ago, she reported that she developed a new pain in her left lower quadrant.
She was told his may be diverticulosis, and was treated conservatively and without antibiotics.
Subsequently, in the past few days, she reports that she developed an acute on chronic pain in the epigastric/RUQ region.
She had a "popcorn" feeling and never had pain like this before.
Prior to her [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] admission, she had CT abdomen at [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital without acute process.
At [**Name (NI) **], pt had 300cc of hematemesis, and on transfer an additional 3-4 episodes of hematemesis (?
Of note, she has never had hematemesis before.
NG tube aspirate with red color gastric fluid.
EKG showing NSR, old LBBB, no ischemic changes.
Possible history of CNS lupus that per patient gives her MS symptoms of weakness,  tingling and memory problems.
***Clarified this diagnosis with the patient's PCP who stated it was a 'soft call', not really sure she ever had this, more consistent with anxiety and depression.
-migraines with frontal headaches and flashing, and severe headaches.
-peptic ulcer disease.
-Recent diagnosis of B12 deficiency per patient.
Family History: Father died of aplastic anemia at 38, mother smoked and died of lung cancer at 50.
Physical Exam: On Discharge: VS: 98.7, 67, 112/64, 18, 99 RA GEN: AxOx3, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, OP without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, jvd 6 cm, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: mild epigastric tenderness, pigtail drain in place RUQ draining bilious fluid EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters NEURO: AAOx3.
Excavated Lesions: Two superficial non-bleeding ulcers ranging in size from 3 mm to 4 mm were found in the jejunum distal to the anastamosis.
A single additional superficial non-bleeding 5 mm ulcer was found on the jejunal side of the anastamosis.
An adherent clot was noted initially, but removed with washing, and no high-risk stigmata were noted.
This resulted in the formation of a large adherent clot that could not be removed, and prevented adequate visualization for further endoscopic therapy.
Impression: A single cratered ulcer with a visible vessel on the gastric side of the gastro-jejunal anastamosis (endoclip) Previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with identification of the gastro-jejunal anastamosis Two superficial non-bleeding ulcers in the jejunum A single superficial ulcer on the jejunal side of the gastro-jejunal anastamosis, with active bleeding (injection) Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum  EGD: [**2142-5-24**] Previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with identification of the gastro-jejunal anastamosis All previously-identified ulcers examined closely Single clean-based and non-bleeding ulcer on the jejunal side of the anastamosis, with surrounding inflammation and friability Three small non-bleeding superficial ulcers on the jejunal side of the anastamosis Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum IR guided angio of Stomach: [**2142-5-22**]  INDICATION: 60-year-old woman with upper GI bleed.
Endoscopy revealing bleeding ulcers on both sides of the gastrojejunostomy site which could not be controlled by epinephrine injection and clips.
Moderate conscious sedation was provided by administering 200 mcg of fentanyl and 3.5 mg of Versed throughout the total intraservice time of 1 hour 45 minutes, during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by a trained radiological nurse.
Right common femoral arterial access.
Selective celiac arteriogram.
Superselective arteriograms of proper hepatic, gastroduodenal and left gastric arteries.
Coiling of the left gastric artery.
A 5 French short vascular sheath was then placed over the wire.
This was not successful, and the catheter was then re-directed into the common hepatic artery for selective arteriogram.
A Waltmans' loop formed inth ehepatic artrey was then succesful at nearly engagaing the left gastric artrey and a better arteriogram of the celiac truck was then recorded.
Using a combination of Transcend microwire and microcatheter, the left gastric artery was cannulated more distally, and diagnostic angiograms were performed.
In view of direct visualization of active bleeding during that morning's EGD, empiric embolization using two 2 cm x 1 mm coils which were placed in the left gastric artery.
There is gaseous distension of large and smal bowel presumably related to just-completed EGD.
Clips are noted at the region of the bariatric gastrojejunostomy site and cholecystectomy site and a three migrated endoclips are seen distally in the bowel.
Images demonstrate no evidence of abnormal extravasation or vascular malformations.
are visible with no extravasation.
Celiac arteriogram demonstrating typical branching pattern with a gastrohepatic trunk and tortuous left gastric artery.
No extravasation or abnormal vascularity noted.
Left gastric arteriogram demonstrating no active extravasation or lesion.
Post-procedure final scout image demonstrating optimal position of the coils.
The patient withstood the procedure well except for back pain from the table and had no immediate complication and was shifted to the floor in stable condition.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated empirical coil and Gelfoam embolization of the left gastric artery for known bleeding ulcers at gastrojejunostomy site.
Lobulated hypoattenuating non-enhancing abnormality within the lateral segment of the left liver; differential includes an abscess, biloma, or hypoenhancing cystic/necrotic mass lesion.
Associated moderate left greater than right intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Tiny hypodensities in the periphery of the spleen may represent cysts or hemangiomas; difficult to further characterize.
Less likely infarcts or abscesses.
No acute extravasation.
No enhancement of the left gastric artery.
Extensive stool retained throughout the colon.
6mm nodule and 8 mm groundglass opacity of the lingula; comparisons can be made to prior exams if they become available.
Increase in left hepatic lobe fluid collection.
New small fluid collection in anterior abdomen, without evidence of inflammation or infection.
Cholecystectomy changes, with moderate intrahepatic and common biliary ductal dilation.
Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and left gastric artery embolization.
Resolving lingular opacity, likely inflammatory or infectious.
Completely normal assessment of the liver vasculature and extrahepatic portal system.
The collection adjacent to the left lateral segment is largely solid with only minimal cystic areas, likely representing a gel phase clot.
[**2142-5-31**]: US liver  Difficult study due to multiple dressings overlying the anterior abdomen in the region of interest.
There is a pigtail drain in situ in the left lobe of the liver.
Overall, the area of abnormal liver parenchyma measures approximately 3.6 x 3.4 x 4 cm.
The pigtail drain is in adequate position centrally within this area of abnormal liver parenchyma.
No intra-hepatic bile duct dilatation, the common bile duct measures approximately 7 mm, not significantly changed compared to the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient with known peptic ulcer disease presented with with epigastric pain x 2 weeks.
At OSH she had 500cc of bloody emesis and HCT 37 to 29 on arrival to our ED.
Patient remained normotensive and her repeat HCTs were 27.4 and 27.5.
GI was consulted and did a bedside EGD where they saw a bleeding ulcer that they were unable to clip.
She remained stable after this with no further evidence of bleeding and her hematocrit remained stable.
On HD #4, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, but continued to complain of epigastric pain; the WBC increased from 12.9 to 18.3.
An abdominal/pelvic CT scan did reveal lobulated hypoattenuating non-enhancing abnormality within the lateral segment of the left liver with associated moderate left greater than right intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and proximal common duct dilation to 1 cm.
This was consistent with infarction of liver segment.
At this time interventional radiology placed a drainage catheter into the fluid collection wich drained 100cc of bilious fluid.
A follow-up CT scan was done to evaulate the hepatic fluid collection after the drainage catheter had been removed.
A new drainage catheter was then placed which also drained bilious fluid.
Her drain output initially put out roughly 200cc per day of bilious drainage.
This output decreased daily and patients abdominal pain improved.
On [**2142-5-31**] an US of the liver was obtained at the request of the hepatobiliary surgical team which showed a decrease in size of the hepatic fluid collection and the pigtail catheter well placed in the center of the collection.
Pt will follow up as an outpatient with their service for consultation of possible liver resection at a future date.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
