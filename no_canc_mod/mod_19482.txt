Small intestinal segments with diffuse ischemic changes.
Brief Hospital Course: Admitted [**2170-7-25**] with small bowel obstruction and question of perforation/sepsis, transferred from [**Hospital3 **].
Immediately went to the OR for an exploratory lapartomy and ~12 inch ischemic bowel resection.
There was a question of aspiration of gastric contents in the OR, so he remained intubated and was SICU on pressors.
Also on [**7-27**], he had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation with HR in the 140s.
On [**7-29**], he was found to be in respiratory distress with sats in the 80's and was promptly reintubated.
He started on heparin and plavix for demand ischemia vs STEMI after troponins peaked at 0.81.
On [**8-3**], bronchoscopy cultures grew pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
On [**8-7**], a code was called for bradycardia to the 30's and decreased O2 sats.
Tagged RBC scan was performed which showed GI bleeding of unidentified source.
GI was consulted and suspected diverticulosis vs ischemia as sources of the bleeding.
On [**8-14**], he continued to have gross blood per rectum.
He underwent a colonoscopy which showed old blood in the colon, no active bleeding, and diverticulosis throughout.
On [**8-15**], he was reintubated for the fourth time for respiratory distress with PCOs in the 80's.
GI bleeding resolved.
