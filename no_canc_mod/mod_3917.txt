ECG: [**10-31**] NSR, LAD, significant [**Month/Year (2) 5348**] artifact, no clear ST changes.
CXR: ET in place, no effusion, multifocal areas of opacity - asymetric edema vs PNA   Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure The patient recently recovered from multifocal PNA requiring long intubation and trach placement.
Now presenting with acute onset of respiratory distress.
No witnessed aspiration event.
CXR with multifocal opacities concerning for edema vs infiltrate.
Pt with evidence of volume overload on exam, diuresis was attempted with ethacrynic acid as the pt has history of lasix allergy.
A TTE was performed to evaluate for worsening AR/MR or new focal wall motion abnormality as cause for CHF.
The TTE was a limited study, and MR could be exacerbating [**Last Name 3545**] problem, however, no evidence of worsening by Echo.
There was no evidence of infection by sputum, fever, or WBC and bronch appearance was consistent with pulmonary edema.
