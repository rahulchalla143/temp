Redemonstration of reversal of portal venous flow.
Coarse echogenic liver consistent with cirrhosis.
[**2125-1-24**]: Abdomen - supine and erect: FINDINGS: Note is made of diffuse increase in radiodensity of the abdomen, suggestive of ascites noted on the prior ultrasound.
Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable, without evidence of significant obstruction.
No evidence of free air is seen.
No evidence of obstruction or dilatation of the bowel gas.
[**2125-1-25**] Liver/GB u/s-Appearances are consistent with hepatopetal flow secondary to portal hypertension in a cirrhotic liver.
[**2125-1-25**]: LENI: No evidence of DVT .
[**2125-1-30**]: ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with near akinesis of the septum and inferior wall.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion .
The gallbladder is relaxed, but there is gallbladder wall thickening and sludge within the gallbladder, both likely reflecting background chronic liver disease.
The patient has moderate ascites.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.

CONCLUSION: Cirrhosis with portal hypertension as described.
No evidence of renal or hepatic vein thrombus .

[**2125-1-23**]: Stool Cultures: FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2125-1-26**]):       NO ENTERIC GRAM NEGATIVE RODS FOUND.
NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2125-1-25**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
OVA + PARASITES (Final [**2125-1-24**]):       NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2125-1-24**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
SERRATIA LIQUEFACIENS.
Brief Hospital Course: On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], patient continued to have copious diarrhea of approximately 1L per day.
An extensive workup looking for potential causes of her diarrhea inlcuding: - stool cultures : these were negative - paracentesis: negative for SBP, malignancy - TTG: negative - C Diff cultures - were negative - GI service was consulted and followed patient while on floor.
Despite an extensive workup, no clear cause of her diarrhea was identified.
In the AM, she was found to be relatively [**Name2 (NI) 24420**] (sbp in the 70's and tachy to the 115 range) and to have increased o2 requirement (was on 2 lpm, but was 91% on 4 L now on NRB).
She was transferred to the MICU for central access in the setting of coagulopathy (INR 1.5), the need for closer monitoring of volume status and fluid repletion, as well as a diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis.
Later in the evening of [**1-30**], she was found to be in respiratory distress and felt to be in acute pulmonary edema.
This repiratory compromise was felt to also be [**1-18**] increasing abdominal ascites.
It was felt that this ARF was likely ATN from her transient hypotensive episodes vs. Hepatorenal syndrome.
# Elevated bilirubin: In regards to this, there was no evidence of CBD dilation by ultrasound.
This elevation was likely in the setting of worsening hepatitis from volume depletion.
- in addition, the potential of cholangitis was discussed, and it was decided that in the event of worsening clinical status, that there would be a need to cover for cholangitis.
# ESLD/ETOH Cirrhosis:  Initially Held nadolol [**1-18**] relative hypotension,however restarted nadolol [**2-1**] in setting of increasing SBP and discontinuation of pressors.
oral vancomycin switched to IV for broader coverage in setting of increasing WBC, temp, ?sepsis, and no clear source identified.
Her Sputum from [**2-2**] did grow out GNR which grew out to be pansensitive serratia liquifasciens.
- she was continued on rifamixin, and Ceftriaxone was added [**1-31**] - Tap negative for SBP - continued Ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis .
# Depression.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for agitation.
