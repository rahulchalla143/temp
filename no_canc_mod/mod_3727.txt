1) COPD exacerbation/respiratory distress - Patient just D/Ced home [**5-18**] after 1 day stay for COPD flare.
Given sudden decline, etiologies considered include pulmonary embolism or mucus plugging.
He was also treated empirically for pneumonia with azithromycin for 5 days, nebs, and tiotropium.
Twice during his stay in the MICU, he had episodes of flash pulmonary edema that were excerbated by the patient's anxiety causing an increased RR and breath stacking.
2) EKG changes - inferolateral ST depressions, likely rate related ischemia in setting of respiratory distress.
He ruled out for an MI and has had a clean cath in the recent past.
This is thought to be due to overdiuresis and the this resolved with encouaged increased PO intake of fluids.
4) Abdominal Pain - Transient pain that the patient described as soreness in left lower quadrant, not associated with constipation.
Pain resolved spontaneously.
