Admission Date:  [**2133-5-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-5-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-6-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Compazine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**] Chief Complaint: Gastrointestinal bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TIPS Endotracheal intubation Placement of central venous catheter  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 63 y/o female with UC s/p colectomy and colostomy 20 yrs ago and recently diagnosed cirrhosis after a variceal bleed in early [**Month (only) 547**] requiring ICU stay and a total of 11 units of PRBCs.
She presented at that time with bright red blood in her ostomy.
The bleeding was eventual stopped when the surgery team put sutures in an actively bleeding vessel at the ostomy site on [**2133-4-26**].
She now represents with recurrent bright blood in her ostomy starting at 11 PM last night.
She [**Last Name (un) 25177**] had a mild nose bleed.
Past Medical History: Hypothyroidism Ulcerative colitis GI Bleed: Bleeding vessel at ostomy Cirrhosis, likely [**2-26**] ETOH Anemia of blood loss and [**Month/Day (2) **] deficiency Lower extremity cellulitis vs venous stasis   Social History: Reports no alcohol since last admission.

Ext: 3+ tense pitting edema, areas of erythema over b/l medial shins, +warmth, no tenderness.
no focal deficits.
The access site was dilated and a 10-French vascular sheath was placed over the wire with the tip positioned in the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.
The venogram was performed through the catheter, which demonstrated multiple large collateral vessels.
A 10 mm x 94 mm Wallstent was then deployed, extending from the main portal vein into the hepatic vein.
This demonstrated patent shunt, and decreased collateral vessels.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
F/u Day 1 post-TIPS Doppler U/S: FINDINGS: The liver is normal in size, no focal lesions.
No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Doppler interrogation along the stent shows a velocity of 71 cm per second in its proximal portion, an elavated velocity of 210 and 256 cm in the mid portion and 142 cm at the distal end.
Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites around the liver in the right upper quadrant.
Elevated velocities in the mid portion of the TIPS stent over 200 cm per second.
Short interval followup with Doppler is advised.
Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
The stent appears patent with wall-to-wall color flow on Doppler exam.
There is a small amount of intra- abdominal ascites around the liver in the right upper quadrant.\ IMPRESSION: 1.
Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in right or left common femoral, superficial femoral, or popliteal veins.
Bilateral small pleural effusions have slightly improved.
No evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions may be slightly decreased.
Vertical left basilar atelectasis now slightly obscures the descending aorta and some consolidation may be present here as well.
New opacities in right middle lobe and left retrocardiac region, which could represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
Decreased pleural effusions.
[**5-29**] PA/Lat CXR: FINDINGS: Left internal jugular venous access catheter appears in unchanged position with tip terminating in upper SVC.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and bibasilar atelectasis, slightly increased from the previous examination.
No pneumothorax.
Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, slightly increased.
No definite evidence of pneumonia.
Left internal jugular venous access catheter in satisfactory position.
[**5-31**] PA/Lat CXR: There has been no significant change since the prior film of [**5-29**], 06, other than removal of the left jugular CV line.
No pneumothorax.
Bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis are again demonstrated and no new lung lesions are identified.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 63 y/o female with UC s/p colectomy and colostomy 20 yrs ago and recently diagnosed cirrhosis after a variceal bleed in early [**Month (only) 547**] requiring ICU stay and a total of 11 units of PRBCs.
She presented at that time with bright red blood in her ostomy.
The bleeding was eventually stopped when the surgery team sutured an actively bleeding vessel at the ostomy site on [**2133-4-26**].
She represented with recurrent bright blood in her ostomy starting at 11 PM on [**5-24**].
She also had a mild nose bleed.
On presentation to the MICU, she complained of chills, but denies lightheadedness or SOB.
On initial exam in the MICU, she had no evidence of ascites, and diuretics were held.
The first ileal portion showed portal hypertension ileopathy.
Per GI and liver staff, IR consulted for TIPS procedure and possible embolization of prominent ileocolic vein.
She was extubated post-procedure without difficulty.
F/u US demonstrated resultant expected hepatopetal flow, but with elevated velocities to >200cm/sec.
She had no further episodes of bleeding since her TIPS.
She states that her legs improved somewhat, but remained erythematous and edematous at time of admission, and she was switched to vancomycin on [**5-25**].
She had LENIs on [**5-26**], which showed no evidence of DVT.
Her vanc was d/c'ed on call-out to floor on [**5-29**] since LEs did not appear cellulitic, and unclear whether initial appearance was due to cellulitis or venous stasis changes.
She had no worsening of symptoms after d/c'ing vancomycin.
[**5-28**] CXR demonstrated a new RML and L retrocardiac infiltrate, c/w PNA or atelectasis.
She has been receiving finger sticks and being maintained on a diabetic diet for blood sugars elevated to 190s, possibly in setting of infection vs steroids.
On call-out to the medicine floor, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had been afebrile for 24 hours, and was feeling very well.
She did have one transient episode of relative hypotension to SBP 70s on the morning of transfer, which responded well to 500mL LR.
Her baseline BBP is 90s, and she had no further episodes of hypotension below this level.
Once called out to the floor, a PA/Lateral CXR was done to better characterize opacities seen on AP film, which were read as more consistent with atelectasis.
She had no increase in oxygen requirement or new fevers after being observed for 48 hours.
She did have an elevation in her wbc, matching the initiation of steroid therapy.
Primary team believed that episode of fever/rigors was [**2-26**] transient bacteremia in setting of TIPS, and transiently increased O2 requirement was [**2-26**] atelectasis, which resolved with use of incentive spirometry.
As she was not volume overloaded and had a recent TIPS procedure, she was not sent out on her home diuretic therapy.
However, she was instructed to call her physician if she had increasing LE edema or abdominal swelling to discuss reinitiation of diuretics.
She was also instructed to return to the ED with any recurrence of fevers, shortness of breath, or for any other concerns.
