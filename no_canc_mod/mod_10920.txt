Admission Date:  [**2124-7-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2124-7-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-11-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 35714**] is a 46-year-old man who presented with chest pain that developed in the morning at work, it lasted about 5 minutes, it was steady, it was associated with nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and shortness of breath and it went to both arms, however, it resolved after about 5 minutes and the patient continued at work.
Later that afternoon around 1 p.m. the chest pain returned and the patient drove himself to [**Hospital3 3583**] without any resolution of the chest pain.
He also continued to feel nauseous and short of breath.
The patient has a history of chest pain over the past several years which she says is not exertional.
He says that the pain comes on in particular after a night of drinking.
He, however, does have no history of coronary artery disease or heart attack in the past.
The patient also denies orthopnea, PND and lower extremity edema.
At 4 p.m. that afternoon his pulse was 74, blood pressure 126/81, however, the patient continued to have chest pain despite the thrombolytic therapy and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**].
At the cath lab it was found that his left main was normal, left anterior descending had a 99% thrombotic lesion in the mid part of the LAD with timi I distal flow.
RCA had 50% diffuse mid lesion, a 95% lesion as well as a timi II distal flow with left circumflex collateral.
At the time of cath we did Angioject and stenting of the LAD, however, even after stenting we had slow flow so intercoronary Diltiazem was given and results were 0% residual lesion with timi III flow.
At that time it was felt that the right coronary artery was high risk and they were going to place intraaortic balloon pump at the time of cath, however, due to loss of the femoral sheath, it was not done at that time and the patient was sent to the CCU.
His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, 70 beats per minute, resolution of ST changes, however, he has Q waves in 2, 3 and F, axis of 0.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for angina over the past two years for which he has sought no treatment, back surgery, L4,L5, history of penile cancer operated on 15 years ago as well as 2 years ago.
Generally he was awake and alert, in no acute distress.
Oropharynx clear, mucus membranes moist.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
On the second catheterization they noted the RCA had diffusely diseased mid vessel, 100% post AM branch with bridging collaterals and right to left collaterals, however, they were not able to pass a wire through the lesion and it was deemed to be too risky to intervene at that time.
The patient returned to the floor, his lipid levels were checked and it was noted he has a total cholesterol of 219, triglycerides 559, HDL 29 and LDL could not be calculated due to the high triglycerides.
