There is minimal surrounding edema.
There is equivocal midline shift (at most, 3 mm from left to right), slightly increased from prior study.
No other areas of hemorrhage are seen and there is no intraventricular hemorrhage.
Mucosal thickening is seen in the bilateral frontal and ethmoid sinuses.
NCHCT [**2148-10-12**]: No significant change in the left putamen and lateral globus pallidus intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema.
However, given the differential attenuation within the hematoma and a hypodense component  anteriorly, attention for ongoing hemorrhage is rec.
by close followup; clinical correlation for HTN, coagulopathy; further workup for any other underlying cause to be based on clinical correlation.
No shift of midline structures, herniation or intraventricular hemorrhage   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 91361**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for a higher level of care.
He essentially presented to an OSH with slurred speech and right sided weakness and was found to be hypertensive and with a large IPH in the left basal ganglia (putamen/GP).
He did display significant hypophonia and mild right sided weakness, but had no anomia or obvious language deficits.
On [**2148-10-13**] he had an episode of SVT that responded to IV lopressor, and thereafter became quite agitated for which he received IV ativan per CIWA protocol which caused sedation.
He is significantly dysarthric with significant right sided facial weakness but with full strength in all extremities.
At the time of his transfer, he had developed a slightly elevated WBC with 12.1K but had been afebrile and otherwise well appearing.
While on the floor he continued to do well, no longer needed restraints and was able to successfully be sent to rehab.
Subcutaneous heparin was started on [**10-16**] for DVT prophylaxis.
