Admission Date:  [**2139-11-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-12-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-3-1**]       Sex:  M  Service:  VASCULAR  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Non-healing gangrenous right foot ulceration and increasing creatinine.
He has a non-healing right dorsal foot ulcer with digital gangrene and cellulitis with shallow ulcerations.
The patient does admit to rest pain and has noted a dry left medial malleolar ulceration.
Popliteals were Dopplerable signal biphasic bilaterally.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Renal failure.
History of cervical disc disease.
History of chronic low back pain.
History of renal artery stenosis status post angioplasty.
Constitutional exam:  Edgy, but in no immediate distress.
There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
There is no costovertebral angle tenderness.
The right foot shows a 5 cm by 3 cm area of glossy erythema and necrosis with some serous sanguinous oozing with global pedal edema.
Her left foot shows global pedal erythema.
Renal was consulted regarding his elevated creatinine and Vascular regarding his ischemic rest pain.
The Renal Service felt that the creatinine was not an acute change since he has had elevated creatinine within the last two months, the highest most recent being 5.5 in [**Month (only) 359**] of this year and 4.4 in [**Month (only) **] a year prior to that.
There is question that maybe he has reoccurrence of his renal artery stenosis.
Continue to monitor his renal function and urinary output.
The patient was placed on a PCA Dilaudid for pain control.
He underwent on [**2139-11-26**] an abdominal aorta and bilateral iliac angios with nonselective renal angiography.
The abdominal aorta showed mild moderate atherosclerosis.
The renal artery showed moderate restenosis of the right renal artery and left renal artery was patent without stenosis.
The right lower extremity had a high grade diffuse disease of the right external iliacs, totally occluded internal iliacs.
The PSA had moderate disease.
There was no runoff due to renal failure seen on MRA.
The left extremity showed mild osteal left common iliac and left external iliac with severe disease with totally occluded internal iliac and probably occluded left common femoral with no runoff was done secondary to his chronic renal failure.
The procedure was complicated by a left groin hematoma which required a CT Scan to rule out a retroperitoneal bleed which this was negative.
A MRA was done which demonstrated a stenosis of the right internal iliac artery times three sequentially.
The patient had a P-MIBI done on [**2139-11-27**] which showed a moderately reversible inferior and infralateral wall defect and ejection fraction of 46%.
I felt this patient was at low risk for a perioperative cardiac event given high risk for AT and difficulty of access.
Bone scan was negative for osteomyelitis.
His blood cultures were no growth.
Patient was transferred, extubated to the SICU for management of his metabolic acidosis secondary to chronic renal failure.
Acute Pain Service followed the patient perioperative for analgesic management.
His renal status continued to show improvement and his acidosis was corrected.
His basal rate PCA was discontinued on [**2139-12-7**] and OxyContin was begun for analgesia control.
for breakthrough pain.
Ischemic toe and rest pain status post aorta-bifem bypass.
Chronic renal insufficiency with acute increase in creatinine, corrected.
