No head injury.
She has been nauseated and intermittently vomiting.
She reports the patient has been very depressed lately but does not think the patient ingested anything.
She did not notice any confusion, but stated that she has been very weak and fatigued.
There are some reports of bystander CPR but that is not confirmed.
When EMS arrived the patient was pulseless and apneic and found to be in V Fib.
She was shocked then asystolic and then developed PEA arrest.
Patient had a Fem line placed.
She was given Calcium gluconate 1 amp, NaHCO3 2 amps, and started on 1 L NaHCO3, thiamine 100mg IV, The ED was unable to place either a radial or a femoral arterial line for BP monitoring.
Pt was bronched in the ED for concern re: misplaced ET tube due to air leak.
Bloody secretions were noted in bronchi and trachea.

On admission, the patient was in cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure s/p multisystem organ failure.
The patient was critically ill and had very poor prognosis given her initial GCS and prolonged period without cerebral and systemic perfusion.
The cause of her ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest is uncertain.
She possibly had an alcoholic cardiomyopathy that caused the arrhythmia although that was not noted on the Echo that was performed while she was on pressors.
The patient was initiated on a cooling protocol with a target temperature of 34 degrees celcius.
# Her shock was most likely a combination of cardiogenic and hypovolemic.
She did not have any evidence of an MI.
She likely had acute blood loss anemia.
She was treated empirically with vancomycin and zosyn due to concern that an occult infection may be the cause of her symtpoms.
# Respiratory failure.
She became so fluid overloaded with the colloid, crystalloid and medications that were administered that she became hypoxic on maxiaml support.
# Acute Renal Failure - The patient was noted to have anuric renal failure most likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis from hypoperfusion of her kidneys.
# Liver failure - Patient with elevated LFTs at OSH most likely secordary to acute liver failure on chronic liver disease related to alcoholism.
Her LFTS drastically increased from the OSH to levels seen at [**Hospital1 18**] most likely secondary to shock liver.
The patient also developed a coagulopathy with an elevated INR that was not noted ealier.
She did not appear to be # Altered mental status - Patient's neurologic exam is concerning for anoxic brain injury.
# Lactic Acidosis - Patient with severe lactic acidosis >24 initially.
The lactic acidosis seemed out of proprotion to that expected from resusictation alone.
The patient had a mildly elevated osmolar gap as well.
They felt this degree of acidosis was somewhat unexpected as well.
They were concerned about an ethylene glycol or methanol ingestion, an iron overdose, cyanide poisoning, carbon dioxide and a tylenol ingestion despite the normal tylenol levels.
# Comfort measures - After close to 24 hours of resuscitation efforts, the patient still had a very grim prognosis.
Her neurological exam was concerning for severe hypoxic brain injury.
She had fixed dilated and unequal pupils, no gag reflexes and was unresponsive to painful stimuli; however she did have agonal respirations.
