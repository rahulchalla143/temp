No pneumothorax.
Multilevel right rib fractures, better visualized in the concurrent outside hospital trauma torso CT  [**2131-2-22**]: ct of the c-spine:   IMPRESSION: 1.
No acute cervical fracture or malalignment.
Non-displaced right anterior first rib fracture.
[**2131-2-22**]: cat scan of the head:   IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial traumatic injury.
Age-related global atrophy  [**2131-2-22**]: cat scan of the abdomen:    Multilevel non-displaced right rib fractures at 1st, 2nd, 4th, and possibly 3rd and 5th.
No PTX or lung contusion.
No intrathoracic vascular injury 3.
Posterior linear splenic lucency (image 3:56), without perisplenic hematoma, making it less likely to represent a splenic laceration.
Right superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, minimally displaced.
Small adjacent hematoma.
L2 and L4 compression deformities, of uncertain chronicity, but probably old  [**2131-2-22**]: cat scan of the lower extremities:  Schatzker type 3 fracture with depression of the lateral tibial plateau of the right lower extremity with lipohemarthrosis and small anterior soft tissue hematoma.
Large left lower extremity hematoma with intramuscular involvement of the vastus medialis oblique muscle without evidence for definite fracture.
Diffuse osteopenia limits assessment of subtle fractures and given the extent of soft tissue hematomas, MRI of the bilateral knees can be performed for further evaluation.
[**2131-2-23**]:  x-ray of the right knee:  IMPRESSION: Nondisplaced lateral tibial plateau fracture with associated moderate lipohemarthrosis.
Mild-to-moderate volume overload.
Bibasilar opacities, likely  atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
No pneumothorax  [**2131-2-23**]: cat scan of sinus and mandible:  Mild deformity of the right-sided nasal bone likely a subtle fracture of undetermined age.
[**2131-2-24**]: Echo:  IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with mild free wall hypokinesis.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Preserved regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm, or a chronic condition such as sleep apnea, COPD, etc.)
[**2131-2-24**]: chest x-ray:  IMPRESSION: Worsening pulmonary edema  [**2131-2-24**]: chest x-ray:  FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: No pneumothorax is appreciated.
Diffuse ground-glass opacity and vascular congestion has also mildly decreased consistent with mild improvement of a moderate degree of pulmonary edema.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
There is a small hiatal hernia  [**2131-2-25**]:  chest x-ray:  FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
Ground-glass opacity and vascular congestion continues to mildly decrease, consistent with improving pulmonary edema.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions as well as streaky left retrocardiac opacity, which likely represent atelectasis.
A moderate sized hiatal hernia is also noted.
[**2131-2-26**]:  chest x-ray:   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing and pre-described pleural effusions have slightly increased in extent.
Also increased is a small retrocardiac atelectasis.
Minimal overhydration and borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
No pneumothorax.
Prior to her admission, she was hypotensive and required intravenous fluids and packed red blood cells.
She was reported to have a subtle non-displaced nasal fracture, right tibial plateau fracture, and a pelvic fracture.
She also sustained right rib fractures.
Orthopedics was consulted because of the extent of her injuries and recommended a left knee immobilizer.
The pelvic fracture was reported to be stable and managed with a closed reduction.
The acute pain service was consulted and placed a right intercostal nerve block to help alleviate the pain from her rib fractures.
On HOD #3, she developed atrial fibrillation associated with hypotension.
A TEE was done which showed RV changes with a normal ejection fraction.
Her chest x-ray did show mild pulmonary edema and she was started on a gentle diuresis with lasix.

You sustained facial fractures, rib fractures, and a fracture to your right leg.
You are now preparing for discharge to a rehabiliation facility with the following instructions: You did sustain rib fractures because of your injury.
Please follow these instructions:  Your injury caused right anterior rib fractures [**11-29**] which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs ( crepitus )  Please follow these general discharge instructions:  You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
*Your pain in not improving within 8-12 hours or is not gone within 24 hours.
Call or return immediately if your pain is getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or back.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you  Please follow these orthopedic instructions:  brace on R knee per ortho, TDWB RLE, WBAT LLE *report any numbness/pain in lower extremities   Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Plastic [**Hospital 37176**] clinic, as an outpatient, regarding elective repair of your right sided nasal fracture on CT maxillofacial imaging.
