Ischemia, his non ST elevation myocardial infarction on [**8-5**] was treated with Lovenox for 72 hours 120 mg b.i.d.
He had no more episodes of chest pain during the remainder of his hospital course and in terms of his ischemic heart disease was deemed to be stable.
Sinus tachycardia, his rate was controlled with Lopressor, which was titrated up to 150 mg b.i.d.
It was a sinus tach secondary to a hypovolemia after his last skin graft at the end of [**Month (only) 205**], which is believed to have caused his non ST elevation myocardial infarction, so his rate was maintained with the Lopressor at a baseline in the 90s to low 100s with a baseline blood pressure of 80 to 90s/50s to 60s.
In addition in order to control the sinus tachycardia, the patient's pain and anxiety were controlled.
The third cardiac issue is a past medical history significant for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
The patient was treated for 72 hours for his non ST elevation myocardial infarction with Lovenox and he was started on Coumadin.
Infectious disease had signed off saying that he had no further evidence of infection and during his hospital stay at the Medicine Service his skin graft was followed by the Trauma Surgery Service and was deemed to be steadily improving.
On [**2171-8-17**] the patient had a PICC line in the right antecubital area, which was pulled, because the area of insertion was erythematous and slightly indurated.
At that time the patient did not have an elevated white blood cell count and was not afebrile.
At this point the patient still had no evaluated white count and his highest temperature was 100.4.
On [**2171-8-13**] the patient was transfused one unit of red blood cells, because of concern that his sinus tachycardiac might be due to his decreased oxygen delivery with his substantial wound healing.
His anemia is likely an anemia of chronic disease as iron studies were drawn and laboratories were consistent with this picture.
This was discontinued and the patient was placed on oral morphine 60 mg every eight hours with instant relief for breakthrough pain.
The plan is pain wise is to monitor how much morphine he is using and then switch him back to the analgesic equivalent dose of oral morphine so that we can transition him to a po medication rather then a PCA.
Psychiatric:  The patient had a psychiatry consult while in the hospital and they recommended Remeron 30 mg every evening for depression and Zyprexa 2.5 mg as needed for anxiety.
