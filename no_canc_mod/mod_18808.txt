[**2161-7-6**] Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 73788**] is a 76 yo male with a history of angina, and cardiac arrest, who presented with recurrent episodes of chest pain and diaphoresis.

Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel disease.
The LMCA had mild diffuse disease.
The LAD was totally occluded after giving rise to two large septal branches and a very large bifurcating diagonal artery, which had 90% stenosis in its lower branch supplying a large portion of the anterolateral wall.
The LCx had an 80% proximal stenosis and was totally occluded after giving rise to OM1.
Left to left collaterals were present to small distal OM branches.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial pressures, with aortic systolic and diastolic pressures of 126 and 60 mm Hg, respectively.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and distal septum.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.5cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunctionn c/w CAD.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
There is less than 40% stenosis within the right internal carotid artery.
There is 40%-59% stenosis within the left internal carotid arteries.
[**2161-7-12**] Chest CT Scan: There is mild decrease in the AP diameter of the trachea at the thoracic inlet suggestive of post intubation stenosis.
Mild secretions are in the trachea, and right main bronchus.
There are no enlarged mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes.
There is a trace of pericardial effusion.
Bilateral nonhemorrhagic layering pleural effusions, small in the left and moderate size in the right side are associated with adjacent relaxation atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
There is a posterior right hydropneumothorax and tiny bilateral anterior pneumothoraces.
There are bilateral retrosternal hematomas, the left is very small and has a tiny bubble of air.
He remained pain free on medical therapy without further evidence of active ischemia.
Additonal evaluation included echocardiogram which was notable for severe aortic stenosis with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
A carotid ultrasound mild to moderate carotid disease bilaterally(see result section).
Due to recurrent ventricular tachycardia, he required transfer to the CCU for intravenous anti-arrhythmia therapies.
Urology was consulted and flexible cystoscopy was performed with Amplatz dilatation of bladder neck contracture.
There were no complications, and is was recommended to continue foley catheter as long as possible.
He weaned from inotropic support without difficulty.
He experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation which was successfully treated with Amiodarone.
He continued to have an oxygen requirement, and was diuresed.
At discharge there was no warmth or drainage and he was afebrile.
