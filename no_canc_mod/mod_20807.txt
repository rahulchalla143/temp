Admission Date: [**2118-1-26**]        Discharge Date: [**2118-2-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-6-20**]        Sex:  F  Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital on [**2118-1-26**] for congestive heart failure.
She had a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 69**] prior to this visit in [**Month (only) 359**] with congestive heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and acute-on-chronic renal failure.
She was discharged home on [**2117-12-1**] with plans for rehabilitation and recovery at home and then possible mitral valve repair in the future for her known mitral regurgitation.
The patient reported two admissions to outside hospitals since her discharge on [**12-1**] and weakness as well as gastrointestinal bleed.
On [**1-25**] she presented again to an outside hospital with bright red blood per rectum and progressive weakness.
She reported edema, fatigue, weakness, and dyspnea on exertion.
The patient had no catheterization of record on here; but appears to have had her last catheterization in [**2117-3-29**] at an outside hospital with clean coronaries.
On [**2118-1-18**] a transesophageal echocardiogram had been done at [**Hospital1 69**] which showed an ejection fraction of 30 to 35 percent, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, trace aortic insufficiency, 3 plus mitral regurgitation, 2 plus tricuspid regurgitation, and no noted AF at the time.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of    2).
ALLERGIES:  She has multiple drug allergies including SULFA, ASPIRIN, CODEINE, ALLOPURINOL, COLCHICINE, and DIGOXIN.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  In preparation for impending valve surgery the patient underwent a number of studies and also was seen daily by the Medicine Service and the Cardiology Service for resolution of her congestive heart failure.
Preoperative carotid ultrasounds also showed a probable occluded left vertebral artery, but less than 40 percent bilaterally in her common carotid artery.
Sh[**Last Name (STitle) **]in the hospital approximately 10 days prior to her surgery with plans to obtain either repeat pulmonary function tests from an outside hospital or new pulmonary function tests at [**Hospital1 69**].
A GI consultation was discussed, although there was bleeding in the setting of an elevated INR.
Cardiothoracic Surgery also recommended a possible Neurology consultation as the patient reported presyncope and syncopal symptoms over the past two months.
The patient could not clearly say if the episodes were with atrial fibrillation or a gastrointestinal bleed or if they were independent.
She also reported visual changes and the sudden onset of blurred vision that lasted minutes at a time.
She had a CT scan at an outside hospital in [**Month (only) **], for which the Cardiothoracic Surgery team was trying to obtain the films for neurologic review.
Colonoscopy from the outside hospital from [**12-17**] showed diffuse moderate-to- severe diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending colon and a colon polyp.
A small-bowel series on [**2117-12-20**] also at an outside hospital showed a distended third portion of the duodenum with recommendations for abdominal CT.
She was treated for a urinary tract infection from [**2118-1-22**] to [**2118-2-2**] with Levaquin.
She also received two doses of Macrodantin for a urinary tract infection.
On [**2118-2-7**] the patient underwent aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, replacement of ascending aorta, closure of ASD/ISD, and a partial maze radiofrequency ablation.
Over the course of the next several days, the patient exhibited both bradycardia and a rapid atrial fibrillation.
Electrophysiology consulted on the patient and determined that she had tachy- brady syndrome and would require a pacemaker.
Over the course of the next couple of days, she did complain of some pain in her right foot which was similar to her gout pain.
Again, she refused to restart Coumadin given her increased bleeding risk and prior gastrointestinal bleeds.
Also on [**2-18**], a chest x-ray showed small bilateral effusions, but the patient made excellent progress on the floor after her pacemaker and was discharged from the hospital.
A repeat cardiac catheterization showed a normal left main, normal LAD, a normal ramus, a 30 percent OM1 lesion of the circumflex, and a normal RCA, as well as severe aortic stenosis.
She had decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Her chest incision had no drainage or erythema.
She had 1 plus peripheral edema, but her extremities were warm.
Her pacemaker site was unremarkable in her upper chest area.
Status post aortic valve replacement, mitral valve    replacement, tricuspid valve repair, radiofrequency maze    procedure, repair of atrial septal defect with closure and    replacement of ascending aorta.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with tachy-brady syndrome.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Diverticulitis with a history of gastrointestinal    bleeds.
