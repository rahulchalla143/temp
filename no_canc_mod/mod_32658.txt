He was found to have multifocal pneumonia on CXR and was treated with Vancomycin, CTX, azithro, levofloxacin, and solumedrol (for concern of retropharyngeal abscess).

The lung volumes remain low and (allowing for technical differences) the patchy airspace process involving the right mid lung and both lung bases has become more confluent.
There is no pleural effusion and the cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vessels are unchanged, with no evidence of hilar adenopathy.
Left lower lobe process is also progressing, but less extensively.
[**12-31**] CXR PA/LAT: Widespread, multifocal areas of consolidation have progressed in the interval, particularly in the mid and lower lungs bilaterally.
Additionally, new patchy ill-defined areas of consolidation have developed within the upper lungs, right greater than left.
Small left pleural effusion with apparent loculation is also demonstrated, new in the interval.
The size of the cardiac silhouette is normal, no evidence of pleural effusions.
[**2201-1-1**] CT CHEST: MPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia characterized by the presence of consolidation in all lung segments along with some reactive lymphadenopathy and accompaning pleural fluid bilaterally.
Non pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinum, most likely reactive.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Pt is a 19 yo male with an extensive psychiatric history as well as a history of poly-substance abuse in the past who presents with fever, sore throat and respiratory distress.
# Multifocal pneumonia:  Initially, due to concern for respiratory distress and fever, Pt was assessed by CT scan for pharyngeal abscess, which was negative.
His initial CXR, however, showed a multifocal pneumonia by CXR.
Pt received Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin in the ED as well as solumedrol and stablized from a respiratory standpoint.
He was admitted to the ICU because of the extent of his initial respiratory distress, but was saturating at or near 100% on RA at that point.
This concern was raised in the setting of a multilobular process combined with the fact that Pt has been taking multiple sedating medications at relatively large doses.
Pt defervesced following the addition of clindamycin with decreased cough and improved SaO2, including the maintanence of SaO2 in the 90's during ambulation on [**2201-1-2**].
Given risk factors of IVDU and unprotected sex Pt was tested for HIV and both Antibody and viral load were negative.
# OCD/MDD: Pt did not manifest any signs or symptoms of active OCD or depression during this admission.
He was made aware of the fact that there was concern for the possibility of an aspiration event secondary to over-sedation, but deferred psychiatric consultation on numerous occasions as he prefers to have his medications managed by his outside psychiatrist.
Disp:*11 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Community Acquired Pneumonia Secondary: - Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder - Major Depressive Disorder - Dissociative Personality Disorder   Discharge Condition: Stable, no shortness of breath, saturating 95% on room air.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a fever and respiratory distress.
You were found to have a pneumonia, an infection of the lungs, affecting multiple lobes of both your right and left lungs.
Psychiatric consultation was offered on multiple occasions, but you insisted upon continuing your care with you outside provider.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the absence of acute symptoms of OCD or Depression this was considered a resonable request.
Should you experience increasing shortness of breath/cough/sputum production, fever, lightheadedness, chest pain or palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, pus/bloody urine, or any other concerning symptoms please do not hesistate to visit your student health services or return to the hospital for evaluation.
