:  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE/NSTEMI and CARDIOGENIC SHOCK: The patient presented to OSH and was found to have elevated Troponins to 2.0 with CK of 103.
Aditional review of his EKG at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed normal sinus rhythm but prominent ST segment depressions in I, II, aVL, V5-V6 and ST segment elevations in leads aVR and V1.
Patient's beta blocker held in the setting of severe cardiogenic shock on admission to CCU.
Admission TTE/ECHO [**2136-11-1**] showed moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %) and Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
The right ventricle was mildly dilated with mild global hypokinesis as well.
Diagnostic coronary angiography showed 2 vessel and left main coronary artery disease as patient was found to have 90% L-main occlusion.
He underwent PTCA and placement of a bare-metal stent in the distal LMCA to origin of LAD and recovered well with no notable complications post-procedure.
The patient had initial elevation in BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 79816**] given his acute NSTEMI and CHF with poor cardiac output.
He received post catheterization diuresis with Lasix and his CXRs showed improvement in his pulmonary edema throughout his hospital course.
The patient's oxygen saturations were improved to 96 % on room air by time of discharge and he had no clinical complaints of shortness of breath and only trace lower extremity edema which had improved from his initial presentation.
RHYTHM : The patient was monitored throughout his stay and per telemetry he remained predominantly in normal sinus rhythm after his PCI procedure with very limited PVCs.
ANTICOAGULATION: The patient's most recent ECHO revealed moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =35-40 %)and the right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
Thus, he was started on IV heparin and bridged while starting coumadin therapy to reduce his risk of thrombus and CVAs.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE : The patient's initial CRF history was further challenged by his relative hypoperfusion in the setting of his ACS/NSTEMI and during his cardiogenic shock.
Unclear if patient has true underlying cirrhosis but ultrasound revealed a nodular liver.
Per GI records the patient had a classification of Child Class B w/ 30% cirrhosis secondary to alcohol history.
He had no appreciable RUQ tenderness, jaundice, HSM on exam and he will plan to follow-up with his usual PCP after discharge regarding his GI management.
RECENT PNA : The patient was noted to have had a fever at OSH and he had recently completed treatment for PNA.
He had no dullness to percusssion on exam and he had no significant cough or productive sputum during his CCU course.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] did have leukocytosis to 19 at OSH but only mildly elevated WBC to 12 here and CXR clear other than mild effusions initially which had improved to near resolution by time of discharge.
DEMENTIA : For the patient's mild dementia he was continued on his daily Donepezil therapy.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION: On [**2136-11-5**] the patient had a routine UA which revealed bacteria and WBCs and labs were consistent with a UTI so he was started on Doxycycline for a 7 day regimen.
He was through 4/7 days therapy at time of discharge and had no complaints of dysuria or frequency.
SACRAL DECUBITUS: The patient's sacral stage 1 buttock sore remained in tact and he had protective cream applied to avoid any breakdown.
PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was on anticoagulation for NSTEMI and thrombus coverage in the setting of his hypokinetic heart and was therefore covered for DVT prophylaxis as well.
He was asked to please return to the emergency room or call his primary cardiologist or PCP as soon as possible if he had any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness after discharge.
