Mild-to-moderate amount of intra-abdominal/pelvic free fluid with Hounsfield values most suggestive of simple ascites.
Known underlying severe anemia.
Third spacing noted within the gallbladder fossa and ascending and transverse colon.
CHest x-ray - PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The lungs are clear without evidence of edema, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
There is mild eventration of the posterior left hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Echo - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and distal lateral wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
EKG [**2127-6-11**]- Ectopic atrial rhythm with rightward precordial R wave transition point.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-6-10**] multiple abnormalities as noted persist without major change.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo M with alcoholic cirrhosis presents with upper GI bleed from esophagitis and moderately severe portal hypertensive gastropathy which was complicated by posterior MI in the setting of demand.
# Upper GI bleed - Concerning for variceal bleeding in setting of known cirrhosis, but EGD showed portal gastropathy likely [**1-27**] NSAID use.
Octreotide was d/c'd when no variceal bleeding identified on EGD.
A gastric ulcer that appeared healed was found on EGD and will require follow up EGD in [**3-31**] weeks.
Patient was not [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **] aspirin given his significant bleeding risk.
# Leukocytosis - Differential included acute stress response, PNA, colitis, sinusitis given OSH CT findings.
Patient without localizing symptoms and appeared non-toxic.
As he had very mild ascites (unable to perform bedside tap) per recommendations from liver team patient was started on 3 day course of empiric cipro.
Blood and urine cultures were sent which were no growth.
# Demand Ischemia/ - Patient was noted to have diffuse ST elevations and troponin elevation in setting of profound anemia.
Patient reported chest pain prior to admission however remained chest pain free after admission.
Cardiology was consulted and patient was determined to have posterior myocardial infarction.
Aspirin therapy could not be initiated given significant upper GI bleed.
Was sent for TTE to evaluate for wall motion abnormality.
Echo demonstrated regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Cardiology want to take to cardiac catherization as soon as patient would be able to safely go on anticoagulation.
# Cirrhosis - Etiology ETOH/Hep C. Prior workup at [**Hospital3 **] showing mild varices.
No evidence of decompensation clinically, small-to-moderate ascites on imaging.
# SVT with aberrancy vs accelerated idioventricular rhythm: Cardiology was consulted when patient had abrupt increase in HR and EKG showed either SVT with aberrancy vs accelerated idioventricular rhythm with rate of 100bpm.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Upper GI bleed          Acute myocardial infarction          Liver cirrhosis .
Secondary: 35 years of ETOH, sober since [**11-2**] Hepatitis C/ETOH Cirrhosis w/ portal HTN, small varices on last EGD Osteoarthritis of the Knee s/p b/l knee arthroscopies Paroxysmal Afib  Discharge Condition: afebrile, vital signs stable, hematocrit stable > 48 hours  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after an upper GI bleed.
You underwent endoscopy by gastroenterology which demonstrated esophagitis and evidence of portal gastropathy and some esophageal varices.
You also had a myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiology was consulted to evaluate you.
