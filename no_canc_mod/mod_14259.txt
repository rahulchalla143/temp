TEE (Complete) Done [**2146-10-5**] at 4:19:52 PM      FINAL Conclusions No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A pleural effusion is seen.
CONCLUSION: No valvular vegetations or paravalvar abcess seen.
No evidence of endocarditis.
EEG Study Date of [**2146-10-4**] IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal routine EEG in the waking state secondary to a right hemispheric breach artifact.
There were no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform features noted.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2146-10-13**] 4:50 AM IMPRESSION: Mild interval improvement of retrocardiac atelectasis with persistent moderate left effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 51933**] is a 62 yo M with history of schizophrenia, dementia, NMS, anxiety, cardiomyopathy, found on floor unresponsive and found to have brainstem hemorrhage involving R midbrain, bilateral pons, and 4th ventricle.
# Neurology/Inraparenchymal bleed: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the NeuroICU for managment of his likely hypertensive bleed.
His exam has remained relatively stable at day for the first 2 weeks of his hospitalization, with minimal evidence of awareness or interaction with his environment.
On HD# 14, the patient was noted to open his eyes and to have apparent down-gaze only.
He had notable twitching of his right shoulder and mouth; and EEG was normal and without evidence of a eptileptic component to these events.
# ID/Pneumonia/Bacteremia: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated ventilator-associated pneumonia for which he recieved an 8 day course of vancomycin and cefepime starting [**9-12**].
# Cardiovascular/Hypertension: On admission, the patient was monitored on telemetry with no major events and nicardipine drip was used for SBP > 160.
Over his ICU course, the patient was noted to be hypertensive in the setting of increased fluid retention.
He was started on lasix which significantly improved his hypertension and peripheral edema.
# Abdomen/GI:  The patient initially had an OG tube which was noted to have dark output.
Over his hospital course, the patient was noted to have increased abdominal distention and decreased stool output.
Xray was notable for stool in the colon, but no obstruction.
In addition to the above, given the prolonged nature of his hospitalization, a PEG tube was placed on [**10-3**] for long term nutritional managment.
Due to failure to wean completely from the vent, a tracheostomy was performed on [**10-3**].
He has the potential for only partial ventilation requirements as his pneumonia improves.
# Ophthalmology: The patient was noted to have a swollen right eye.
He was evaluated by urology this hospitalization and was felt to have no barrier to future foley placement or removal.

Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for fever or pain.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: brainstem hemorrhage involving R midbrain, bilateral pons, and 4th ventricle, likely hypertensive etiology.
Pupils equal but right eye with minimal reaction.
You have suffered a major hemorrhage in your brain which has resulted in your inability to move, eat or speak.
