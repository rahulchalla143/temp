He was subsequently explored and was noted to have a significant amount of bleeding from the posterior aspect of the liver.
Upon completion of the exploration and a relative hemodynamic stability, the patient was transferred to the trauma surgical intensive care unit.
His peripheral vascular access sites were also bleeding significantly, indicating the severity of his coagulopathy.
After discussion with the trauma surgical attending, the trauma surgical chief resident and the anesthesia attending, who were all present throughout the entire resuscitation effort, it was felt that resuscitation efforts should be terminated, given the lack of chance for survival.
