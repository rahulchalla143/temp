He was undergoing an evaluation for hypertension and had a CT scan which showed a left adrenal mass which is probably not malignant or active, but was found quite incidentally to have a 5.5-cm aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta.
He denies any abdominal or back pain.
His father had a femoral aneurysm which was never treated.
He has also a family history of coronary artery disease.
He was having exertional angina about three years ago.
He had a positive stress test and ultimately [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1834**] cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty and stenting.
He reports that his most recent stress test in this past fall however was reasonably good, although he does not have specific details.
Past Medical History: CAD, HTN, ^ chol, s/p RCA 3.0 x 8 mm Cypher DES [**7-/2184**] Syncope, AAA, PUD as result of large of ibuprofen, s/p cauterization, GERD  PSH: Tonsillectomy, Appy, Bilateral cataract surgery  Social History: He is married and lives with his wife.
Family History: Father - femoral artery aneurysm  Physical Exam: On physical exam, he is well-appearing gentleman in no acute distress.
He had no cervical bruits.
His abdomen was soft and nontender.
He had very prominent pulsating mid abdominal mass was evident, which was nontender.
He had palpable femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally with no suggestion of peripheral aneurysm.
PROCEDURE:  Resection and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with 20 mm Dacron tube graft.
INDICATIONS:  This 78-year-old gentleman was recently found to have a 5.5 cm aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta - not involving the iliacs, with ectasia of his aorta proximally and with the visceral segment being about 3 cm.
He did not have a neck that was suitable for endovascular repair, and he was advised to have an open repair.
An oblique incision was made across the flank, extending to the edge of the rectus muscle, off the tip of the eleventh rib.
The incision was actually extended posteriorly onto the eleventh rib for a short distance.
Dissection was then carried proximally, exposing the entire neck of the aorta inferior to the left renal artery.
It was apparent, however, that the aorta here was thin-walled and ectatic with early aneurysmal changes, and I was uncomfortable with the thought of clamping it, even though I knew there was no thrombus present within it.
A vessel loop was placed around the left renal artery to prevent embolization into the renal when clamping the aorta close to it.
A large amount of thrombus and atheromatous debris was removed from the aortic sac.
Some calcific plaque at the aortic bifurcation was carefully removed transversely, giving a good sewing ring distally.
I then took a strip of felt and took a 20 mm woven Dacron graft.
A couple of small bleeding points were found on the right corner of the anastomosis and these were repaired with interrupted horizontal pledgeted mattress sutures of 3-0 Prolene.
Prior to completing this anastomosis, the arteries and graft were flushed copiously to be sure there was no residual thrombus present within.
The patient did drop his blood pressure to about 80 mmHg, but this responded rapidly to volume replacement.
One or two bleeding points in the distal anastomosis were encountered and these were repaired similarly with horizontal pledgeted mattress sutures of 3-0 Prolene.
The internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles were closed in a single layer with a running continuous suture of double-stranded #1-PDS, and the external oblique was closed with a separate running continuous suture of double-stranded #1-PDS.
He was found to be anemic and hypotensive so was transfused a total of 3 units of blood with suboptimal response.
He complained of abdominal distension and constipation, so was started on a bowel regimen with good result.
On POD 8 he was voiding well, ambulating, and pain was well controlled, so was discharged home.

Eat small frequent meals ??????
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing over the area that is draining, as needed ??????
A sudden increase in pain that is not controlled with pain medication ??????
Bleeding from incision ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions   Followup Instructions: Followup with your primary care physician for blood pressure control.
