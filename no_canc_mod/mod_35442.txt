CT revealed diffuse SAH with early HCP.
12:30 am, heavily medicated, proceeded to CT for a CT and CTA which revealed a L MCA aneursym.

Code Status: Full   Pertinent Results: Radiology Report CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2128-11-26**] 12:30 AM Final Report CTA OF THE BRAIN/CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]  FINDINGS: There is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns.
There is a 2.5-mm aneurysm at the junction of the AComm and the right A1-A2 junction.
There is no evidence for vasospasm.
There is a hypoplastic left A1 segment.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND  FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler images of the left and right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained.
There is non-compressibility and absence of wall-to-wall flow in the proximal superficial left femoral vein, consistent with a non-occlusive deep venous thrombosis.
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive deep venous thrombosis of the left proximal superficial femoral vein.
Status post extensive right frontal craniectomy with placement of paired ventricular drains, with persistent herniation of a significant portion of the right frontal lobe through the craniectomy defect.
Hemorrhage and edema involving the paramedian frontal lobes, bilaterally, which may represent evolving hemorrhagic transformation of acute infarcts, or, less likely, contusions.
Continued blood in the interhemispheric fissure as well as within the ventricular chain, with a very small amount of residual subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Perfusion abnormality corresponding to the abnormal portion of both frontal lobes, but, elsewhere, perfusion is normal, and the CTA demonstrates no evidence of vasospasm or flow-limiting stenosis.
Chronic inflammatory changes involving the left sphenoidal air cells and bilateral maxillary antra.
His mental status remained poor and elevated ICP's.
Pentobarb was then d/c'd on [**12-2**] and angio on that day showed mild vasospasm.
During this time pt was febrile and CSF was sent for culture however pt was found to have LLL PNA which was treated and ID was involved due to gram + cocci in CSF.
On [**12-9**] His exam remained poor with only external rotation of BUE and triple flexion of BLE with noxious.
He was then found to have a L common fem DVT and an IVC filter was placed.
He also had elevated LFTs and abdominal US was negative however an Abd CT was done to confirm these findings.
On [**12-11**] Patients exam has slowly improved, he is opening his eyes and tracking the examiner and following simple commands with his upper extremities, with minimal to no movement of his lower extremities.
During his ICU stay the patient has been bronched multiple times for theraputic lavage and to obtain a BAL.
[**12-14**] slight development of hydrocephalus.
