INDICATION: 35-year-old male with Down syndrome and pleural loculations on chest x- ray.
Initial presentation is right upper quadrant pain and fever.
Intravenous contrast was not administered secondary to elevated creatinine.
The unopacified heart and great vasculature are grossly unremarkable without pericardial effusion given limitation of no IV contrast administration.
There are scattered prominent lymph nodes within the mediastinum, the largest of which measures 1.5cm in short axis in a subcarinal location.
No axillary adenopathy is present.
Limited views of the upper abdomen without contrast demonstrate no abnormalities within the liver, stomach, adrenal glands or spleen so far as visualized.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
Multiple loculated right-sided pleural fluid collections are noted.
The attenuation of these pleural collections is consistent with simple fluid.
Compressive atelectasis is noted in the right lung with septal thickening at the right lung base.
There is no pneumothorax.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are detected.
Loculated right pleural fluid collections.
Given the absence of contrast evaluation for enhancement and nodularity along the pleura is limited.
Septal thickening and atelectasis in the right lung.
Small left pleural effusion.
***** [**2172-1-12**] RUQ ULTRASOUND: Reason: Please eval for GB pathology or other pathology contributing  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 35 year old man with fever, jaundice, RUQ tenderness REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please eval for GB pathology or other pathology contributing to his sx INDICATION: 35-year-old man with fever, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness.
FINDINGS: There is a subtle rounded hyperechoic area seen adjacent to the right hepatic vein, measuring approximately 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.
No definite Doppler flow is seen within this lesion.
No other definite focal lesion is identified within the liver.
Gallbladder appears unremarkable, without evidence of stones.
Right pleural effusion incidentally noted.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
Subtle hypoechoic lesion seen within the right lobe of the liver without significant mass effect, possibly representing focal fatty infiltration, hemangioma or FNH.
Right pleural effusion.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No pericardial effusion or pathologic flow identified.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
***** [**1-25**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please perform w/ PO and IV contrast - hypoechoic liver lesion on previous US [**2172-1-12**], now w/ elevated LFTs, fever CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Hypoechoic liver lesion on previous ultrasound and elevated liver function tests.
FINDINGS: The liver appears normal with no evidence of abnormal lesions corresponding to the son[**Name (NI) 493**] finding within the right lobe.
There is an NG tube in place with the tip seen within the stomach.
The bowel appears unremarkable with no evidence of pneumatosis or obstruction.
There is no evidence of free fluid within the abdomen.
There are bilateral basilar atelectases with consolidation in the right lower lobe.
There is a small right- sided pleural effusion.
There is a subcutaneous collection seen in the right hemithorax more laterally on image 122 measuring 4.4 anteroposteriorly x 2.5 cm axially.
There are no suspicious bony lesions.
There is no hepatic lesion detected that would correspond to the ultrasonographic finding within the right lobe.
Bilateral lower lobe atelectases and consolidation within the right lower lobe with a small effusion.
A collection within the subcutaneous tissues in the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax with evidence of surrounding inflammatory changes.
He continued to spike fevers with elevated white count, and his cultures grew out strep viridans from the pleural fluid and yeast from sputum.
Echo was done which was negative for vegetations, and all lines were changed.
On [**1-25**] he had a CT of the abdomen/pelvis to rule out intraabdominal source, which revealed a fluid collection below his thoracotomy wound, so the incision was opened.
Minimal purulent fluid and old clotted blood was expressed.
There was a small left apical pneumothorax post-pull which was stable on subsequent xray.
He completed his course of Zosyn on [**2-4**], but developed C diff colitis so was started on PO flagyl.
