Here he was hypothermic with an elevated lactate and SPB ~70 and started on vancomycin/zosyn for presumed sepsis.
Diagnostic tap of his ascites was negative.
CT showed a small SAH (later thought to be artifact on repeat) and he was dilantin/keppra loaded.
A L1/2 compression fx was seen and orthopedics evaluated him as well.
His initial labs were significant for a coagulopathy w/ INR=1.8 and plt=53 and he was given 1u plt, 2u RBC, and 1u FFP and sent to the MICU for further w/u.
Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**5-31**] for progressive ascites and had a therapeutic tap there and was diuresed with lasix/aldactone.
In the MICU, his BP was stable in a normal range and he had a CXR showing a probable infiltrate along w/ ?
R rib fractures and his antibiotics were switched to levaquin/flagyl.
His mental status was slightly impaired on arrival (AAOx2) and this was felt to be secondary to intoxication and chronic liver failure.
His labs were initially thought to be c/w a picture of DIC (low haptoglobin, low plt, low fibrinogen) but his OSH labs were eventually obtained and showed a chronic picture of liver failure (alt 71, ast 130, alp 719, tbili 1.2, alb 2.1, INR 1.6) along w/ pancytopenia (HCT 24.8 and plt 53).
Given this information, his hematologic abnormalities were thought to be close to his baseline and he was called out to the floor.

There are degenerative changes with intervertebral osteophyte formation at C4-5.
This causes severe narrowing of the spinal canal and flattening of the spinal cord.
Small osteophytes at C5-6 narrow the spinal canal and produce mild narrowing of the neural foramina.
[**7-27**] Rib X-Ray Nondisplaced fractures of the right posterolateral eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs with callous formation.
The findings represent subacute versus remote injury.
No pneumothorax.
Interval worsening of bilateral airspace opacities, worse in the left mid lung.
Diagnostic considerations include pneumonia  CT head [**2151-7-25**]: Likely a small focus of subarachnoid blood in the left parietal  occipital lobe.
Scalp hematoma of the left scalp.
No evidence for skull fracture.
CT spine [**2151-7-25**]: No evidence for cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
Degenerative changes at C4-5 .
Large volume of ascites throughout the abdomen and pelvis.
Small liver and few small varices suggest liver disease.
Distended gallbladder without gallbladder wall thickening or gallstones.
Distended stomach containing solid and liquid material.
Pancreatic calcifications suggest prior pancreatitis.
No pancreatic inflammation or peripancreatic fluid collections.
Stable multifocal consolidations, most consistent with pneumonia.
Stable appearance of right-sided rib fractures without evidence for pneumothorax.
KUB ([**2151-8-3**]): 1) Mild gaseous distention to loops of small bowel, with probable large bowel ileus affecting transverse colon.
KUB ([**2151-8-4**]): Slightly decreased distention to loops of small bowel with unchanged dilatation of the transverse colon measuring up to 8 cm suggestive of an ileus.
No evidence of obstruction.
KUB ([**2151-8-5**]):Dilated transverse colon with interval development of a single loop of dilated small bowel within the left lower quadrant.
These findings are again most suggestive of an ileus.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course: On arrival to the floor on [**7-27**], the patient was complaining of breathing difficulty and increased back, chest pain.
His blood pressure ranged from 95-110, and he had minimal urine output.
Imaging had previously revealed right rib and L1 fractures.
neurosurgery was consulted regarding the patient's neck CT showing possible spinal cord compression.
They felt the compression was a result of chronic degenerative changes, and that the patient's only clinical manifestation was mild proximal weakness.
hepatology consulted on the patient, and they recommended increased diuretic administration.
hepatology initially diagnosed him with hepatorenal syndrome and recommended to discontinue the diuretics, and to add 25g of 25% albunmin [**Hospital1 **].
Since pt responded so well with IVFs and discontinuation of diuretics, the diagnosis was later changed to renal failure.
In addition, his left arm was found to be cyanotic, with nonpalpable radial pulse and poor capillary refill.
No intervention was suggested atthis time.
Heme/Onc was cnsulted and they were not certain if the patient had DIC or HIT, reporting the patient's chemistries are difficult to interpret because he received blood products in the MICU prior to arrival on the floor, and the recent trends in coagulation studies may simply be the patient's return to his baseline values as opposed to a consumptive coagulopathy.
They recommended discontinuing HAART and adding Zosyn (to Vancomycin), given the fact that the patient just triggered with hypothermia and may be septic.
As pt developed a lower extremity rash zosyn was discontinued and aztreonam and flagyl was used instead.
However, on [**8-3**] pt was found to have a possible ileus on a KUB (done b/c had mild epigartic pain).
Patient was temporarily placed NPO but had BM and was passing gas without nausea and vomiting; therefore his diet was advanced while ambulation was ecouraged.
In addition, his amylase and lipase started to rise despite not having any s/s of pancreatitis (no abd pain, no nausea, vomiting).

- Pt needs to have potassium monitored in the close follow-up with his PCP since he is on a high dose of spironolactone which may cause hyperkalemia - Pt may need to be re-stared on HIV/AIS antiretroviral therapy
