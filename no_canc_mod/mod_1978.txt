The pain comes at rest, is not associated with exertion or SOB.
Describes it as pain and pressure.
At [**Location (un) **] her pain resolved with 3 SL nitro, and her imdur was increased.
On the morning of [**1-15**] she had an episode of nausea, wretching, chest pressure.
She was found to have new lateral ST changes - 2mm STD in V4-V5.
Also, CXR revealed possible right lower lobe pneumonia and question of CHF.
She was treated with Levaquin (3 days of 250mg IV) and 40 IV Lasix on day of transfer with only moderate UOP.
On arrival to floor she was comfortable on 3L NC O2, without chest pain or shortness of breath.
On the morning of transfer she developed severe chest pressure and pain with associated N/V.
An ECG showed 2-3mm depressions in V2-6 with 2mm elevation in aVR consistent with left main disease.
She was given NTG SL x1 with resolution of her CP as well as Zofran for nausea.
CAD s/p CABG 2.
CHF- preserved EF but multiple admissions for CHF exacerbations, 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] 3.
HTN 5.
Hypothyroidism 7. s/p appendectomy 8.
Colon cancer s/p hemicolectory [**2142**] 9. s/p cholecystectomy [**53**].
Anemia of chronic disease- baseline hematocrit 30 .
Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Hypertension .
Cardiac History: CABG, in [**2144**] anatomy as follows: bypass from the ascending thoracic aorta to the OM and D1 with SVG and to D1 with LIMA .
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective angiography demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease.
The left main demonstrated diffuse disease with a calcifed 80% distal lesion that extended into both the left circumflex and left anterior descending artery.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA comments).
Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with a Mynx closure device.
Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with a Mynx closure device.
Placement of an IABP .
There is mild cardiomegaly.
There is haziness of the pulmonary vasculature and mild blunting of the costophrenic angles.
Overall, the appearance of the lungs has improved, with a more patchy opacity in the right lower lobe, being less prominent.
No definite evidence of pneumonia.
1/27.09 - chest x-ray PA/Lateral - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2151-6-8**], bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
The prominence of markings at the bases and the pleural fluid makes it difficult to assess for the possibility of a supervening pneumonia.
There is no hydronephrosis, stone, or solid renal mass visualized.
EKG  [**2153-1-17**] - Sinus rhythm.
Non-specific inferior ST-T wave flattening.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2153-1-16**] the anterolateral ST segment depression appears less prominent.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM2 who presented from OSH with chest pain with positive troponin, CHF exacerbation with possible superimposed PNA.
# CAD - patient with extensive CAD history with 3 vessel disease and previous CABG.
Patient's troponin elevated at OSH but no acute ECG changes.
Lateral EKG ST depressions resolving.
On the floor she developed a STEMI and was sent to cath for high risk intevention.
Balloon was then removed and patient remained hemodynamically stable.
Pump - most recent echo from [**9-/2152**] (OSH) demonstrates EF 40%, 2+MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to distal inferior, inferoseptal and apical hypokinesis.
Patient's weight has been slightly increased at home.
No O2 requirement at home.
On exam here at [**Hospital1 18**] patient with crackels at lung bases, pitting edema on right.
As patient had renal failure, initially lasix was held, once creatinine improved to baseline patient started back on home dose of lasix.
As no oxygen requirement currently, did not restart outpatient metolazone.
Possible pneumonia: Patient with possible RLL infiltrate at OSH, given 3 days of levaquin for CAP.
Patient without significant cough, chest x-ray without definitive evidence of pneumonia, and patient only febrile once.
Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency: with baseline Cr 1.6.
The patient acutely became more hypoxic and apparently volume overloaded shortly after placement of HD line, and dialysis was initiated with improvement in oxygenation.
Plan not to discharge on ACE inhibitor given acute renal failure and readdress on follow up.
Hyponatremia: Noted to be chronic issue for the patient.
Patient as above appeared volume overloaded on exam to thought to be secondary to hypervolemic hyponatremia and improved with HD and improved cardiac function.
# Hypertension - patient maintained as outpatient on hydral, norvasc, imdur, as well as beta blocker.
Continued hydral and amlodipine for afterload reduction, however would consider discontinue of hydral when able to start ACEi.
Patient on Procrit as an outpatient as well as iron, likely anemia of chronic disease.
No obvious GI bleeding.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1439**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13089**] Care Center - [**Location (un) 1439**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Non-Q wave Myocardial infarction .
Secondary: Diabetes mellitus type 2 Hypertension Hypothyroidism Chronic renal insufficiency Anemia of chronic disease   Discharge Condition: Good, hemodynamically stable, afebrile, > 2 L of UOP in last 24 hours   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for treatment of chest pain from a heart attack.
You also had worsening of your pre-existing renal insufficiency, likely related to the contrast given during catherization.
You were also treated for pneumonia, and completed your antibiotic course prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].
As you have heart failure it is important that you weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
The following changes were made to your home medications: 1) Your hydralazine dose was lowered 2) Your allopurinol dose was decreased based on your renal function to every other day 3) Your daily potassium was stopped 4) Your norvasc was changed to 10 mg PO daily (previously 5 mg PO BID) 5) Your iron supplementation was changed to daily 6) Your Zaroxyln was discontinued 7) Your dose of simvastatin was increased 8) You were started on calcium acetate 9) Vicodin was discontinued, Tylenol started alone for pain control 10)Your ranitidine was discontinued as H2 blocker unlikely to be a good choice for elderly female (tums PRN instead) .
If you experience any worsening chest pain, SOB, decreased UOP, nausea/vomiting, or have any other concerns please [**Name6 (MD) 138**] your MD or return to the ED.
