Admission Date:  [**2143-5-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-5-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Coreg Cr  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2962**] Chief Complaint: Ventricluar Tachycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VT ablation   History of Present Illness: Patient is an 84 yo woman w/ h/o CAD s/p MI x 2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM2, OSA who initially presented on [**2143-5-1**] with c/o chest pain -> on presentation to ED was found to have monomorphic VT, otherwise hemodynamically stable.
Following ablation, pt was found to have complete heart block and prolonged H-V conduction.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI ([**2115**], [**2120**]) Hypertension Hyperlipidemia OSA on BiPap Diabetes mellitus, type 2 Osteoporosis Recent shingles Vertigo   Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use, but history of heavy use - smoked 3pks/day for 30yrs, quit 25yrs ago.
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Family History: see above  Physical Exam: Vitals - T 96.7, HR 60 (paced), BP 127/57, RR 16, O2 97% on 2L NC General - awake, alert, pleasant, lying flat, NAD HEENT - PERRL, EOMI, MMM Neck - flat JVP Chest - R chest wall with bandage/temporary pacer in place.
Looks C/D/I CVS - RRR soft S1 S2 no noted m/r/g Lungs - CTA anteriorly, laterally Abd - soft, large, NT/ND, + BS Groin - R groin site w/ small amt eccymoses, no hematoma, no bruit Ext - No LE edema b/l .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of all segments except the basal inferior, posterior, and lateral walls (the anterior septum is extensively scarred/fibrotic and akinetic); the apex is dyskinetic.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 year old female with CAD s/p MI, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM2 presents with chest pain, found to be in hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT, s/p successful DCCV in ED, now s/p EP study with VT ablation.
Rhythm: Pt presented in hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT treated with amio load and gtt and successfully cardioverted with 200J.
Etiology of VT is likely scar from MI in [**2120**] and not related to new ischemia as it was monomorphic and patient's clinical history does not support ischemia.
She was in normal sinus or sinus brady during her CCU stay.
B. CAD: Pt w/ h/o CAD s/p MI x 2 in [**2115**]/85.
Presented with CP which resolved once converted out of VT. No real signs/sxs of ischemic event - pt with slightly elevated CK and trop, but in setting of cardioversion.
She did not have CP while in the CCU  C. Pump: Pt w/ ECHO on [**2143-5-2**] that demonstrates EF of 30%.
# Hypertension:  Continued outpatient meds .
# Type 2 DM:  QID FS with RISS.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia CAD s/p MI Hypertension Anemia of chronic disease   Discharge Condition: Stable.
It is felt that this rhythm is likely due to old scar in your heart from heart attacks in the past.
