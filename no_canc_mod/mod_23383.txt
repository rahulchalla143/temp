Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 yo M h/o HIV, (CD4 350 in [**5-8**] and VL undetect), SCC s/p RLL lobectomy [**8-7**] complicated by bronchopleural fistula involving aspergillosis treated with [**Last Name (un) 72968**] window- open to air, as well as empyema and invasive aspergillosis treated with voriconazole referred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 8**] for hypotension and fever secondary to a recurrent pneumonia.
Upon admission, he was started empirically on vancomycin, meropenem and ciprofloxacin, as well as voriconazole given his history of aspergillus infection.
CT chest showed widespread reticular and ground-glass opacities as well as more dense consolidation in the left lung.
A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2147-9-4**] that showed no evidence of malignancy or fungus.
Given these findings and the patient's history of aspergillus infection, the Infectious Disease doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 2985**] the [**Name5 (PTitle) **] should remain on life long voriconazole.
There is a voriconazole level and B glucan titer pending at time of discharge that will be followed by his ID physicians at [**Hospital1 18**].
