Initial EKG showed evidence of an anterior STEMI (2-3 mm elevations in leads v1-v4 with ST upsloping in v5 and v6, and reciprocal ST depression of 2 mm in inferior leads).
Subsequent catherization was significant for a 100% proximal LAD occlusion, and the patient recieved a PTCA/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
During the procedure, the patient became hypotensive with a SBP in the 60s.
Patient's hypotension initially improved and she was subsequently transfered to CCU for close observation and management.
Patient again became hypotensive and uncomfortable, and tenderness in the RLQ was noted as [**Doctor Last Name **] as a pulseless/cool right lower extremity.
The Balloon Pump was pulled and a CT showed evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed.
Patients hypotension eventually resolved with medical management, she was taken off of pressors, and her Hematocrit stabilized.

High density fluid is seen in the parahepatic and parasplenic spaces.
There is a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage on the right side of the abdomen which extends into the right pararenal space and into the pelvis.
No free air or pathologic lymphadenopathy is seen within the abdomen.
Note is made of interposition of the large bowel between the liver and anterior abdominal wall.
A large right groin hematoma is present.
There is marked bladder wall thickening, likely secondary to the surrounding hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Large right sided retroperitoneal hemorrhage tracking into the pelvis.
High density fluid is seen in the parahepatic and parasplenic spaces represents intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
We elected to treat this lesion with PTCA/Stenting.
A 2.5 x 20 mm Maverick was used to dotter through the lesion, restoring flow.
Distal vasodilators were administered through an Ultrafuse X catheter.
Right heart catheterization demonstrated low filling pressures, and fluids with peripheral vasconstrictors were administered.
Final angiography demonstrated no dissection, no residual stenosis within the LAD, with minor ostial narrowing of the jailed D1.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  revealed one vessel coronary disease.
After the vessel was opened, it could be seen to give off two medium caliber diagonal branches and a large septal branch.
Acute myocardial infarction, managed by successful primary PCI of the LAD with a 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher DES, post-dilated with a 3.5 mm balloon (see PTCA comments).
Low filling pressures.
Acute myocardial infarction, managed by successful primary PCI of the LAD.
Conclusions: The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of all segments.
No left ventricular thrombus is identified, but the apex is mildly aneurysmal.
There is focal dyskinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Course by System:  71 year old female with no known coronary disease presented with Anterior STEMI s/p proximal LAD [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] complicated by retroperitoneal bleed.
ECG was significant for [**12-27**] ST elevations in v1-v4 with upsloping in v5-v6, and reciprocal ST depression of 2mm in inferior leads.
Patient was taken for catherization where a 100% proximal LAD occlusion was found with a normal right coronary artery, left marginal, and left circumflex.
Patient was transferred to CCU for close monitoring and observation, due to hypotension during catherization.
Patient's cardiac enzymes were initally elevated with a peak CPK of 4315, CPK/MB of 465, MB fraction of 14.0, and Troponin of 20.67.
Pump: At time of catherization, patient was thought to be in cardiogenic shock secondary to the large anterior MI.
However, with a PCWP of 4, patient was treated for hypovolemia with fluids.
Bedside Echo showed an EF of less than 20% and severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of all segments.
No left ventricular thrombus was identified, but the apex was mildly aneurysmal.
Rhythm:  no issues.
B.  Heme  Patient's hematocrit fell to 18.4 secondary to retroperitoneal bleed.
C. Endo Patient exhibited evidence of glucose intolerance post-cath with a Glucose of 480.
D. Prophx Patient was given Senna/Colace for constipation prophx.
call PCP or return to ED if suffering from severe chest pain, shortness or breath, persistent nausea consitent with angina, inability to tolerate food or liquid.
