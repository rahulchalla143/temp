HPI:    Ms. [**Known lastname 30674**] is a 87 year-old woman (likely right handed as she took ppen to write with right hand) with PMH significant for Alzheimer's Disease, HTN and macular degeneration who developed acute onset aphasia, right facial droop (though daughter who was present at bedside after eval.
noted she never appreciated facial droop), right sided neglect and possbily right sided weakness (no clear documentation of this in transfer records).
She presented to [**Hospital3 26615**] with these symptoms and was given tPA (bolus noted to be given at 10:52 PM).
She has Alzheimer's, with dementia noted to be mild to moderate.
Distant smoking history, but not believed to have smoked in over 40 years, per her daughter.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM Neck: Supple Pulmonary: scattered rhonci Cardiac: RRR, S1S2, no murmurs appreciated Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, +BS Extremities: warm, well perfused  Neurologic:  NIH Stroke Scale score was: 6 1a.
Extinction and Neglect: 1 (inconsistent with sensory and visual extinction right; sometimes accurate, sometimes not, possibly component of inattention, but when mistakes were made, always on the right)  Mental Status: Awake, alert, oriented to person only.
No right-left confusion.
No definitive objective evidence of spatial neglect, but when given the picture to describe, she only seemed to be looking at left side of picture when trying to say what she was seeing (her nonfluent aphasia prevented her from saying anything meaningful though).
No spontaneous speech, but is able to respond to questions.
Occasional paraphasic errors.
Difficult to perform visual field testing to confrontation due to her inattention, but on finger counting in different quadrants, there is a possible right lower quadrantanopia (she would consistently make mistakes in this quadrant, but not consistently in others, though she did an occasional mistake in other quadrants).
VII: There is possibly a slight right lower facial droop, but the NLF is symmetric.
Formal strength testing difficult due to inattention, but from what she was able to participate in, strength appeared full and symmetric bilaterally, including at deltoids, biceps, triceps, FE, IP and hams.
Sensory: No deficits to light touch or noxious (pinching).
Pinprick deferred given recent tPA use.
DTRs:   [**Name2 (NI) **] Tri [**Last Name (un) 1035**] Pat Ach L  3  3    3    2   0 R  3  3    3    2   0 No clonus.
Coordination: No intention tremor or dysmetria on finger-nose, FNF.

No other flow limiting stenosis or thrombosis noted.
CTP: left temporal hypoperfusion with prolonged MTT but no CBF/CBV mismatch.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac source of thromboembolism identified.
Occlusion of the anterior left M2 division with perfusion abnormalities suggesting acute infarct in the left anterior frontal lobe.
There is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation or mass effect.
Unclear area of increased perfusion and blood volume involving the medial left frontal lobe (ACA territory).
While these changes may be related to old infarct or neoplasm, there is no structural CT correlate and MRI should be performed for further assessment.
CXR [**2194-12-11**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
No evidence of vascular infarction, specifically in left MCA distribution.
Multiple small areas of slow diffusion, with associated ADC change, too small to accurately characterize; scattered throughout the right parietal and left temporal lobes, likely related to embolic infarction.
Severe changes related to the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year-old right-handed woman with history of Alzheimer's Disease, HTN, and macular degeneration who presented to OSH with left hemispheric syndrome (aphasia, right facial droop and questions of right hemiparesis).
Upon arrival, her NIHSS here was 6, with deficits due to her nonfluent aphasia/anomia and disorientation (though the disorientation may be her baseline).
She had no gross motor or sensory deficits on exam (although somewhat limited by inattention).
NCHCT showed no acute process; CTA showed L inferior division cut-off but with good collaterals with good distal filling.
There was decreased left temporal MTT on CTP but no mismatch.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] she remained nonfluent with dense anomia although was able to repeat, follow 2-step commands, and read short sentences.
She continued to improve, and the next morning [**Last Name (un) **] able to speak fluently in complete sentences although still with some anomia and paraphasic errors.
MRI on [**12-11**] showed no evidence of vascular infarction, specifically in left MCA distribution but multiple small areas of slow diffusion, with associated ADC change, too small to accurately characterize; scattered throughout the right parietal and left temporal lobes, likely related to embolic infarction as well as severe changes related to the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
EKG showed sinus rythym with atrial premature beats.
She was started on simvastatin 20mg QD for an elevated LDL and for secondary stroke prevention.
# Renal Cr was slightly increased at 1.7 on admission.
She was maintained on IVF @ 100cc/hr given elevated Cr and CTA.
We also recommend that she has a 30 day Holter monitor set up through her PCP to further evaluate our suspicion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Medications on Admission: -ASA 81 mg daily -Atenolol 50 mg daily -Hudrocerin cream to skin on arms and legs at bedtime -I-CAPS plus daily -Lisinopril 20 mg daily -Multivitamin -Namenda 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] -Ranitidine 150 mg daily -Vitamin D 1000 units daily -Loperamide 2 mg prn diarrhea  Discharge Medications: 1. atenolol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
9. loperamide 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day as needed for diarrhea.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Excella VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Multiple embolic infarcts in right parietal and left temporal lobes.
NEURO EXAM: difficulty with short-term memory, 5/5 strength throughout with v. mild R facial droop   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 30674**], You were seen in the hospital because of a left sided stroke.
While here we determined that the likely source of your stroke was from your heart, but did not find any clots on our imaging.
