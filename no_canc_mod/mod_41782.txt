CT Head [**8-27**]- FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, or shift of normally midline structures.
Ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent.
Vascular calcifications are seen in the carotid arteries.
Slightly dense foci in frontal lobes are related to volume ageraging of the adjacent bones.
Evaluation of posterior fossa and temporal lobes is limited due to artifacts.
IMPRESSION:  Limited evaluation of posterior fossa and temporal lobes.
Allowing for this, no acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
No hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.
No pleural effusions.
No pulmonary edema.
No other acute changes.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
There is a complete fracture of the right humeral shaft.
This is confirmed by the presence of the fracture on an outside chest radiograph from [**2145-7-18**].
The outside radiograph, as well as a second chest radiograph from an outside hospital, performed on [**2145-7-16**], additionally indicate luxation of the humeral head with respect to the acetabulum.
No safe evidence of cortical erosion in addition to the fracture or of spongiosal destruction is provided by the limited quality radiographs.
Brief Hospital Course: 55F with DM, bipolar d/o on lithium, s/p right arm surgery c/b MRSA infection here with AMS, [**Last Name (un) **], and hand ischemia.
# AMS: Appears to have been subacute in nature, more suggestive of acute on chronic lithium toxicity.
Per friend, it appears patient has been increasingly more confused and lethargic with decreasing PO intake and urinary/fecal losses which probably led to dehydration.
This increased dehydration potentially led to decreased clearance of lithium, explaining elevated level and worsening mental status.
Though osmolar gap is elevated at 17 and pt has hx of EtOH abuse, serum and urine tox are negative x 2.
Head CT also negative for organic causes.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely due to severe dehydration given history (diarrhea, poor PO intake) and presentation.
[**Last Name (un) **] likely contributing to decreased lithium clearance and AMS as above.
Psych was consulted and there remains some question as to the validity of her bipolar diagnosis.
Seen by Hand team in ER who felt there was no indication for urgent amputation or IV abx.
# MRSA infection of right shoulder: Pt reportedly completed IV abx course for this in late 6/[**2145**].
In [**10/2144**] had R humeral fracture which was repaired with pins and rods and was complicated by MRSA infection, which required removal of hardward and finished 3 week course of IV vanc (per pt, administered by a home nurse daily) in 6/[**2145**].
[**8-29**] radiograph of R shoulder shows subluxation of humeral head from acetabulum and at least 1 inch of missing bone; complete humeral shaft fracture that is most likely old.
Ortho felt like this was an old fracture and non-operable.
Pt had slight white count but does not meet other SIRS criteria.
Pt empirically treated with ceftriaxone.
# Diarrhea: Pt presented with fecal incontinence and diarrhea of unclear etiology.
She was recently on abx so at risk for Cdiff.
Abdominal exam currently unremarkable and no leukocytosis.
Diarrhea was not an issue while in house and may have been due to lithium.
# DM: Elevated blood glucose on presentation but no gap or ketones in urine to suggest DKA.
# HTN: Lisinopril and HCTZ were initially held in setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
# HL: Has a history of hyperlipidemia and statin was initially held with initial concerns for rhabdomyolysis.
# COPD: Rhonchorous on exam initially without wheeze.
