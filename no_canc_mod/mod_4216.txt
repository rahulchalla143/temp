Admission Date:  [**2101-9-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-9-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2029-12-9**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU MEDICINE  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Epistaxis and bright red blood per rectum  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old male with a history of Type 2 diabetes, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic renal insufficiency, who had had three days of epistaxis and bright red blood per rectum prior to admission.
During the past two days, he has experienced bruising and bleeding from his left and right forearms (from superficial abrasions) as well as dark maroon stools with flecks of bright red blood.
He had no abdominal pain, no nausea, vomiting.
He did have some loose stools for two days.
He denies hematemesis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He had no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no headache, no lightheadedness, no dyspnea on exertion, no orthopnea.
He was noted to be guaiac positive, with maroon-covered stools with flecks of bright red blood.
He had no melena.
A urinalysis was consistent with a urinary tract infection, and he was started on ampicillin in the Emergency Department.
On telemetry, he was noted to have frequent premature ventricular contractions and several four-beat runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (asymptomatic).
Type 2 diabetes 2.
Congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 20 to 25%, the cardiomyopathy is thought to be secondary to alcohol) 3.
Hypertension 6.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.7 8.
History of asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia 9.
History of a right groin hematoma with pseudoaneurysm status post cardiac catheterization in [**2101-6-23**] 11.
History of question prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction 12.
History of congestive heart failure exacerbation in [**2101-6-23**], at which time cardiac catheterization demonstrated high filling pressures, both left and right-sided, with a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 32, global hypokinesis, and moderate pulmonary hypertension  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.6, pulse 79, blood pressure 142/59, respiratory rate 16.
His oropharynx was without lesions or blood.
His neck had slight jugular venous distention to just below the angle of the jaw.
His cardiac examination was irregularly irregular, with a soft II/VI systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border that radiated to the axilla.
His lungs were clear to auscultation, without wheezes or crackles.
An electrocardiogram on admission showed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 82, frequent premature ventricular contractions, a leftward axis, QRS complexes at 144 (intraventricular conduction delay), .
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions in Leads V4 through V6, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in Leads I and AVL, which are old findings.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
At approximately 12:15 P.M. on [**9-2**], a Code was called, and the patient was found to be unresponsive, with initially polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, then torsades, then ventricular fibrillation, for which he was initially shocked at 200 joules, with recovery of a pulse transiently.
The patient also received epinephrine, amiodarone 300 mg then 150 mg, some potassium, intravenous fluids, and packed red blood cells as part of his resuscitation.
He was also noted to have had a six point hematocrit drop over the few hours prior to the Code.
Rhythm:  The patient had a ventricular fibrillation arrest as above.
Following his resuscitation, Electrophysiology service was consulted, who felt the patient warranted an [**Month (only) 3941**] as a survivor of a sudden cardiac death.
The plan was to do so once the patient was stabilized regarding his coagulopathy as well as his active gastrointestinal bleeding, and his pulmonary status.
During this interim, several runs of polymorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia without hemodynamic consequences nor symptoms were appreciated.
These runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were managed with amiodarone.
On [**9-4**], the patient had a 15 second run of pulseless ventricular tachycardia that was asymptomatic, as well as AIVR.
On the Coronary Care Unit service, the patient was maintained on amiodarone with no further episodes.
The defibrillator was implanted without complications, and interrogated subsequently.
Ischemia:  The patient had a cardiac catheterization in [**2101-6-23**] that demonstrated no flow-limiting disease.
The patient did have a troponin leak in the setting of electrical shocks during his ventricular fibrillation arrest.
c.  Pump:  The patient has non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%, with right ventricular and left ventricular systolic dysfunction per echocardiogram on [**2101-6-27**].
His catheterization demonstrated high filling pressures with an RA of 25, a PA systolic pressure of 50, with a wedge of 32, cardiac index of 2.8.
Pulmonary:  The patient was extubated on [**9-3**] without complications.
He subsequently developed some mild atelectasis that was treated with incentive spirometry.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of an INR equal to 20.
Given his cardiac issues were more active during this admission, there was no role for colonoscopy at the time of admission.
Infectious Disease:  The patient had a urinary tract infection on admission.
Ventricular fibrillation arrest status post [**Month (only) 3941**] placement 2.
Ambien 10 mg by mouth daily at bedtime as needed for insomnia  FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: 1.
Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection.
