Bilateral lower extremity AKA   Pertinent Results: [**2143-7-27**] 06:20PM   WBC-9.6 RBC-4.06* HGB-11.9* HCT-43.6 MCV-107* MCH-29.3 MCHC-27.3* RDW-17.2* [**2143-7-27**] 06:20PM   NEUTS-76.5* LYMPHS-15.8* MONOS-7.0 EOS-0.4 BASOS-0.3 [**2143-7-27**] 06:20PM   PLT COUNT-322 .
CXR: IMPRESSION: Persistent left basilar opacity likely reflective of effusion and atelectasis/pneumonia.
A small right pleural effusion.
Very small perihepatic fluid.
Small amount of free pelvic fluid, slightly increased since prior study of 8/[**2142**].
EKG: A-fib rate 115, nl axis, ST depressions in I, aVL and V4-V6 with TWI in V4-6 all from prior ECG.
Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis.
Severe global left ventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with global hypokinesis.
Depressed cardiac index.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA presents with respiratory failure secondary to ?pneumonia, complicated by heart failure and inability to wean off pressors or ventilator.
Patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due to pneumonia.
She subsequently developed a rising leukocyosis thought to be secondary to a line infection which was positive for enterococcus.
Finally, she was felt to have an element of cardiogenic shock given her echo showed severe aortic stenosis which per cardiology was not seconary to sclerosis of the valve but rather due to impaired filling in the setting of CAD and A. fib with RVR.
Tip of femoral line positive for enteroccus.
Patient's most recent echo which was performed during her hospital stay showed severe AS, but per cardiology, likely functional due to CAD and poor filling times in setting of tachycardia.
She underwent CVVH for volume removal.
HIT was diagnosed in [**12/2141**] and complicated by thrombus in bilateral lower extremities requiring amputations.
She was initially supertherapeutic, likely in setting of abx and coumadin interaction.
Her anemia was felt to be due to chronic disease, blood loss from blood draws and procedures, and guiaic positive stools.
Patient had NSTEMI in [**2142**].
