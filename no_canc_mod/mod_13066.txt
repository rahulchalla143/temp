History of Present Illness:  69M with DM, non-ischemic CM (EF 20-25%)s/p bivi/ICD placement in OR with hypotension/decreased urine output.
Past Medical History: CM (EF 20-25%) LBBB DM CRI Enlarged prostate  Social History: pt traveled from [**Country 11150**] for BiV-ICD placement.
diastolic murmur lungs: cta ant abd: soft, + distention, no suprapubic pain but diffuse upper epigastric pain on palpation (LUQ most signficant pain per pt) ext: warm/dry; +DP pulses   Pertinent Results: [**2109-6-13**] 10:00AM   GLUCOSE-124* UREA N-21* CREAT-1.2 SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-14 [**2109-6-13**] 10:00AM   CALCIUM-9.9 PHOSPHATE-3.5 MAGNESIUM-2.0 [**2109-6-13**] 10:00AM   WBC-7.7 RBC-5.36 HGB-13.5* HCT-42.5 MCV-79* MCH-25.1* MCHC-31.7 RDW-18.1* [**2109-6-13**] 10:00AM   PLT COUNT-280 [**2109-6-13**] 10:00AM   PT-11.7 PTT-20.4* INR(PT)-0.9  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1603**] is a 69M who is s/p operative BiV/ICD placement c/b hypotension and decreased urine output.
Initially the differential of the hypotension included sepsis, cardiogenic shock, tamponade, and dehydration.
However, 2 ECHO's did not show evidence of tamponade, and the swan catheter did not support cardiogenic shock.
The fever and elevated white count was consistent with sepsis, especially in the setting of presumed PNA and lung infiltration.
Zosyn and vanco were started for presumed nosocomial infection or infection d/t surgery.
Lasix IV was subsequently used when patient demonstrated fluid overload, improving the patient's breathing and clinical status.
Initially the plan was to wait until [**6-17**] for DCCV and load the patient with ibutilide and lidocaine and start him on amio on [**6-16**].
However, the patient was hypotensive and concern there was concern that was causing this hypotenion.
Pneumonia was considered as a cause of the fever and hypotension for several reasons, including complicated OR course of intubation and adjusting lung volumes as needed for placement of leads of pacemaker, developing a new productive cough, and having infiltrates on CXR.
However, in the CCU levo was changed to zosyn due to concern for nocosomial infection and to avoid prolongued QT interval, and this was continued until discharge.
In regards to his CHF and cardiac status, digoxin was held d/t dig toxicity (level 1.3), while ASA and zocor were continued.
As hypotension improved metoprolol was added, as well as losartan and coreg.
BP tolerated these medication additions well  Patient has underlying diabetes and was placed on an insulin sliding scale while in the hospital.
He also received SQ heparin and protonix as prophylactic measures for DVT and gastric bleed, respectively.
