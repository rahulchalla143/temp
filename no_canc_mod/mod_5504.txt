Admission Date:  [**2125-10-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-11-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-1-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Demerol / Codeine  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1136**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension/hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old woman with diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, history of C. diff, and vertebral osteomyelitis who presented with hypotension and hypoxia.
She had been at rehab when she had an episode of hypotension and hypoxia (low 80's).
A CTA of the chest was negative for PE, but had bilateral pleural effusions.
She was on vancomycin and flagyl for osteomyelitis and C. diff.
Originally, she was transferred to the CCU out of concern for cardiogenic shock.
An ultrasound revealed cirrhotic liver.
She is currently on vanc/zosyn and flagyl for history of C. diff.
Patient was having episodes of constipation.
No complaints of pain, shortness of breath, or nausea.

Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: [**2125-10-29**] WBC 16.6 / hct 33.3 / Plt 491 Na 144 / K 3.9 / Cl 109 / CO2 22 / BUN 26 / Cr 1.3 / BG 220 BNP [**Numeric Identifier 40151**]  DISCHARGE LABS: [**2125-11-4**] WBC 10.9 / Hct 27.1 / Plt 540 Na 143 / K 3.3 / Cl 111 / CO2 26 / BUN 17 / Cr 1.2 / BG 103  MICROBIOLOGY: [**2125-10-29**] Blood Cx negative [**2125-10-29**] Urine Cx yeast [**2125-10-30**] Urine Cx yeast [**2125-10-30**] Peritoneal Fluid Culture - negative [**2125-10-31**] Urine Cx yeast  STUDIES: ECHO ([**2125-10-29**])- The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal septum, anterior and inferior walls.
There is a small apical left ventricular aneurysm with apical akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution).
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
[**2125-10-29**] Abdominal U/S- IMPRESSION: Shrunken nodular liver with diffuse ascites consistent with the provided history of cirrhosis.
A small echogenic nodule abutting the capsule is visualized, incompletely characterized on this study.
Postsurgical changes with fluid collections related to the surgical hardware in the dorsal soft tissues, which may be postoperative seromas.
Underlying infection would be difficult to entirely exclude.
Fluid collection in the left aspect of the retroperitoneum also may be postsurgical in nature, although underlying infection in this location would also be difficult to exclude.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Postcontrast MRI of the lumbar spine would probably not be helpful given the degree of susceptibility artifact in the region of the surgical hardware.
[**2125-11-1**] CXR - Left lower lobe sizable atelectasis and pleural effusion.
No acute pulmonary infiltrates.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior wall and the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls, and the apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of mitral regurgitation is also increased.
Hypoxia:  Patient came in with drastically increased oxygen requirement.
She was admitted to the CCU and then the MICU with concerns for cardiogenic shock and sepsis.
She was found to have a left sided pleural effusion on chest x-ray and was on 2L NC (satting 97% on discharge).
She denied any symptoms of shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.
Questionable sepsis: Given that patient had elevated lactate and WBC, sepsis was a possibility.
There were no acute episodes of hypoxia or hypotension.
She remained afebrile and her WBC trended down (was 10.9 on discharge- down from 16.6 on admission).
Concern for sepsis arose given elevated lactate and hypotension.
Patient [**Name (NI) **] was most likely secondary to ischemic ATN, as was thought to be the case during previous admission.
She demonstrated signs of fluid overload on exam (3+ LLE pitting edema, elevated JVP) but labs represented more of a pre-renal etiology (urine sodium < 10, hypernatremia, elevated creatinine).
We considered giving her albumin or blood but were concerned of causing fluid overload in her lungs.
Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure- Patient had ECHO on admission given concern for cardiogenic shock.
During previous admission, ECHO showed EF of 35-40% with new anterior and anteroseptal left ventricular systolic dysfunction with subtle inferior wall hypokinesis.
However, it showed new apical dysfunction.
Patient reported being very anxious and upset during hypoxic and hypotensive episode.
She reports the symptoms occuring shortly after this anxious episode.
Given new apical akinesis and correlation with anxiety, there is a possibility that this is stress-induced cardiomyopathy.
Repeat ECHO on [**11-5**] revealed "moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior wall and the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls, and the apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of mitral regurgitation is also increased."
Cirrhosis- An ultrasound on [**10-29**] revealed cirrhotic liver with no portal vein thrombosis.
Patient has history of steatohepatitis.
Blood, urine, peritoneal cultures did not show any SBP or signs of active infection.
Nutrition- Patient had poor PO intake on admission.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, controlled but with complications - Continued on NPH and sliding scale with good control of her sugars.
Guaiac positive stools- Patient found to have guaiac positive stools on admission.
No active signs of bleeding (brown stool).
Iron deficiency anemia - Chronic.
Denied any fatigue or dizziness.
Bowel regimen- senna and docusate.
