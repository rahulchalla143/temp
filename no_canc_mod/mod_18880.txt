Admission Date:  [**2167-2-9**]       Discharge Date: [**2167-2-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2100-12-17**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old gentleman with a history of end-stage liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites who presented to the Emergency Room after two days of lower extremity weakness and confusion.
The patient was recently hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2167-1-1**] through [**2167-1-2**] for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and workup of a lung mass.
He sights problems with ongoing back pain and new onset leg weakness.
End-stage liver disease secondary to alcohol-induced cirrhosis diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis at the age of 37 in [**2166-5-25**].
He had an episode of hepatic encephalopathy, history of ascites and scrotal edema.
Liver mass on CT noticed in [**2166-11-24**] with new masses on MRI.
History of colonic polyps with last colonoscopy in [**2166-11-24**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for liver disease.
General:  He is a chronically ill appearing male in no acute distress.
The oropharynx was clear with positive scleral icterus.
Neck:  No JVD.
Cardiovascular: Normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Protuberant with central midline scar and tympanitic.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurologic:  No asterixis.
Chest x-ray showed question of a retrocardiac density, spiculated nodular opacification in the left upper lobe and a flattened diaphragms consistent with COPD.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 66-year-old gentleman with end-stage liver disease secondary to alcoholic-induced cirrhosis and history of hepatic encephalopathy and ascites who presented initially with lower extremity weakness, confusion, and hypernatremia.
Initially, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring with severe hypernatremia.
END-STAGE LIVER DISEASE:  Secondary to alcoholic hepatitis for which he has had disease for about 30 years.
The patient had an ultrasound of his right upper quadrant eventually to assess for ascites and his flow.
Ultrasound did have evidence of perihepatic ascites and in light of the patient's lethargy and confusion, plans were made for a diagnostic paracentesis.
This was done on [**2167-2-10**] without complications and laboratories returned later that evening with a white count in the fluid of greater than 20,000, red blood cells 4,800, with 78% polys.
He had an SAAG of 1.8 and this was consistent with portal hypertension with superimposed infection.
The patient was groaning to pain and touch to palpation of his abdomen but otherwise poorly responsive at that time.
He was with an elevated lactate and concern for sepsis.
Eventually, the patient was intubated by Anesthesia for airway protection and for increasing acidemia and hypoxia.
Surgery evaluation was also called at the time to rule out perforation.
The patient also had an arterial line placed in his left radial artery for better blood pressure monitoring.
His lactate remained elevated secondary to his sepsis.
Eventually, he went down for a CT of his abdomen with gastrografin which revealed dilated loops of colon and small bowel with colonic wall thickening and no evidence of microperforation.
We continued to follow his examinations via KUBs and his dilated loops of bowel seemed to resolve and no evidence of free air throughout his stay.
Secondary to his end-stage liver disease and criticalness of his illness, the patient was not considered a liver transplant candidate and was given Lactulose for history of hepatic encephalopathy and with continued Lactulose mental status did continue to improve but did continue to wax and wane even upon transfer to the floor when his orientation waxed and waned.
His liver disease remained stable even on transfer to the floor on the Lactulose.
His abdomen had decreased with diuresis, however, with a bump in creatinine the diuretics were held and the patient's abdominal girth remained stable, however, with a drop in blood pressures.
The patient continued to receive fluid boluses once he was titrated off pressors and with increasing hydration, his abdominal girth continued to increase and with IV fluid replacement or free water replacement did not remain intravascular.
He continued to have episodes of hypotension once he was weaned off the pressors and transferred to the floor.
His pressures remained in the 80s/60s range and at that blood pressure the patient continued to talk and mentate and continued to have reasonable urine output.
No thoughts of recurrence of sepsis while on the floor.
His white count remained stable and his fever curve remained afebrile throughout his course on the floor.
Also of note was increasing fluid boluses for blood pressure support and hyperalbuminemia from his chronic illness and recent exacerbation of his illness.
His altered mental status was most likely attributed to his toxic metabolic state from sepsis versus hepatic encephalopathy.
This will continue to be followed and continue to use Lactulose, titrating to at least four bowel movements a day to help with his hepatic encephalopathy.
He remained stable, oxygenating with his nasal cannula; however, at the time of this dictation did have a chest x-ray showing bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and possible bilateral pleural effusions which is consistent with his cirrhotic hyperalbuminemic state.
The patient does have the known left upper lobe lung mass which is concerning with a cancer; however, although was scheduled to have a CT-guided endobronchial biopsy done, the patient's change in medical condition prevented completion of that test.
This workup will be deferred for now as the patient will likely be unable to tolerate treatment for the mass at this time.
ASTHMA:  The patient's respiratory wheezes were stable and clinical asthma was stable in-house while on his Combivent and Fluticasone regimen.
However, he did have some lability here, likely secondary to his end-stage liver disease but was stable and only continued on sliding scale insulin regimen.
ANEMIA/THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  The patient did have a negative workup for hemolysis but possibly a low-grade DIC with rising INR and PTT and dropping fibrinogen in light of initial sepsis; however, this has been stabilized and his thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to his chronic liver disease and anemia likely secondary to malnutrition.
ELECTROLYTES:  The patient initially came in hyponatremic and this resolved with normal saline hydration and eventually corrected to hypernatremia in light of recent dehydration, especially intravascularly.
His rising chloride and low bicarbonate were also consistent with dehydration and contractions and continued to try to replete free water as above.
PERITONITIS:  Initially with abdominal distention and elevated white count on ascites fluid concern for microperforation versus peritonitis, especially with dilated loops of bowel.
The patient had C. difficile times three which remained negative and were stable.
CODE:  The patient's family was updated daily with progress and prognosis in terms of the patient's condition.
Eventually, at the time of discharge from the ICU after a family meeting on [**2167-2-18**], it was decided that the patient should be DNR/DNI with no pressors and no ICU stays.
However, continue supportive care in terms of fluid boluses and family is still to be updated daily on any changes and on progress and will continue to treat infection and hypotension as previously.
NUTRITION:  The patient's PPN was discontinued once his small bowel dilatation seemed resolved and he was started on tube feeds through his NG tube to be titrated up slowly.
The patient's albumin was most recently 2.1, consistent with his poor nutrition and chronic disease.
