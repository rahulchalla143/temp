At an outside hospital, she was ruled out for a cerebrovascular accident.
She underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2177-12-8**], at [**Hospital1 190**], which revealed an ejection fraction of 70 percent, an 85 percent left anterior descending coronary artery lesion, a 60 percent right coronary artery lesion and aortic valve area of 0.65 centimeter squared and a mean gradient of 29 mmHg.
She is now admitted for elective aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of cerebrovascular accident.
History of peripheral vascular disease.
Status post right lower extremity bypass.
ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to Penicillin.
She gets hives and gets anxiety from Demerol.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is an elderly white female in no apparent distress.
No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular examination is regular rate and rhythm, with IV/VI systolic ejection murmur, which radiated to the carotids.

They said she had an old right parietal occipital infarct of unclear etiology and her left internal carotid artery stenosis was not related to that.
She did have carotid duplex, which showed less than 40 percent right internal carotid artery stenosis and a 60 to 69 percent left internal carotid artery stenosis.
She was cleared by neurology and on [**2177-12-27**], she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, reversed saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and diagonal with an aortic root enlargement and an aortic valve replacement with a 19 millimeter [**Last Name (un) 3843**]- [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue valve.
