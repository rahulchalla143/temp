Admission Date:  [**2126-8-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-9-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-7-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress, cardiac arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with drug-eluting stent   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 79692**] is a 73yo woman with h/o DM2, CHF, and HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 **]w/ respiratory distress with subsequent asystolic cardiac arrest.
Per EMS records, she was having difficulty breathing this morning at midnight, about 1 hour after she had gone to bed.
Per daughter, she has had a dry cough and has had worsening DOE.
On transport, the patient became unresponsive in the ambulance 2 min prior to arrival to the OSH.
CPR was initiated and atropine/epi were administered with return of pulse (her total arrest time was 1-2 min according to her daughter).
A CXR was read as bilateral fluffy infiltrates c/w volume overload vs ARDS.
She became hypotensive to SBP of 70's and was started on a dopamine gtt.
She was given atropine 0.5mg for HR "in the 50's" and amiodarone was stopped because of bradycardia.
She had an episode of hyperkalemia that was treated with calcium and dextrose.
Past Medical History: Chronic systolic heart failure (LVEF of 40% from [**6-20**] echo) DM (non-compliant w/ meds) HTN recent D&C 3 weeks ago for uterine polyp (not malignant) recent hospitalization for SOB (in [**State 4260**]), intubation not required .
No tobacco, minimal alcohol.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Ill-defined bilateral perihilar consolidations, differential includes ARDS and multifocal pneumonia.
Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema is possible, although the cardiac silhouette is not particularly enlarged, and clinical history is not entirely consistent with pulmonary edema.
8-mm right lower lobe nodule is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15410**], most probably representing a granuloma.
[**2126-6-27**] EKG 00:42 NSR with RBBB and TWI in inferior leads.
02:58 Regular WCT at 154 with LBBB pattern, BP 110/40 03:05 Sinus brady at 56 with TWI in inferior leads and deep TWI in V1-V6, ?
05:03 NSR with LAD and LBBB.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal and apical hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD revealed a mid 80% lesion after the second marginal.
The Lcx and RCA and no angiographically apparent stenoses.
Resting Hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 15 mmHg and a PCWP of 19.
PASP was mildly elevated at 40 mmHg.
Excellent result with normal flow and no residual stenosis.
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction 3.
[**2126-8-28**] CXR Still moderate pulmonary edema has markedly improved.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left side.
There is overall improvement in the left retrocardiac opacity consistent with partial resolution of atelectasis.
The right lower lobe opacity is still present suggesting unresolved atelectasis as well.
Minimal vascular engorgement is present in the perihilar area but no evidence of frank pulmonary edema is seen.
[**2126-8-27**] Right groin CATHETER TIP-IV WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2126-8-30**]): No significant growth.
[**2126-8-28**] R IJ CATHETER TIP-IV WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2126-9-2**]): No significant growth.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 73 yo woman with h/o DM, systolic CHF with EF 40%, and HTN who presented with respiratory distress requiring intubation complicated by asystolic cardiac arrest and s/p cath with DES to LAD.
# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Recent admission for CHF exacerbation.
At this admission, echo showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal and apical hypokinesis; LVEF 40%.
Lung exam and lower extremity peripheral edema was consistent with fluid overload, which improved with diuresis.
# CAD: CPK were elevated to 381 with normal CPK; trop was mildly elevated to 0.05.
Cardiac cath showed a small LAD with 80% occlusion, and a drug-eluting stent was placed.
# Abdominal pain: Pt has a history of longstanding but stable LLQ pain which had been worked up in past at OSH.
She had no acute abdomen on exam.
Her LFTs were notable only for mild transaminitis, ALT > AST which may be [**3-16**] to her acute cardiac event and decreased forward flow.
She was noted to have guiac positive stools during this admission but her HCT was stable.
She was restarted on her home dose iron and received colace for constipation prophylaxis, of note patient does not usually take colace.
She subsequently developed diarrhea with an elevated WBC and low-grade temp to 99.7 which was in the setting of recent antibiotics but her stool was negative for C. diff.
She was worked up for an infectious pulmonary process as she reportedly had thick yellow sputum prior to admission and still had a lingering cough during hospital course.
The increased WBC was thought to be secondary to demarginalization vs. iatrogenic (she is enrolled in study in which she might be given hydrocortisone; note that WBC was 21 at [**Location (un) **]).
She was restarted on a beta blocker and an ACE I which were uptitrated as tolerated for cardioprotection.
# Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure with a Cr of 1.5.
The renal failure was likely secondary to decreased forward flow in the setting of her cardiac arrest.
# Wide Complex Tachycardia: The EKG at the OSH showed wide complex tachycardia which was thought to be [**3-16**] to dopamine.
At [**Hospital1 18**], amiodarone was stopped due to bradycardia.
Of note, the patient has LBBB at baseline so she could have had sinus tachycardia with aberrance that was misinterpreted as Vtach.
Metformin was held in the setting of her ARF and was not restarted prior to discharge.
