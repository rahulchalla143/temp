Admission Date:  [**2137-12-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2137-12-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-9-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of hepatitis B cirrhosis who presents with bright red blood per rectum.
The patient was in his usual state of health except for mild fatigue for the past two days until the night before admission when he noted some bright red blood dripping after a bowel movement.
He went to bed and woke up on the morning of admission at approximately 1:30 a.m., went to the bathroom and had a large amount of bright red blood per rectum and associated with lightheadedness.
He reports no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, melena, shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations.
In the Emergency Department, his blood pressure was 63/48, pulse 82, 16 respirations, 98% on room air but no temperature recorded.
Two large boar peripheral IVs were obtained.
Of note, the patient had an EGD at [**Hospital 1774**] Hospital last week which showed grade I-II esophageal varices.
Cirrhosis with a history of esophageal variceal bleed for which he gets a 7 liter paracentesis therapeutic every week.
Anemia with a baseline hematocrit of 30%.
Chronic renal insufficiency for which he started hemodialysis on [**2137-12-13**].
Peptic ulcer disease with a history of an upper GI bleed for which in the [**2114**] he received a blood transfusion.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
[**Name (NI) **] has no history of tobacco or alcohol.
The sclerae had slight icterus.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Distended and large with a large amount of ascites but not tense and positive bowel sounds, no tenderness to palpation.
There are no initial radiologic studies.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  Given the bright red blood per rectum associated with straining of bowel movements, it was most likely bleeding from obvious lower hemorrhoids, although may represent rectal variceal bleeding as well.
It is unlikely that it is from esophageal variceal bleeding, although to rule out that possibility the patient had an EGD which demonstrated stigmata of old varices with no active bleeding.
The patient also did have a colonoscopy during his hospital course which demonstrated two 5 mm polyps, one in the ascending colon and one in the sigmoid with no active bleeding.
There were some internal hemorrhoids which were referred to later by the Hepatology fellow as rectal varices and some external hemorrhoids, both with stigmata of active bleeding.
Given the bleeding from the internal hemorrhoids, the patient was discontinued on the Octreotide and restarted on Nadolol, continued on an IV proton pump inhibitor and changed to p.o.
For the purposes of ultimate treatment of the rectal varices and hemorrhoids, the Hepatology Service recommended no current intervention as far as hemorrhoidectomy is concerned and that banding would probably just cause infection as the hemorrhoids sloughed off and that the definitive treatment would come via liver transplantation or portal systemic shunting.
No diagnostic tests were done off this since it was done for therapeutic reasons and not for a diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Overall, the patient remained stable throughout his hospital course and in all he had approximately four episodes of bright red blood per rectum while in the hospital, the last being greater than 36 hours prior to his discharge from the hospital and he continued to have some regular bowel movements without any blood.
The patient was placed on stool softeners and an attempt to decrease the amount of straining that he would have to do which could likely cause further bleeding and for definitive management.
The patient was instructed to return to the ED if any further bleeding happens for the potential of more definitive management of the hemorrhoids/rectal varices.
