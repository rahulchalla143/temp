Admission Date:  [**2125-5-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2125-5-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2084-3-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from outside medical hospital with refractory anion gap acidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 41-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension (untreated) and asthma with seasonal allergies, who presented to an outside hospital on [**5-18**] with a five day history of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and progressive weakness and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] with refractory anion gap acidosis and ketoacidosis.
Patient was reported in his usual state of health until approximately five days prior to admission, when he reports acute onset nausea followed by vomiting and watery diarrhea.
The patient reports occasional episodes of vomiting and diarrhea initially, however, after two days, the frequency and severity progressively worsened to approximately 10-30 episodes per day of bilious nonbloody vomiting, and 10-30 episodes per day of brown-watery diarrhea with little to no oral intake for approximately three days.
During this time, the patient reports progressive generalized weakness (proximal greater than distal muscle groups) with significant fatigue and lightheadedness.
He also reports unsteadiness secondary to generalized weakness with a reported fall with subsequent trauma to his right arm prior to admission.
In the outside hospital Emergency Department, patient was found afebrile and hemodynamically stable with positive serum and urine ketones (ABG 7.21/23/86/95% on room air), anion gap 34, normal serum glucose, and negative serum toxin screen except for salicylates.
Of note, the patient recalls two prior episodes when he developed similar prodrome of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and weakness.
The first of these episodes occurred in his early 20's, when he reports significant nausea and vomiting with progressive weakness.
A family friend, who is a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4351**] treated the patient with antiemetics and his symptoms resolved without need for official medical attention.
The symptoms were significant enough to prompt the patient to seek medical attention at an outside hospital Emergency Department.
Patient was [**Name10 (NameIs) 4351**] treated with IV hydration that corrected his anion gap acidosis and discharged to home from the Emergency Department.
A subsequent Gastroenterology workup for his elevated liver function tests included a right upper quadrant ultrasound, as well as blood work evaluating possible infectious, toxic, or immunologic causes.
Per the patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] workup was essentially negative, and the primary care physician was recommended to followup with a repeat CK at a later date for evaluation for possible primary muscular abnormality.
Seasonal allergies.
Hypertension (untreated).
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No known history of diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, malignancies, or muscle abnormalities.
In general, the patient is a thin middle age male in mild distress appearing diaphoretic and tachypneic.
Anicteric sclerae.
Moist mucous membranes, with no oral lesions.
Neck exam:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
No jugular venous distention was appreciated.
Pulmonary examination:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Cardiovascular exam: Tachycardic, regular, normal S1, S2 with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdominal exam:  Soft, normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, and nondistended with no masses appreciated.
Extremities:  Warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses, no rashes.
Neurological examination:  Alert, awake, oriented x3, appropriate, cranial nerves II through XII intact, diffusely weak 4+/5 motor strength throughout with no focal signs of weakness, reflexes 2+ patellar, 2+ brachial symmetric bilaterally.
Initial blood work at [**Hospital1 69**]: Chem-7 with a sodium of 134, potassium 6.9, chloride 96, bicarb 10, BUN 19, creatinine 1.2, and glucose of 105 (notable for a gross hemolysis).
The patient received aggressive hydration, initially with D5 half normal saline (x3 liters), eventually changed to lactated ringers with the addition of bicarbonate drip (2 liters with 3 amps of sodium bicarb) for persistent metabolic acidosis.
Despite patient's persistent laboratory abnormalities, the patient demonstrated significant clinical improvement with no further episodes of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Patient's strength also progressively improved with downtrending heart rate as well as respiratory rate.
Serial laboratories were notable for a persistent anion gap acidosis, mild transaminitis, AST greater than ALT, uptrending creatinine kinase to greater than 4,000, macrocytosis, and persistent large blood acetone.
On transfer to the Medical floor, the patient continued to complain of diffuse weakness with nonfocal neurologic examination.
Despite diuresis, the patient maintained adequate oral hydration without orthostasis.
Despite clinical improvement, the patient continued to have large serum acetone with ketonuria.
A Neurology consult was obtained on [**5-22**] for evaluation of potential metabolic myopathy.
The Neurology evaluation revealed an essentially negative neurologic examination except for mildly decreased muscle strength ([**4-21**]) in the patient's deltoids bilaterally.
Based on their evaluation, Neurology suggested a primary myopathy as the source of the patient's metabolic derangements and proximal muscle weakness.
The differential diagnosis for myopathy includes metabolic causes such as lipid metabolism, glycolytic and/or glyconeolytic causes, and/or mitochondrial defects, post-viral causes such as EBV, HSV, HIV, etc, or inflammatory myopathy such as polymyositis, or vasculitis.
The Neurology service recommended obtaining EMG to differentiate between inflammatory or noninflammatory myopathy as well as a metabolic workup including serum pyruvate, ammonia, and carnitine.
The blood work was sent, however, the EMG was not obtained secondary to scheduling.
Although it was felt that the elevated CK and LFT abnormalities were most likely secondary to primary muscle source, hepatitis serologies including hepatitis A, B, C, as well as EBV and CMV serologies were obtained.
The patient was instructed to return to the Emergency Department incase of recurrent nausea, vomiting, and intolerance of oral intake, generalized weakness, or orthostatic symptoms.
Metabolic abnormalities, with anion gap acidosis, elevated CK, and transaminitis of unclear etiology undergoing workup for possible metabolic myopathy.
