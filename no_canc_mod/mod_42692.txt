Admission Date:  [**2132-4-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-4-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Macrodantin / Amiodarone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o CAD, A fib, HTN, CHF s/p recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 103736**] involving MICU stay for hypoxia attributed to underlying interstitial lung disease with overlying pulmonary edema now admitted for hypoxia.
Pt currently at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab - reportedly received ativan 1mg and ambien for agitation and became more confused than at baseline and fell.
During previous admission [**Date range (1) 103736**] pt was diagnosed with allergic rash thought [**2-22**] requip as well as hypoxia thought [**2-22**] underlying interstitial lung disease with overlying pulm edema.
CT scan chest showed diffuse interstitial changes c/w pneumonitis as well.
In the ED CXR was c/w worsening pulm edema vs. infection.
Afib with pacemaker 2 yrs ago for tachy-brady syndrome 3.
HTN 4.
Anemia 6.
Chronic low back pain from "ruptured disc" 30 yrs ago 11.
Hiatal hernia 13.
RLS: s/p allergic reaction to Requip.
s/p last admission she has been at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab  Family History: mother died of CVA   Physical Exam: Vital signs: 95.8, 92, 158/89, 36, 94% on CPAP+PS 10/5, TV 537, FIO2 100.
HEENT: unable to examine due to CPAP mask.
Chest: coarse breath sounds throughout with crackles bilaterally.
No gross hemorrhage or mass effect identified .
CXR [**2132-4-8**]: Marked progression of the interstitial opacities and peripheral alveolar opacities in both lungs, worrisome for worsening of pulmonary edema.
Diffuse infection is another possibility if the patient has fever.
Worsening of the underlying interstitial lung disease such as AIP can also manifest this appearance, so as pulmonary hemorrhage if the patient has hemoptysis.
Enlarged right hilar contour, which can represent hilar lymphadenopathy in addition to known enlarged pulmonary artery.
Echo [**2132-3-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The interatrial septum is mildly aneurysmal.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ECG [**2132-4-8**]: AFib at 95, RBBB (old), demand atrial pacing.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o interstitial lung disease, CHF admitted with severe hypoxia: .
# Hypoxia: this presentation similar to previous admission which was felt to be a combination of underlying interstitial lung disease with overlying pulmonary edema.
She was initially treated with IV solumedrol given poor clinical picture on presentation but then switched to PO steroids given unclear of utility.
She was initially given cefepime and vanc for broad coverage given severe hypoxia but once diuresed she improved so drastically so changed coverage to levoflox.
Oxygenation and overall respiratory status continued to worsen and this was felt possibly secondary to her underlying interstitial lung disease (which was never very well understood).
