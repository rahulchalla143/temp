According to the rehab note, patient was getting chest therapy at nursing home, and during this he became acutely short of breath.
In the ED, he continued to be tachypneic but was unable to answer further history questions.
His ABG showed respiratory acidosis so he was intubated.
After intubation, he became hypotensive with pressures nadiring at 67/37.
He was started on norepinephrine for this hypotension and right IJ CVL was placed.
Because of concern for sepsis, he underwent CT C/A/P which showed left lower lobe collapse and no acute intra-abdominal process.

Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, with necrotic consolidation of the left lower lobe, and fluid versus soft tissue attenuation of the left lower lobe bronchus.
This may represent mucus plugging, or an obstructive lesion.
There is marked mediastinal lymph node enlargement in all visualized stations.
Small bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions.
Multiple abdominal drains, with no residual fluid collection or acute intra-abdominal pathology noted.
There continues to be bilateral patchy airspace opacities with a more confluent opacity at the left base, which may reflect multifocal pneumonia.
An element of superimposed edema cannot be entirely excluded as the pulmonary vasculature appears somewhat indistinct.
There is a layering left effusion and a smaller right effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo M with recent ex lap with repair of bile leak/enterotomy and placement of PTCB and PEG tube who presented from rehab with hypercarbic respiratory failure and altered mental status.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure/septic shock: CT compatible with necrotizing pneumonia, enterobacter growing from the sputum as well as MRSA.
Due to witnessed aspiration event at rehab.
Low compliance/high resistance on the vent.
# Recent bile leak s/p surgery: PTBD (percutaneous biliary [**Month/Year (2) 19843**] and JP [**Month/Year (2) 19843**] also in place) replaced by IR [**2146-10-15**] with improvement in alkaline phosphotase today.
Surgery team continued to follow with no additional recommendations.
