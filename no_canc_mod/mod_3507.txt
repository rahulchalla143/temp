The patient now returns for right lower extremity bypass.
He denies rest pain or claudication.
ALLERGIES:  Biaxin and Penicillin which causes nausea and vomiting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Illnesses include coronary artery disease, status post angioplasty with stent placement to the left circumflex in [**2172-3-7**].
The ejection fraction at that time was 63% with mild aortic stenosis.
The patient has a history of congestive heart failure.
The patient is a Type 1 diabetic with triopathy.
He has a history of hypertension, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis since [**2161**] to [**2167**], when he underwent a cadaver renal transplant, a history of pneumonia in [**2167-3-8**], cervical stenosis, a history of pelvic fracture and left hand fracture secondary to fall in [**2168**], history of right navicular bone fracture in [**2169-7-6**], pyelonephritis in [**2170-1-5**] treated, bilateral ankle fractures in [**2170-12-6**], peripheral vascular disease status post common iliac stent with balloon angioplasty to the right common iliac artery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital [**Hospital1 **] was consulted for diabetic management.
He was preopped by Cardiology and was known to have asymptomatic aortic stenosis with a mid cavity gradient of 36 mm.
Postoperatively cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms.
