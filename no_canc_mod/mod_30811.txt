Right Femoral Line   History of Present Illness: 54F w/HTN, CAD s/p CABG, MV repair, AVR on coumadin, hemolytic anemia [**12-31**] valve s/p mechanical fall with trauma to leg and chest in setting of elevated INR 6.7 (checked at PCPs office) admitted 2 days after fall with persistent L knee pain and hematoma on head/L chest wall.
On admission, patient's INR had fallen to 2.7; however, given fall in setting of elevated INR, but had a trauma evaluation including CT head, spine, Abd/pelvis and LLE without evidence of bleed or fracture.
Of note, patient has a h/o HTN; on admission was noted to have low BPs (usual SBP 140-160s, on admission SBP 100), but was asymptomatic (no LH/dizziness/CP/SOB/fatigue).

Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2201-2-14**]: 1:15pm Hct 34.6 [**2201-2-15**]: 07:00am Hct 31.9, INR 2.9, PTT 42.1 [**2201-2-15**]: 6:00pm Hct 30.0 * Chemistries: GLUCOSE-94 UREA N-21* CREAT-1.4* SODIUM-134 POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-99 TOTAL CO2-25 ANION GAP-14 * Radiologic Studies- CT left knee: No evidence of hemarthrosis or fracture of the left knee.
* CT head: No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
* C-Spine: 1) No fracture or malalignment 2) Multilevel degenerative changes.
* CT abd/Pelvis: No evidence of acute traumatic injury on limited noncontrast evaluation.
* Femur/Tib Fib Plain Films: Negative for fracture * CXR PA/LAT [**2-17**]: Bilateral plate-like atelectasis at the lung bases, left greater than right.
Underlying pneumonia within atelectatic lung cannot be excluded.
* CXR PA/LAT [**2-19**]: No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.
The on previous examination, ([**2-17**]) identified bilateral plate atelectasis have resolved completely.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] MR.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion   Brief Hospital Course: 54 y/o female with CAD, mechanical AVR, MVannuloplasty, on coumadin, who was admitted for pain control s/p fall with hospital course c/b hypotension and hematocrit drop of unclear etiology requiring [**Name (NI) 153**] overnight observation.
Subsequently remained hemodynamically stable.
She was otherwise asymptomatic (no lightheadedness, dizziness, dyspnea or chest pain).
However, of concern is that she normally has poorly controlled hypertension and she remained with low systolic BP's off all anti-hypertensives.
Aggressive work up was performed to rule out bleed given her recent fall.
CT scan of the thigh and pelvis were performed which showed no evidence of bleed.
CT head on admission was also negative for bleed.
It was suspected that her hypotension might be secondary to opiate analgesics she recieved on admission, therefore opioid analgesics were discontinued.
Patient awake/alert but diaphoretic and given 250cc NS bolus.
Had an EKG which showed a new RBBB.
Right femoral line placed and given 2L NS but SBP remained in the 80s with good UOP (1000cc after foley placed).
Given her history of significant cardiac disease and new RBBB, cardiology was consulted and a stat bedside echo was performed to r/o cardiogenic shock, which was unchanged from prior echo.
Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hemodynamic monitoring.
Etiology of hematocrit drop was unclear as on admission patient had full work up which was negative for hematoma.
(Of note, she developed T 103 mid-transfusion; blood was sent for transfusion reaction.
She had a [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test to r/o adrenal insufficiency as cause for her hypotension, which was normal.
Pt did have a mild temperature and sepsis was entertained as possible etiology of hypotension.
CXR showed vague RLL infiltrate, and she was started on empiric vancomycin/levofloxacin pending culture data.
She remained stable overnight, with stable blood pressure and hematocrit and was transferred back to the medicine service.
She subsequently remained afebrile and HD stable, with cultures negative, suggesting against infectious etiology of her hypotension.
In addition, repeat CXR PA and Lat showed resolution of vague RLL infiltrate.
Anemia- The patient has a noted history of hemolysis secondary to mechanical valve.
Her LDH on admission was mildly elevated w/ Haptoglobin less than 20.
However, her levels were not significantly elevated from baseline to suggest this as the cause of her acute hematocrit drop.
As mentioned she had no evidence of bleed by multiple CT studies.
CAD- Known CAD s/p CABG with recent Cath in [**9-1**] with stents X 4 to RCA/RPDA.
She had a new RBBB seen on EKG but stat ECHO showed no new changes from previous and she was not felt to have acute MI or cardiogenic shock.
She remained chest pain free throughout her course.
Left Leg Pain s/p Fall: No evidence of fracture or hematoma.
Given reported history of multiple falls recently, she was evaluated by physical therapy service who felt inpatient rehab was necessary for physical conditioning.
Pain was controlled with tylenol and low-dose oxycodone prn.
Avoided long-acting opioids given her hypotensive episodes.
LLL pneumonia: Initial evidence of pneumonia by CXR vs atelectasis.
However subsequent CXR 2 days later showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Left leg pain  Secondary Diagnoses: 1.
Chronic Hemolytic Anemia 3.
Hypothyroidism 5.
