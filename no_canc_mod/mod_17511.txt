Admission Date: [**2167-7-22**]        Discharge Date: [**2167-7-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-11-9**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old, Caucasian male who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with fever, rash and subcutaneous nodules with hypotension from an outside hospital on [**2167-7-22**].
The patient was at an outside hospital on [**2167-7-14**], eight days prior to admission with groin pain, left greater than right, and then presented again on [**7-19**], which was three days prior to admission, with a rash and painful subcutaneous nodules in the left inguinal area.
The patient then presented to [**Hospital1 18**], spiked a fever and dropped systolic to 70, but responded to IV fluids and dopamine.
The patient continued to state groin pain and rash, macular, blanching, nonpruritic, painful, but without drainage in the left groin area and medial thigh that the patient states responded somewhat to the previous antibiotics at the outside hospital.
The patient presented without any history of sick contacts, travel outside of [**Location (un) **], ingestion of raw or undercooked food, no history of pharyngitis or any people in his family with pharyngitis, but did state recent exposure to numerous wildlife including dead chipmunks, aerosolizer on feces and because of recent work in the forest, had positive exposure to all the classic vectors known in [**Location (un) 511**] including ticks, spiders and mosquitos.
The patient also presented with arthralgias in bilateral shoulders which migrated down his arm into his phalangeal joints, a dry, hacking, intermittent cough and urge to move his lower legs, running in place because it tingled.
The patient was also admitted with the diagnosis of sepsis secondary to hypotension and fever with an unknown source.
Lyme titers were sent which were not positive for either IgM or IgG.
Titers were sent for tularemia as well as blood cultures being sent for Ehrlichia, Yersinia and other rickettsial diseases.
The patient had significant leukocytosis upon admission which was as high as 25.2, which came down to less than 12.
He denied continued pain at the inguinal rash site or the nodule site.
Once he was hemodynamically stable, the patient was started on vanc and clinda for questionable staph strep cellulitis and doxycycline was later added on for rickettsial coverage.
The patient also developed a new complaint of a band of chest tightness across his chest from left to right in an nondermatomal pattern, although essentially across the pectorals that was provocated by deep breaths and palliated by sitting forward.
EKG showed some diffuse ST segment elevations and prolonged PR interval.
Throughout the hospital course the rash became smaller and not painful.
The nodule did not change in size, although when surgery did I&D of the area, they did not find anything but PMNs, but nothing growing out on culture and no cystic fluid aspirated.
The patient also had throughout his body questionable remnants of a red, macular, reticular or streaking rash which he described as the same appearance of what was throughout his whole body which is still remnant on his arms and legs toward the anterior sides.
Of note, this is not the same and his current inguinal rash and pertinent negatives included negative sore throat, facial palsy, central clearing rash, confusion or lethargy, ulceration or eschar around the rash or any uncontrolled upper extremity movements.
Differential had 86.7 percent neutrophils which was down from 93.8 percent on admission, with no bands.
Urine was dark amber in color with large blood, but only 2 RBC, positive for urobilinogen and trace protein.
Tularemia [**Doctor First Name **] is still pending, although we expect it to be back on [**2167-7-28**].
Lower extremity Doppler of the area showed enlarged lymph nodes in the left groin area that are probably reactive, but no fluid collections.
Chest x-ray showed a small right pleural effusion, otherwise within normal limits.
EKG on [**7-23**] showed borderline first degree AV block which was resolved by [**7-26**], but had an increased PR interval and multiple lead ST changes.
Echo also done in-house showed LVEF greater than 55 percent with no vegetations, no pericardial effusion.
In general, this is an alert and oriented times three patient who is appropriate, in no acute distress, pleasant.
HEENT shows no rashes or lesions on his head or neck.
No exophthalmos.
Cardiovascular was very significant for a friction rub, regular rate and rhythm without murmur, S1, S2, no gallop.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender, positive bowel sounds, no rash, lesions or nodules visualized on his anterior abdomen or lower back.
Extremities left inguinal and medial macular red rash that is blanching without drainage that has been marked with a pen.
Lower extremities without venous stasis changes, without edema or erythema distal to the site.
Lower leg and distal arm have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], reticular, red rash which is very faint.
No facial palsy.
No focal sensation or motor deficits in his upper extremities, lower extremities, head or neck.
[**Hospital **] hospital course, much of which has been covered in the HPI, 51 year old with multiple infectious exposures with resolving fever, who was transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] once hemodynamically stable, who shows a resolving rash and a stable, palpable nodule in his left inguinal area.
Because of his multiple exposures the differential diagnosis for this presentation was quite large.
Blood cultures were sent including instructions for growing out rickettsial diseases, which in this area would include ehrlichiosis, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9880**] spotted fever and Lyme disease.
The patient denied any recent trauma to the area, denied finding any bites, ticks in the inguinal area.
Denied preceding pharyngitis or sick contacts, no signs of upper respiratory viral illness, no other nodules throughout his body, no preceding arthralgias which reduce the differential diagnosis for the team to Lyme disease, tularemia staph strep cellulitis or acute rheumatic fever.
The diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever was pursued because of evolving pericarditis, rash and subcutaneous nodules which are part of major Jones' criteria as well as this migrating polyarthritis which was most apparent in his left shoulder, radiating down his arm.
The patient's ASO was negative times one, he had no signs of chorea and did have significant exposure to wild animals and vectors as well as apparent resolution with antibiotics and no aspirin or steroids, it was assumed that the etiology was more infectious than rheumatologic.
He complained of occasional, left, pinpoint shoulder pain, but did not have reduced range of motion.
He did have multiple EKGs for pericarditis and for any other cardiac events because of this migrating pain/arthritis that went down his left arm, all of which were negative.
His signs and symptoms of pericarditis as well as signs of pericarditis on EKG were also not present on day of discharge.
It was not painful, did not have any connection to the cutaneous tissue, was freely moveable and it was considered that this was probably a reactive lymph node that would decrease in size over time.
The patient was given very specific instructions on how to follow up with this questionable diagnosis of Lyme disease which was most likely the entity that is being treated, although other rickettsial diseases also could be treated with doxycycline.
Streptomycin was not started for tularemia as this was lower on the differential diagnosis, although tularemia does not necessarily have to be glandular with ulcerations in the central eschar which, of note, was not present in this patient.
A throat culture was done for beta strep and the primary consulted with the infectious disease team who believe that aspirin for the initial diagnosis of rheumatic fever was not necessary as this was more likely an infectious etiology.
He was taking a full diet, had been afebrile for at least 24 hours, had very stable white count, showed no other pertinent signs on physical exam except for an apparently resolving, [**Doctor Last Name **], reticular rash in the same left inguinal area with a very stable subcutaneous nodule that is most likely a lymph node.
The patient was reminded to keep this appointment as it is very important to prevent further sequelae including very serious complications of disseminated Lyme disease by following up with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
Cellulitis with subcutaneous nodule.
The patient was also asked that if this dictation or the lab results do not make their way to Dr.[**Name (NI) 55597**] office, that he does remind Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that these labs were drawn and it is very important to follow up on the Lyme serology to prevent future serious sequelae of untreated Lyme disease or improperly treated Lyme disease.
if the rash is not resolving, if he experiences high fever, myalgias, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath or any other condition he believes needs to be seen by a medical professional.
Upon discharge the patient was understanding of his diagnosis, discharge condition, discharge medications and plans for followup and states compliance with these plans.
