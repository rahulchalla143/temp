* On the day prior to admission, he started to feel dizzy while sitting down watching television.
At that time, he noted left arm and leg weakness.
He went to sleep and woke up on the day of admission with left-sided weakness.
Exam was significant for inattention to left side, righ gaze deviation, right eye skew deviation, vertical upgaze palsy, left hemiparesis, left hemisensory loss.
CT Scan showed 4cm x 3cm right basal ganglia/thalamic bleed with extension to right lateral ventricle with mass effect and slight midline shift.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy and CHF.

His exam is significant for left sided inattention, upgaze palsy, bilateral sixth nerve palsy, skew deviation of right eye, left hemiplegia, and left hemisensory loss.
All of these findings are c/w right thalamic bleed, and the bilateral 6th nerve palsy may be explained by intracranial hypertension.
Neuro: ICH likely due to HTN complicated by anticoagulation (INR 2.7).
BPs remained fairly well controlled on drip, but he had episodes of agitation where BP was increased to 190's.
Cardiac: - HTN - On [**2125-10-22**], metoprolol was increased to 75mg tid and home losartan (50mg qd) restarted.
The risks and benefits of coumadin in the setting of hemorrhagic stroke were discussed with the patient, his family, and the patient's cardiologist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Endo: DM - Patient had been on sliding scale in NICU, and on transfer to the floor on [**2125-10-21**] was placed on standing NPH as well as humalog sliding scale.
Pulm: - The pt had a low grade temp on [**10-30**] and CXR was obtained to r/o PNA.
A PA and lateral showed no infiltrate.
Sats were good and pt did not have T spike.
F/E/N: - Diabetic, cardiac diet - Pt coughed during neuro exam with thin liquids.
Videoswallow showed that the patient had no difficulty with thin liquids, but did have difficulty with mixed consistency liquids.
Please encourage pt to take single sips of liquid from the cup, versus continuous "chug a lug" drinking.
Renal: - CRI, likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy - Creatinine stable while in hospital (d/c Cr 1.5) * 8.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: - Right thalamic intracranial hemorrhage with intraventricular extension - HTN - DM - MVR ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 1525**])  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the ER if you have any further weakness or sensory loss, any difficulty breathing, or any difficulty seeing, speaking, or swallowing.
