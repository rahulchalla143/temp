He was at his nursing home on the night before presentation to [**Hospital1 69**] when he was noted to have an acute onset of respiratory distress and diaphoresis at approximately 08:00 p.m.
At that time, an EKG there showed rapid atrial fibrillation and labs there were notable for a CK of 279, MB of 27.6, and troponin of 1.2, as well as a D-Dimer of greater than 1000.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] where he remained in rapid atrial fibrillation upon presentation.
In the Emergency Department, they attempted to obtain a chest CT angiogram but were unable to do so secondary to body habitus.
Degenerative joint disease.
Morbid obesity.
A left parietal cerebrovascular accident with right hemiparesis.
History of transient ischemic attacks.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Levaquin which he was taking for a urinary tract infection.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
He had a very large thick neck so was unable to assess for jugular venous distention.
His heart was tachycardic and irregularly irregular; distant heart sounds.
Anterior and laterally they were clear to auscultation with distant breath sounds.
Extremities showed chronic venous stasis changes bilateral lower extremities.
No edema was noted.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 140 beats per minute, left axis deviation and intraventricular conduction delay, left ventricular hypertrophy, no ST changes were noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Overall, the patient was a 69 year old male with multiple cardiac risk factors with recent hospital admission for urosepsis, who presented with the acute onset of respiratory distress.
The possibilities initially included pulmonary embolism, aspiration incident, development of a pneumonia, particularly given his brief hospital stay, and acute myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema, or pulmonary edema due to rapid atrial fibrillation.
Initially, it was attempted to get a CT scan to look for pulmonary embolism, however, we were unable to obtain one because of the patient's body habitus and it was considered to be less likely just given the findings of an acute myocardial infarction and the fact that the patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation on presentation.
Also, on his initial chest x-ray there was a question of an increasing right lower lobe infiltrate which led to the possibility that the patient had acquired a Nosocomial pneumonia during his hospital stay.
Early on in his hospital stay, the patient had a bronchoscopy and the bronchial alveolar lavage in the secretions he was able to obtain had a Gram stain of Gram positive cocci, however, the cultures were negative from this, possibly due to colonization already covering with antibiotics.
The left lower lobe infiltrate did improve over the hospital stay although difficult to visualized on chest x-ray, and the pneumonia appeared to improve clinically on the Vancomycin and Levaquin.
Throughout this time, the patient had decreasing necessity for ventilation, although he did require a constant PEEP of around 10, probably due to the fact that he is morbidly obese with a low chest wall compliance, and therefore had difficulty in recruiting alveoli.
Nevertheless, the patient was stable enough to be extubated during his hospital stay and was doing fairly well on a CPAP mask with a PEEP of approximately 10 until he experienced acute onset of respiratory failure again and clinically appeared to be in flash pulmonary edema.
Therefore, we managed the flash pulmonary edema which will be discussed under the section of his coronary artery disease, even given management of pulmonary edema and optimization of his cardiac parameters, the patient was not able to be successfully extubated during hospital stay and required a tracheostomy.
At the time of this discharge summary, the patient was being maintained on tracheostomy still requiring significant PEEP as well as pressure support, and showing signs of significant respiratory muscle weakness, however, he also did develop a second pneumonia which was likely to be Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, although this may also represent colonization, therefore, the patient ended up being retreated with Vancomycin for a possible Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
It was believed at the beginning of the hospital stay that this was due to cardiogenic shock, possibly with a distributive component.
The patient did have a pulmonary artery catheter placed to help determine the etiology of his shock and importantly, it showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25, central venous pressure of approximately 16, although his cardiac output was 7.85 and his SVR was 673.
This led us to believe that there was probably some element of cardiogenic shock given elevated wedge pressure, however, there was a significant component of septic shock validity to increased cardiac output and the SVR on the lower side.
RAPID ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  This was controlled via Diltiazem and Lopressor.
The patient did end up becoming bradycardic on the first night which was thought to be due to more an overdose of the Diltiazem which was maintained at 15 throughout the first night of his hospital stay.
The patient did have multiple episodes were he reverted to atrial fibrillation, at times rapid atrial fibrillation during the hospital stay, which was controlled mostly with a combination of Diltiazem and Lopressor.
The patient was also started on heparin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which eventually was discontinued due to, first the patient being taken for cardiac catheterization, and then secondary to a falling hematocrit.
It was felt that the falling hematocrit represented more danger to the patient than the stroke risks or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, so the heparin was not restarted temporarily.
The patient had gone several days without reverting to atrial fibrillation at the time of this discharge dictation, possibly because an amiodarone drip was started and then changed to amiodarone p.o., which was continued at the time of this dictation.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  For his coronary artery disease, the patient was initially not thought to have had a primary myocardial infarction as his event, and that the rising CK and troponins may have been due to demand ischemia from underlying coronary artery disease and the stress put on his heart from atrial fibrillation and septic shock.
When the patient was septic and being treated for such, he was not taken to cardiac catheterization, however, after he experienced his episode of flash pulmonary edema after extubation, it was thought that one of the principal obstacles to permanent extubation was optimization of his cardiac function.
In Cardiac Catheterization, disease was found primarily in the left anterior descending and obtuse marginal 1, both of which were stented successfully, without any evidence of rethrombosis during his hospital course up until the time of this dictation.
For his coronary artery disease, the patient was maintained on aspirin, Plavix, Metoprolol, originally Isordil and hydralazine and the hydralazine was then changed to Captopril once his creatinine reached its baseline level, and Lipitor was added later in the hospital course.
NEUROLOGY:  It was noted later on in the hospital course that the patient had a question of decreasing movement of the right side of his body; it was unknown at the time that the patient had a right hemiparesis from a left parietal cerebrovascular accident and it was said at this time that the patient's mental status began to improve a bit after weaning of sedation.
Therefore, a head CT scan was obtained which showed the old left parietal infarction as well as some hyperdensity in the right temporal lobe.
It was unclear at this time whether this represented a subarachnoid hemorrhage or question of meningioma, therefore a repeat CT scan was done the next day which showed unchanging of this lesion.
He was still showing significant weakness bilaterally likely due to his prolonged Intensive Care Unit course.
A CK was done at the time which was normal and his mental status was just watched over time to see that it would improve and how his strength would improved.
ENDOCRINE:  From an endocrine standpoint, the patient had significant problems with glycemic control which was controlled with an insulin drip.
Towards his third week of hospitalization, the patient did have a significant drop in his hematocrit of about six points which was felt to be due to an expanding hematoma towards the area of cardiac catheterization which was done approximately a week earlier, therefore, an ultrasound was obtained which is pending at the time of this dictation.
Regarding his guaiac positive stools, it was felt that there was no necessity for an acute colonoscopy and this should be followed up likely as an outpatient.
The patient will likely necessitate a direct gastric feeding tube which will be difficult to obtain without an open surgery due to his body habitus.
Otherwise, the patient did require occasional Lasix for diuresis, principally due to inadequate renal function.
He was diuresing well even without the necessity for Lasix and the Lasix was temporarily held in light of his recurrent sepsis.
No imaging was done to determine whether there was any thrombus from prior hospitalizations or altered anatomy.
There was imaging done on the left side due to inability to thread the wire after repeated central venous lines were placed in the left internal jugular and subclavian.
No clots were noted in that area and eventually all central venous access was discontinued with his fevers and a right PICC line was able to be obtained.
He was experiencing continued fevers and infection, possibly from pneumonia, possibly from line sepsis, but not having any abdominal pain to give consideration for a work-up of acalculous cholecystitis.
