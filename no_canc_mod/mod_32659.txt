His girlfriend denied associated tongue biting or urinary/fecal incontinence.
Patient's family denies any toxins or exposures.
He did not have recent travel.
He did have a mild upset stomach after eating a chicken [**Location (un) 6002**] the night before, but did not have n/v.
He had a normal affect, and per his girlfriend, did not endorse any symptoms of depression.
His family noted that he did not have any febrile seizures in childhood, and had no medical problems growing up.
Shortly afterwards, he was also noted to have an SVT and given adenosine as well, and upon breaking the EKG was consistent with WPW with AVRT.
He was seen by toxicology, who considered wellbutrin overdose as etiology for seizures.
Family History: CAD and DM2.
NAD HEENT: PERRL.
I/VI systolic ejection murmur at RUSB.
No rubs or gallops.
PULM: CTAB no RRW.
No organomegaly.
**FINAL REPORT [**2106-3-18**]**     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2106-3-15**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2106-3-18**]):    NO GROWTH.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-3-15**] 1:46 PM FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, shift of normally midline structures, edema, hydrocephalus or major vascular territorial infarct.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-3-16**] 9:14 AM MR BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS GADOLINIUM: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.
No diffusion abnormalities are detected.
There are no foci of abnormal enhancement post contrast.
A moderately large air- fluid level is seen within the right sphenoid air cell.
There is moderate mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid air cells.
Slow flow within the right jugular bulb is incidentally noted.
A small Thornwaldt cyst measures 5 mm.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
There is no pericardial effusion.
EEG Study Date of [**2106-3-17**] IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the occasional bursts of irregular slowing in the left temporal region and due to the single burst of sharp theta slowing.
The left temporal slowing suggests a focal subcortical abnormality in the left hemisphere, but the tracing cannot specify its etiology.
The burst of sharp activity reflects a deeper midline or generalized process.
It included sharp features but no overtly epileptiform abnormalities.
The cardiac monitor showed an intermittently irregular rhythm.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname 76929**] is a 29 yo M w/o significant PMHx who presents with tonic-clonic seizure activity and AVNRT with WPW.
Generalized tonic-clonic seizures - Patient without a clear etiology including no history of significant alcohol use, other ingestions, CNS masses, or traumatic brain injury.
LP performed in the ED did not show evidence of infection.
Altered mental status - intubated in ED for airway protection in setting of tonic-clonic seizures.
No evidence of respiratory failure.
- Patient with episode of AVNRT requiring adenosine while having a tonic-clonic seizure.
Likely developed arrhythmia in setting of stress.
- Post resolution of AVNRT noted with delta-waves and short PR interval - Monitored on telemetry, with episodes of bradycardia with WPW morphology - Repeat EKG with no changes - Planned ablation [**4-1**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - EP Consultation  Medications on Admission: none  Discharge Medications: 1.
You should not drink any alcohol, as this can start a seizure  You should not engage in activities which either a seizure or arrythmia could be dangerous such as sports, standing on heights.
You will be returning to the medical center to have a cardiac arrythmia ablation procedure.
