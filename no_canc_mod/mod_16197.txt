Differential diagnosis includes inflammatory, infectious, or ischemic.
No focal abscess or fluid collection.
Although there are scattered colonic diverticula this does not appear to be the source of this problem.
Multiple liver cysts.
Prominence of the left paratracheal stripe in the configuration of aortic arch suggests unfolding.
There is no pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: # [**Year (4 digits) **]: Her [**Year (4 digits) **] was likely due to a combination of urosepsis and tizanidine induced [**Year (4 digits) **].
There was initial concern for GI bleed given strongly guaiac positive BM in ED.
However, pt with no further evidence of GI bleed and her lactate was normal.
She was treated broadly for infection with Vanc/Zosyn given [**Year (4 digits) **] in setting of T>98 (considered fever in MS patients) and leukocytosis.
She was also started on on midodrine due to concern for autonomic dysfunction with MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4246**] and midodrine was discontinued.
She was told not to take tizanidine within 2 hours of your baclofen or within one hour of lisinopril.
Her Hct remained stable for the rest of the admission with no further bloody stools.
She did have a with proximal transverse colon thickening that was thought to more consistent with ischemic rather than infectious or inflammatory processs.
Initial hematochezia may have been secondary to mild bowel ischemia from [**Hospital1 **] in a pt with low reserve.
# Weakness/confusion: Given her complicated neurologic history, her complaints of muscle weakness and confusion were likely due to both her MS, UTI, and transient [**Hospital1 **].
# Renal failure: She initially presented with ARF which was likely hypovolemic in the setting of [**Name (NI) **], UTI, and ?GI.
# Anion gap acidosis: She had a normal lactate with no evidence of uremia.
Her anion gap acidosis was likely secondary to ketosis in setting of NPO status.
# Prophylaxis: continued on home famotidine and heparin sc.
