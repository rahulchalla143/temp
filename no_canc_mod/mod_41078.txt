Admission Date:  [**2120-12-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-12-30**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia after a fall.
There was no complaints after the fall, loss of consciousness or head injury.
After approximately 30 minutes became increasingly shortness of breath associated with left pleuritic chest pain and came to the Emergency Room.
Sats were noted to be 75 to 80% with tachypnea, with increased respiratory rate in the 40's.
Had a left pleural effusion on chest x-ray and trauma placed an apical left chest tube.
Also had a fever of 101.1 the previous night with nausea, diaphoresis and episode of watery diarrhea without blood.
There is no vomiting.
The temperature decreased with Tylenol and she did not note a fever this morning.
On [**12-27**] she noted a headache, nausea as well as feeling chilled.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her great grandchildren had a stomach virus recently.
No chest pain, persistent cough without sputum that was thought to be either congestive heart failure or gastroesophageal reflux disease at her PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] lower extremity edema recently, no dysuria, abdominal pain.
Coronary artery disease.
Status post myocardial infarction in [**2109**].
Hypertension 3.
Question of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Left cerebrovascular accident.
Congestive heart failure with last echo in [**2120-4-1**] revealing an EF of 35 to 40%  Mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy, mild LAE, lateral and posterior hypokinesis, 1 to 2+ MR, +2 Tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Degenerative disc disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of rib fractures.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the left base, left chest tube is in place.
No edema or clubbing.
A Urinalysis revealed 100 protein, trace ketones, small bili, no leukocytes or nitrates.
No blood,many bacteria.
Left lower lobe opacity revealing either consolidation or contusion with a small effusion.
Healed right rib fractures and no pneumothorax.
5.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm which is old and no change from [**2121-12-2**].
Chest CT:  Large left pleural effusion, consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Small left pneumothorax.
Chest tube was tip at apex, emphysematous changes, calcified aorta and carotid vessels.
Old healed rib fracture on the right.
Negative for hemorrhage, shift or fractures.
Left frontal lobe with a prior infarct.
ASSESSMENT:  This is an 86-year-old woman with a one day history of fever, nausea, status post a fall this morning and later presented with increased short of breath, O2 desaturations requiring intubation with a left lower lobe pneumonia and effusion, status post a chest tube, and metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate likely secondary to sepsis.
Pleural fluid revealed an exudative effusion with a low glucose (2) likely representing a parapneumonic effusion.
It was decided to double cover with Levaquin and Ceftriaxone (she was pre-medicated and we were to watch for possible rash or allergic reaction.
Also requiring continues fluid bolus and her TH had decreased to 7.01 with a metabolic and respiratory alkalosis with a lactate rising to 5.7.
Cardiology was called and since there was no pericardial effusion on CT it was felt that depressed blood pressures were likely not cardiogenic however, she was obviously having an acute myocardial infarction in the setting of sepsis.
She passed away at approximately 5:10 AM with cessation of heart rate, breathing and fixed dilated pupils.
