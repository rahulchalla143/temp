HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:    This is a 42 year old man with an anterior myocardial infarction on [**4-30**], status post left anterior descending PCI at [**Hospital6 **], who presented to his primary care physician's office on the morning of admission with complaints of left substernal chest pain.
The symptoms began at 9 a.m. with chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea and some dizziness.
The pain was slow in onset.
It radiated to the left shoulder; no shortness of breath.
Similar in location and character to anginal pain but less severe, seven out of ten as opposed to ten out of ten with myocardial infarction, not relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin.
The pain was also different in that it was exacerbated by motion, pleuritic in nature.
The patient denies shortness of breath, has two to three pillow orthopnea which is stable.
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
He has mild intermittent lower extremity edema but no progressive edema.
The cardiac catheterization demonstrated a patent left anterior descending stent, serial 40% lesions in obtuse marginal 2, 80% right coronary artery lesion with left to right collaterals from the left anterior descending, PAP pressures 43/20.
The patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit for concerns of elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressures post procedure.
Coronary artery disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   No early coronary disease in the family; father with alcohol abuse.
In general, a middle aged man in no acute distress.
No jugular venous distention.
Abdomen soft, notable for ecchymosis across the lower abdomen.
Mildly tender around area surrounding bruise.
Extremities with no edema.
ST elevation in V1 through V4 with Q waves V1 through V3 consistent with evolving old infarction.
The patient underwent echocardiogram which demonstrated no pericardial effusion.
Ejection fraction 30 to 35% on early depressed overall left ventricular systolic function.
The patient was started on aspirin 650 mg four times a day times seven days for treatment of post myocardial infarction pericarditis.
The patient's Telemetry monitoring demonstrated no arrhythmia and the patient will continue to follow-up for further electrophysiology studies as planned through [**Hospital6 **].
