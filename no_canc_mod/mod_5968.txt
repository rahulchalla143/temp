History of Present Illness: This 75 year old woman has a history of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, CAD and [**Location (un) 3484**] syndrome with longstanding steroid use and subsequent development of DM.
On [**2132-10-16**] she underwent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital3 2358**] [**2-26**] anginal sx and an abnormal ETT.
Angiography revealed three vessel disease with a 50%stenosis of the RCA, 40% LM, 80-90% stenosis of her OM1 and OM2, and a 90% stenosis of distal LAD.
Studies have revealed no usable lower extremity veins for CABG.
In addition, it is felt that Mrs.[**Known lastname 24469**] is quite high risk for sternal complications.
Plans were for PCI of the RCA, OM1 and OM2 by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] with possible LIMA to LAD by CTsurg at a later date.
She denies any chest pain, and her EKG was not concerning for evolving MI.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - [**Location (un) **] disease s/p ablation of pituitary adenoma at [**Hospital1 2025**].
- Obesity.
- History of left lower leg hematoma after a fall 3 years ago.
- Depression.
- Hypothyroidism.
- Cataract in both eyes status post extraction.
She is independent in her ADL's but is known to have a gait disorder and a history of falls in the past.
-Tobacco history: Never -ETOH: None -Illicit drugs: None  Family History: Brother died from an MI at 50.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
JVD not able to be assesed secondary to body habitus CARDIAC: S1 S2 faint SEM LUNGS: Obese distant breath sounds.
CTA BL ABDOMEN: Obese NT +BS EXTREMITIES: LE WWP Venous stasis dermatitis BL with exfoliative scar on left anterior tibia.
Left UE is without erythema but mild non pitting edema.
Significant OM1 lesion with flow.
STEMI lateral.
Moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls and akinesis of the distal inferior, septal, and anterior walls.
The apex is mildly dyskinetic.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

# CAD: No angina or ST elevations immediately following first catheterization.
CKMB is mildly elevated which could be evidence of evolving MI.
The patient had to return to the cath lab for revision of original procedure.
She almost immediately [**Doctor First Name **] to complain of chest pain.
ECG showed ST elevations, and she was brought to cath lab again.
Selective coronary angiography of her right dominant system revealed three-vessel CAD.
The LMCA had patent stents with persistent dissection outside stents.
The LAD had patent stents with diffuse distal disease.
The LCx had patent stents; the OM1 had reopened since prior cath had had a 95% proximal stenosis with associated limited dissection from prior.
The RCA had patent stents with a 95% PDA stenosis present on prior films.
Her peak CK was 4332 in the setting of extensive chest pain and manipulation of coronary arteries.
# Acute systolic Dysfunction: The echocardiogram of [**2132-12-15**] showed reduced LVEF of 30% in the setting of STEMI.
Although cardiac catheterization showed high filling pressures, she has appeared euvolemic with no signs of fluid overload and has not required standing diuretics.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Noted in the setting of MI.
Currently in AF with frequent bradycardia at night, she is asymptomatic with these episodes.
She is on very low dose metoprolol for MI prevention  but this can be discontinued if HR cont to be an issue.
Decision made to treat with ASA and Plavix only given hx of falls and likelihood that EF will increase in the long term.
No symptoms of compartment syndrome (pain, cap refill, pulses) were noted.
Given the stressors, however, of her cardiac events, dosing was increased to 100mg.
# Hypertension: SBP was somewhat low so her Imdur and Norvasc was not restarted and her Lisinopril was decreased to 5 mg daily.
# Neuropathy: Continue neurontin but dose [**Month (only) **] to 300 mg daily.
# Delerium: Noted after extubation and thought to be related to sedation, ICU stay and UTI.
Her memory is mildly impaired at baseline.
# Papillomatous rash of groin: Dermatology consulted and rec miconazole powder.
15. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
