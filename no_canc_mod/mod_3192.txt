Admission Date:  [**2102-8-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-8-31**]   Service: MED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Fall and Hip Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 87M h/o CAD/Angina, COPD, DMII, and [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] who fell on DOA and was experiencing hip pain.
He had no head trauma and no LOC.
Since his fall, he's had sharp pain in his left hip and buttock.
Pain occured mostly with ambulation and radiates down the left leg to the foot.
He has occ left foot numbness and tingling.
Mild diarrhea over last few mos (or weeks?).
No blood in stool.
Possible dark stools for mos.
SKIN - NO RASH.
BACK/CHEST - NO TENDERNESS OF SPINE.
MILD L ILIAC CREST TENDERNESS.
EXT - NO CCE.
Marked bilateral vascular calcifications are noted.
Degenerative change of the lower lumbar spine are seen.
No fracture or dislocation is appreciated.
Central wedge compression deformity of the L3 vertebral body of indeterminate age, but likely old.
Grade I anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 of indeterminate age, but likely related to degenerative change.
L-Spine MR ([**2102-8-25**]):  Since the prior MRI study of [**2098-10-31**], a new chronic compression fracture of L3 is noted.
Moderate-to-severe spinal stenosis is seen at L2-3 and L3-4 level and severe spinal stenosis is seen at L4-5 level.
Focal area of signal abnormality within T12 vertebra at the site of previously seen hemangioma has unusual appearance for hemangioma and metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
Small left-sided disc herniation at L3-4 level severely narrowing the left lateral recess.
\  Bone Scan ([**2102-8-28**]): Left femoral intertrochanteric and left medial tibial plateau increased uptake, consistent with fractures in these regions.
CXR ([**2102-8-30**] - 12PM): Left lower lobe consolidation with effusion.
Mild CHF.
CXR ([**2102-8-30**] - 6PM): Extensive pneumonia in the left upper and left lower lobe.
The patient was diagnosed with a Pseudomonas UTI and treated with Ciprofloxacin .
His pain was considered secondary to post-traumatic aggrevation of a pre-existing spinal stenosis.
An EGD was scheduled - the pt was taken down to the GI suite where he became became acutely hypoxic - no sedating medications had been administered.
A CXR revealed mild CHF and a LLL consolidation consistent with PNA.
Unfortunately, his oxygen requirement increased and his blood pressures dropped.
The patient passed away in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from respitory failure and progressive hypotension.
Again, the pt had an episode of acute hypoxia prior to an EGD evaluation despite the lack of sedating medications.
A LLL PNA was discovered on CXR along with mild CHF.
Femur fracture: Initial x-rays for pelvic or femur fracture were negative.
However, an incidental lumbar compression fracture was noted.
A bone scan was then pursued to evaluate for metastatic neoplastic disease - a small, subacute to chronic left intertrochanteric fracture was discoverd.
(No metastatic disease was found.)
Spinal Stenosis: An MRI of his L-spine showed mod-sev spinal stenosis from L2-L5 without cord compression.
He was then seen by the Pain Service who scheduled the injections to target his radicular symptoms from spinal stenosis.
Fall: Regarding the patient's fall, it was believed that the cause was mulitfactorial and included effects from spinal stenosis pain/weakness, deconditioning, dehydration (diarrhea/poor POs), and a UTI.
Although the patient's HCT and SBPs were stable, he had a large melenotic stool late in his course.
He also reported a h/o melena along with a 20-30lb wt loss over one year.
There was a concern for for NSAID-gastritis/enteritis/PUD or cecal/asc.
Secondary Dx: Pseudomonas and E.Coli Urinary Tract Infection, Dehydration.
