Earlier in the afternoon, after raking leaves for several hours Pt was in the house resting when he developed a mild ([**12-10**]) chest discomfort and associated diaphoresis.
Because of feeling "funny" Pt arose and walked a few steps towards his brother when he syncopized with LOC and striking his right forehead.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] brother immediately called EMS and upon their arrival Pt was mildly confused and bradycardic.
ECGs in the field were consistent with an RV infarction given inferior STEs and reciprocal depressions.
On route to the hospital, Pt with tracing consistent with complete heart block for which he received atropine and additionally with evidence of some ventricular ectopy for which he recieved lidocaine.
Given clinical picture Pt given dose of [**Last Name (LF) 60172**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 4532**] load, integrillin and started in heparin gtt and immediately transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catherization.
Upon arrival, Pt was CP free with STE present but decreased to less than 1 mm in smae previous distribution.
Given that Pt was pain free and showed resolvement of STEs in light of recent integrillin and TNK administration, it was felt best to defer catherization until the morning.
Past Medical History: No CAD No DM No HTn s/p right cataract surgery  Social History: Pt lives with his brother ans is employed full time as a denture technician.
Family History: no early CAD, DM or CA.

ECG: Sinus rhythm Marked left axis deviation Left atrial abnormality RBBB with left anterior fascicular block Inferior infarct - age undetermined Since previous tracing of [**2197-10-9**], no significant change  Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 95 164 130 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 60173**] -64 -57     Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo man with h/o tobacco use but no known [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with an inferior STEMI after recieving thrombolytics.
Given evidence of reperfusion as well as wanting to minimize Pt's bleeding risk, interventional cardiology felt it was best to postpone catherization untill the morning.
Pt remained CP free overnight and HD stable.
Subsequent cath showed a right dominant system, with 60%LAD, clean LCx and a RCA with 70% ulcerated proximal lesion that was fixed with a DES.
V-gram showed a LVEF 45% with inferior akinesis consistent with a RV inferior MI.
Pt remained CP free during complete hospital stay.
Both the beta-blocker and ACEi will need to be titrated as an outpatient to acheive the best control of HR and BP possible.
Given RV infarction it was important to keep Pt well hydrated in initial phases.
Pre-cath echo showed a depressed LV systolic function but was unable to asses more thoroughly; intra-cath V-gram showed a LVEF 45% with inf.
AT several times recieved IV bolus in reaction to tachycardia as a possible reaction to hypovolemia.
No obvious signs or symptoms of heart failure during this acute insult.
3) Rhythm: Pt with transient heart block enroute to the OSH, treated with atropineby EMS.
Tele-monitoring during hospital stay significant for short runs of NSVT, no obvious conduction discorders.
Pt most likely suffering from conduction block in the acute setting of a MI.
And it was this conduction block and related hypoperfusion that caused Pt's initial episode of syncope.
4) Head Hematoma: Normal neurologic exam but given recent thrombolytics, a head Ct was obtained which was negative for acute bleed or mass effect.
Hematoma quickly resolved and Pt without any complaints.
