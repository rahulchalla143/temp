Admission Date: [**2157-11-12**]        Discharge Date: [**2157-11-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2157-11-12**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NB   HISTORY:  This infant was born at 36 and 1/7 weeks gestation and admitted to the NICU for respiratory distress.
[**Hospital 37544**] medical history of bipolar disorder and HSV.
This pregnancy was complicated by fetal growth restriction and low amniotic fluid index.
There were no prenatal sepsis risk factors.
Rupture of membranes was 11 hours prior to delivery, revealing clear fluid.
Baby was noted to have some tachypnea, retractions and grunting in the delivery room which warranted her coming to the NICU.
Mild retraction.
Periodic breathing with desaturations was noted.
CV:  Normal rate and rhythm, no murmur.
2+ femoral pulses.
Abdomen soft with positive bowel sounds.
No sacral anomalies.
The infant has had no further     apnea spells or desaturation spells and has been stable     on room air since that initial newborn period.
The     infant had increased irritability and poor feeding     initially and some spits.
Blood     culture also had no growth.
Otherwise, maintains a normal neurologic     exam for gestational age.
It has been felt that those     neurologic symptoms are most likely related to the     maternal medications during pregnancy for Mom's bipolar     disorder.
There are no active issues at this time     of concern.
MEDICATIONS:  There are no medications.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Sepsis ruled out.
