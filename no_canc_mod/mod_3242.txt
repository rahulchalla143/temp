LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Conclusions Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 - 45 %).
with inferior and apical hypokinesis.
There is mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
There is trace aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB: The patient is in SR, on no inotropes.
