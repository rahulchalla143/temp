Admission Date:  [**2178-6-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-7-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-1-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MED  Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Neurontin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8684**] Chief Complaint: Bilateral pulmonary emboli and COPD flare  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 74 yo male NH resident, h/o COPD (on O2), type 2 DM, presenting with lethargy, hypoglycemia, and SOB; pt was 83-84% with FSBG=59.
Given pt's lethargy, HCT was performed which was negative for mass effect or bleed.
CXR on admission showed possible RUL/RML PNA, but was concerning for endobronchial lesion.
F/U Chest CT showed bilateral PE's, and patient was started on anticoagulation with coumadin and lovenox.
Pt was initially stable on the floor, but on hospital day [**1-13**], he had an acute desaturation, was working hard to breathe/using accessory muscle, and was transferred to the MICU at this time where he was stabilized using non-invasive measures (O2 mask, frequent nebs).
Chest X-ray did not show any acute process, but patient was laboring to breathe, using accessory muscles, and was not moving air very well.
Pt started on Heparin drip, became more stable from a respiratory standpoint, and he was transferred back to the floor where he has remained stable on 2 L NC O2, nebs, hep gtt, antibiotics, and steroid taper.
COPD: Pt continued on a prednisone taper (2wks) for possible COPD flare, likely one of the reasons for his respiratory distress.
?PNA-normal cxr, afebrile, but did have bandemia on admission and now with pseudomonas in sputum, resistent to quinolones.
Given allergy to pcn, ceph, wills start aztreonam for presumptive coverage since he has poor respiratory status.
14-d course of Aztreonam with a 7-day course of Levo for possible pneumonia with COPD flare.
Psych: continue Effexor, give Ambien for insomnia; hold Xanax, monitor for signs of benzo withdrawal  6.
Pt is now Full code; reversed code status in-house given possibly reversible cause of respiratory distress.
Pt needs monitoring of his coumadin; pt found to have bilateral severe PE's on chest CT, thought to be chronic.
If lifelong anticoagulation proves to be inadequate, an IVC filter should be considered.
Pt was DNR/DNI before this hospitalization; code status was reversed given the possibly reversible nature of his pulmonary emboli.
