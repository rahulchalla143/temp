Admission Date:  [**2140-4-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2140-4-15**]   Service:  NEUROSURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 86 year-old retired vascular surgeon has a long history of hypertension.
He was actually sitting on the edge of the pool kicking his legs in the water when he noted the sudden onset of a severe headache.
There was no nausea or vomiting.
He did not have his usual energy.
He complained of various aches and pains.
On the day of admission the patient noted the onset of another severe headache.
He has had difficulties with muscle cramps with them.
He is in no acute distress.
His long and short term memory are good.
He has no drift.
Abdomen is soft and nontender.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
This demonstrated a small amount of blood layering in the occipital horns bilaterally.
There is no evidence of any subarachnoid hemorrhage.
This showed marked atherosclerotic disease with tortuosity and calcification in virtually all of his major vessels.
There was a bit of prominence to his internal carotid arteries bilaterally in their supraclinoid portion, along with a question of a bit of prominence of the vascular tip, and the posterior communicating arteries.
Unfortunately, because of the patient's severe atherosclerotic disease and the patient's difficulty cooperating this examination was extremely limited.
His vertebrals were somewhat tortuous, but there was no evidence of any posterior circulation aneurysms.
There was extensive atherosclerotic disease, but no clear aneurysm.
The angiogram seemed to demonstrate an irregular 8 mm posterior communicating artery aneurysm.
The patient had no evidence of any spasm.
In addition, he was also noted to have low grade fevers.
This showed a small left lower lobe infiltrate.
Because of his multiple medical problems, the great difficulty doing his diagnostic angiogram and the calcification and tortuosity of his vessels, it was decided to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 2025**] for further management.
