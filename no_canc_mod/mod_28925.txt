No other foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage are seen.
No subdural or intraparenchymal hemorrhages identified.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with age-related atrophic change.
There is decreased attenuation in the periventricular white matter, consistent with changes relating to chronic small vessel ischemic infarct.
There is extensive calcification of the carotid arteries bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right temporoparietal region.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 1.Pt should remain strictly NPO with PEG placement recommended   for nutrition/hydration/meds  2.Pt should receive rigorous oral care  [**2182-7-21**] 07:20AM BLOOD WBC-7.3 RBC-3.93* Hgb-12.1* Hct-35.1* MCV-89 MCH-30.8 MCHC-34.4 RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-380 [**2182-7-14**] 01:06AM BLOOD WBC-9.8 RBC-3.70* Hgb-11.4* Hct-32.8* MCV-89 MCH-30.8 MCHC-34.7 RDW-13.3 Plt Ct-352 [**2182-7-21**] 07:20AM BLOOD Glucose-94 UreaN-26* Creat-0.8 Na-141 K-4.1 Cl-105 HCO3-25 AnGap-15 [**2182-7-14**] 01:06AM BLOOD Glucose-102 UreaN-17 Creat-1.2 Na-127* K-4.5 Cl-94* HCO3-23 AnGap-15 [**2182-7-14**] 01:06AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-110 [**2182-7-14**] 01:06AM BLOOD CK-MB-4 cTropnT-0.01 [**2182-7-21**] 07:20AM BLOOD Calcium-8.9 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.4 [**2182-7-14**] 01:23PM BLOOD Albumin-3.6 Calcium-8.3* Phos-3.1 Mg-1.7 [**2182-7-16**] 04:06AM BLOOD TSH-2.3 [**2182-7-14**] 03:20AM URINE Blood-LG Nitrite-POS Protein-TR Glucose-NEG Ketone-NEG Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-NEG pH-6.5 Leuks-MOD [**2182-7-14**] 03:20AM URINE RBC-0 WBC-0 Bacteri-NONE Yeast-NONE Epi-0-2  Brief Hospital Course: Pt was a trauma transfer from an OSH where he was found to have a Right tempoparietal SAH, on presentation he did not follow commands but otherwise had a non-focal neuro exam.
Neurology and Neurosurgery were consulted regarding the patients MS change and management of his SAH, respectively.
Neurology suggested and EEG which was read as inconsistent with seizure activity, making this an unlikely contributor to his MS change.
After running several test to further evaluate his dementia, the consensus among teams was that his changes in mental status were due to his SAH on top of his underlying dementia, the patient's mental status failed to improve and a speech and swallow eval revealed that he was unable to protect his airway with POs.
Return to the Emergency Department if you develop high fevers (>101.5), severe headache, Nausea, Vomiting, or other concerns.
