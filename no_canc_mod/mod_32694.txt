He was complaining of nausea with vomitting, and had decreased PO intake as a result.
He reportedly has not had fevers or abdominal pain.
He presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on hte morning of [**2142-9-19**] where he had normal laboratories and was presumed to have a viral gastroenteritis.
On CT imaging of his abdomen, however, he was reported to have "specks" of air within his portal venous system, as well as emphysematous gastritis and inflammation of his sigmoid and descending colon.
Physical Exam: T 96.4  BP 88/44  HR 61  RR 18  Sat 100% on room air General: well-appearing, maneuvering around bed without difficulty HEENT: no scleral icterus, moist mucous membranes Neck: supple, JVP 6cm Chest: clear to auscultation throughout, though poor cooperation with exam; no wheezes/rales/ronchi CV: regular rate/rhythm, normal s1s2, II/VI systolic murmur loudest at apex Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended, normal bowel sounds, no HSM; well-healed vertical midline scar, and well-healed scar along right costal margin Extr: no edema, warm, 2+ PT pulses Neuro: alert, intermittently cooperative with exam, CN 2-12 intact Skin: no rashes or jaundice   Pertinent Results: From [**Hospital **] Hospital: WBC 4.5 (81% PMN, 11% L, 8% Mono), Hgb 15.3, Hct 43.5, MCV 96.9, Plts 105 Na 138, K 3.7, Cl 108, HCO3 21, BUN 14, Cr 1.0, Gluc 90, Ca 7.3 AST 31, ALT 33, TBili 0.6, DBili 0.2, Alk Phos 66, amylase 55, lipase 24, albumin 4.2, TProt 7.9 CK 54, TnI <0.02 PT 13.7, INR 1.32, PTT 28.1 Urinalysis: negative .
There is a long segment of colon with wall thickening, involving the sigmoid colon (and questionably other portions of the distal colon extending from the splenic flexure to the rectum).
Other diagnostic considerations include inflammatory bowel disease, infectious colitis and pseudomembranous colitis (under appropriate clinical setting).
No discrete abscess.
There appears to be a broad area in the stomach that shows lucency subjacent to the apparent stomach wall.
The enhanced gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, urinary bladder and the vascular structures are unremarkable for acute disease.
CT Abdomen at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2142-9-20**]: Intralobar air trapping consistent with possible airways disease and/or CHF.
No pneumobilium or dilation of the ducts.
Mild colitis.
Left inguinal mass likely a cryptorchid testicle.

Surgery was consulted and felt abdominal exam and labs were un-concerning for serious abdominal pathology but repeat CT was ordered to ensure no free air, etc.
The repeat CT was essentially normal with mild colitis likely [**3-3**] gastroenteritis.
## Hypotension: was initially concerning for ominous abdominal process, though he is tolerated this quite well and it may be his baseline.
No nausea or vomiting.
Discharge Instructions: You have been diagnosed with a mild infection of your colon.
This caused nausea and vomiting but no serious complications in your gastrointesinal tract.
You should call your primary care physcian or return to the ED if you have lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, bloody or black stools, or abdominal pain.
Followup Instructions: Follow-up with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-31**] weeks  Follow-up with urology for undescended testicle.
