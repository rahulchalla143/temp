She was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 69**] from [**1-5**] to [**1-21**] when she had a coronary artery bypass graft done for three vessel disease with normal EF.
Her postoperative course was complicated by respiratory failure requiring a tracheostomy, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, requiring hemodialysis and an embolic cerebrovascular accident diagnosed on the CT of the head as a right MCA inferior division stroke.
On the 29th the patient had fevers and hypotension.
The patient had ID consulted and they recommended discontinuing the dialysis line as they suspected that was the source of her sepsis and elevated white blood cell count.
The patient was started on neo-synephrine for her hypotension and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].
Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
End stage renal disease.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft [**2119-1-2**].
Atrial fibrillation postop.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
She had suturing staples intact.
Her wound was dry.
Electrocardiogram was sinus at 80 beats per minute with a left bundle branch block and a normal axis.
It appeared that the source of her sepsis was an organism called actinobactor baummanni.

She was continued on her Keppra for her history of seizure disorder.
However, on the Friday prior to discharge she did have what is likely an aspiration event.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient has a history of coronary artery disease.
History of atrial fibrillation:  She was continued on her Amiodarone.

Coronary artery bypass graft wound dehiscence.
