Admission Date:  [**2180-10-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-11-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2145-7-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Compazine / Zosyn  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, labored breathing  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization endocardial biopsy   History of Present Illness: 35yF with multiple medical problems (including SLE, restrictive lung disease, global cardiomyopathy with severely depressed systolic function, nephrotic syndrome), with recent admission [**Date range (1) 68983**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, re-admitted with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and persistent nausea.
Her symptoms began in [**Month (only) **] (after a recent hospitalization), when she developed diarrhea (which she relates to her metoprolol).
She then developed nausea, vomiting, and dry heaves, without abdominal pain, and was admitted on [**10-10**].
She also reported worsening shortness of breath, 3 pillow orthopnea, and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
She had a thorough workup for causes of her diarrhea (infectious, structural, medication related etc.)
She had acute on chronic renal failure which returned to close to baseline (1.5) with IV fluids; she had a renal biopsy during that admission, the results of which are still pending.
She has nausea and dry heaves (non-bloody, non-bilious), along with worsening shortness of breath/PND/orthopnea.
Her husband (who follows her vitals closely) has noted increased blood pressures and heart rates since she was discharged from the hospital.
Given her worsened nausea and tachycardia to the 120's, he brought her to the hospital.
On review of systems, she reports nausea and vomiting, as well as shortness for breath and orthopnea as above.
She denies fevers, chills, chest pain (but perhaps some chest "heaviness"), palpitations, pleuritic chest pain, cough, weakness, numbness, tingling, abdominal pain, constipation, hematemesis, hematochezia, urinary symptoms.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.

[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2180-11-9**] Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-11-6**], left ventricular cavity size is smaller, global systolic function is improved (quantitative biplane LVEF 30% on review of prior study), and the severity of mitral regurgitation and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are reduced.
Brief Hospital Course: 35yF with multiple medical problems (including SLE, restrictive lung disease, global cardiomyopathy with severely depressed systolic function, nephrotic syndrome), with recent admission [**Date range (1) 68983**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, admitted with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and persistent nausea.
She was treated with steroids, cytoxan, plasmaphoresis, IVIG and supportive care, and improved from an EF of 15 to 33%.
Her mitral regurgitation and hypertension also contributed to her poor forward flow, and htn improved with diuresis, hydralazine, lisinopril and amlodipine.
Reported 3 pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal noctural dyspnea, in the setting of recent d/c Lasix and IVF resuscitation, LE edema also suggested fluid overload.
BNP extremely elevated at 65,187.
She also had non-specific sxs concerning for HF including throat tightness and GI sxs.
Given her SOB and LE edema R>L, a LE US was performed and showed no LE clot, therefore PE was thought to be unlikely.
Cardiomyopathy and renal failure on current admission were felt to be manifestation of underlying lupus.
She recieved 1 dose of cytoxan 750mg on [**10-20**] with mesna, cell counts with nadir on [**11-5**].
Additional plasmaphoreis was considered but held due to her continued improvement.
Most likely due to gut edema in the setting of right HF.
Patient developed thrombocytopenia with nadir of 68, likely multifactorial related to dilution, imunnosupression, and possibly pheresis.
Thrombocytopenia quickly improved, however then fluctuated in the setting of cytoxan use.
IgG and IgM ACA negative, so unlikely to have prothrombotic state.
#) Acute on chronic RF: Pt with h/o SLE Nephritis.
Pt previously with membranous nephropathy on prior biopsy.
She had repeat biopsy showing type 3,4,5 lupus nephritis.
Worsening renal failure with creatinine increased to 3.7 up from 1.4 on admission.
Urine lytes indicative of prerenal ischemia (FeUrea < 0.02%) +/- evolving ATN  likely from poor cardiac output/ cardiorenal syndrome.
renal U/S show's no obstruction.
While her renal function showed some initial worsening with diuresis, diuresis was continued due to continued volume overload, and creatinine remained stable.
# HTN: BPs improved with uptitration of hydralazine and addition of lisinopril.
# Anemia:  Likely due to acute renal disease, cytoxan therapy.
# Joint pain: ?
medication side effect (IVIG, hydralazine) vs lupus flare, however pt has never had joint pain with lupus flares in the past.
Hydralazine was discontinued, symptomatic relief with tylenol, PT.
