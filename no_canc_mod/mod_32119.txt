RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to position.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior akinesis, basal to mid inferoseptal hypokinesis and basal to mid inferolateral hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Normal right ventricular function with moderate tricuspid regurgitation (likely due to pacing wire).
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: The 60-year-old male presented with acute dyspnea 45 minutes before admission.
He had no chest pain but had diaphoresis.
He was transferred to the cath lab where he was found to have a 90% ostial left main and a 50% mid hazy lesion in the LAD.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
He developed a small amount of serosanguinous sternal drainage from the lower sternal wound with a small spot of purulence noted on the dressing.
He was afebrile and Kefzol was started and local wound care performed.
By the time of discharge on [**3-18**] the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing with a scant amount of serosanguinous drainage and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
there was no erythema and keflex was ordered for a week.
There was no swelling evident but venous studies were ordered and thrombus in the right internal jugular was found, not occlusive.
