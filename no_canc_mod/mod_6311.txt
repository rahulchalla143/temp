Mr. [**Known lastname 14323**] was in his USOH until approximately 3 days ago when he developed progressive somnelence.
However, due to continued somnolence, worsening hypercarbia on ABG (7.30/61/80/41 to 7.26/295/95/45), and transient hypotension to 90s, pt was intubated.
Pt was not given any abx, steroids or nebulizers in the ED.
CXR showed some haziness of the costophrenic angles bilaterally, but no clear effusions or consolidations.

Sinus tachycardia.
Low voltage in the precordial leads.
[**5-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  Bilateral parenchymal opacities, worse at the bases, left greater than right, suggestive of underlying edema or bilateral infection superimposed on atelectasis.
Otherwise, there has been no change.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 yo M with h/o OSA, COPD, obesity hypoventilation, and chronic pain on narcotics, who presented with increasing somnelence and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Active issues: # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with concurrent narcotic/benzo use and obestity hypoventialtion on top of poor substrate with COPD/OSA.
Reportedly responded to narcan in ED, but became hypercarbic with high FiO2.
[**Month (only) 116**] be due to decreased respiratory drive from high oxygen.
Possible PNA as pt with cough and CXR wet and so levofloxacin x 5 days was completed during admission.
He was transitioned from NC to room air without complication.
With improvement in respiratory status, pt became increasingly awake and alert and returned to baseline normal function.
Chronic issues: # Chronic pain: Significant chronic hip pain from bilateral necrosis/replacement.
Also with chronic knee pain.
Narcotics were held for entirety of ICU stay due to concern for sedation and pain was well-controlled with tylenol.
This did not adequately control his pain and so he was restarted on 40mg [**Hospital1 **] oxycontin with improved pain control and without change in respiratory status.
# Psych: Signficant psych history including concern for schizophrenia.
Buspar, Xanax and seroquel were held during ICU stay due to concern for sedation.
Patient will need to address these changes with his psychiatrist.
