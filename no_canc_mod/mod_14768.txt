Admission Date:  [**2176-9-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-9-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2139-9-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Betadine / Lisinopril / Valsartan  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Hypertensive urgency   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 37 y/oM with chronic type B dissection, uncontrolled HTN with chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure admitted to MICU with hypertensive urgency in the setting of medication noncompliance.
The patient complained of worsening fatigue and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection x 1 week with increasing dyspnea x 36hrs.
His first episode of shortness of breath woke him in the middle of the night.
He subsequently complained of dyspnea on mild exertion.
+ Intermittent nonproductive cough with post-tussive emesis x 1.
+ Increasing peripheral edema, orthopnea and PND.
He denied any chest discomfort, palpitations, fever, increased sputum production or other complaints.
He does have a remote history of asthma but has not needed an inhaler since childhood.
Of note, the patient has not taken his home doses of amlodipine or HCTZ x 2 weeks because "his prescription ran out and he was unable to go to the pharmacy while it was open."
CXR showed atelectasis vs infiltrate on L side and CT chest w/o contrast without significant abnormality.
His dyspnea resolved with oxygen therapy and he became asymptomatic.
Vascular surgery consult recommended CTA to r/o increased dissection but patient refused IV contrast.
After talking with radiology, decided to pursue MRI which showed stability of type B dissection with slight increase in size of thoracic aorta.
He was subsequently started on a labetolol drip with BP decreasing slightly.

Left atrial abnormality.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
MRI CHEST/ MEDIASTINUM W/O CONTRAST [**2176-9-20**]: IMPRESSION: Little overall change in the appearance of the known type A dissection with continued slight interval increase in size of the descending thoracic aorta.
male with chronic type B dissection, uncontrolled HTN with CKD, and CHF admitted to MICU with hypertensive urgency in the setting of medication noncompliance.
Hypertensive urgency: The patient presented with hypertensive urgency presumed due to medication noncompliance.
Prior to discharge given persistent mild hypertension to the 160's his labetalol was increased to TID.
Aortic dissection: Initial concern on transfer was that the patient's aneurysm could be expanding in the setting of hypertensive urgency.
MRI imaging was not suggestive of this and aneurysm remained stable.
Dyspnea: The patient presented with subjective dyspnea without any hypoxia.
Despite concern for infiltrate in the ED given no leukocytosis and no other signs suggestive of pneumonia antibiotics were stopped.
No EKG changes suggesting unlikely to be due to coronary ischemia.
The patient's dyspnea was ultimately thought most likely due to mild volume overload in the context of hypertension and an increased afterload.
Eczema: The patient has severe eczema particularly on extensor surfaces of his toes.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to the intensive care unit at [**Hospital1 18**] for severely elevated blood pressures.
You were restarted on your home blood pressure medications, which you had not been taking for some time.
You had an MRI and an ultrasound, which did not show any worsening of your aortic dissection.
