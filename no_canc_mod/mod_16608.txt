She suffered a traumatic crush injury of the bilateral lower extremities with an open fracture of her right tibial plateau and right fibula associated with popliteal artery occlusion and severe ischemia of the right lower extremity, as well as an open fracture of her left femoral condyle.
There was no report of loss of consciousness.
The patient was complaining of right leg which was initially noted to have a cool dusky appearance.
ALLERGIES:  Allergies included AMOXICILLIN.
There were no obvious deficits.
The patient did have decreased motor activity in her right lower extremity.
Her extremity examination revealed her right lower extremity to be cool and modeled without a palpable dorsalis pedis, popliteal, or posterior tibialis pulse, and an open tibial wound with exposed bone and muscle was present.
On the left lower extremity and open tibial wound was present.
The back examination revealed no tenderness and without any deformities or stepoff.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray was negative for a pneumothorax.
The right lower extremity x-ray revealed a tibial plateau fracture as well as fibular fracture.
A left lower extremity x-ray showed a possible posterior knee dislocation and a femur evulsion fracture.
A computed tomography of the abdomen was negative for any acute injury.
The patient received thoracic spine and lumbar spine films to assess for a spinal injury.
Her thoracic spine and lumbar spine films revealed no fractures.
The patient also received a computed tomography scan of her cervical spine without contrast on [**2172-6-15**] to rule out a cervical injury.
There was no fracture or abnormality.
The impression was a negative computed tomography of the cervical spine.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of probable ischemic right lower extremity due to a right tibia/fibula fracture as well as a left open fracture of the tibia.
The angiograms which were performed did reveal a total occlusion of the right popliteal artery.
However, the left arteriogram showed an intact vascular supply to the left lower extremity.
As previously mentioned, the patient's major orthopaedic injuries included a right tibial plateau fracture and midshaft fibular fracture on the right side, as well as x-rays which showed a fracture of the left femoral condyle.
The patient received several consultations including that of Orthopaedic Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Infectious Disease and remained on the Trauma Service during this entire period.
The patient underwent multiple debridements of the bilateral lower extremity wounds including dressing changes and wound Hemovac sponge changes of the right tibia and left knee.
Subsequently to this procedure, the patient underwent several more washout and debridement procedures of the bilateral lower extremities as well as a split-thickness skin graft on the left and right lower extremity from Plastic Surgery.
On [**2172-6-18**] procedure performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 9694**] which included a debridement of the skin, muscle, and bone of the right leg wound as well as operative treatment with the application of an external fixator to the right leg and application of a vacuum-assisted closure dressing.
Other pertinent laboratory data included a culture from the tissue of the wound on the right lower extremity which revealed Pseudomonas species growing out from this culture which was pan-sensitive to all the antibiotics listed.
The patient also received a Psychiatry consultation which diagnosed the patient with acute stress disorder and possible episodic delirium secondary to narcotics.
She remained anticoagulated during her entire hospital stay, as previously mentioned and returned to the operating room multiple times for washouts and debridement of her lower extremity wounds.
The patient was to contact the below listed specialists (including Plastic Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery, and Vascular Surgery) at the telephone numbers listed below to insure proper followup on her previous surgeries and her future care.
(e)  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**] from Trauma and General Surgery Division (office telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6554**]) through the [**Hospital1 69**].
A right grade IIIC tibial plateau fracture.
A left grade III femoral condyle fracture.
Multiple wound debridements and washouts of the bilateral lower extremities.
