Admission Date:  [**2175-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-2-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Increased SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheal intubation Mechanical ventilation Chest tube placement x 2 Arterial cannulation Central venous cannulation Bronchoscopy Tracheostomy PEG tube placement Pleurodesis  History of Present Illness: 85 year old woman admitted with a chief complaint of hypoxia.
She has had a steadily increasing oxygen requirement since, progressing to the point on the day of admission of being on BiPap 14/8 15L.
She has been evaluated for her hypoxia by various coverage physicians over the weekend and was treated with nebulizer treatments and lasix with little improvement.
She also had a CXR on [**12-28**] which showed a left lower lobe pneumonia for which she is on ceftriaxone, flagyl, and vancomycin.
On the day of admission, she was tachypneic, more hypoxic, with decreased responsiveness, and was sent in for evaluation.
On exam in the ED, she was noted to have decreased air movement with rhonchi and faint wheezes which improved with nebulizer treatments.
An EKG showed multifocal atrial tachycardia and mild lateral ST depressions.
The patient was thus intubated in the ED for worsening respiratory failure and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Past Medical History: type 2 diabetes hypertension gout osteoporosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, steroid dependent, oxygen-dependent, (FVC 1.89,FEV1 0.83, FEV1/FVC 44, DLCO: Severely reduced) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation anemia peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes gastroesophageal reflux disease history of MRSA hyperthyroidism  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: right below knee popliteal bypass graft with nonreversed saphenous vein and a left popliteal bypass graft with saphenous vein angiogram on [**2175-9-30**].
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: T 100.8 HR 106 BP 163/69 O2Sat 90% AC Tv 400 x 20 PEEP 5 FiO2 0.5 Gen: Patient intubated, responsive and sedated Heent: PERRL, sclera anicteric, OP with ulcers, MMM Lungs: Diffuse tubular sounds ant/lat Cardiac: Irregularly Irregular no murmurs Abdomen: soft NT NABS Ext: Left BKA, surgical wound intact, staples in place; Right LE no edema, black necrotic right big toe.
Worsening of right upper lobe opacity near the future, which are somewhat linear.
Background emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis as well as pulmonary artery hypertension.
Bilateral small pleural effusions are stable.
No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.
Right lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis; this likely represents pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
Stable mediastinal lymphadenopathy, most prominent in the AP window and precarinal distribution.
Severe fibrotic, bronchiectatic, and cystic changes consistent with the known history of COPD.
No pneumothorax as was demonstrated on the prior CT. 5.
Several smaller focal areas of consolidation bilaterally, the most prominent of which in the left lower lobe, just superior and anterior to the dominant area of consolidation.
While these may represent multifocal areas of infection or fibrotic change, followup should be obtained to exclude malignancy.
Small left-sided pleural effusion.
Mild prominence of the central main pulmonary artery, likely consistent with the given history of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Head CT [**2176-1-5**]: There is no evidence for hemorrhage.
The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns demonstrate no effacement.
There are multiple hypodensities seen in the subcortical and deep white matter as well as both thalami that are the sequelae of chronic small arterial ischemia.
There is a frothy fluid within both maxillary sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, and right mastoid air cells that may indicate sinusitis.
CXR [**2176-1-5**]: Very large left-sided pneumothorax with signs of tension.
Since it shifts the mediastinum rightward and everts the left hemidiaphragm, it may be causing hemodynamic tension as well.
The left lung is tethered to the chest cage by many pleural adhesions.
Right lower lobe consolidation is improving and edema has resolved.
A 6- cm bulla marginates the left major fissure and smaller bullae are seen elsewhere .
There is no right pleural or any pericardial effusion.
Subcentimeter mediastinal nodes not meet CT size criteria for lymphadenopathy.
Extensive atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications are noted, along with substantial aortic valvular calcification.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A 24-mm gallstone is noted without evidence of cholecystitis.
There are no suspicious bone findings.
Large left hydropneumothorax could be under tension and hemodynamically significant.
Severe emphysema including a 6 cm bulla along the left major fissure.
Improving right lower lobe consolidation.
Decreasing pulmonary edema.
There is a background of chronic lung disease and emphysema.
Scattered nonspecific opacities are present bilaterally.
The left apical pleural tube is relatively short intrathoracic and the tip of the basal tube is not its entire course is extrathoracic.
Little if any left pleural effusion or pleural air.
Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
No appreciable left pneumothorax.
Small left pleural effusion may have increased.
Small right pleural effusion unchanged.
Subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall and neck is still severe but improving.
Heterogeneous opacification in the lungs is probably a combination of pulmonary edema, multifocal pneumonia and emphysema.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 85yo woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, admitted with respiratory failure, intubated in the ED, likely secondary to multilobar pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure, complicated by a pneumothorax.
Respiratory failure - Her initial respiratory failure was thought to be multifactorial, secondary to multilobar pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with very poor baseline function, and congestive heart failure.
She was treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and azithromycin for 14 days for broad coverage given that she had recently been living in health care facilities.
DFA for influenza and urinary legionella antigen were both negative.
Most recent sputum cultures grew E coli, thought to be a contaminant as well, as the patient has been afebrile, with resolving leukocytosis, unremarkable chest x-ray, and no other symptoms of a pneumonia.
She then developed a low grade temperature and with 2/16 sputum culutres with 2+ GNR and with a history of enterobacter, she was restarted on a 10 day course of meropenem to be finished at rehabilitation.
Her sputum culture grew gram positive cocci and she was started on a course vancomycin, to complete a 10 day course of vancomycin and 10 day course of meropenem.
Her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was treated with albuterol and atrovent, though she was not very responsive to these medications.
She has also had several trach collar trials, during which she tires within 10-15 minutes.
Pneumothorax - On the morning of [**2176-1-5**], the patient's chest x-ray showed a vertical linear opacity consistent with pneumothorax.
This was thought to occur secondary to positive pressure with preexisting severe bullous disease, and likely occurred the night prior to the chest x-ray, as she began to have low blood pressure responding to IV fluids that night.
She was determined to still have an element of pneumothorax at her left lung base, so a second chest tube was placed.
The apical chest tube was displaced slightly and caused subcutaneous emphysema, but it was effective and was able to be clamped and removed on [**1-10**] without complications.
The basilar chest tube manifested an inspiratory leak which resolved until the patient's tracheostomy, at which time the leak recurred.
The chest tube was clamped and removed [**1-24**] without complications.
A chest x-ray after chest tube removal showed no pneumothorax.
However, that night she became increasingly tachypneic, and a CXR in the morning showed recurrence of the pneumothorax.
Another chest tube was placed, with a significant amount of resulting subcutaneous emphysema (head to toe) and no significant change in the pneumothorax.
Her course was also complicated by a bronchopleural fistula, requiring pressure control ventilation.
Her fistula gradually resolved, and she has been able to be adequately supported on pressure control ventilation.
Her chest tubes were put to water-seal on [**2176-1-31**], then were clamped on [**2-9**], and daily CXRs have revealed no evidence of recurrent PTX.
The chest tubes were sequentially clamped and then removed with serial chest xrays revealing no pneumothorax.
Hypotension - She had an episode of hypotension in the setting of her pneumothorax.
Initially, it responded to fluid boluses and, given that the patient had been aggressively diuresed previously, was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia.
This was likely just a contributing factor to hypotension caused by pneumothorax.
Fluid status - On admission, the patient was volume overloaded.
This was held in the setting of hypotension (with her pneumothorax), and was thought to be hypovolemic at that time.
Mental status - Early in the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have decreasing responsiveness.
She also has had difficulty in regulating sleep/wake cycles.
She was treated with one dose of fluconazole with resolution of her symptoms.
Atrial tachycardia - She had a rhythm consistent with multifocal atrial tachycardia, most likely secondary to her underlying pulmonary issues.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response - Ms. [**Known lastname 7474**] has known PAF, but she had increasingly frequent episodes of RVR to the 150s, with stable blood pressures.
Her metoprolol and diltiazem dosages were increased, with some effect, but she continued to have these episodes with maximal doses.
She was placed on an esmolol drip, which helped Ms. [**Known lastname 7474**] to revert to NSR at a dose of 100mcg/min, but experienced recurrent episodes on the drip.
She developed episodes of atrial fibrillation while on amiodarone and cardiology was consulted and she was started on a low dose heparin drip for possible DCCV if she became hypotensive.
Long term anticoagulation is to be determined as an outpatient The pt will need EKG's to assess for QT prolongation.
Diabetes - She was monitored with fingersticks.
Urinary tract infection - Urine culture grew E. coli and Enterobacter clocae on [**1-24**].
Hypertension - Other than during her brief episode of hypotension, she was treated with her outpatient metoprolol and diltiazem.
Peripheral vascular disease - Plavix and aspirin was continued.
The pt is to follow up with vascular surgery 1 month after discharge to f/u her dry gangrene.
She had no post-operative complications stemming from her recent left BKA.
This needs to be readdressed as an outpatient, as her current status was likely complicated by her stay in the ICU, and should be assessed once in an outpatient setting.
