Admission CTA Head and neck/CTP Brain: Final Report INDICATION: 47-year-old male with left upper extremity weakness and left lower extremity weakness along with facial droop, here to evaluate for CVA.
TECHNIQUE: CTA of the head and neck with perfusion was performed with and without intravenous contrast according to department protocol.

Otherwise, the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is well preserved, and there is no evidence of additional ischemic infarct.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
The left maxillary sinus shows mucosal thickening with an air-fluid level.
PERFUSION IMAGING: There is increased mean transit time throughout the right cerebral hemisphere with corresponding decreased blood flow but no significant blood volume abnormality, which is concerning for a large area of penumbra.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK: The right internal carotid artery shows an acute dissection extending from the upper pole of the right common carotid artery bifurcation to the level of the intracranial internal carotid with an associated filling defect in the right carotid canal.
There is no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.
The common, left internal and external carotid arteries are normal in appearance without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis or dissection.

CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK: An intimal flap is again noted in the right internal carotid artery extending from the level of the right common carotid artery bifurcation to the terminus of the intracranial internal carotid, consistent with acute internal carotid dissection.
There is an increased filling defect in the arterial wall of the right intracranial internal carotid artery within the carotid canal which is nearly complete with only vague enhancement.
The terminus of the right intracranial internal carotid artery is completely occluded.
The right middle cerebral artery reconstitutes by collateral arterial flow from the anterior communicating artery.

LABS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: [**2174-3-21**] 05:30AM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-5.65 Hgb-15.0 Hct-47.2 MCV-84 MCH-26.5* MCHC-31.7 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-344 [**2174-3-21**] 05:30AM BLOOD Glucose-110* UreaN-12 Creat-0.8 Na-138 K-3.9 Cl-104 HCO3-21* AnGap-17 [**2174-3-21**] 05:30AM BLOOD Calcium-9.2 Phos-4.0 Mg-1.9  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 47 year old right-handed male with HTN, HL, DM2, tobacco use, who presented with L hemisensory loss and hemiparesis, with L neglect and extinction, found to have R hemispheric stroke in the setting of R terminal ICA occlusion/dissection.
#Right Internal Carotid Artery Dissection: The patient's history is unfortunately not completely clear in terms of progression of symptoms over time, and exact time of onset.
Neurological exam initially showed dysarthria and left neglect as well as left hemibody sensory loss with visual and tactile extinction.
Originally the exam was significant for L face, arm and leg weakness in upper motor neuron pattern but was still antigravity in proximal muscles and full strength in the hand and ankle.
Intial CTA/CTP (see full report above) shows occlusion/dissection of terminal R ICA with reconstitution at take-off of MCA from contralaterals through anterior circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
The intial NCHCT shows small area of R parietal hypodensity, and CT perfusion showed very large entire R MCA territory penumbra.
Discussion was held at his admission with the neurointerventional team and it was felt that clot retrieval attempt may be complicated by distal embolization of clot, causing further infarction and worsening of his current symptoms, and therefore risk outweighed the benefit.
#Diarrhea: Patient had one large BM with some diarrhea on [**3-21**], a CDiff PCR was sent and was negative.

You were admitted due to weakness and sensory changes on your left side.
You had some imaging performed of your head which showed a stroke on the right side of the brain due to damage to one of the arteries suppling the brain.
This artery had a dissection (tear in the vessel wall), and is known as right internal carotid artery.
We evaluated several risk factors for stroke, and we found that your blood sugar has not been optimally controlled.
