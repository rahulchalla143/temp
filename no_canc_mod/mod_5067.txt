She was intubated for respiratory failure which was likely caused a severe COPD/asthma exacerbation, compounded with severe viral infections.
No evidence of an infectious process was noted on CXR.
Following extubation, pt became tachypneic with severe wheezes.
At this time, her nasopharyngeal washes came back positive for influenza, parainfluenza and adenovirus and she was started on Tamiflu.
The following day, pt self extubated and was then reintubated several hours later after she became tachypneic with diffuse wheezes.
It was thought that she was failing extubations secondary to laryngeal edema and she had a bedside bronchoscopy.
The bronchoscopy showed "near complete occlusion of lingula, RLL, LLL with forced expiration due to mild malacia."
After no cuff leak was found, she was successfully extubated on hospital day #9.
She was discharged with combivent inhaler, advair and a rescue albuterol inhaler.
# UTI: The pt's urine culture showed evidence of probable Gardnerella Vaginalis (10,000-100,000 organisms/ml).
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Respiratory failure s/p intubation 2.
Asthma/COPD exacerbation  Secondary Diagnosis: 1.
Call your physician or go to the ER if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath that does not improve with your inhalers, problems breathing, fever >101.4, chills or any other concern.
