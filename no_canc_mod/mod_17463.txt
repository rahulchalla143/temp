Bedside echo performed with relatively preserved LVEF, no acute valvular abnormalities.
cath in [**9-20**] w small occ OM2 with collat, otherwise non-obstruc dz A fib s/p DDD pacemaker MVR Hyperlipidemia Diabetes, type 2 Obesity Hypertension Asthma Ostructive sleep apnea on BIPAP.
Mild pulmonary HTN 36/18 on cath [**8-21**]   Social History: She is a post office worker and she lives at home with her husband, no   alcohol, no smoking.
JVD undetectable Cards: RRR, nl S1S2 no MGR.
No abdominial bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Neuro: after weaning sedation pt found to have R sided weakness R pupil irregular and 4mm with little rx,L pupil 3 mm and reactive Visual fields appeared full, preferentially looking over to the left but will follow to cross midline R arm initially 0/5, improved to [**1-20**] by discharge with proximal movement, 0/5 with distal movement.
TELEMETRY demonstrated intermittently V paced .
There is no mitral nor aortic regurgitation .
Rads: [**6-1**] Right LENI: no DVT .
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Large evolving subacute left MCA territory infarction, demonstrating luxury perfusion and a few tiny foci of hyperdense component posteriorly perhaps representing a tiny amount of hemorrhagic transformation.
Short segment occlusion of the M2 portion of the left MCA, best demonstrated on the 3D volume/snapshot images.
Two ill-defined nodular opacities at the right lung apex which may be inflammatory/infectious, though followup to resolution is recommended.
[**6-5**] right knee: Assessment for joint effusion is limited by positioning.
No fracture is evident.
No periarticular erosions are identified.
[**6-6**] echo: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest x 2.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
We felt that diastolic dysfunction leading to acute pulmonary edema was a primary contributor.
Other factors included likely aspiration pneumonia in the setting of her hypoxia and increased work of breathing.
We also were concerned about pulmonary embolus given her large A-a gradient.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and EKGs were obtained; however, this was thought not to be a primary ischemic event.
Her underlying rhythm was sinus but she has known hx of atrial fibrillation.
Atrial pacing was restarted with good blood pressure thereafter.
#ID: Pt was initially started on broad abx to cover for aspiration pneumonia given the respiratory failure, low grade fever on presentation and suggestion of mixed septic physiology by Swan numbers.
She also found to have an e.coli UTI which was pansensitive.
Initial [**Location (un) 1131**] showed low SVR with low CI.
There was felt to be a mixed picture of sepsis and cardiogenic shock physiology.
This was conttributed to by the AV dissociation of ventricular pacing.
We treated with broad antibiotiocs and diuresis, initially on dobutamine alternating with dopamine.
Pt had 7L of fluid removed with diuresis, BP stabilized.
# Neuro: On [**6-4**], new right arm weakness and R>L pupil size were noted.
Stat neuro consult and head CT showed left MCA territory embolic infarct, likely of cardioembolic etiology.
TEE on [**6-6**] did not find evidence of atrial clot or aortic atheroma to suggest a source for embolus.
# on [**6-7**] pt began experiencing abdominal pain with mild LLQ tenderness.
KUB showed a nonspecific gas pattern and no free air under the diaphragm.
Abdominal pain resolved with an aggressive bowel regimen.
