She presented to the ED with 10/10 chest pain with associated SOB and diaphoresis.
No EKG changes and nl initial enzymes.
CXR showed widened mediastinum.
In the CT scanner she became unresponsive after one bolus of contrast.
ROS: Pt unable to provide; per ED note she reported multiple episodes of blood-streaked emesis.
No abd pain, bloody BMs, or diarrhea.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p anteroseptal MI - 2 yrs ago HTN Gout s/p L Nephrectomy - TB in kidney?

Family History: no premature CAD  Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 99.5  P: 70  BP: 123/82  SaO2: 100% on CMV 600/12/1.00/5 General: intubated, sedated HEENT: NC/AT.
Pulm: Lungs clear anteriorly Cardiac: RRR, nl S1/S2, no M/R/G appreciated Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, + BS, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Rectal: guaiac negative in ED Ext: No edema b/t, 2+ radial, femoral, DP and PT pulses b/l.
EKG: Initial EKG: ST @ 117, nl axis, nl intervals, <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] dep in V3/V4 EKG #2: NSR @ 83 bpm, nl axis, QTc 472.  no ST changes.
CTA [**2154-7-29**]: No definite evidence of proximal pulmonary embolism.
This exam is limited secondary to heart motion and evaluation of the more peripheral branches of the pulmonary arterial vasculature is not well assessed.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Coronary artery calcifications .
The left main coronary artery was without angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease.
The left anterior descending coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic disease throughout.
The left circumflex coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic disease throughtout.
There were no lesions in the mid or distal RCA.
2) Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
There was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
The cardiac output and index were preserved at 5.0 and 2.5 respectively 3) Successful direct stenting of the proximal RCA was performed with a 3.0x18 mm Cypher stent.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the basal inferior wall.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is suggested (could not be confirmed).
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No ascites or biliary dilatation identified.
Diffuse increased echogenicity of the liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Discharge Labs: [**2154-8-4**] 05:14AM BLOOD Hct-30.2   Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o F with h/o CAD s/p anteroseptal MI who presented with chest pain and arrested in CT scanner, which required intubation.
Questionable V fib arrest - It was unclear whether patient had VF when she became unresponsive at the CT scan, our leading explaination was that she had a respiratory arrest after one dose of IV contrast for chest CT, in setting of vomiting and low bicarb, also some QT prolongation.
No recorded strip available for confirmation.
Her urine tox screen was positive for benzo and opioids, but she received versed and fentanyl during cath.
Given she presented with chest pain and she coded at the CT scan, she was taken to the cath lab which showed one vessel disease (70% stenosis of RCA) and stent was placed, and she was started on ASA and plavix post cath.
Given her initial CK and tropinin was negative, it was unlikely that ischemia is the course of her chest pain on presentation.
Ischemia - patient presented with chest pain, N/V, SOB and diaphoresis, although her initial CK and tropinin was negative, and ECG showed no evidence of acute change suggesting ischemia.
However, she coded while at the CT scan, given her initial presentation of chest pain, she was intubated and taken directly to the cath lab which showed one vessel disease 70% stenosis of RCA s/p Cypher stenting.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
3 HTN - initially hypertensive, hypotensive in ED on propofol.
5 Abd pain/nausea and vomiting - patient initially presented with abdominal pain/N/V.
Intially chest CT showed fatty liver, and RUQ ultradsound showed normal gall bladder and fatty liver.
6 Anemia - She was anemic post-cath (Hct in the 23-24), iron studies showed anemia of chronic disease, normal Folate and B12.
Given concerns for GI bleeding, GI was consulted, but no EGD per GI due to multiple cardiac risk factors at this time.
She was told to follow up with her PCP for outpatient anemia workup.
7 Psych - Patient has MDD and borderline personality disorder.
8 Chronic pain - She was initially started on both PO and IV pain meds, but we d/c'ed IV morphine and dilaudid, and only continued home narcotic regimen.

Discharge Instructions: If you experience any chest pain, SOB, heart palpitations, fever, or abdominal pain different than your baseline or any other serious medical condition, please go to the emergency room immediately.
You have had a cardiac catherization with a stent placed in one of your coronary arteries to keep it open.
Please follow up with your PCP for work up of anemia (EGD and/or colonoscopy).
