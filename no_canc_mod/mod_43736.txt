She has increased lower extremity edema since her rehab.
She also noted no cough, shortness of breath.
She admits to increased irritation with urination but no dysuria or hematuria.
A CXR demonstrated increased interstitial opacities of the right lung with bilateral pleural effusions felt consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema.

Followup on KUB that was taken in the ED to evaluate for megacolon; this showed some thickening of the colon.
CT scan of the abdomen was obtained which showed thickening throughout the colon with some stranding, but no abscess, toxic megacolon, or perforation.
Her WBC remained elevated, and she continued to have copious amounts of liquidy stool.
She was transferred to the ICU on [**5-18**] for closer monitoring given her lack of clinical improvement.
In the ICU, fluid resuscitation was continued (4L); central line was inserted with CVP's slightly elevated at 14.
Now on exam there may be a component of left heart failure with bibasilar rales.
Patient is TBW overloaded with lower extremity edema (it is unusual for her to have LE edema and none noted on her admission exam last month).
Fluids were initially given carefully (concern for 3rd spacing with history of CHF), but she developed hypotension (systolics to the 70-80's).
As above, fluids and pressors were used without success (also received PRBC initially upon transfer).
Cause of this was thought to be a combination of prerenal azotemia (FeNa calculated as 0.3%) and secondary to dye nephropathy (got CT scan on [**5-16**] with IV contrast, did receive IVF prior to scan).
Creatinine continued to rise, and she expired from presumed sepsis as above (blood pressure without response to fluids and pressors).
LVEF from [**1-11**] is 45%, unclear if her systolic dysfunction has progressed.
CXR today with possible asymmetric right sided pulmonary edema.
Repeat TTE showed EF=60% with 1-2+ MR.  As above, CVP was somewhat elevated when measured in the ICU (?diastolic dysfunction).
Patient has a history of palpitations and was on a KOH monitor as an outpatient.
Code status: on discussion with patient and her daughter, it was decided that that she did not want untubation or compressions but would get shocks if necessary.
