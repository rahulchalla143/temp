MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2118-12-6**]):   POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.
Significant small bowel dilation and fecalization just proximal to the right mid abdominal anastomosis concerning for massive impaction.
Small amount of free intra- abdominal air and pneumatosis of several loops of ileum deep within the pelvis are all concerning for an ischemic process.
Unchanged aneurysm (x2) of the infrarenal abdominal aorta.

A CT scan was done which showed some fecal impaction and he was disimpacted in the emergency room.
It also demonstrated a small foci of free air and possible pneuomotosis in proximal illeum.
Currently he reports significant improvement in his abdominal pain since the disimpaction.
