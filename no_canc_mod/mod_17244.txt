Admission Date:  [**2175-1-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2175-1-10**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (status post myocardial infarction times three) who presented as a transfer from [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital secondary to respiratory distress requiring intubation and sedation.
The patient was originally seen on [**1-1**] in the Emergency Department for three days of shortness of breath and a cough.
The patient presented again on [**1-5**] with increased shortness of breath and was noted to have a blood pressure elevated to 232/96, a heart rate of 113, and a regular rate and rhythm of 36.
In addition, a chest x-ray revealed questionable flash pulmonary edema.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction times three.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of 1.6 to 2.1).
Questionable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:  Questionable allergy to LIPITOR (causing back pain and "liver pain").
Lungs revealed rhonchi diffusely with decreased breath sounds at the right base.
There was distant heart sounds.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
Extremity examination revealed trace bilateral edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 with peaked T waves in V2 through V4.
Perihilar haziness and patchy lower lobe densities consistent with pulmonary edema/congestive heart failure.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Ischemia:  There was initially some concern regarding possible electrocardiogram changes with questionable ST elevations in V2 through V3.
Upon transfer, the patient was seen by Cardiology who felt the shape of the T waves were not consistent with infarction and were more consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy.
A statin was started despite the questionable history of an allergy.
The patient was to have an outpatient Cardiology followup regarding a possible outpatient stress test or catheterization.
(b)  Pump:  The patient had an echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 25% to 30% with global hypokinesis and focal hypokinesis on the anterior free wall.
ACE inhibitor was held secondary to an increased creatinine, and Lopressor was titrated up.
Throughout the remainder of his course he showed no signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure, and no further Lasix was required.
ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  This was felt to be secondary to Bactrim with an acute interstitial nephritis picture as there was positive eosinophils.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was intubated for presumed flash pulmonary edema in the setting of likely viral bronchitis presentation.
A chest x-ray showed no evidence of infiltrate.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had upper respiratory infection symptoms and a temperature at home prior to admission.
The patient was initially on Levaquin for a question of bronchitis/pneumonia but was stopped on [**1-6**].
Blood cultures, and urine cultures, and sputum cultures were all no growth.
The patient remained afebrile throughout the rest of his admission.
The patient was instructed to seek medical attention if he experienced shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or other concerning symptoms.
The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the Friday after his discharge to have his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine checked.
Congestive heart failure.
Acute renal failure; likely secondary to Bactrim.
The patient should be considered to have an allergy to SULFA, as this was likely the cause of his acute renal failure.
