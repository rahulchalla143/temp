Admission Date:  [**2140-10-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-10-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right internal jugular vein central line temporary pacemaker wire left femoral arterial line   History of Present Illness: 86F h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI [**2140-9-30**] without intervention, CHF (EF 45%), chronic AF on coumadin since [**8-3**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-6**] for pacemaker placement following multiple recent syncopal episodes.
Found to have prolonged pauses >10 sec on ECG at OSH.
Presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with epigastric discomfort and fatigue.
The morning of admission she had a near syncopal episode and ECG revealed a [**9-8**] sec sinus pause.
She was given 1mg atropine with good response and transferred to the ICU for further observation.
Emergent right IJ line placed successfully with temp wire and left femoral a-line for hemodynamic monitoring.
Of note, she had been feeling unwell for 3 weeks PTA with nonbloody diarrhea and malaise.
During this admission, she had an NSTEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath [**2140-9-30**] which revealed non-obstructing 2v disease and therefore no intervention was performed.

No evidence of congestive heart failure, presumably interstitial lung disease.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had a 30% distal stenosis.
The LAD had a proximal 30-40% stenosis; 60-70% stenosis in a small first diagonal branch; and diffuse 50-60% stenosis in the distal LAD.
The LCx had a proximal 50% stenosis and mild luminal irregularity throughout.
The right coronary artery was a small non-dominant artery with diffuse disease.
Flow wire interrogation of the first diagonal as well as the  proximal left circumflex revealed fractional flow reserves post  adenosine infusion of .87 and .97, respectively.
Brief Hospital Course: 86F h/o CAD s/p recent NSTEMI, CHF (EF 45%), chronic AF on coumadin presented with syncope and long sinus pauses transferred for pacemaker placement s/p asystolic arrest.
Shortly after arrival the patient had a 15 sec asystolic pause and a code blue was called.
During temp wire placement the patient became hypotensive with SBP 50's.
She was started on dopamine gtt and then weaned to neosynephrine due to persistent tachycardia and lack of BP augmentation.
She was febrile and had a bandemia lending concern for septic shock and thererefore was started on empiric ceftriaxone and vancomycin.
However, at approximately 3:30am on [**2140-10-7**], the patient spontaneously awoke with increase in SBP to 120's and was A&Ox3 with no focal complaints.
An attempt to wean neo was performed the following morning, however during weaning she became acutely hypotensive with SBPs in the 50's associated with the new onset of continuous temp pacing.
Neo was increased with no response.
