No acute intracranial process.
Small subgaleal hematoma at the right skull vertex without underlying fracture or parenchymal contusion.

Allowing for this, respiratory motion and some suboptimal inspiratory effort, the lungs are probably grossly clear and no definitive infiltrate is noted.
CONCLUSION:  No definitive acute findings.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
RUQ ultrasound: IMPRESSION:  Limited study with patent main portal vein and no gross ascites.
CXR Minimal interstitial abnormality in lower lungs developed over 3 hours on [**5-23**], probably mild edema.
Lungs clear of any evidence of pneumonia.
Pleural effusion minimal, if any.
