At that point, he did not have vertigo or nausea.
After a  MRI that showed a R-cerebellar infarct with hemorrhagic conversion and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] (as surgical backup is present).

Quit smoking '[**82**] (smoked for 20 years)  Family History: Father: MI [**47**]'s, sister had CABG  Physical Exam: Vitals T 97.8  HR 60  BP 120/76 sO2 95% RA  RR 18  FSBS 102 i/o: 190/500(shift) General: NAD HEENT: mmm; no icterus Neck: no bruits over carotids; no LAD; no JVD, supple Cor: S1, S2, regular, no murmurs Pulm: CTA bilaterally Abd: soft, nt, nd, nl bs Extr: no edema, warm  Neurological exam: Mental status: awake, alert, oriented to person, time and place.
No neglect for situation or space.
III, IV, VI: extraocular movements intact with bilateral horizontal nystagmus (more pronounced to the R), saccades on horizontal gaze V: facail sensation intact VII: facial movements symmetrical VIII: hearing intact to fingerrub bilaterally IX-X: palate elevates in midline [**Doctor First Name 81**]: strength in trapezius and  sternocleidomast.
no fasciculations or tremor.
No pronator or deltoid drift.
Decreased proprioception in both toes.
Coordination: FNF slow, with dysmetria bilaterally (more on R), rebound increased, HTS intact on R, slightly impaired on L. [**Doctor First Name **]: slow bilaterally.
BRAIN MRI: Findings indicative of acute/subacute infarct with associated blood products and edema in the R cerebellar hemisphere and mass effect on the fourth ventricle with resultant moderate hydrocephalus.
Old L- cerebellar stroke.
MRA OF THE HEAD: Irregularity of the flow signal of the distal right vertebral artery in the vicinity of the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery could be secondary to a thrombus or a focal dissection.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY: The right vertebral artery is narrowed from its entry into the foramen magnum until the take off of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
The cavernous portion of both carotid arteries shows some atheromatous change, but no evidence of dissection.
CT head [**6-10**]: FINDINGS: There is no significant change from the previous study.
Chronic left cerebellar infarction and subacute right cerebellar infarction are again noted.
There is similar compressive effect on the fourth ventricle and secondary dilatation of the third and lateral ventricles.
No new regional areas of hyperdensity are appreciated.
There is similar appearance to high density along the left superior tentorium.
No worsening or new intracranial hemorrhage identified.
CT head [**6-14**]: Comparison with the prior [**2113-6-10**] head CT scan continues to show the mixed density large infarct within the medial aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere, also occupying a portion of the vermis.
The smaller chronic left cerebellar infarct is again seen.
There are no other overt interval changes identified.
TEE [**6-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There is a 1.0 x 0.9 round echodensity seen in the left atrial appendage, likely representing an organized thrombus.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Probable thrombus in the left atrial appendage (differential diagnosis also includes an atypical left atrial myxoma or other cardiac tumor).
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Severe systolic left ventricular dysfunction, consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old R-handed male with CAD, DM, HTN, PVD, CRI presenting with nausea, vomiting, later followed by an ataxic gait and ataxia in his arms.
was found to have an acute R-cerebellar stroke with hemorrhagic transformation and some compression on the 4th ventricle.
Also old L-cerebellar stroke.
Mr. [**Known lastname 99134**] had some episodes of intermittent double vision, but no dizziness, headache or vomiting during the remaining course of the hospitalization.
1) Neuro: acute R-cerebellar stroke with hemorrhagic transformation and compression on the 4th ventricle.
As the TEE showed the possibility of a thrombus in the left atrium, coumadin was started as well.
2) Cardiovascular: Patient has a history of post-op afib.
4) Prophylaxis: VD boots while in bed (DVT), no complications; ranitidine (PUD); colace, senna and dulcolax prn (BM) 5) Diet: Patient passed speech and swallow [**6-12**] and was started on a low sodium, cardiac diet which he tolerated well.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 13990**] Health Care Center  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. cerebellar stroke with hemorrhagic conversion 2. left atrial appendix (thrombu or myxoma)   Discharge Condition: Good, with gait problems  Discharge Instructions: Please follow up with your PCP and at the Stroke Clinica as instructed below.
If symptoms (as double vision or gait problems) worsen or if you experience nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or a severe headache, please seek medical assistance or call 911.
Needs follow-up in one month with his PCP regarding repeat TEE to see if clot in left atrial appendage has resolved.
