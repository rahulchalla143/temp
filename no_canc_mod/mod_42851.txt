He walked upstairs, sat down and shortly thereafter, at about 8 p.m., he had substernal chest pressure.
It was described as feeling like there was air in his chest associated with nausea, which is atypical for him, and persisted despite two sublingual nitroglycerins.
Pain persisted.
Cardiac risk factors include:  Hypertension, age, sex, increased cholesterol, questionable history of diabetes mellitus 2, prior anginal type symptoms occurring with and without exertion, usually resolves in about 15 minutes, not positional.
Patient can usually walk 200 or 300 yards, occasional pressure with this.
Increased cholesterol status post hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No coronary artery disease.
No sudden death.

Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Jugular venous distention to 6 cm, left carotid bruit, dry mucous membranes.
Pulmonary: Dry crackles at left base and right base.
Extremities:  No bruits present in groin, no edema.
Neurological:  Full strength and sensation, no focal deficits.
Chest x-ray from [**Hospital3 9683**] showed a left lower lobe infiltrate.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is an 80-year-old male with history of coronary artery bypass graft times five vessels in [**2122**] with chronic atypical chest pain now with some chest pain associated with nausea, longer lasting.
At catheterization, patient was found to have total occlusion proximally of the left anterior descending, total occlusion of the right coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to D1 graft 90% lesion, saphenous vein graft to OM1 graft 90% lesion, saphenous vein graft to OM2 totally occluded, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery patent without critical lesions, left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending patent with proximal 50% lesion at origin.
After the coronary catheterization, patient received an echocardiogram which showed global left ventricular hypokinesis, more in the septum, ejection fraction of 30-40%, mild aortic insufficiency, trace mitral regurgitation, no effusions.
Throughout the rest of the hospital course, patient had no telemetry events, continued left bundle branch block pattern on electrocardiogram and had no further chest pain.
Overall, patient was transferred to the floor once stabilized in the unit and after catheterization and chest pain free.
