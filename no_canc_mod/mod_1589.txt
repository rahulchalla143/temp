Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 11505**] for hypotension after reported fall (unclear etiology, hypotension resolved), as well as altered mental status (presumably related to medications received for her wrist fracture, resolved with Narcan).
No elevated lactate during the previous admission.
She has had gradually worsening shortness of breath and wheezing associted with a cough productive of white sputum.
No fever but has had chills and sweats.
Non-exertional chest tightness associated with the wheezing.
Reports worsened symptoms upon waking up in the AM.
She continued using her Advair [**Hospital1 **] as well as PRN Albuterol inhaler and nebs with minimal improvement.
She says that the dyspnea progressed, and today she tried taking a warm shower to see if her symptoms got better but instead she felt as if she was choking to death so she presented to the ED.
CXR showed no acute process.
She complained of some mild abdominal discomfort so given her h/o SBO's she underwent CT abdomen that also showed no acute process.
On arrival to the MICU, she still feels very short of breath but can speak in full sentences.
No rhinorrhea or sinus congestion.
No recent antibiotics.
She has continued left wrist pain from her fracture.
No more abdomnal pain - she says that the pain she had in the ED was mild dull peri-umbilical pain that she thinks was related to being hungry, as well as swallowing phlegm - and did not feel like the pain she had during SBO's.
Also notable for continued back pain and left wrist pain, very poorly controlled FSBS in the setting of Prednisone (up to 400's), continued polyuria related to her DM2 but no dysuria.
Also had mild headache related to coughing frequently but this has resolved.

Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 11503**] [**Known lastname **] [**Doctor Last Name 11504**] is a 78y/o lady with asthma, diverticulitis s/p SBO's with multiple abdominal surgeries, DM2 with Metformin uptitrated last month, falls with recent Colles' fracture who presents with continued cough/dyspnea, hyperglycemia, and elevated lactate.
Her prednisone was weaned down to 30 mg daily but was not weaned further because of adrenal insufficiency (see below).
Adrenal insufficiency: She had hypotension during this admision as well as previous admissions.
We then consulted endocrinology who recommended a very slow taper of her prednisone.
# Elevated lactate: Likely from medication and volume depletion.
Diabetes mellitus type 2: Her metformin and glipizide were stopped on admission and she was started on insulin sliding scale.
Hypertension, benign: She has been on lisinopil, clonidine and lasix which were held in the setting of hypotension on presentation (this was thought to be due, at least in part, to adrenal insufficiency.
No source of infection was identified).
-continued Pravastatin .
-continued Sertraline .
Pain from left Colles' fracture and chronic back pain.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -[**Month (only) 116**] need insulin if blood sugars elevated on steroids and without metformin -Needs to be on long prednisone taper as directed by endocrinology -Blood cultures pending at time of discharge -Would consider outpatient referral to Pulmonary.
