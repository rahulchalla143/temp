The electrocardiogram on admission, [**2189-9-29**] showed sinus rhythm, poor R wave infarction, T wave inversions in leads I and AVL, and nonspecific T wave flattening in leads V3 through V6.
The latest electrocardiogram at the time of dictation was from [**2189-10-8**] and shows sinus tachycardia with no diagnostic interim change from the prior electrocardiogram.
Pathology [**2189-10-5**], shows no diagnostic abnormality.
Echocardiogram performed on [**2189-9-29**] was read as: Left atrum normal in size, interatrial septum not fully visualized, left ventricular cavity size normal, left ventricular systolic normal with a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 65%, right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion normal, aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal, mitral valve normal, trivial mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, small to moderate size circumferential pericardial effusion which is echodense, particularly anteriorly, which is suggestive of possible organization, probably significant respirophasic duration in mitral and tricuspid inflow patterns, no right atrial collapse is identified in suboptimal views; the right ventricular free wall appears somewhat extrinsically compressed with no clear diastolic collapse; compared with prior echocardiogram on record from [**2189-5-19**], the pericardial and pleural effusions were noted to be new.
Repeat echocardiogram on [**2189-10-12**] was read as follows:  Left atrium normal in size, right atrium moderately dilated, left ventricular wall thickness normal, left ventricular cavity size normal, overall left ventricular systolic function normal with a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than ...................; right ventricular systolic function appears depressed, there is abnormal systolic septal motion position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload, aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion; there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen, no pericardial effusion is noted, no intracardiac shunt seen, no thrombus seen, no pericardial effusion seen.
