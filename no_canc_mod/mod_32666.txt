Admission Date:  [**2181-1-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2181-2-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-6-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: code stroke: aphasia, right facial droop, right hemiparesis   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Trach, PEG, HD, TEE   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 79 yo man with DM II x 15 yrs, ESRD on dialysis, HTN, hyperlipidemia, smoker, who presents with acute onset aphasia, R facial droop and R hemiparesis, last seen nml by his wife at 22h30.
He had a NCHCT that did not reveal intracranial bleed.
Given his renal failure, the dialysis fellow was called prior to administering iv contrast which accounted for some of the delay, such that the CT scan was performed at 4 am and completed at 4h30.
U/a neg for leuks or nitrites, protein > 300 mg/dL.
Past Medical History: -HTN -Hyperlipidemia -DM II x 15 yrs -ESRD on dialysis, secondary hyperparathyroidism, Perm-a-Cath R IJ vein [**2179-10-31**] and replaced [**2179-12-1**] due to line infection, L arm radiocephalic AV fistula -prostate Ca s/p radioactive seed implant -OSA, on BIPAP -osteoarthritis -vertigo -gout -L-sided pleural-based lung fibrotic lesion attributed to chest trauma at 5 yrs of age in [**Country 2559**] requiring surgery, and multiple pulm nodules stable on CXRs.
Social History: owns a plastics manufacturing company, smokes, occasional EtOH, lives with wife, supportive family, daughter Mrs [**Name (NI) 43852**] cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76940**]   Family History: -father prostate Ca, mother died at age [**Age over 90 **]   Physical Exam: T 98.7  HR 88  BP 130/63  RR 24   sO2 100% on 4 L np GEN: NAD HEENT: mmm NECK: no LAD; no carotid bruits; full range neck movements LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally HEART: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, [**4-5**] pansystolic murmur at LLSB, no gallops or rubs.
EXTREMITIES: no clubbing, cyanosis, ecchymosis, or edema  NEURO  NIHSS 12: 1a=0, 1b=2, 1c=0, 2=0, 3=2, 4=2, 5=0, 6=0, 7=X, 8=1, 9=3, 10=2, 11=0, 12=A  MSE: awake, responds to voice, mute, follows simple commands such as opening eyes and gripping but no other commands such as sticking out tongue or showing two fingers, fidgety, trying to remove O2 nasal cannula & O2 sat probe.
No adventitious movements, no tremor, no asterixis.
R sided mild weakness compared to left.
No pronator drift.
However, the non-contrast CT scan suggests low density and swelling in the left MCA territory, which would imply a completed infarct.
The CT angiogram demonstrates occlusion of the left vertebral artery in its cervical course.
There is evidence of acute infarction in the distribution of the superior division of the left middle cerebral artery.
The MRA examination demonstrates an abrupt cutoff of the superior division of the left MCA with a faint tapering that suggests a meniscus and a likely intraluminal filling defect.
These findings are most suggestive of an embolic infarction in this location with a tiny trickle of flow passing distal to the occlusion.
No other intracranial vascular abnormalities are noted.
CONCLUSION: Acute infarction in the superior division of the left middle cerebral artery with near occlusion of this branch just distal to the middle cerebral artery bifurcation.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
Patchy area of opacification persists at the left base, which could well represent atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There are complex (>4mm) non-mobile atheroma in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta to 37cm beyond the incisors.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2) by planimetry.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2) related to the severe MAC (no evidence of rheumatic deformity).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The intra-atrial septum and right atrium were not well seen.
Agitated saline was injected at rest with no appearance of bubbles in the left atrium suggestive of the absence of a PFO or ASD with right to left shunting.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old man with a history of DM2, ESRD on HD, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presented with aphasia and right face/arm/leg weakness, found to have a L MCA stroke from likely embolic source, transfered to ICU for possible PNA management and subsequent trach/peg on [**2-6**].
He was found to have a L MCA superior division stroke.
Patient was initially evaluated at OSH within the tPA windonw, however none was given as it was felt that his symptoms were improving.
Etiology was thought to be intracranial thromboembolism secondary to multiple risk factors.
CT Angiogram showed patent carotids but chronically occluded left vertebral artery.
TTE and TEE showed no ASD, PFO, or cardioembolic source.
Hb A1c was found to be 8.2; covered with an ISS, though he may need adjustment of his diabetes regimen as an outpatient after his acute illness.
However, lipitor was stopped due to marked elevation of CKs to 1000s.
Patient also had a repeat head CT on [**2-9**] that showed slight progression of his affected L MCA teritory.
Patient remained with R sided weakness, able to weakly grasp on the R hand and flex his R ankle that was slightly improving with physical therapy.
# GI: Swallow evaluated him and found him to be unable to swallow.
# Pulmonary - patient with a small RML PNA upon transfer to ICU on [**2181-2-4**].
He underwent an uneventful trach placement for likely future aspiration events on [**2-6**].
Bronchoscopy did not reveal acute plugging, hemorrhage or airway collapse.
He did have mild to moderate secretions that did improve with antibiotics.
Patient was also started on steroids with a 7 day taper for presumed PNA associated COPD exacerbation which he will need to complete in rehab (2d late).
His HD was used to remove volume as he had an elevated BNP of 1600.
Although he never had pleural effusions.
Patient continued to improve on the above treatement and on [**2-9**] he was change to 50% trachmask and was breathing and interacting comfortably.
A Passy Muir vlave assessment was considered but defered until his mental status cleared.
# ESRD - patient received HD while in house.
# Anemia - patient's Hct ranged from 24-28.
# Diabetes - Patient is on oral medications as an outpatient and was managed with both NPH and humalog here due to his steroid requirement.
# Access - HD catheter via L fistula, R sided PICC that renal service requests to be d/c once IV antibiotics are finished to preserve the site for potential future sites for HD and potential future fistula if the L side failed.
