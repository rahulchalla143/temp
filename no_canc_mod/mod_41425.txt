failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation cardiac catheterization with no intervention   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is an 85y/o lady with HTN, diastolic HF (EF 70%), severe AS (valve area 0.8cm2), CVA, and anemia who was admitted to [**Hospital6 17032**] two days ago for shortness of breath and is transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU due to CHF with respiratory failure.
Of note, she was admitted to the OSH twice last month due to CHF exacerbations.
She had been doing fine at rehab until [**2192-3-28**] when she went for a doctor's appointment and got acutely short of breath - by the time she arrived at the OSH ED she had decreased level of consciousness and was intubated.
She had pulmonary edema as well as ?RLL infiltrate.
During her OSH stay, she was ruled out for acute MI, diuresed, and treated for CAP with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.
Leukocytosis reportedly decreased from 15 on admission to 5 on the day of transfer.
Left subclavian CVL was subsequently placed and CVP was [**2-23**], with decrease inurine output.
Upon OSH admission her Hct was 28, but today was 20 in the setting of the fluid boluses and she is reportedly guaiac negative.
Has not been complaining of chest pain.
She did have syncope in the past (incl.
Does get short of breath with ambulation, which has been her biggest complaint.

No pneumothorax detected.
Enlarged tapered pulmonary hilum raises the question of pulmonary hypertension.
There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.
There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
Probable small bilateral effusions.
ECHO ([**2192-3-31**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Pathology Crossmatch ([**2192-3-30**]): Ms [**Known lastname 1968**] has a new diagnosis of anti-E antibody.
Anti-E antibody is clinically significant and capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions.
Unable to scan the right carotid artery due to presence of central venous line.
40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
One vessel coronary artery disease of proximal LAD.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
Moderately elevated left sided filling pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is an 85y/o lady with HTN, diastolic HF (EF 70%), severe AS (valve area 0.8cm2), CVA, and anemia who was admitted to [**Hospital6 17032**] two days ago for shortness of breath and is transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU due to respiratory failure in the setting of CHF and PNA.
thought to be [**12-22**] aortic stenosis as well as PNA.
Precipitant of CHF is unclear (was ruled out for MI, not able to answer history questions about med/dietary compliance), but she has had multiple hospitalizations recently for CHF.
Sputum culture had no growth.
Due to aggressive diuresis, she developed a contraction alkalosis that inhibited her respiratory drive, so lasix drip was stopped.
# CHF: As above.
# HCAP: as above, pt thought to have PNA on transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
She became afebrile and her WBC count normalized.
She continued to have excessive secretions.
# severe AS: pt has normal EF on echo but severe AS, mild LVH, and pulm artery HTN.
likely severe AS has caused her recent multiple hosp admissions for acute CHF.
Pt had never had significant work up for AS because she had never been symptomatic other than mild chest pressure on exertion.
He thought was good percutaneous candidate due to underlying history of lung disease.
Consulted c-[**Doctor First Name **] to eval for op candidacy and obtained testing as requesting:  carotid US (result: Unable to scan the right carotid artery due to presence of central venous line.
# Altered mental status:  At baseline, per family, patient is functional, conversational and able to perform ADLs.
Held lisinopril and nifedipine in setting of normotension.
# Anemia, acute on chronic: Pt has a h/o anemia (Hct 28) and was stable on arrival to the OSH, but had a precipitous drop the day of transfer to Hct 20.
Etiology thought to be most likely hemodilution in the setting of IVF's initially.
No evidence of bleeding.
iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
This was likely [**12-22**] acute PNA and worsening of CHF.
INACTIVE ISSUES  #  h/o CVA: no obvious deficit.
