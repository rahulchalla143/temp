HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year-old female who presents with aortic stenosis.
Over the past year she has been having worsening symptoms of dyspnea on exertion.
She became short of breath after climbing one flight of stairs or walking two blocks on a flat surface.
She also had some lightheadedness when she was walking, but denied any syncope.
The last echocardiogram was in [**2120-1-9**], which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal wall motion and ejection fraction of 60% and a severely stenotic aortic valve with a mean gradient of 43 mmHg and a peak gradient of 65 mmHg.
Urinary frequency.
NECK:  Without carotid bruit.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with a systolic murmur.
EXTREMITIES: Palpable peripheral pulses with no varicosities.
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with nonobstructive coronaries and normal pulmonary artery pressures along with a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.
The following day she was taken to the operating room, where she had an aortic valve replacement with a tissue prosthetic valve.
The procedure was remarkable for a transfusion requirement of 5 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of fresh-frozen plasma and two units of platelets.
However, that evening, she became tachycardiac to a pulse rate of approximately 120 to 130.
The EKG at that time demonstrated a junctional tachycardia that was narrow complex in nature and very regular.
In addition, she started to have some bronchospasm that was secondary to the IV Lopressor and she may have also had an element of congestive heart failure.
On the afternoon of this dictation, a diabetes mellitus consultation was obtained as the patient has had some elevated blood sugars during this hospitalization and it could be that she has undiagnosed diabetes mellitus at which time she will likely be placed on an oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Aortic stenosis now status post tissue aortic valve replacement.
Previously undiagnosed adult onset diabetes mellitus.
