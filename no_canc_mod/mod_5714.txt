History of Present Illness: The patient is a 79 year old man with history of PVD, DM2, and recent osteomyelitis ([**2183-3-15**]) referred from [**Hospital3 **] for management of endocarditis and discitis.
He presented on [**2183-6-2**] with fever and pain in the inner aspect of his groin.
He also had pain in his back.
He had some pain in his mouth as well that was concerning of necrotic mandibular abscess.
Had concern for mild renal insufficiency on admission and had potential history of AIN induced by nafcillin so treated with vancomycin.
He remained afebrile until the night of [**2183-6-6**] at which time he spike to 101.
CT head had no mandibular mass.
On [**6-4**] he had MRI of the left ankle that showed subchondral marrow edema suggestive of osteomyelitis.
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] normal LVEF, marked concentric LVH and 1.1 cm mobile density on posterior leaflet of mitral valve with trace mitral insufficiency.
Also, his blood sugars were persistently low requiring holding of his lantus and a D10W infusion.
Past Medical History: PMH: DM Type II - insulin dependent glaucoma GERD bleeding peptic ulcer hx of MRSA bacteremia osteomyelitis of left foot due to poorly healing wound ([**10-21**] and [**2183-3-15**]) hypothyroidism Legally blind .
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Neck supple, no LAD, carotid bruit on right CV: RRR, nl s1, s2, 3/6 systolic murmur at apex radiates to axilla PULM: CTAB, no w/r/r with good air movement throughout ABD: soft, minimal tenderness to LLQ, ND, + BS, no HSM EXT: 1+ edema to ankles.
closed heal ulcer on left.
no sensory level alongs legs/torso to pinprick DTR: diminished throughout PSYCH: appropriate affect Skin: stage I sacral pressure ulcer.
CXR: The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.
There is no evidence of pneumonia or large amount of pleural effusion .
MRI Pelvis: : No fracture or dislocation is identified.
Degenerative changes are seen involving the right hip with a subchondral cyst noted within the right acetabular roof.
A joint effusion is not present.
No edema is seen within the greater trochanter to suggest greater trochanteric bursitis.
Diffuse high signal on T2-weighted imaging is seen involving the imaged muscles, particularly both iliopsoas muscles, and the subcutaneous tissues, compatible with diffuse edema.
Additionally, focal area of abnormal high signal on T2- weighted images is seen involving the origin of the right hamstring muscles, compatible with a partial tear.
There is diffuse fatty atrophy of the imaged muscles, particularly the gluteus muscles on the right.
No focal fluid collections to suggest an abscess are identified.
The patient's known osteomyelitis involving the superior lumbar spine is not imaged on the current examination.
The sacroiliac joints demonstrate small marginal osteophytes but otherwise are within normal limits.
A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder, which contains a small focus of air within the lumen.
There is small amount of ascites demonstrated within the pelvis.
Diffuse wall thickening is seen involving the rectum and sigmoid colon.
Small fat- containing bilateral inguinal hernias are present, with the left inguinal hernia containing a small amount of fluid.
The presence of contrast on this examination from [**2183-6-7**] suggests impaired excretion of gadolinium from the body.
Partial tear involving the origin of the right hamstring muscles.
Diffuse anasarca and small amount of ascites in the pelvis.
Wall thickening involving the sigmoid colon and rectum likely secondary to third spacing of fluid.
Diffuse muscular atrophy.
No evidence of osteomyelitis or abscess within the imaged portion of the pelvis .
Presence of intra-articular gadolinium on the pre-contrast sequences indicates retention and excretion of contrast which was administered for a previous MR examination on [**2183-6-9**].
Please note that the patient has had three MRIs with intravenous gadolinium in the span of three days (at 2 different institutions), and the presence of intra- articular gadolinium on the current study (and in the urinary bladder on the pre-contrast images from the previous study) suggests renal impairment and decreased clearance of gadolinium.
Correlation with patient's creatinine levels and consideration of dialysis is recommended.
No further MR examinations with gadolinium is recommended in the near future until the patient's renal function has been evaluated.
Periprosthetic fluid is seen surrounding the methyl methacrylate components, which is in continuity with the joint space, a nonspecific finding.
MRI cannot distinguish between edema related to post-surgical changes and edema related to infection.
No discrete abcess is identified.

Mild aortic stenosis is present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a large mass measuring (1.7cm x 2.6 cm) present on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve This mass is heterogeneous in appearance and can be seen to prolapse back and forth through the mitral annulus.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve has a normal structure with no evidence of any mass or vegetation present.
No mass or vegetation is visualized on the pulmonary valve.
Conclusions: Large mass on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve measuring (2.6 x 1.7cm) which is likely a vegetation with mild (+1) mitral regurgitation.
No other vegetations or abscesses seen.

No evidence of deep venous thrombosis identified.
Brief Hospital Course: # Endocarditis: The patient has valvular mass with typical bacteria ([**Month/Day/Year 8974**]) for infective endocarditis and a potential source of bacteremia could be prior left ankle osteomyelitis.
He was without significant conduction defect compared to priors.
He was without sign of significant valvular compromise or respiratory distress.
He underwent an MRI of his pelvis and right knee as he was complaining of some pain in that area looking for further sites of hematogenous spread which was negative.
# Renal failure: consistent with AIN as he had WBC casts in his urine.
Has not responded well to fluid or albumin.
# Elevated INR: Likely from multiple sources including liver disease, poor nutrition, and possibly low level DIC as per DIC labs.
He was given vit K with little effect though the INR improved with time to 1.6 on the day before discharge.
# Peripheral vascular disease: appears to have adequate macrovascular flow to feet as gauged by peripheral pulses.
# Anemia: he had evidence of chronic inflammation, renal disease, liver disease, and hemolysis during his stay to account for his anemia.
He will need a CBC drawn biweekly and will need transfusions for symptoms or HCT < 23.
Minimal EtOH history, no other known liver history.
There was also a singular nodule which was consistent with HCC per radiographic studies as above.
Liver was consulted and recommended further outpatient workup with possible biopsy and RFA.
Hep serologies negative.
He had moderate ascites.
# decubitus ulcer: wound care involved.
His diet was limited by subjective satiety, pain with sitting up, and difficulty eating when not sitting up.
He should be pretreated for pain before being sat up for meals.
# heel osteomyelitis: likely source of his endocarditis.
# hamstring tear: likely majority of his leg pain.
He was given pain control: lidocaine patch, fentanyl patch, dilaudid PO and IV.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: He was maintained on SSI with humalog as well as 10 units glargine qhs.
# Hypothyroidism: - continued on home dose thyroxine .
