Admission Date: [**2129-5-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2129-6-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-2-22**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]  Patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of asthma, who was previously hospitalized for severe respiratory distress requiring intubation.
[**Hospital **] hospital course was prolonged complicated by congestive heart failure and MRSA pneumonia.
Patient had a prolonged wean from the ventilator at the time requiring a tracheostomy.
Patient was eventually decannulated and was discharged to home when he represented in [**2129-2-20**] with respiratory distress again requiring intubation.
On bronchoscopy at that time he was found to have significant subglottic stenosis and a trach tube was placed.
Again, his hospital course was complicated by MRSA respiratory infection as well as GI bleeding and non-ST- elevation myocardial infarction.
At that time he underwent cardiac catheterization revealing nonsignificant coronary artery disease and no lesions requiring intervention.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] and evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for the subglottic stenosis.
He is found to have a near complete obstruction of his upper airway at the level of first and second tracheal ring with some degree of involvement of the anterior coracoid on rigid bronchoscopy.
On flexible bronchoscopy, he was found to have no disease at the stomal site or distally.
Coronary artery disease status post non-ST-elevation    myocardial infarction.
Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES:  Patient reports no known drug allergies.
Thin male, who appears quite healthy and not in no apparent distress at the time of examination with trach mask collar with humidified air.
Cervical examination reveals no supraclavicular or cervical adenopathy.
S1, S2 without murmurs.
Thorax is symmetrical without lesions or masses.
Extremities shows no clubbing or edema.
CT scan from [**2129-4-21**] shows a subglottic stenosis at the level of the anterior coracoid down to approximately [**2-22**] tracheal rings.
Patient presented to the OR on [**2129-5-25**] for elective resection of his subglottic stenosis and reconstruction of airway.
On postoperative day seven, patient underwent a bronchoscopy for evaluation of his surgical site.
Patient's hypertension was controlled with his usual regimen while taken at home, and did require a slight adjustment with increase in Lopressor to 50 mg p.o.
Subglottic tracheal stenosis.
Status post resection of the stenosis and airway    reconstruction.
Coronary artery disease.
Diabetes type 2.
