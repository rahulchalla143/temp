Early or partial obstruction cannot be excluded and could be further evaluated on CT as clinically warranted.
[**2144-5-24**]: chest x-ray:   IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, but no focal consolidation.
No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragm.
[**2144-5-25**]: Echo:  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation.
Based on [**2139**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
[**2144-5-25**]: cat scan of the abdomen:    IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for distal ileal inflammation,perforation, and ischemia.
[**2144-5-28**]: Echo:  Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
No tricuspid regurgitation.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2144-5-29**]: x-ray of the abdomen:   Stacked dilated loops of small bowel with distal air seen in the colon and rectum may be postoperative ileus but concerning for partial or evolving small-bowel obstruction is also considered.
[**2144-5-29**]:  chest x-ray:  IMPRESSION: Bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.
Small left effusion.
Minimal right pleural effusion.
Increased density at the left lung base consistent with worsening atelectasis or consolidation.
Brief Hospital Course:   49 year old gentleman admitted to the acute care service with abdominal pain and fever.
Upon admission, he was found to be hypotensive, tachycardic and neutropenic.
He was emergently taken to the operating room where he was found to have a perforated terminal ileum.
He also had placment of a right sided abdominal drain.
He required blood products ,crystalloid, and pressors  for maintainence of his blood pressure.
He was transported to the intensive care unit after his surgery for monitoring where he was hypotensive and tachycardic.
He also had blood cultures drawn which showed GPR's and recommendations were made for vancomycin, meropenum, and micafungin.
His post-operative pain was managed with dilaudid PCA.
He did continue to have episodes of tachycardia and underwent a TEE which showed no valvular vegatation and an LVEF >55%.
He has not resumed his daily home dose of insulin because of his tenuous GI status but his blood sugars have been closely monitored.
