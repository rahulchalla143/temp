Admission Date:  [**2159-7-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-7-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-6-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: vancomycin  Attending:[**Known firstname 922**] Chief Complaint: Endocarditis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2159-7-2**] AVR (25 mm On-X mechanical)/ flex cystoscopy  History of Present Illness: 54 year old male with Asperger's syndrome was noted to have a murmur at his [**Hospital 3390**] clinic visit in the Spring of [**2158**].
An echocardiogram revealed vegetation on the aortic and mitral valves in the setting of a positive UTI and a new diagnosis of a non functioning right kidney.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-3-9**] with aortic valve staph epidermidis endocarditis with [**2-9**] + aortic insufficiency without evidence of CHF.
It was thought that his endocarditis was most likely from a urologic source.
He currently denies fatigue or other complaints.
Past Medical History: Asperger syndrome Endocarditis with significant aortic insufficiency Atrophic non functioning right kidney, s/p Right laparoscopic nephrectomy, ureterectomy on [**2159-5-7**] Hx of UTI's - [**2159-3-9**] grew coagulase negative staph in [**5-14**] bottles, Staph epidermitis was cultured from  his urine Hypospadias Urethral stricture disease s/p dilation [**2159-4-17**] Bilateral ureteral reflux Inguinal hernia Hydrocele [**11-8**]: scrotal hernia repair [**2142**]: urethral blockage release VRE  Social History: Patient is single.
He was previously living with his father prior to his admission for endocarditis.

No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
Aortic leaflet prolapse is present, most notably of the non-coronary cusp.
There are moderate-sized vegetations on each of the three aortic valve leaflets.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is holodiastolic flow reversal seen the in the distal descending thoracic aorta.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a focal thickening of the mid anterior mitral leaflet that may represent healed scar from prior vegetation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is new segmental wall motion abnormality noted in the inferior wall.
The inferior wall hypokinesis and the global systolic function improves gradually with time.
Wall thicknesses measure approximately 1.6cm, representing moderate concentric hypertrophy.
There appears to be a small sewing ring leak in the area between anatomical left and non-coronary cusps, but it is not well seen in all views.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
[**2159-7-10**] CXR: Low lung volumes without focal radiopacity suggestive of pneumonia.
Moderate cardiomegaly stable from prior exam.
No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
His operative course was complicated by a difficult Foley insertion for which the GU service was called and performed a cystoscopy for Foley placement (see operative note for details).
Within 24 hours, sedation was weaned off and he awoke neurologically intact and was weaned from the vent and extubated without difficulty.
Also on post-op day one he was found to have a right groin pseudoaneurysm and was given a thrombin injection.
Infectious disease was consulted for gm + cocci in aortic valve tissue in OR and he was treated with Daptomycin due to vanco allergy.
On post-op day two he was noted to have a high degree heart block on his routine EKG.
On post-op day three he developed post-op afib/flutter and was started on oral amiodarone and his Lopressor was discontinued per his Atrius cardiologist (and with Dr.[**Name (NI) 9379**] approval).
On post-op day five he developed frequent [**3-14**] second pauses while on Amiodarone.
A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed via right IJ and EP was consulted for possible permanent pacemaker placement if heart rhythm didn't improve.
Coumadin was stopped and Heparin started for anticoagulation pending possible need for pacemaker.
Following the procedure he was brought back to the CVICU where he remained for one day for observation and on the following day he was transferred back to the step-down floor for further care.
Finally, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will make recommendation during outpatient visit whether to restart amiodarone or perform cardioversion.
