Admission Date:  [**2113-4-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2113-5-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2077-9-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**] Chief Complaint: cardiac arrest, seizure   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - none   History of Present Illness: 35 y/o female with hx of HCV s/p recent bowel perforation 1 month ago surrounding a complicated ERCP presents s/p report of cardiac arrest and seizures.
The patient has been feeling lethargic for the last several days, and today was found by her sister to be "shaking" on the couch with seizure like activity, clenching her jaw with staring and rigid posturing.
Her sister called the neighbor over who is an MA, and no pulse could be palpated so CPR was intiated and 911 was called.
During this time, patient started to have seizues with bladder incontinence.
Patient was intubated and given fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, diazepam, and propfol without resolution of her seizures.
EKG at the OSH showed sinus tachycardia to 133, normal axis, normal intervals, flattened TW in AvL and V1 with good R wave progression in the anterior leads.
Surgery rec'd a CT A/P which showed stable positioning of patient's perc drain with minimal resolution of prior fluid collection and no evidence of new collections or abscesses.
Neuro rec'd to continue the cooling protocol with EEG, check dilantin level and continue 100mg q8hrs, obtain LP to eval for infectious source of fevers and seizure, and to consider loading with Keppra or start midazolam drip if continued seizures.
LP was done which showed no evidence of infection.
EKG showed shivering artifact but evidence was ventricular bigeminy and sinus waves.
No troponins were present at time of ICU admission.
Cooling protocal initaited at 0350 hrs with temperature prob in foley and rectum.
Rectal and bladder temperature probes were affirmed by patient's nurse.

IMAGING: [**2113-4-26**]   Radiology MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST: No evidence of intracranial mass, infarction, or infectious process.
Acute-on-chronic inflammatory disease in the left sphenoid air cell; correlate clinically.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2113-4-21**]   Neurophysiology EEG   [**2113-4-21**]: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of the presence of a few isolated paroxysmal potential epileptiform transients in the left central region.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum and the inferolateral wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2113-4-20**]   Neurophysiology EEG   [**2113-4-20**]:  This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of the presence of a diffuse severe encephalopathy.
While the frequencies are in a range that would suggest reasonable brain activity there continues to be a reverse anterior posterior gradient.
It is necessary to monitor this to see if it evolves into and alpha coma pattern.
There also exists multifocal and independent appearing interictal sharp transients.
Near the end of the record there appeared to be some variability to the background suggesting some cyclic behavior.
[**2113-4-19**]   Radiology CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: No acute intracranial pathology.
Mucus-retention cyst with aerosolized secretions within the left sphenoid air cell, with inflammatory changes in the anterior ethmoidal air cells; correlate clinically.
[**2113-4-19**]   Radiology CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO:Residual rim-enhancing fluid collection in the right posterior perirenal and pararenal spaces, slightly smaller since [**2113-4-6**].
No new fluid collections.
[**2113-4-19**]   Neurophysiology EEG   [**2113-4-19**]:This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of a severe diffuse encephalopathy with some multifocal interictal epileptic features.
Additionally, there were short runs of semi- rhythmic activity which may represent brief abortive seizure discharges.
Brief Hospital Course: 35 y/o female with Hep C and recent bowel/biliary perforation s/p ERCP with drain in place who presents s/p reported cardiac arrest with ROSC after 2 shocks in addition to seizure activity and clinical pararamaters consistent with sepsis.
# Possible VF/VT arrest:  Pt was initially brought to OSH s/p reported cardiac arrest.
[**Name2 (NI) **] report, she had seizures prior to the arrest and was found with loss of pulse with shockable rhythm.
Initial TTE showed EF 35-40% with moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction in a non-coronary distribution.
#Sepsis:  On admission to MICU, pt met SIRS criteria with fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia and also had elevated lactate.
Concern was high for GI source of infection given recent history of bowel perforation.
Four sets of blood cultures from [**2113-4-19**] grew staph epi and coag neg staph (not sensitive to oxacillin).
Her JP drain was sent for culture and grew pseudomonas sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
Patient had mild increase in WBC and transaminitis during day 11 of hospitalization while on vancomycin and ceftazidime.
Patient was asymptomatic during this period and remained afebrile.
See below for abdominal abcess.
# Seizure - No history of seizures in the past.
There was no evidence of IC mass/process on stat head CT. Lumbar puncture showed no growth in CSF fluid.
# Bowel perforation - Etiology was due to duodenal perforation after ERCP.
CT A/P in the ED showed drain in appropriate place and no new evidence for abdominal catastrophe.
She was kept on vanc/zosyn initially and switched to vanc/cipro when JP drain culture grew pseudomonas sensitive to cipro.
Repeat CT of the abdomen showed only slight decrease in the size of the abdominal fluid collection.
The patient refused to stay in the hospital for this procedure even after explaining her the high risk for spreading of the infection, her becoming septic again and potentially dying from this.
# Hep C - last month VL at 72,762 IU/mL.
# Diarrhea: After extubation, pt developed diarrhea associated with profound electrolyte abnormalities that required frequent monitoring and repletion.
Diarrhea may have been due to narcotic withdrawal.
She was continued on her home dilaudid for chronic abdominal pain.
?s diarrhea resolved on its own 4 days after being on the floor and patient remained asymptomatic off of loperamide.
She appeared quite depressed with flat affect, had issues with polydipsia (drinking liters of water daily), and had anorexia.
Psych was consulted who did not think she was at acute risk of harming herself and her anorexia in the ICU was most likely appetite related.
Patient was initially maintained on a 1.5L fluid restriction but given well-compensated kidneys and normonatremia, the fluid restriction was lifted with no issues.
Disp:*90 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0* 3. zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: - Cardiac Arrest - Seizure - Intra-abdominal abscess - Bacteremia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because your heart stopped and had a seizure.
You did not have any further seizures during your hospitalization.
Initial image of your heart showed slowing of activities but that was in the setting of you going through cooling for your seizures.
You also had blood cultures which showed a bacteria in your blood.
You were also found to have an infection in your stomach from your prior intestine performation.
You were given antibiotics for the infection and you finished that course on [**5-9**].
You had a repeat CAT scan of your stomach which showed that the infection was not completely gone.
