HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female, with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, atrial tachycardia, hypothyroidism, status post DDD pacer placement in [**2106-2-13**] after being admitted for palpitations and syncope, and a question of calcium channel induced bradycardia.
The patient's thyroid supplementation was decreased from 75 to 50 mcg po qd after she was observed to have several runs of atrial tachycardia.
The patient now presents with progressive weakness.
The patient denies any change in appetite.
The patient also reports nonproductive cough x three days.
The family states that the patient has been more confused with worsening in her short and long-term memory.
It seems like changes of confusion and memory have taken place over the last several months.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient complains of right-sided headache consistent with her trigeminal neuralgia, history of diplopia but no current diplopia, no dysphagia, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, GU symptoms, diarrhea or constipation, lower extremity pain, or swelling.
No known weight change.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Extremities - no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.006, otherwise normal.
STUDIES:  Left hip film showed no fracture or dislocation.
Chest x-ray - a questionable left lower lobe atelectasis.
Echocardiogram from [**2106-2-25**] showed an EF of greater than 75%, normal right ventricular size and free wall motion, moderate MR, mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
EKG - normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, normal axis, atrially paced, no ST or T wave changes, no Q waves, unchanged.
1) FAILURE TO THRIVE:  Of note, the patient's labs were notable with greatly elevated TSH.
The patient did report feeling cold, although there has been no clear appetite change or weight change.
The patient's elevated TSH and low-normal free T4 may account for her symptoms.
In terms of infectious sources, the patient never had any fever or white blood cell count.
There were no other new medications that could explain these changes.
Finally, it is possible that the patient has some progressive dementia, likely Alzheimer's or [**Last Name (un) 309**] body, as it seems that her confusion and memory lapses may have preceded the change in the thyroid medication.
2) CARDIOVASCULAR:  As already noted, the patient has not complained of any palpitations or presyncope.
Given the increase in her dose of levothyroxine, the patient will need to be monitored closely for atrial tachyarrhythmias.
Given a gradual decline in cognitive status prior to her recent worsening, family was considering permanent [**Hospital1 1501**] placement.
If these has normalized and the patient continues to have symptoms of confusion, low energy, memory loss, she will likely need to be worked-up for a dementia.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) Hypothyroidism with subtherapeutic thyroid supplementation.
2) Failure to thrive.
4) Atrial arrhythmias, status post pacer placement.
