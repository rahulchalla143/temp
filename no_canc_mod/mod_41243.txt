No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with preserved regional and global LV systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Dilated and hypokinetic RV with at least moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Massive biatrial enlargement.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 yo F with panhypopituitarism, diastolic CHF, obesity-hypoventilation and OSA recurrently admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, admitted for the same.
The patient has a history of multiple and recent admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
On the day of admission, the patient presented to the ED with weakness, headache and respiratory distress.
She was noted to develop profound shortness of breath and desaturated to the 60's% while in the ED with ambulation to the bathroom.
Due to desaturation to 76% with respiratory rate = of 33 and findings of hypercarbia to pCO2 76, the patient was intubated by fiberoptic bronchoscope.
She received vancomycin, zosyn for a possible pulmonary infiltrate and pulse dose solumedrol out of concern for a COPD exacerbation.
The patient was noted to have stable massive cardiomegaly on CXR with possible volume overload.
UA was noteworthy only for some blood in the setting of foley placement and blood and urine cultures were sent and without significant growth.
Head and chest CT without contrast were largely unremarkable with some bibasilar atelectasis and an ill-defined lingular opacity.
Echocardiogram confirmed severe right heart failure with associated mitral and tricuspid regurg.
The patient had received 2L NS and diuretics were held in the setting of hypotension (see below).
The most likely explanation (as described in a note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] for her decompensation was hypoxemia prior to admission causing worsening pulmonary hypertension and RV pressure increase causing interventricular septal deviation and compromised LV function.
Declining cardiac function with poor forward flow precipitated acute renal failure.
Given the complex nature of her apnea including a likely component of central apnea, the thoracic surgery team was not certain that trach would improve the patient's respiratory status any more than CPAP.
The patient was scheduled for short-term outpatient pulm follow-up for further evaluation of her problems and for further consideration on the utility of a trach.
The patient was noted in the ED, around the time of respiratory decompensation, to develop sinus bradycardia to 36 (confirmed on EKG) and hypotension to 70/60.
Out of concern for pulmonary or other source of sepsis, the patient received doses of vancomycin and zosyn though these treatments were not continued after the first 2 days of hospitalization.
Subsequent telemetry monitoring revealed no further bradycardic episodes.
It is possible that this represented a medication effect in the setting of renal failure or a vasovagal response to a primary pulmonary process.
There are no signs that this was due to sepsis or adrenal insufficiency though the patient did transiently receive treatment for both of these potential etiologies.
She did not have signs of obvious volume overload and improved with holding diuretics and volume rescucitation for unclear reasons.
Acute renal failure with a Cr of 4.3 was noted on admission.
Renal ultrasound was negative for hydronephrosis.
UA was noteworthy for RBC's in the setting of foley placement.
Diuretics and [**Last Name (un) **] were held in the setting of acute renal failure and re-instituted prior to discharge.
The patient continued on treatment for panhypopituitarism with steroids (initially stress dose, then maintenance), levothyroxine and desmopressin.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Americare at Home Inc  Discharge Diagnosis: Multi-factorial hypercarbic respiratory failure .
Complex apnea Obesity-hypoventilation Diastolic heart failure Panhypopituitarism   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath and required a breathing machine while in the hospital.
This was likely due to multiple problems including your history of apnea, hypoventilation and right-sided heart failure.
At this appointment you should discuss further treatment of your problems including possible tracheostomy.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital for any new or worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches, fatigue or any other concerning symptoms.
