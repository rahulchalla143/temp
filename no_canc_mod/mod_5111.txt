Admission Date:  [**2141-12-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2141-12-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2071-10-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 7-year-old female with known coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of a stent to the left anterior descending as recently as [**Month (only) 359**] of this year who presented with four to five pounds of typical chest discomfort and low level exertion consistent with new onset and unstable angina.
The patient has a past medical history significant for a retinopathy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, has no history of transient ischemic attack,no history of stroke, Gastrointestinal bleeding.
She has hyperlipidemia and has known coronary artery disease as previously stated.
No history of myocardial infarction is present.
Electrocardiogram on admission showed no acute changes.
Left ventriculography showed a mitral regurgitation with left ventricular ejection fraction to be "normal."
There was a right heart dominant circulation with left main coronary artery disease within normal however, there was 90% in-stent restenosis in the proximal left anterior descending.
Given the aggressive in-stent restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending in a diabetic female with a right coronary artery lesion the recommendation was to go forward with coronary artery bypass grafting.
The patient has no known drug history, no history of dye allergy.
Heart was regular, no murmur.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally.
She underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two including Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and a right saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery, posterior descending.
She was afebrile throughout her hospital course.
Blood pressure was however, hypertensive on postop day three she reached systolics of 200/palp which was able to precipitate chest discomfort, chest pressures, electrocardiogram done at this time shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-T segment changes.
Additionally she has chest x-ray that showed bilateral apical pneumothoraces that were stable from previous x-ray seen after chest tube removal.
Cardiac was stable with no drainage.
There were crackles at the basis.
Intact, well approximate, no evidence of erythema or exudate.
Significant and aggressive in-stent restenosis, 80%     distal or mid-right coronary artery lesion status post     Coronary artery bypass graft times two,     Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending     and right saphenous vein graft to posterior tibial     artery.
