Admission Date:  [**2166-10-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-10-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2097-10-24**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CT Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old male with a history of depression, bursitis and hypercholesterolemia, who began noticing exertional dyspnea approximately three months ago.
At that time, he had had an echocardiogram that showed a flail posterior segment of the mitral valve as well as severe mitral regurgitation.
He had a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 50%, a wedge pressure of 26 and a pulmonary artery pressure of 53/31.
Given the patient's symptoms and severity of the flail segment, he was therefore slated a quadrangular resection of the posterior leaflet valve and repair with annuloplasty.
A chest x-ray was negative for any acute cardiopulmonary process.
The patient was noted to have good biventricular function postoperatively by transthoracic echocardiogram as well as only a small trace of mitral regurgitation with the new valve.
By postoperative day number four, the patient was noted to be ambulating freely without assistance.
His pain was well controlled.
A chest x-ray status post discontinuation of chest tubes showed no evidence of pneumothorax, well expanded lungs, some basilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
This was held for persistently labile blood pressure.
On discharge physical examination, he was in no acute distress.
He was afebrile with a maximum temperature of 98.5, blood pressure 117/60, pulse 80s to 90s, he was atrially paced at that time, and fingerstick was 132.
His wound sites were clean, dry and intact without erythema or exudate.
His lungs were clear except for decreased sounds at the left base, no crackles.
Lower extremities were warm and well perfused with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Severe mitral regurgitation with flail posterior segment, status post mitral valve posterior segment repair with annuloplasty.
