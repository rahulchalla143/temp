Admission Date:  [**2173-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-8-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2139-9-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**] Chief Complaint: pancreatitis, hypercalcemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 33yo previously healthy female presents from OSH with severe hypercalcemia, acute pancreatitis who is now POD #0 s/p C-section delivery of healthy male.
She reports that she has had ongoing mid-low back pain x several months which became worse over the past few days.
She also noted increasing epigastric pain associated with nausea and vomiting at home over the past 1-2 days.
She reports that the pain became so severe ([**10-6**]) overnight that she went to the local ED for further evaluation.
At the OSH ED, initial labs revealed significantly elevated WBC count with neutrophils near 90% (no bands); she was afebrile.
Further noted was a serum calcium level of 18.5 and elevated pancreatic enzymes as outlined below.
She denies RUQ pain currently nor colicky pain in the past and is w/o h/o gallstones.
She reports severe "heartburn" during her pregnancy for which she's been taking 15+ tums daily (finishes an entire bottle approximately every 1-2wks).
She has also been taking daily prenatal vitamin daily, but denies any additional prescription nor OTC medications.
In the ED at OSH, she was evaluated by Ob/gyn who found nonreassuring fetal heart tones on monitoring.
Per record it appears she was placed on tums prn despite her critically elevated calcium and received a one time dose this morning.
OSH CXR:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**7-29**] head CT: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Peripancreatic edema and mild enlargement of the pancreas, consistent with pancreatitis.
Complications of pancreatitis unable to be evaluated on noncontrast scan.
Extensive free fluid and mesenteric edema, likely due to both pancreatitis as well as postoperative/postpartum condition.
Findings compatible with non-complicated pancreatitis, not significantly changed from prior, however the administration of contrast allows visualization of a homogeneous, non-necrotic pancreatic parenchyma and no significant pseudocyst formation or other related complication.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Post-partum uterus with internal fluid and debris, in keeping with recent C-section.
2+ (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
MODERATE GROWTH.
sputum [**8-1**], [**8-2**] and [**8-3**]: 1+ yeasts [**2173-8-1**] SWAB abd incision: 1+ PMNs, no org   Brief Hospital Course: 33yoF presented to OSH with severe abdominal and back pain, found to have acute pancreatitis and severe hypercalemia, presenting POD 0 s/p cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal heart tones, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further management.
Course complicated by agitation and worsening respiratory distress.
Pancreatitis:  Given her significantly elevated calcium on admission with report of significant Tums intake, this was felt to be the likely cause of her pancreatitis.
Her triglycerides were elevated but not markedly so (488 at OSH, 273 here) and seems less likely cause of her pancreatitis.
CT abd/pelvis was obtained which showed evidence of pancreatitis - fat stranding and free fluid in abd.
also small amount of intra-abd free air c/w post-op, and lung base atelectasis and effusions.
-she clinically improved, was ultimately transferred to the regular medical floor, with resolution of abdominal pain, and tolerating a regular diet.
Respiratory distress: Patient failed pressure support trial on [**7-30**], with agitation and frequent desats to the 80s.
CXR on [**7-30**] suggested increased pulmonary edema v. ARDS.
-she did have some residual hoarsness most likely due to intubation which should continue to improve.
Agitation: on [**7-29**] the patient became increasingly tachypneic, tachycardic, and hypertensive with evidence of desaturation secondary to agitation.
Pt was intubated for control of airway, and exhibited agitation in waxing/ [**Doctor Last Name 688**] pattern on both propofol and versed/fentanyl for sedation.
She was then transitioned to PRN haldol with an appropriate response.
Leukocytosis: She had an elevated wbc count on admission and was pan-cultured with all cultures negative to date as of this dictation.
Due to pancreatitis and respiratory failure, she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics for a 7 day course.
The patient defervesced in the ICU and has remained afebrile for the rest of the hospitalization.
There is no sign of infection at the incision site.
PTH here is 7 (low) and thus would suggest not primary hyperparathyroidism as etiology of her hypercalcemia.
Given excessive use of tums, may very likely represent milk alkali syndrome and exogenous source would decrease PTH production.
Did have triad of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and metabolic alkalosis (albeit mild w/ upper end nml HCO3 of 30 on presentation to OSH).
Other possibilities include malignancy and PTHrp, sarcoidosis, hypervitaminosis D, but given clinical presentation and hx, these seem less likely.
Hypercalcemia has resolved on HD2 with IVF resuscitation .
Acute renal failure:  Creatinine elevated to 2.5 on presentation to OSH, now resolved to 1.0 on initial labs.
Likely prerenal given N/V and risk for 3rd spacing in setting of pancreatitis as well as probable diuresis with hypercalcemia as well as [**1-29**] to direct toxicity of calcium.
She was tolerating a regular diet and ambulating on her own without difficulty.
Medications on Admission: Tums Prenatal vitamin Adderal (d/c'd when found out she was pregnant)  Discharge Medications: none tylenol prn for pain  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Homehealth care VNA of [**State 1727**]  Discharge Diagnosis: acute pancreatitis hypercalcemia respiratory failure   Discharge Condition: improved, tolerating full diet, ambulating without difficulty   Discharge Instructions: seek medical attention if worsening symptoms of abdominal pain, fevers, concern about your surgical scar, or any other symptoms or concerns  Followup Instructions: follow up with your regular doctors [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-29**] weeks after returning home                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1672**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 1673**]  Completed by:[**2173-8-8**
