HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old right-handed male with a history of hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm of 3 cm to 4 cm, and polio in the past who was admitted on [**3-16**] after three hours of left-sided weakness.
At that time, he had no other complaints.
He was initially taken to [**Hospital6 2561**] where he had a head computed tomography and a magnetic resonance imaging.
The head computed tomography showed a dense hyperintensity in the right carotid as well as some areas of effacement in the right middle cerebral artery territory.
Initially, the right M1 and A1 segments were both occluded as well as the internal carotid on the right side.
However, after t-PA his symptoms significantly improved, and he was discharged to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
When he initially presented, the patient had significant anosognosia for his left-sided weakness.
History of abdominal aortic aneurysm of 3 cm to 4 cm.
ALLERGIES:  He has a questionable allergy to PENICILLIN in the past; although, at this time he reports no known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Neck examination revealed he had no carotid bruits.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremity examination revealed he had no edema.
Distal pulses were 4+, and no rashes.
Pupils were small, equal, round, and minimally reactive to light.
He had a left facial droop.
He had decreased tone as well in the left leg and proximal right arm.
Sensory examination revealed he had extensor movement to pain in the left arm, and the leg withdrew.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tobacco use who presented with a complete right coronary artery occlusion that was initially occluded in the right A1 and M1 divisions as well.
He received intraarterial t-PA approximately five hours after the onset of symptoms with improved flow in his intracerebral circulation.
His left-sided weakness also significantly improved throughout his hospital course.
His Intensive Care Unit course was also complicated by a urinary tract infection.
He also had a labile blood pressure initially.
He had a slightly decreased hematocrit.
However, he had a pelvic computed tomography which showed no evidence of hematoma, and his hematocrit stabilized without any need for a transfusion.
At that time, he was able to move his left distal hand and leg with full strength.
He also had [**3-17**] left deltoid and left triceps strength.
Some of his weakness he said was due to his old polio residual weakness.
Initially, after extubation, the patient denied that he had any problems with his left side.
He denied that he had suffered a stroke; however, as time progressed his anosognosia improved significantly, and he was able to say that he has been told that he had a stroke and recognized that his left side may have been a little weaker and that his left face did not look normal.
On the floor, he continued to be stable; however, he continued to have some difficulty swallowing thin liquids.
He had a bedside swallow evaluation which showed some evidence of aspiration with thin liquids.
He was to have a video swallow today, prior to discharge, and his swallowing issues will be further addressed prior to discharge.
Acute right coronary artery stenosis.
Right middle cerebral artery stroke.
Urinary tract infection.
PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION:  Procedures during this admission included intraarterial t-PA.
