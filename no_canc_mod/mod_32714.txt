Patient was than transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from the area hospital because of her multiple orthopedic injuries.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Dynamic interatrial septum.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Right proximal clavicular fracture.
Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Punctate hyperdense focus in the left temporal lobe which may represent hemmorhage or calcification.
Interval increase in hemoperitoneum, centered in the right paracolic gutter, without evidence of active extravasation at the time of the CT scan.
Multiple bilateral rib fractures, transverse processes fractures, pelvic and sacral fractures, right clavicle fracture and comminuted right humeral head fractures as described above.
Interval increase in presacral hematoma without definite evidence of active extravasation at the time of the scan.
Right adrenal gland hematoma.
Antral gastric wall thickening less pronounced on the current study.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Increasing right greater than left simple pleural effusions with resultant atelectasis.
Noncalcified pulmonary nodules, followup chest CT to document resolution or stability remains recommended in [**7-19**] months as suggested before.
Chest PA/lat 3/ IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-30**] through 28:  Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left, stable since [**5-3**].
Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
She was noted with dropping hematocrits and required several PRBC transfusions; the initial concern was that there may be a retroperitoneal bleed given right adrenal gland hematoma with small amount of retroperitoneal hemorrhage noted on CT imaging.
Neurosurgery consulted for a questionable subarachnoid hemorrhage; it was instead noted to be a hyperdensity in left temporal region and no neurosurgical intervention was warranted.
She was made non weight bearing for her right clavicle fracture and weight bearing as tolerated for her pelvic fractures.
Plastics was consulted for her acute right long trigger finger; no operative intervention was warranted at the time.
She was noted to have periods of rapid atrial fibrillation with hypotension and was bolused with 1.5 liters IVF and started on a Neo drip.
Prior to this she had been receiving Lopressor for tachycardia.
Because of her multiple orthopedic injuries she underwent IVC filter placement on [**2137-5-7**].
The procedure was without complications.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Motor vehicle crash Comminuted right clavicular fracture Comminuted impacted right humeral head fracture Multiple bilateral rib fractures L > R Multiple bilateral pelvic fractures: bilateral comminuted ischio-rami fracture, left anterior acetabular wall fracture, right superior ramus fracture Right pelvic hematoma Flexor tenosynovitis (Trigger finger) Atrial fibrillation Acute blood loss anemia  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, tolerating a regular diet, pain adequately controlled.
Followup Instructions: **Follow up with your primary care doctor for pulmonary nodules seen on CT imaging.
