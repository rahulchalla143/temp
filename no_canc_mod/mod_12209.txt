Admission Date:  [**2121-6-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2121-7-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2059-8-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and a history of a normal coronary catheterization five years ago, admission, when he had a presyncopal episode while standing.
He notes for the last few weeks he has had progressively worsening orthopnea, lower extremity edema and shortness of breath.
Family also notes he has had much increased stress at work.
to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
The patient then developed paroxysm of shortness of breath, as well as facial cyanosis, that increased when laying flat.
He developed profound respiratory distress and required intubation.
After intubation, he became hypotensive and was started on dopamine.
He had a CT angiogram that was negative for a pulmonary embolus.
The patient on x-ray and exam was found to be in congestive heart failure, and received 40 mg of intravenous Lasix with some diuresis and improvement in his hypoxia on the ventilator in the Emergency Department.
Hypertension 2.
Question mitral valve prolapse  ADMISSION MEDICATION:  The patient had previously been on atenolol which he discontinued due to inability to refill.
ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN  SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient drinks two martinis a day, denies any intravenous drug use, denies any blood transfusions.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother had a history of a myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure in her 80s and a sister with hypertension.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Exam is significant for extreme cyanosis of ears, cheeks and nose, as well as forehead.
Jugular venous distention to jaw.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
EXTREMITIES:  Cool, trace pulses, cyanotic toes.
Urinalysis with positive nitrites with greater than 300 protein and 4+ urobilinogen.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with an ETT and right IJ in place.
CT angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions.
Echocardiogram on admission - left atrium was mildly dilated, severe global LV hypokinesis, severe global RV free wall hypokinesis, no right to left shunt and ejection fraction of about 20.
Electrocardiogram - initial was atrial fibrillation at a rate of 158 with left axis deviation and T-wave inversions from V4 to V6.
Electrocardiogram on arrival to the floor was normal sinus with left axis deviation, left atrial enlargement, RSR prime pattern and T-wave inversions in V1 through V6.
The patient had his cardiac enzymes cycled and he ruled out for myocardial infarction.
PUMP FUNCTION:  The patient presented with severe congestive heart failure requiring intubation.
His ejection fraction was estimated to be 20% with severe hypokinesis on his echocardiogram and on his cardiac catheterization again his ejection fraction was estimated at about 25%.
The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter placed for his management of his congestive heart failure and required dopamine during part of his hospital stay.
He was on milrinone until the 23rd when it was weaned off without difficulty.
At one point, he was on digoxin for his heart failure and his atrial fibrillation.
His heart failure was thought likely to be secondary acutely to his atrial fibrillation.
C.  RHYTHM:  The patient was initially found in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and was cardioverted in the Emergency Department.
He then was in sinus rhythm initially on the floor and then went into atrial fibrillation again on the 19th with a rapid rate in the 150s.
He was placed on an amiodarone drip after receiving an amiodarone bolus and had multiple boluses due to refractory atrial fibrillation.
The patient will need cardioversion in four weeks for his atrial fibrillation.
PULMONARY:  The patient was initially found to be in acute pulmonary edema requiring intubation.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  On admission, the patient was found to have elevated transaminases, bilirubin and PT and INR.
He had hepatitis serologies sent which had positive hepatitis C antibody as well as positive hepatitis B surface antibody indicating previous immunization.
The patient had a hepatitis C viral load sent  prior to discharge which is unavailable at time of dictation.
He also had iron studies with an elevated ferritin, but all other values were within normal limits.
Hepatology service was consulted in regards to the patient's abnormal liver function tests and his positive hepatitis C serology.
He had further work up via laboratory studies, including hepatitis C viral load, hepatitis A antibody, AFB as well as genetic markers for hemachromatosis.
He also had a right abdominal ultrasound which showed a coarse nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
He had an elevated MCV and an elevated hematocrit.
His iron studies showed elevated ferritin, but all others were within normal limits.
RENAL:  The patient developed some acute renal failure in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
He was premedicated with Mucomyst and hydrated for his cardiac catheterization and on the day of discharge, his creatinine was 1.2.
RHEUMATOLOGY:  The patient two dysrhythmia prior to discharge, developed pain in his right big toe with some swelling and pain with flexion.
He has a history of gout and has responded well in the past to Indocin.
