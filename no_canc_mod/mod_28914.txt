Admission Date: [**2110-6-2**]        Discharge Date: [**2110-6-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-5-29**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NB  ID: [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 63430**] is a 6 day old term infant with presumed viral sepsis being discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU.
HISTORY:  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 63430**] is a 3545 gram product of a term gestation sent to the newborn intensive care unit for evaluation of sepsis risk manifested by postnatal fever.
The infant was delivered via cesarean section for failure to progress.
No sepsis risks factors.
There was no history of maternal herpes simplex virus or other illness.
A fine maculopapular rash was noted about the face and the trunk.
He did receive one normal saline bolus after    admission to the NICU for decreased perfusion with    improvement.
No murmurs have been heard.
He has been voiding    and stooling without difficulty.
A bilirubin was drawn on day of life 4,    with a total bili of 4.8 and a direct bili of 0.4.
Overall it was thought the thrombocytopenia was most    consistent with viral sepis.
There were toxic granulations in the    sample.
Lumbar puncture was performed, with CSF analysis    without pleocytosis.
The rash noted upon    admission to the NICU increased over the next 24 hours,    becoming a diffuse whole-body maculopapular rash, without    petechiae or vesicles.
The rash was thought to be most    consistent with enteroviral infection.
Of note, as the most    likely diagnosis was thought to be viral sepsis, liver    function tests were measured twice, and were within normal    limits.
2) Born between 32-35 weeks    with two of the following: day care during RSV season, a    smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway    abnormalities or school age siblings.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the    child's life, immunization against influenza is    recommended for household contacts and out of home    caregivers.
