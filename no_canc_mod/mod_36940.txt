Aortic arch calcifications are noted.
Given its somewhat linear appearance, atelectasis is an alternative etiology.
There are no pleural effusions and there is no pneumothorax.
No comparison studies.
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles are prominent, likely due to central atrophy.
There is moderate diffuse white matter hypodensity most likely representing chronic microvascular disease.
There is no evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate moderate ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening and mild bilateral right greater than left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.
There is no evidence of fracture.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities.
Extensive microangiopathic changes and central atrophy ============================================================ CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2193-1-5**] 10:16 AM  CHEST (PA & LAT)  Reason: ?
FINDINGS: There is an air-fluid level at the lower mediastinum compatible with a hiatal hernia.
There is no significant pulmonary consolidation.
There is some minimal left basilar atelectasis.
There is thoracic spinal degenerative discogenic disease.
===================================================== ECG: Sinus rhythm Borderline first degree A-V delay Left atrial abnormality Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes Since previous tracing of [**2192-1-26**], probably no significant change Discharge labs:     Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted to ICU on [**12-25**].
In ICU patient patient requiring 4-5liters oxygen, started on levaquin for pneumonia, given aggressive fluids for hypotension likely from dehydration/infection.
Levaquin changed to vancomycin and aztreonam on [**12-29**] with continued fever spikes and continued significant oxygen requirment.
Despite aggressive Rx for above issues, patient still appeared very dyspneic and hence CTA chest was done that revealed bilateral PE's.
In further w/u, pt was also found to have bilateral DVT's.
Incidental finding of pulmonary nodules see on CT chest - needs follow up.
CT abd/pelvis as part of malignancy w/u with non specific LAD.
Hypothyroidism - is on levothyroxine.
TSH significantly elevated and FT4 is low.
Hypertension - HCTZ, lisinopril, metoprolol continued after hypotension resolved.
Hyperlipidemia - on statin  Depression - on zoloft.
Acute Respiratory Failure 2.
Bacterial pneumonia 4.
Asthma with acute exacerbation 5.
Hypotension 7.
