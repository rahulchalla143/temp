Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 84M with h/o CVA, afib, h/o PE, recurrent aspiration PNA, recent admission for abdominal distension presenting from [**Hospital 7137**] with an O2 sat of 65%, HTN to 192/130, HR 150s.
He was placed on oxygen and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.
He was in mild respiratory distress, exam with rhonchi/wheezes similar to prior aspiration.
UA dirty, initial CXR not too impressive with mild pulmonary edema and a possible left lower lobe process.
Since arrival to the ED, he had a slow decline in his O2 sat.
For his vomiting the patient was given one dose of zofran and a repeat chest x-ray was performed that showed substantial incease in bilateral opacties and mild pulmonary edema.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation with RVR at a rate in the 150s with similar morphology to his baseline.
Review of systems is unobtainable secondary to baseline aphasia.
Past Medical History: CVA (L MCA hemorrhagic) with severe contractions, R weakness, aphasia, dementia Atrial fibrillation Diastolic dysfunction Osteoarthritis Pulmonary embolism s/p IVC filter Depression DM2 - not on medications Sick Sinus Syndrome s/p pacemaker Hypertension Chronic colonic pseudoobstruction Recurrent aspiration pneumonia - NPO with PEG tube UGI bleed - EGD deferred given goals of care discussion with HCP  "Reactive airways"   Social History: Lives at nursing home - [**Hospital3 2558**].
EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-16**], there may be slight decrease in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications, predominantly involving the mid and lower lung zones.
Single-channel pacemaker device remains in place and there is continued dilatation of gas-filled loops of bowel within the abdomen.
There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis.
Degenerative changes are seen in the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of pseudo-colonic obstruction as compared to multiple prior examinations.
Brief Hospital Course: 84M with h/o CVA, afib, h/o PE, recurrent aspiration PNA, recent admission for abdominal distension presenting from [**Hospital 7137**] with an O2 sat of 65%.
Respiratory Distress - Pt has history of aspiration as well as flash pulmonary edema.
The patient also had a witnessed aspiration event in the ED when BiPap was attempted.
The Initial CXR showed some evidence of left lower lobe process.
Must also consider PE given known history and subtherapeutic INR.
Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  In the MICU, he was initially on dilt gtt and transitioned to home beta-blocker, which was titrated up.
Chronic colonic pseudoobstruction:  He was continued on his home regimen including reglan.
Aspiration:  Pt has chronic aspiration.
Depression - Continue citalopram  #.
Gout - Continue allopurinol  CODE STATUS: DNR/[**Hospital 24351**] Hospice, no invasive or painful procedures, no escalation of care except for antibiotics, treating respiratory distress with morphine.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] prn constipation 6.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution 1 inhalation Q6H prn SOB  19.
Morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: 5-10 mg PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain or shortness of breath.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Secondary: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Acute renal failure Urinary tract infection Pulmonary embolus Hypertension Colonic pseudoobstruction Depression Gout   Discharge Condition: HR 90s-110s, SBP 100-110s, O2 sat 99% on NRB, aphasic   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for low oxygenation.
This is likely due to aspiration and fluid in the lungs.
Your heart medications were changed from metoprolol to diltiazem to improve control of your heart rate.
