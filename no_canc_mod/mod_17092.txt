A chest CT is recommended to evaluate for possible aortic aneurysm.
Patchy opacity involving the right mid and lower lungs could represent infection or aspiration.

Based on CXR, leukocytosis, exam, acute onset respiratory failure was likely due to aspiration pneumonia.
Course is suggestive of frank aspiration episode given his known h/o aspiration and the acute onset following a meal.
He was initially admitted to the MICU service intubated from an outside hospital following acute respiratory failure.
Sputum cultures later grew coagulase-positive staph aureus, and Vancomycin was continued until organism was reported as sensitive to oxacillin.
After a few days without improvement, he becamse hypotensive with good response to fluid boluses; however, his wife [**Name (NI) 382**] declined escalation of care, specifically including central access, bronchoscopy, or pressor support.
