Admission Date:  [**2151-2-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2151-2-25**]   Service:  ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Unresponsive episode.
Coronary artery disease 2.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old man who was brought to an outside hospital Emergency Department after he had an unresponsive episode of [**2-1**] minutes in duration.
The patient remained continent of both bladder and bowel, no chest pain, significant for shortness of breath.
EKG showed inferior changes and evidence of old myocardial infarction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was an elderly man in no acute distress.
Neck:  Supple, midline without masses or lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub or gallop.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended without masses or organomegaly, obese.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization, given outside hospital findings on the EKG consistent with a cardiac event.
Cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 35-40%, right dominant coronary artery system with severe left main and three-vessel disease.
There were also findings consistent with an acute inferolateral myocardial infarction and the patient was placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well without significant complication.
On postoperative day two in the early morning, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with a rapid response.
The patient converted back to normal sinus rhythm after approximately three hours of rate-controlled atrial fibrillation.
He did have a mild episode of confusion on postoperative day four before he was transferred out of the unit.
The patient was ultimately transferred to the floor on postoperative day four and had no significant events after that.
He was noted to have some serosanguinous drainage coming from his sternal wound, but this was assessed by both the fellow and the attending physician and felt to be relatively stable.
Ultimately, the patient was discharged on postoperative day 10 tolerating a regular diet and with adequate pain control, and having only minimal drainage from his sternal wound.
Physical examination on discharge, in general the patient was in no acute distress.
Chest:  Fine crackles at the bases.
There was some minimal serosanguinous drainage coming from his sternal wound, although his sternum was stable.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
The patient does have [**12-31**]+ edema improved slightly over his floor stay.
if drainage decreases appropriately.
