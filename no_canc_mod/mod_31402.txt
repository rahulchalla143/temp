Upon arrival to the ED, he remained minimally responsive and was intubated for airway protection.
A CXR demonstrated a questionable new opacity at the right base.
A U/A was suggestive of UTI, and he was covered broadly for both UTI and PNA with vancomycin, ceftazadime and levofloxacin.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2154-12-13**]  6:44:40 PM Sinus rhythm with borderline sinus tachycardia.
Brief pause - probably due to non-conducted atrial premature beat.
Borderline first degree A-V delay.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Mild increased opacification persists at the left base.
The cardiac silhouette remains somewhat enlarged and there is indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could be a manifestation of vascular congestion.
MICROBIOLOGY: C diff toxin +  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 87 yo man with recent stroke with persistent near-hemiplegia and PEG placement, DM2, CKD presents from NH with delirium, acute renal failure, ?
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Mr [**Known lastname 95403**] was intubated for airway protection and hypoxemia on arrival.
His x-ray was read as a possible right lower lobe pneumonia, and then evolved with perihilar opacities.
He was started on levofloxacin, ceftazidime and vancomycin to treat a healthcare-associated pneumonia (given recent nursing home residence) and possible UTI.
By the 12th (day [**2-4**]) his x-ray was no longer showing a clear opacity, but he remained ventilator dependent with copious oral and pulmonary secretions.
# C. difficile infection.
On the night before discharge, Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 95404**] was noted to have foul-smelling mucoid stool, and C. diff was sent.
This was likely caught very early in the infection, which was most likely secondary to C. diff regrowth soon after the discontinuation of his 14 day course of levo/ceftaz/vanco for pneumonia, which had likely depleted much of his normal flora.
# Altered mental status: He was lethargic and unresponsive on arrival.
His BUN was remarkably high (baseline at last d/c was 20), though he had no pericardial rub on exam.
Hypernatremia likely [**1-4**] volume depletion.
A CT head was negative for new processes although it did show an old pontine infarct.
A clear etiology was not identified since his infection and hypernatremia were both treated in the first days of his admission; his mental status appeared to clear somewhat although it was difficult to tell (particularly in the setting of requiring mechanical ventilation) what his baseline was and whether he had returned to it.
We would suggest low-dose Haldol if his agitation continues.
# Acute renal failure: Mr [**Last Name (Titles) 95405**] creatinine was quite elevated from baseline on arrival at 4.3, with a BUN of 120; we hydrated him aggressively and saw a progressive improvement in his creatinine over the next several days.
We judged the initial presentation of renal failure to be most likely secondary to volume depletion given BUN/Cr ratio and the strong possibility of falling behind on intake at the nursing home in the setting of an acute illness.
His creatinine rose again in the last three days of admission (to 2.4 on [**12-26**]) in the setting of gentle efforts at diuresis, with the hope of getting his pulmonary and peripheral edema to resolve.
# s/p CVA: Per neuro d/c summary, "at the time of discharge he could withdraw his right leg slightly, with plegia in the right arm and a right facial droop, as well as dysarthria.
He received a unit of packed red blood cells on [**12-14**] for a hematocrit of 21.4 which was dropping in the setting of aggressive hydration (a source of bleeding was not identified then or in retrospect).
# Dispo: To a rehabilitation facility with ventilator capacity .
