By this afternoon, the left eye swelling improved, but the right eye swelling and bruising worsened.
She also reports some increased confusion, mild worsening of his dysarthria, and increased lethargy.

Sensation: Intact to light touch and propioception  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin   Pertinent Results: [**2167-8-16**] 07:45AM BLOOD WBC-4.2 RBC-3.25* Hgb-9.7* Hct-27.9* MCV-86 MCH-29.8 MCHC-34.7 RDW-12.9 Plt Ct-277 [**2167-8-16**] 07:45AM BLOOD Glucose-99 UreaN-5* Creat-0.7 Na-138 K-3.8 Cl-101 HCO3-29 AnGap-12 [**2167-8-16**] 07:45AM BLOOD Calcium-9.4 Phos-4.9* Mg-2.0 Head CT [**2167-8-13**]: FINDINGS: Since most recent head CT examination, there has been significant interval change of low-density fluid with a fatty layer extraaxially adjacent to the craniotomy defect along the left frontoparietal region with the size of the more dense extra-axial collection adjacent to the cerebral cortex stable with exception to a small amount of new hemmorhage inferiorly.
Additionally, there is significantly more local mass effect and inherent parenchymal edema resulting in increased rightward subfalcine herniation of approximately 10 mm and complete obliteration of the suprasellar and ambient cisterns with new left uncal herniation.
Edema within the left occipital temporal region from known infarcts has not displayed any significant evolution.
No hydrocephalus.
Soft tissue swelling along the craniotomy site has increased with accumulation of low-density fluid.
Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumocephalus persists.
IMPRESSION: Significant interval increase in low-density extra-axial fluid collection with a fatty component along the left sided craniotomy defect with no significant change in the amount of hyperdense fluid immediately adjacent to the cortex.
A small amount of new extraxial hemmorhage may be present inferiorly.
Increased mass effect resulting in worsening rightward subfalcine herniation and obliteration of the ambient/suprasellar cisterns with new left uncal herniation.
Head CT [**2167-8-14**]:  FINDINGS: Compared to a prior CT examination there is no longer midline shift.
There has been interval re-expansion of the left lateral ventricles and there has been interval removal of the left-sided extraaxial fluid collection.
There is persistence of small linear areas of of hyper- and hypodensity layering along the left frontal convexity consistent with postsurgical changes.
There is no mass effect.
There is trace amount of air underlying the left craniotomy.
The areas of hypodensity within the left occipital temporal lobes appear unchanged compared to prior examination.
There are no new areas of hemorrhage.
There is no evidence for herniation.
There is mild mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus although the sinus air cells are clear.
There has been interval re-expansion of the left lateral ventricles.
There are no new areas of hemorrhage identified.
No herniation.
Stable appearance of left-sided temporal and occipital hypodensities consistent with subacute or chronic areas of infarction.
Head CT [**2167-8-16**]: There is no new hemorrhage, no new focus of edema, and there remains no significant shift of normally midline structures.
There is no change in appearance of left occipital and temporal hypodensities consistent with evolving infarction.
Mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus is not changed.
No evidence of interval hemorrhage or development of cerebral edema.
Unchanged appearance of craniotomies, left occipital and temporal hypodensities consistent with evolving infarction.
Head CT showed increased extra-axial fluid with 10mm MLS and subfalcine herniation.
On [**8-13**] pt [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a L craniotomy evacuation of epidural and subdural collection.
On physical exam, the patient remains somewhat confused but is oriented to person and year.
There is a slight amount of swelling in the pre-auricular region on the left side.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
