She became hypotensive and was briefly on neosynephrine, but weaned off.
During her stay, she fell from bed and fractured both her left hip and left humeral neck.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management, where she was found to be in respiratory distress and was quickly intubated for ventilatory support.
COPD (2lnc at home) 2.
HTN 4. hypothyroidism  Social History: Pt is a former smoker.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
## L hip [**6-22**]: Status post bipolar left hip hemiarthroplasty in anatomic alignment.
## L shoulder [**6-22**]: 1) Oblique fracture of the left humeral surgical neck with medial displacement of humeral shaft.
## CXR [**6-28**]: 1) Persisting right upper lobe opacity, which given the clinical history is likely consistent with a pneumonic infiltrate.
Although less likely, without prior films malignancy remains in the differential.
2) Bilateral pleural effusions, which allowing for differences in technique are not significantly changed.

)Respiratory failure -- Initially hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to copd, Mrs. [**Known lastname 62033**] had been extubated at the outside hospital.
The wean was aided by COPD tx (prednisone taper and scheduled albuterol/ipratropium MDI's) and gentle diuresis.
However, the patient failed her second extubation attempt despite a bipap bridge; her failure seemed most related to excessive respiratory fatigue, probably from a combination of volume overload and COPD.
At this point, in discussion with the family, it was decided the best course would be to perform a tracheostomy and have Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 62034**] be discharge to a rehab facility for prolonged rehabilitation and ventilator weaning.
Her AMS was initially due to sedative medications, but was also from ICU psychosis and her general ill-state.
She did, at admission, have a CT head that was negative for any acute pathology, such as bleed or mass effect.
Ortho evaluated Mrs. [**Known lastname 62033**] during this admission and said that due to her ill health and poor nutritional reserve, the left humerus should be immobilized in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8688**] brace, and that she was not an operative candidate.
This was converted to a fentanyl patch with sc hydromorphone as needed for breakthrough pain.
)Anemia -- Pt had hct drop following procedure, but no other obvious blood loss source; She was transfused one unit given h/o CAD.
Baseline anemia mainly related to blood loss into the hematoma and her ill state with its attendant marrow suppression.
)Guaiac positive stool -- No melena/hematochezia, this was only a one time finding.
