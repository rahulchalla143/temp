Admission Date:  [**2197-10-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-11-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-5-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ultram / IV Dye, Iodine Containing Contrast Media  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8263**] Chief Complaint: paraparesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: fusion Laminectomy Lumbar T9-S1 with instrumentation and allograft  History of Present Illness: 68 year old male with a PMH significant for polio (residual right lower extremity weakness and atropy), DMII (not on medications), HTN, diastolic HF with a preserved EF, CAD (described on CT) with angina symptoms relieved by SL nitro, who presented for evaluation for paraparesis since [**Month (only) **] of this year.
He was found to have severe central stenosis from T9-S1 and extensive spondylosis on recent MRI.
He underwent fusion Laminectomy Lumbar T9-S1 with instrumentation and allograft and was admitted to TSIUC for post operative care.
He was successfully extubated without issue on [**10-26**], but developed a new O2 requirement of 4L NC which he does not have at home.
He was tachycardic and hypertensive with SBPs to the 160s systolic, and HR ranging 90s-110s.
He has also had 2 episodes of CP with negative enzymes, relieved by SL nitro and no changes in his EKG.
To his recollection he has never had a heart attack, he has never had a stent placed, and never had a cardiac catheterization.
Currently patients complains of productive cough.
He is a chonic smoker and at baseline coughs every day however his cough has become more productive with clear/yellow sputum which he attributes to having stopped smoking since admission.
He reports having chest pain only during coughing.
Denies any pleuritic chest pain.
He has not noticed any changes in his lower extremity weakness of numbness since surgery.
Past Medical History: Diastolic Heart Failure with preserved EF - recently started on Lasix by his PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**10-16**] with LVH and preserved EF.
Hypertension c/b LVH CAD c/b angina, unknown history of MI, caths Type 2 DM BPH Polio H/O measels, mumps, whooping cough Hemorrhoids Cervical laminectomy and fusion Ulnar nerve decompression   Social History: He's from [**Hospital1 189**].
He has residual weakness on the right side from Polio and has been unable to ambulate on the left secondary to pain and spinal disease for which he was operated on this admission.

Bibasilar crackles and few scattered wheezes.
GI: soft, less distended, uncomfortable with palpation, tympanitic, no HSM, no guarding, +BS Ext: Somewhat cool extremities, faint PT pulses.
CNII-CNXII intact, Decreased motor strenght in bilateral legs.
Decreased sensation to light touch in bilateral legs.
Widespread bilateral heterogeneous opacities are compatible with mild pulmonary edema.
Right upper lobe atelectasis is improved.
Left lung atelectasis is stable.
No pneumothorax.
Mild pulmonary edema, similar to prior.
Improved right upper lobe atelectasis and stable left atelectasis.
CXR: [**2197-10-29**] Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are essentially unchanged since [**10-27**] but there is greater opacification in the left lower chest including more consolidation in the left lower lobe either atelectasis or pneumonia and increasing small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Status post anterior and posterior cervical fusion.
Multilevel degenerative disc disease throughout the thoracolumbar spine, status post posterior spinal fusion of the lower thoracolumbar spine.
Diffuse bone demineralization with no evidence for compression fracture.
Mild degenerative joint disease of the hips.
No evidence of fracture or malalignment.
Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old male history of polio, DMII, HTN, diastolic  CHF, CAD (described on CT) with angina symptoms, who underwent T9-S1 decompression and fusion transfered to medicine for evalaution of chest pain, tachycardia and new O2 requirement.
ACUTE: # Hypoxemia: This episode requiring persistent O2 requirement in the post-surgical period was felt to be multifactorial.
Patient has extensive history of smoking and CT chest prior to admission showed interstitial and empysematous changes suggesting possible COPD.
CXR, in combination with new cough, was consistent with pneumonia.
DDx also included acute on chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation given elaveted JVP, peripheral edema, few crackles on lung exam and finding of interstial edema on CXR.
Based on prior chest CT, there were no findings suggestive of maligancy.
Given his condition at the time of transfer, pleural effusion on x-ray, and restricted lung volumes, a V/Q scan was likely be of little utility.
# Chest pain: There was evidence of CAD on CT, as well as several coronary risk factors (HTN, HLD, DM, smoking history).
His pain was relieved with nitro.
However chest pain happens only with coughing suggesting upper respiratory tract inflammation.
There were no ischemic changes on EKG and troponins were negative.
He was continued on aspirin, lipitor and losartan and remained chest pain free throughout admission.
He had no change in his motor function during his hospital stay with persistent left > right sided lower extremity weakness.
TRANSITIONAL: # follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] in ortho on [**11-9**] at 10 am # titrate metformin for diabetes control # CT demonstrated breached screw through the superior endplate above the intervertebral disc of T9.
Nitroglycerin SL 0.4 mg SL PRN chest pain 10.
Spinal stenosis 2.
COPD Exacerbation 3.
You had been experiencing worsening lower leg weakness and numbness therefore you were admitted for elective spine surgery which went well.
After your surgery you continued to require oxygen most likely from variety of reason, including chronic lung disease from smoking, fluids in your lung as well as pneumonia.
Your symptoms continued to improve on antibiotics and with continued lasix.
