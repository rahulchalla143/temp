Diffuse ST-T wave changes which are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2131-10-27**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Chest x-ray [**12-28**] - No significant change since the prior examination.
Appearances are suggestive of mild CHF.
Chest x-ray [**12-31**] - IMPRESSION: Subsegmental atelectasis   Brief Hospital Course: # Dyspnea: Complicated picture likely multifactorial.
Patient not taking BiPAP at home, also patient with upper respiratory symptoms and sounds congested on exam.
Initially concern for COPD exacerbation in the MICU and recieved 1 dose of prednisone but this was stopped.
Also with chest x-ray there is some suggestion of mild CHF and patient has gotten one time doses of diuresis.
CXR demonstrated no active infection and no leukocytosis on admission.
repeat chest x-ray demonstrated no evidence of chf or infiltrate and mild bilateral atelectasis.
On discharge patient with stable oxygen requirement and appears at baseline level of comfort .
# Altered mental status: Unclear what initial presentation was in the MICU but on transfer to the floor, orientation at baseline.
Initial change in mental status may be secondary to hypercarbia in the setting of BiPAP non-compliance and multiple medications including oxycodone.
No white count or fever to suggest infection.
Avoided sedating medications for pain control.
# Neck pain: Pain is chronic and likely musculoskeletal vs. DJD changes.
CT C spine done on [**10-26**] as outpatient which  showed degenerative changes and limited study due to cervical  positioning in lateral film.
For pain control patient was started on round the clock tylenol as well as a lidoderm patch.

Patient eager to leave the hospital   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with increasing shortness of breath which was likely multifactorial and related to your obstructive sleep apnea and not taking BiPAP at home and as well your chronic lung disease.
Chest x-ray demonstrated no infiltrate to suggest pneumonia.
Also while you were in the hospital you were started on a medication called Lisinopril which is an ACE inhibitor and is helpful in patients with heart failure and high blood pressure to prevent furthur cardiac remodeling.
In addition, we discontinued your oxycodone as this was felt to be contributing to your sleepiness and altered mental status on presentation.
We started you on standing Tylenol, and a lidocaine patch which should be standing for your chronic neck pain.
You were also started on low dose tramadol which should be given as needed for pain control.
Additionally because of constipation we added some additional stool softeners to your regimen which may help.
