Admission Date:  [**2143-12-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2143-12-11**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was an 87 year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure and a known EF of 20%.
She presented with increasing back pain for several days that worsened two days prior to admission.
On the day prior to admission she had nausea and vomiting times two without coffee grounds or hematemesis.
However, she did have frequent dark tarry stools without diarrhea.
On the morning of admission she felt increasing dizzy and unsteady and was seen by her [**Hospital6 407**] who found the patient to be presyncopal with low blood pressure.
Nasogastric lavage showed minimal coffee grounds that had cleared with 60 cc.
She was given 5 mg of subcutaneous vitamin K and gentle hydration and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for chest pain.
She has chronic shortness of breath on exertion that is stable.
She denies any abdominal pain or rectal pain.
Coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2-/2143**], status post catheterization with three vessel disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent to the right coronary artery.
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 20 to 25%.
Chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia status post an AICD placement currently on Amiodarone.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on oxygen at home.
History of cerebrovascular accident.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.2.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  She is alert and oriented times three and in no acute distress.
Her neck is supple without JVD or lymphadenopathy.
She has normal S1 and S2 with a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border without radiation.
She has a palpable epigastric pulsatile mass without bruits.
ST segment elevations 1 mm in 2, 3 and AVF, she has biphasic T waves in V5 and 6 as well as 3 and F.  Poor R wave progression 1 through 4.
ST depressions of half to 1 mm in V5 and V6.
She eventually went for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy that was without evidence for a clear bleeding source, although the gastrointestinal service felt that an upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was the most likely etiology of her blood loss.
She was treated with proton pump inhibitor and transfused as needed to keep over 30 without recurrence of bleeding.
The patient continued to have atrial fibrillation and was reloaded on her Coumadin prior to discharge.
The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction during her Intensive Care Unit stay and was presumed to be secondary to the strain of aggressive fluid and her known congestive heart failure.
Aspirin was held throughout, because the process was not thought to be a plaque rupture and there was more concern for her bleeding then for a plaque rupture.
The patient did subsequently have serology that was positive for Helicobacter pylori and was treated appropriately.
