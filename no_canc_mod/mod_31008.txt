Admission Date:  [**2134-2-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2134-3-1**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old female with a past medical history of Parkinson's with dementia, stroke times two ([**2125**] and [**2133**] complicated by left hemiparesis, slurred speech, and dysphagia), as well as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, spinal stenosis, GERD, depression who was admitted from [**Hospital3 2558**] with fever and dyspnea times two days.
Per the patient's daughter, patient had increased "gurgling," increased hyperglycemia on finger stick blood glucoses, and anorexia secondary to increasing dysphagia.
Patient lacks cough reflex secondary to remote strokes and so did not have any productive cough, but was noted to have increasing secretions and confusion.
Patient was also noted to have recent weight loss.
Diabetes mellitus.
Spinal stenosis status post surgery.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General:  This is a cachectic elderly female in moderate distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No sinus tenderness, mucous membranes dry, oropharynx without any lesions.
Neck:  Soft, supple, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, normal rhythm with a grade [**3-12**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.
Pulmonary:  Shallow respirations with crackles on the left axillary line anteriorly.
Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, non-distended, normal active bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding.
Extremities:  1+ pulses, warm, no edema, no calf tenderness.
Chest film showed full lung volumes, no ..........., pleural effusions or pneumothorax with a possible lingular infiltrate; electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 105 beats per minute with normal axis, normal intervals, borderline left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage, no ST or T-segment changes when compared with a prior electrocardiogram and no T-waves.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was begun on broad spectrum antibiotics, initially started on Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl and later broadened to Levofloxacin for possible pseudomonal infection, though none was documented.
Patient was noted to have a metabolic acidosis with anion gap that was presumably secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis on admission and was begun on an intravenous insulin drip.
Patient was also noted to have acute renal failure that was likely pre-renal in nature with a creatinine elevation to 1.8 from her baseline of 0.8.
The patient also was noted to have a significant pre-water deficit and hyponatremia that was slowly corrected in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was 153 on transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the general medical floor.
Patient was noted to be in ongoing significant respiratory distress, presumably secondary to pneumonia as well as congestive heart failure.
Patient was noted on the floor to have a temperature of 101 as well as worsening respiratory distress.
The patient's oxygen saturation rate was 96% on 3 liters initially on transfer to the medical floor, though subsequently, patient developed a worsening oxygen requirement and was noted to desaturate to 86% on 3 liters with a respiratory rate of 48 followed by the initiation of a non-rebreather with improvement of her oxygen saturation rate to 90%.
All intravenous fluids were discontinued as the patient was felt to be in worsening congestive heart failure.
