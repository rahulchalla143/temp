Admission Date:  [**2165-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-8-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-2-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Oxycodone  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Melena and newly diagnosed colonic mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation times 3  History of Present Illness: HPI: 74F with PMH COPD on home O2 2L, CAD (+ stress test, not cathed), HTN, hx DVT on coumadin presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**7-28**] with a CC of dark stools and foot pain.
Dark stools started in the 2 days prior to presentation and were associated with fatigue and increased SOB.
No fever, chills, abdominal pain, BRBPR, n/v, hemoptysis, syncope or CP.
No evidence of upper GIB on endoscopy, but colonoscopy revealed an appendiceal/cecal mass with an ulcerated center, bx: high grade dysplasia with no definite adenocarcinoma.
CT showed cecal wall thickening corresponding to mass location, mildly proominent right hilar lymphadenopathy of unclera significance, and no evidence of metastatic disease.
Given patient's high surgical and procedural risk, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further pre-operative assessment and ultimately treatment of her colonic mass.
She reported only mild abdominal pain and her baseline SOB.

The aorta is normal in caliber without acute pathology.
Extensive multivessel coronary arterial calcifications are present.
A small 8mm penetrating aortic ulcer is present in the arch distal to the left subclavian origin.
There is extensive biapical predominant centrilobular emphysema.
Abrupt attenuation of the subsegmental and lower order branches of the bronchi supplying the lingula (4, 85-88) could represent sequela of a prior infection such as scarring (which could be correlated with prior exam if available).
There is trace right dependent atelectasis.
No obvious pulmonary nodule or mass.
There are wedge compressions involving T4-5 vertebral bodies, status post vertebroplasty with hyperdense material within the vertebral bodies.
There is also wedge compression of what appears to be T7 vertebral body, with a 30% loss of height, age indeterminate.
Limited subdiaphragmatic evaluation demonstrates two exophytic right renal cysts, the inferior of which measuring approximately 20 Hounsfield units, which could represent proteinaceous or hemorrhagic component, but is incompletely assessed.
There is diffuse moderate atherosclerotic disease throughout the imaged portion of the aorta, without aneurysm.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
8-mm penetrating aortic ulcer in the aortic arch distal to the arch vessel origins.
Diffuse moderate atherosclerotic disease.
Moderate diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
Subsegmental lingular atelectasis.
Probable right renal cysts, the inferior of which is hyperdense.
Severe multivessel coronary arterial disease.
No right-to-left shunt is seen on agitated saline injection at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 74F with PMH COPD on O2, CAD, HTN, DVT previously on coumadin, presented to OSH with 2 days of melena and was found to be anemic to HCT 22 with an appendical/cecal ulcerated mass.
She was noted to become tachycardic and acutely desaturated to 70% requiring emergent intubation by anesthesia.
She was extenuated and initially fared well, though the patient did experience acute episodes of shortness of breath.
She was started on treatment for COPD exacerbation.
The patient was subsequently extubated, but quickly required re-intubation for respiratory distress and concern for fatigue despite PPV.
Brief outline of on-going issues during patient's hosptalization prior to be made CMO:  # GI bleed- Based upon colonoscopy at OSH, patient's ulcerated appendiceal/cecal mass was felt to be the most likely source.
Her bleeding had stopped by the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] and her HCT was trending up, from a nadir of 22 at OSH to 31 on hospital day 2 at [**Hospital1 18**].
An active type + screen was maintained and patient was monitored on telemetry.
In spite of the fact that patient had stopped bleeding, we continued to hold her Coumadin and Plavix given that we did not have source control.
# Colonic mass- Patient's 2cm, ulcerated appendiceal/cecal mass had been biopsied during colonoscopy at OSH and pathology revealed high grade dysplasia concerning for malignancy.
A rectal polyp was also removed with pathology showing a tubulovillous adenoma with high grade dysplasia.
GI at [**Hospital1 18**] was consulted and felt that mass could not be managed or excised with an endoscopic approach, so colorectal surgery was consulted.
Surgery was not purused given her respiratory status.
# HTN- Home antihypertensives Lisinopril and Metoprolol were held at OSH in the  setting of patient's GI bleed.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was hemodynamically stable and telemetry demonstrated occasional PVC's, so Metoprolol was restarted.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient denied urinary symptoms and Levaquin was discontinued.
Her urine culture showed enterococcus 10,000-100K CFU.
# AAA repair c/b embolism to Left Leg and Left Foot Amputation- Patient's Coumadin was held given recent GI bleed.
# CAD -  Patinet has a history of drug eluting stent placement in her RCA in [**2159**].
