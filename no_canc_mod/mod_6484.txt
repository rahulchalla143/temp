Admission Date:  [**2126-3-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2126-3-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2075-1-26**]     Sex:  F  Service:  ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old white woman with a history of lung cancer status post chemoradiation and surgery who presented with an episode of syncope.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 27953**] had a three day history of fevers and shortness of breath and a sore throat and myalgias.
She was feeling better on Saturday morning when she went to take a warm shower and had an episode of syncope and found herself in the fetal position in the bathtub.
No apparent head injury.
There, during a physical examination by the medical students, in which she was standing up after she had done head to toe walking, she had an episode of syncope and on her rhythm strips she had sinus bradycardia to the 40s with a junctional escape rhythm.
This syncopal episode was associated with loss of bowel and bladder function.
She subsequently had a repeat episode in the ensuing minutes, again, with sinus bradycardia and junctional escape and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further observation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for incidental finding of bronchial alveolar carcinoma, Stage 3A, status post right upper lobe resection in [**2125-3-8**].
History of morbid obesity, status post gastric bypass in [**2123**].
ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS:  She was on [**Last Name (LF) 27956**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] herbal remedy for hot flashes, as well as calcium supplementation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for the lack of dysuria, hematemesis, seizures, headaches, rashes or arthralgia, chest pain, shortness of breath and palpitations all lacking.
She did note a runny nose and nasal congestion.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history of no sudden cardiac death.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was a pleasant woman in no acute distress.
There was no neck lymphadenopathy.
No conjunctival injection.
Cardiac exam revealed a normal S1, S2 with mild tachycardia.
There was no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No abdominal heart sounds.
Abdomen was soft, nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities had no edema.
Her neurological exam was notable for horizontal nystagmus.
Electrocardiogram was sinus with normal axis, normal intervals and no acute ischemic changes.
She had no further episodes of bradycardia or syncope.
She did have a urinalysis which had white cells on it.
She was seen by the Electrophysiology Service who concluded that this was a classic vasovagal episode in the setting of dehydration and recommended a vigorous hydration as well as treatment of her urinary tract infection.
If she has further episodes like this in the future, she may benefit from beta-blocker to prevent her vasovagal induced vasodepressor syncope.
Urinary tract infection.
FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  As per recommendations of the Electrophysiology Service, she should have an echocardiogram in the ensuing week or two to assess her structural cardiac function.
