Admission Date:  [**2178-1-2**]       Discharge Date: [**2178-1-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2129-3-18**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 31470**] is an unfortunate 48-year-old female who was in her usual state of health and otherwise has no other past medical history who sustained an assault on [**2178-1-2**].
Her assailant apparently had attacked her from behind in an attempted robbery and she sustained multiple stab-wound including stab-wound to the right shoulder, right thumb and left thigh as well as attempted strangulation and a presumed attempted drowning event.
Evaluation in the Emergency Room included activation of the trauma service.
At the time of evaluation her past medical history showed no medical problems.
She has no known drug allergies.
She did have bilateral scleral hemorrhage.
She had ecchymosis over both bilateral orbits and she had linear scrapes on the anterior neck indicating a possible choking event.
Her back had no step-off or deformities and she was otherwise nontender.
She did have a 6 to 7 cm linear laceration just above the sacrum in the midline approximately .5 cm in depth presumed to be a slash wound.
She had a 1 cm puncture wound to the left medial thigh.
Additionally there was a 1-1/2 cm puncture wound to the lateral left arm.
She did have a Troponin that was found to be 35.6, a CK value of 235 and MB of 20 with an MB index of 8.5 suggesting a possible cardiac injury verses an acute coronary syndrome.
She had a CT of the head with fine facial cuts that was additionally negative for any nasal or malar bone fracture.
At this time the conclusion was that the patient sustained strangulation with multiple signs of near asphyxiation supported by the bilateral scleral hemorrhage and petechiae throughout her face and neck.
Given this, this prompted the actual sending of the cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram which showed possible anterior cardiac injury by electrical signature.
A Cardiology consultation was obtained and an echo revealed anterior wall dysfunction with mild mitral regurgitation in the setting of having a Troponin of 35.
The differential diagnosis at that time included a possible acute myocardial infarction verses cardiac contusion, verses demand ischemia.
Cardiac consultation was achieved and ultimately due to her profound hypotension and her polytrauma mechanism it was decided the patient should go to the trauma Intensive Care Unit for resuscitation.
She had excellent urine output, was given 60 mg of intravenous Lasix due to her depressed left ventricular function found to be approximately 40% by EF on her echocardiogram.
Because of persistent hypotension a pAO2 of 58, this was done under rapid sequence utilizing Succinylcholine.
At that time the patient's assessment by their exam showed there is no signs of ruptured globe or retinal pathology.
She had subconjunctival hemorrhage bilateral likely secondary to her strangulation.
Otherwise there was no other ophthalmologic irregularity found.
She was still being supported with Levophed which is utilized for blood pressure monitoring after being given the 60 mg of Lasix which had quite a profound diuretic effect and in fact caused her to be somewhat hypotensive therefore, requiring some volume resuscitation.
Cardiology deferred catheterization presuming that she actually suffered a possible cardiac contusion of her system and ischemia.
Ultimately their recommendations were to have a follow-up echocardiogram in 2 to 3 days post injury to see if there is any recovery of Left ventricular function.
Social Work consultation had been obtained on her presentation in the Emergency Room prior to her becoming hypotensive and intubated therefore, their services were continued throughout her hospitalization, she was already being referred to an outpatient referral center that deals with assault patient's where she will continue to have counseling and support.
After approximately a five day hospital stay the patient was deemed appropriate and stable for discharge.
A decision was made at the request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31471**] to have the patient discharged to home with her to have follow-up in the Center for Violence and Prevention and Recovery with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 31472**] to continue her social work and psychosocial support.
This actually showed her left ventricular function to have deteriorated down to an EF of 25 to 30%  Ultimately the management of her presumed low EF state will be left to the care of the cardiology consultation service.
Additionally she will be seen in the outpatient setting by the Cardiology service to manage her EF of 25 to 30% as well as going to the Center for Violence Prevention and Recovery with social work assistance.
Status post assault with strangulation and asphyxiation,     attempted drowning sustaining multiple petechial     hemorrhage and possible demand ischemia verses acute     myocardial infarction in the setting of polytrauma.
