CT Head without Contrast ([**2197-12-4**]): IMPRESSION: Left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
MRI Head with and without Contrast (): IMPRESSION: Unchanged left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with no enhancing masses or vascular malformation identified.
Several small vessels clustered superficially over the region of hemorrhage are most likely reactive and a small vascular malformation is unlikely.
The location suggests cortical vein throbosis, though no imaging findings of thrombosis are present.
Cerebral Angiogram ([**2197-12-5**]): FINDINGS: Evaluation of the above branches demonstrates no evidence of aneurysms or vascular malformations.
IMPRESSION: Evaluation of the right internal carotid artery, right external carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery, and left vertebral artery demonstrates no aneurysms or vascular malformations.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 84133**] is a 37 year-old right-handed man with a remote history of headache who presented to [**Hospital6 2561**] with the acute onset of right lower extremity weakness in the setting of a supplement use.
The study showed a stable left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with no enhancing masses or identifiable vascular malformation.
Although several small vessels clustered superficially over the region of hemorrhage were thought to most likely represent a reactive process, it was considered important to evaluate for an underlying arteriovenous malformation.
The imaging demonstrated no identifiable cause for the patient's hemorrhage (no aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation).
The hemorrhage may have been due to a sudden elevation of his blood pressure.
Although no neoplasm was seen underlying this hemorrhage, he will require follow up MRI brain in six weeks to rule out underlying neoplasm.
The patient's blood pressure continued to be quite elevated during the hospital course (170s-190s systolic).
He will be discharged home on this regimen and have a repeat MRI/A brain in six weeks and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
Allergies: PCN - anaphylaxis  Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of right leg weakness and were found to have a bleed in your brain.
It was thought this may have been due to hypertension.
