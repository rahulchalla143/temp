She underwent CT guided drainage of the abscess, but continued to have increased abd pain and elevated white count, so went to the OR for sigmoid colectomy/hartmanns.
She began to have stool output from the ostomy on POD2, but on POD3 began putting out large amounts of bloody stool.
Multiple endoscopies were done which revealed only nonbleeding gastric ulcers.
Past Medical History: Sciatica, back pain history of appendectomy.

Uppper endoscopy demonstrates copious blood comming from the ampulla.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please identify the source of bleeding into the biliary tree and embolize as appropriate.
MESENTERIC ANGIO AND EMBOLIZATION  INDICATION: Upper GI bleeding from the ampulla by endoscopy from the outside institution.
There was no evidence of active bleeding, pseudoaneurysm or neovascularity in the right hepatic artery, left hepatic artery and gastroduodenal artery.
There is a small broad-based pseudoaneurysm in the mid portion of the splenic artery without evidence of active extravasation.
The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] and it was decided to perform embolization of the splenic artery since no other potential source of bleeding was detected.
Followup arteriogram demonstrated occlusion of the splenic artery and no opacification of the pseudoaneurysm or distal splenic artery.
No abnormalities, active extravasation, or aberrant/accessory vessels were identified in the SMA territory.
There were no immediate complications.
Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of 200 mcg of Fentanyl and 3 mg of Versed throughout the intraservice time of 3 hours during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.
IMPRESSION: Small pseudoaneurysm without evidence of active bleeding in the mid portion of the splenic artery, embolized with multiple coils after discussion of the findings with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**].
FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a left basal effusion with atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are multiple coils present in the splenic artery, and on the post- contrast examination, there are multiple low-attenuation foci within the spleen one of them in anterior portion of the spleen with a convex outer margin, suggestive a combination of cysts and splenic infarcts.
Bilateral left more than right diffuse thickening of the adrenal glans most likely represents hyperthrophy.
There are scattered subcentimeter upper abdominal lymph nodes.
There is a left-sided ileostomy.
CT PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a drain present within the pelvis, traversing the right lower pelvic wall.
There is small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
There are scattered bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, mildly enlarged but with preserved fatty hilus.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Bilateral subcutaneous fat stranding of the right and the left lateral abdominal and pelvic walls might represent areas of dependent edema or inflamation.
There are degenerative changes present in the spine.
Multiple metallic coils within the splenic artery with scattered low- attenuation foci within the spleen, most likely a combination of cysts and focal areas of splenic infarction post-coil embolization.
Left basal effusion with atelectasis at the left lower lobe and inflammatory changes in the mesentery of the upper abdomen are consistent with post-procedure sequelae.
Bilateral adrenal gland thickening, most likely representing hyperplasia.
On [**1-30**] she underwent mesenteric angiography which revealed no active bleeding, but did reveal a splenic artery aneurysm.
This revealed a bleeding ulcer in the second part of the duodenum, which was injected and fulgurated.
Endoscopy was repeated on [**2-4**] and the same ulcer was injected and fulgurated once again.
She also complained of back and L leg pain during her ICU stay so pain service was consulted and she was started on her home oxycodone/celexa.
She complained of nausea with eating solid foods, but was able to obtain adequate nutrition by supplementing her meals with Ensure.
She continued to have low back and left leg pain consistent with her preexisting diagnosis of sciatica.
Chronic pain service was consulted and she was started on Neurontin, dilaudid, and standing tylenol.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for Acute pain.
