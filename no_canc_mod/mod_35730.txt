SICKLE CELL C DISEASE AND THROMBOCYTOPENIA ISSUES: Hematology was consulted again regarding the resumption of the hydroxyurea.
RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The final Renal recommendations were to start the patient both on Phos-Lo and Renagel for phosphate binding.
She will undergo midline placement for administration of her ceftazidime which should still be administered every day until [**2140-7-17**].
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS ISSUES:  Briefly, during the Intensive Care Unit stay before the patient was extubated and after the patient had begun dialysis, she still remained very sleepy and difficult to arouse.
Because of the setting of the low platelets, the patient was sent for a computed tomography scan of the head to insure that there was no intracranial process accounting for her decreased level of consciousness.
The computed tomography of the head showed an essentially normal computed tomography scan; although, there was a question of a hypodensity within the frontal lobes bilaterally, which was not specific in pathology but was potentially consistent with a hypoxic injury.
NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient did have a Speech and Swallow evaluation and was found to pass her video swallow test.
End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis).
Diastolic heart failure.
Pulmonary hypertension (on home oxygen).
Cirrhosis secondary to iron overload.
History of neutropenia secondary to hydroxyurea.
Recent Klebsiella urinary tract infection in the Intensive Care Unit.
