ADMISSION to [**Hospital1 882**] [**2159-2-4**] IMAGING: [**2-4**] CXR RLL infiltrate [**2159-2-5**] ABD US: normal except for a 1.8cm cystic lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney.
[**2159-2-6**]: CT ABD/PEL small right lower lobe pleural effusion; possible necrotizing PNA; septated cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney which does not appear to be an abscess (recommendation to repeat son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging in 6 months); edema of gallbladder wall .
Abnormal opacity in the right hilum with patchy consolidation in the right lower lobe.
Findings are consistent with right lower lobe pneumonia.
This may be due to a right hilar mass and could be further evaluated with chest CT. PE cannot be excluded.
No evidence of CHF.
Extensive consolidation in right lower lobe with underlying emphysema, representing lobar pneumonia.
Extensive centrilobular emphysema.
Right pleural effusion.
A 1.1 cm right hilar node.
No other mediastinal or hilar mass.
Subtle bilateral infrahilar opacities are present, not significantly changed allowing for differences in technique dating back to [**2159-2-23**].
Severe upper lobe emphysema is noted.
IMPRESSION: Subtle bilateral infrahilar opacities, likely due to a slowly resolving infection.
Severe emphysema.

RLL PNA:  This was thought to be likely community acquired PNA vs. MRSA PNA vs. aspiration PNA.
There were possible necrotizing features seen on OSH CT, not appreciated on CT here, however PNA is consolidated, lobar RLL.
The patient was initially maintained on TB precautions until he ruled out w/ 3 sputum samples and a negative PPD.
He was taken for bronchoscopy, and subsequently required intubation as copious pus was found in the bronchioles and his airway was compromised.
Cytology from the BAL was negative for malignant cells.
The patient was administered frequent nebs, and IV Solumedrol for his severe COPD.
He was extubated two times, but required re-intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He underwent the procedures on [**2-23**] with thoracic surgery without complication.
Fevers: The patient continued to have daily fevers without a clear etiology and the differential was broad in this pt with comorbidities and multiple exposures and a history of immunosuppression with chronic steroids/prednisone tapers.
He did grow out Stenotrophomonas as described above, but remained afebrile and was not treated as it may represent a colonizer.
# Aggitation - patient with increased anxiety peri-extubation and with persistent feeling of hypoxia despite maintaining good sats.
COPD - Patient is to be maintained on Prednisone 10.
Osteoporosis:  from chronic steroid.
Hyperglycemia - patient is with new insulin requirement and hyperglemia.
It may be due to high steroid doses adminstered.
Haloperidol Lactate 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1) ml Injection q6:prn as needed for aggitation.
COPD exacerbation 2.
MRSA pneumonia 3.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement 4.
ICU delirium 5.
Chronic Anemia 6.
