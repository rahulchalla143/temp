Admission Date:  [**2108-1-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-1-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-7-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Keflex / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Tx from OSH with pancreatitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Central line placement Arterial line placement X 2  History of Present Illness: 52YO female, pw four day history of N/V/D, generalized weakness and decreased PO.
Pt denied abdominal pain.
Pt had elevated troponin to 1.16.
Her exam was notable for coarse but equal breath sounds and a distended abdomen.
Pt was noted to be guiac positive,  She was evaluated by general surgery out of concern for necrotizing pancreatitis.
They concluded that given the patient's down-trending LFT's and CT changes, these were not consistent with nec pancreatitis.
Past Medical History: pancreatitis anemia COPD  Social History: Smokes [**11-23**] PPD.
NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e, warm, good pulses SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice NEURO: AAOx3.
Moderate amount of stranding within the anterior pararenal space surrounding the pancreas, which is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
There is no evidence of complication (on this essentially unenhanced scan).
Persistent renal parenchymal enhancement, with a somewhat striated appearance, which despite the normal serum creatinine, raises the question of acute renal dysfunction, particularly ATN or other tubular abnormality.
Low-attenuation liver consistent with generalized fatty infiltration.
Large consolidation in the lower lobes bilaterally and posteriorly, raises the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
Mild hypodensity in the wall of the cecum and ascending colon which could represent submucosal edema with mild apparent hyperemia of the mucosa, focally.
High density within the cystic duct and common bile duct as well as intermediate density within the gallbladder.
These findings, in this context, are most suggestive of vicarious excretion of contrast, also suggestive of underlying renal abnormality.
[**2107-12-31**]: ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Diffuse low QRS voltage.
Poor  R wave progression - cannot rule out old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes which are non-specific.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2108-1-1**]: CXR: There has been interval worsening in bibasilar consolidations and effusions greater on the right side.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No evidence of pancreatic pseudocyst or hepatobiliary obstruction.
Multifocal pneumonia.
Featureless sigmoid colon may represent C. diff infection.
Fatty liver, unchanged since [**2108-1-5**].
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 52 year old female transferred from OSH with pancreatitis, likely ETOH, intubated with possible ARDS and aspiration pna.
# Pancreatitis: Nausea, vomiting, decreased PO, CT scan, and lipase of > 1000 demonstrate pancreatitis on admission.
There was no evidence of hemorrhage or pseudocyst on CT scan.
Patient admits to drinking whiskey daily which is the likely cause of her pancreatitis.
Her pancreatitis has now resolved and she has been advanced to a PO diet.
She was educated on the harms of alcohol abuse and was told to refrain from any EtOH use in the future as it may precipitate another episode of pancreatitis.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  TTE on [**1-2**] with LVEF 25%, with severe global hypokinesis.
During her MICU stay, she continued to spike fevers and her antibiotics were broadened to Vancomycin and Zosyn IV.
She was treated for 10 days of antibiotics and was afebrile on discharge.
She has no history of CAD but may have EtOH cardiomyopathy based on TTE done here.
She was started on Toprol for treatment of her CHF and NSVT.
# Elevated LFTs.
An obstructive pattern.
No evidence cholecystitis, biliary tree abnormality on RUQ u/s x2 and CT torso.
Tablet(s)   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 77534**] Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Hypovolemic/Septic shock - Aspiration pneumonia - Acute respiratory distress syndrome - Necrotizing pancreatitis - ETOH hepatitis - Non-thrombotic troponin elevation - Acute Systolic heart failure - SVT with aberrancy - NSVT - Multifactorial anemia - Rash NOS - Malnutrition, moderate degree  Secondary: - ETOH abuse - COPD   Discharge Condition: good.
pancreatitis resolved.
Discharge Instructions: you were admitted for pancreatitis to the intensive care unit.
Your pancreatitis has now resolved.
You were also found to have heart failure which will need to be addressed with your cardiologist.
please follow up with your gastroenterologist to address you abnormal liver function and for continuing care of your pancreatitis.
