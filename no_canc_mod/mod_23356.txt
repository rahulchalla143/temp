Pt recently admitted for Afib with CP with follow up catheterization to look for ischemia and discharged on [**2188-12-27**].
She underwent cardiac catheterization without intervention on [**2188-12-25**] with pressure wire to the LAD, complicated by AVNRT with rate 150 and hypotension, systolic drop from 140 to 90.
Per report, patient developed ligtheadedness/presyncope the morning post procedure after daily atenolol dose; she became bradycardic to the 30s and initially not responding but was easily [**Last Name (LF) 18248**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report, and HR returned to 60s when aroused.
She was switched from atenolol to metoprolol, had no further episodes of bradycardia but did have an episode of AVNRT which resolved on its own.
Pt underwent ablative procedure successfully on [**2189-1-13**], but in setting of chest pain was noted to have SBP in 100s, and HR in 100s.
ECHO revealed circumferencial effusion (1-1.5cm width).
Given HD stability effusion was not drained and pt transferred to CVICU on CCU service for closer monitoring and repeat echo.
Repeat transthoracic echo preliminarily appeared to show mild increase in size of pericardial effusion.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for pleuritic chest pain, nausea.
Negative for shortness of breath.

# Pericardial Effusion: The patient developed pericardial effusion post EP procedure after her ablation.
An echo showed mild increase in the size of the effusion post procedure, with some evidence of impaired filling consistent with tamponade.
Repeat echo the following day on [**2189-1-14**] showed some resolution of the pericardial effusion and less evidence of tamponade.
# Chest pain: The patient had pleuritic chest pain, which was thought most likely to be post procedural and pericarditis related pain.
# Hx Afib, AVNRT s/p ablation [**2189-1-13**]: Ablation appeared to have been successful because of inability to reproduce AVNRT.
# Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was noted to have high blood sugars while admitted, states she has never been told she is diabetic.
# Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's plavix discontinued secondary to the effusion.
