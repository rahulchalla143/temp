The lungs reveal mild left basal subsegmental atelectasis and the left costophrenic angle is beyond the field-of-view.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Left parietal and temporal encephalomalacia as above.
Secretions in the distal trachea and plugging small left lower lobe airways with mild subsegmental atelectasis, likely related to aspiration in this patient with a mildly distended, fluid-filled esophagus 3.
CT C-SPINE [**2143-10-31**]: IMPRESSION: No fracture and normal alignment of the C-spine.
MRA [**2143-11-1**]: IMPRESSION: Sequela of subacute to chronic left MCA infarct.
No acute infarct seen.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 56 yo man prior L MCA territory infarct in [**2142-4-26**], who presents with multiple GTCs with R gaze deviation in the setting of a recent URI.
After breaking his seizures with ativan and a phenytoin load, he was intubated for airway protection.
His original labs at the OSH showed evidence of a new leukocytosis with a bandemia.
He was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics and received a lumbar puncture to investigate for possible CNS infections as being a cause for his new onset seizures.
During the first two nights of his ICU stay, Mr. [**Known lastname 17684**] did demonstrate quite a bit of agitation requiring high doses of ativan and antipsychotics to keep him calm.
While he was quite sleepy and confused during this first day, his mentation improved quickly such that by the next day, we were able to complete a full neurological examination which revealed some mild paraphasic errors and slow speech, but normal [**Location (un) 1131**] and comprehension, impaired short term memory, right sided visual loss, mild right sided pyramidal weakness and a relatively normal gait.
Ultimately, his transaminitis subsided without manipulation and he was continued on dilantin.
They mentioned to us that in the past he had been driving following his seizures, in spite of a persistent right homonymous hemianopia that was only evident on formal visual field testing.
He also complained of some loose stools over the last two days prior to his discharge.
It is possible that his loose stools were a consequence of his scheduled colace dosing, which was discontinued on discharge.
Ultimately, Mr. [**Known lastname 17684**] was able to verbalize his understanding of his condition and the importance of taking an antiepileptic medication.
He was instructed to switch back to TID dosing should he continue to have difficulties with GI distress.
Disp:*90 Capsule(s)* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizures Cerebrovascular disease Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We believe that these seizures were likely a consequence of your old stroke, and perhaps your recent upper respiratory tract infection.
