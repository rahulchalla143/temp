Admission Date:  [**2194-12-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-12-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2145-11-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: OSH transfer in Shock  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Arterial line Tracheal entubation   History of Present Illness: 49m with DM1, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and a recent admission at [**Hospital3 **] for DKA and rapid afib presented to [**Hospital3 **] [**2194-12-7**] with palpitations, was found to be in afib with rvr, developed progressive hypotension followed by a junctional rhythm, went into PEA, was resuscitated, and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for balloon pump.
At the time of presentation to GoodSam, he was found to be in afib with heart rates in the 150s-160s.
He was noted to be in CHF (edema on CXR and BNP of 993), so he was given furosemide 40mg IV, producing 300ml of urine.
He was then transferred to the ICU where, for increasing hypotension and respiratory distress, he was intubated and started on propofol.
Given his ongoing pressor requirements and the feeling that he was in cardiogenic shock, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a balloon pump.
Altered MS ?
Family History: no premature coronary disease  Physical Exam:  PE: middle aged man, intubated and sedated VS: T 98.6, HR89, BP 112/69 (83), RR 14, 99% satO2 vent setting: 99% on AC 550 x 14 Peep 5 FiO2 100% pressors: dobutamine 5 and levophed 0.24 Skin: pale HEENT: anicteric, op clear with sl dry mucosa Lungs: moves air well, coarse, no wheezes or rales Cardiac: rrr, s1s2, no m/r/g ABD: soft, nt, nd, decr but present bs, hepatomegaly 3-4cm below costal margin Extremities: dopplerable DP and PT pulses, trace edema over feet, cool/dry Neuro: sedated, perrl, moves all extrm to pain   Pertinent Results: Tachy, a fib, normal axis, low voltage in limb leads, normal voltage in precordium, poor r wave progression, TWI in I, II, TW flattening in III, aVR, aVL, aVF, ST elevation (<1mm) in V3, ST depression (1mm) in V5, V6.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild biventricular cavity enlargement with severe global biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.
The low heart rate raises the suspicion for hypothyroidism - though he does not have a pericardial effusion).
[**12-13**] Port CXR: IMPRESSION: No significant change in the appearance of the cardiac enlargement or bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists.
[**12-14**] IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive clot in the lower internal jugular vein.
Single vessel coronary artery disease as manifest by 70% proximal stenosis of a moderate sized ramus branch.
Severely reduced left ventricular systolic function with elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 49m with DM2, likely alcoholic cardiomyopathy who presented to GoodSam with afib-rvr, developed shock of presumed cardiogenic etiology, and had a PEA arrest.
By ECG he did not seem to have a major ischemic event to account for the shock.
- lipids with low HDL but, LDL 119 and Total chol 186 .
# Sepsis -- WBC normalized and afebrile.
WBC and fever could both be insetting of infection or PEA arrest.
- Discontinued Ceftaz in CCU - continued vanco for a total 7-day course - continued broad abx with aztreonam for in place of ceftaz for a total 7-day course - f/u cultures here negative - Was afebrile X 4 days with normal wbc count on discharge .
# CHF: DDx alchoholic vs myopathy [**1-2**] afib vs viral.
CXR and vent/abg were consistent with pulm edema, likely secondary to CHF-EF 15-18%.
Will need repeat outpt echo (in 3 months) for evaluation of cardiomyopathy and possible primary prevention with ICD.
- continue lasix with potassium supplementation - Cath with moderate 3VD, plan for stress in future - will recommend he get HIV testing as outpatient .
# Afib -- PAF.
Another episode of afib with RVR during hospital course on medical floor to HR 200s now in NSR on amio taper.
He was asymptomatic during this episode.
# Elevated LFTs -- Resolved by discharge.
With transaminases this elevated and only modestly elevated alk phos and t bili, the most plausible diagnosis is shock liver.
This is occuring in the background of likely underlying alcholic liver disease.
Bilateral pleural effusion vs atelectasis vs infiltrate on CXR.
- diuresis for pulm edema - IS to bedside .
#RUE- erythema and edema.
Has a R IJ non-occlusive dvt - already on LMWH/coumadin .
#Acute renal failure -- Resolved.
Likely a septic ATN (with additional contribution from ischemic ATN during PEA) potentially exacerbated by the pressor use.
#Hilar mass -- Seen on one CXR at GoodSam.
CT Chest without findings c/w hilar mass.
No additional signs of withdrawal during hospital course.

If your heart rates stays in the 120 range for more than one hour and you are resting, go to the ER.
If you experience any nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms please seek medical attention immediately.
