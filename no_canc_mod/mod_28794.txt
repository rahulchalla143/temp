HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 76-year-old Greek speaking gentleman with a past medial history significant for hypercholesterolemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented to an outside hospital on [**7-7**] complaining of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion initially and at the day of presentation at rest.
The patient also complained of generalized weakness and occasional left sided chest pain.
His EKG at that time showed sinus tachycardia with a rate of [**Street Address(2) 64158**] depressions in 1, 2, F and V4 through V6, elevations with T-wave inversions in V1 through V3.
His cardiac catheterization revealed an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm squared and 3 vessel disease in LAD with 80% tubulo stenosis, circumflex with a mid vessel 70% stenosis, and an RCA with proximal 80% stenosis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, status post transurethral resection of prostate, hypercholesterolemia.
GENERAL:  In no acute distress.
Neck is supple with no jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy.
LUNGS: Diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes with rales in the right base.
EXTREMITIES: Cool and dry with no edema and dopplerable pulses.
ST depressions in 1, 2, F, V4 through 6, elevations with Q wave inversions in V1 and V3.
Chest x-ray - hyperinflated lung fields with moderate congestive heart failure, no effusions or consolidations.
At that time no occult bleeding was found and the patient was re- wired, stabilized and returned to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
He awoke and moved all extremities and became restless and was re-sedated.
During that period the patient had frequent burst of rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 120 to 140.
On postoperative day 2, the patient remained in atrial fibrillation for which he continued to receive amiodarone infusion.
An attempt again was made to cardiovert the patient following which he had short periods of sinus rhythm but then generally returned to atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 120 to 130.
During this time attempts were also made to lighten the patient's sedation, however each attempt was met with periods of agitation and desaturation.
By postoperative day 2 when the patient was sedated, he remained hemodynamically stable, however attempts to wean sedation were met with patient becoming hemodynamically unstable and dyspneic associated with periods of agitation.
On postoperative day 3, the patient remained in atrial fibrillation.
The patient again became agitated and dyspneic, however he maintained his oxygen saturations with minimal ventilatory support.
Over the next 24 hours, the patient became less agitated and more easily reoriented.
His chest tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed, however he was maintained on cardiothoracic intensive care unit for 2 additional days to monitor his pulmonary status.
Once on the floor, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course.
Incision is clean and dry without drainage or erythema.
21 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial    valve as well as coronary artery bypass graft x 3 with    left internal mammary artery to the LAD, saphenous vein    graft to the patent ductus arteriosus and saphenous vein    graft to the diagonal.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia, status post transurethral    resection of prostate.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of    1.7.
