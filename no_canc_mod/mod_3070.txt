Marked inflammatory stranding around the pancreatic head with poor definition of the pancreatic parenchyma in this region.
These findings are most consistent with pancreatitis.
PLease note that pancreatic necrosis cannot be excluded on this non contrast enhanced scan.
Marked gallbladder wall edema, this could be due to pancreatitis.
If cholecystitis is of clinical concern ultrasound could be performed.
Moderate amount of intraabdominal ascites.
Right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo F with h/o afib, HTN, asthma who presents with rapid afib, pancreatitis, and acute renal failure.
When the patient arrived to the floor she was in rapid Afib at a rate of 150-160's.
She was mentating well at this time with no complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness.
She was given another bolus of 1L NS given the concern for her pancreatitis.
At this time she also began having mental status changes and agitation.
Her LFT's and amylase/lipase were still normal despite evidence of pancreatitis on CT and possibler CBD dilatation.
During the evaluation and work up of the patient ECG showed rapid afib.
We were concerned about possible ST changes in leads V1-[**Street Address(2) 17297**] elevations and V4-[**Street Address(2) 17298**] depressions.
Cardiology was consulted first to do possible ECHO however they felt based on story that pericardial effusion was unlikely and that the afib was her [**Last Name 17299**] problem.
After the ECG changes were noted the ECG was faxed to the on call cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 17300**] [**Name (STitle) **] who felt that there was no significant ischemic changes compared to old ECG's.
When patient intially arrived to the floor our first concern was her rapid heart rate and hemodynamics.
Possible causes for the patients condition include myocardial ischemia(however had no significant trop leak, and no significant ECG changes per cardiology), PE(however she was with INR of >2 from recent labs and was 3.6 then 1.7 in the ED), ischemic bowel(no bowel wall thickening on CT, but did have AG acidosis and elevated lactate), sepsis(empirically given vanco and levofloxacin however no identifiable source was found on intial eval.)
