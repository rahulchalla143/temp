During recent admission from [**Date range (1) 7291**], an etiology for patient's altered mental status was not determined.
There was no evidence of infection, positive tox screen, or acute intracranial process on head CT. She was re-started on her haloperidol and quetiapine, as her symptoms seemed more typical of schizophrenia than of delirium.
There were no obvious signs of infection.
She was observed in the MICU and remained unresponsive, awake consistent with catatonia.
Past Medical History: -Atrial Fibrillation - recently started on digoxin and metoprolol, stopped coumadin, diltiazem, lisinopril, atenolol -DM2 -Microcytic Anemia - extensive recent GI wkup at [**Hospital1 112**] unrevealing  -Schizophrenia - diagnosed age 23 -Eczema   Social History: Lives alone in an apartment.
Family History: Mother with ETOH abuse, no FH of heart disease, HTN, DM or malignancy.
Physical Exam: Admission exam Vitals: T: 98.9 BP: 148/92 P: 103 R: 20 O2: 97%RA General: Eyes open does not track, not responding to any commands HEENT: Conjunctiva injected, MMM, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Irregular, tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, mild pedal edema Neuro: PERRL, unable to assess remaining cranial nerves, mild cogwheeling in RUE, some finger and toe movement b/l, downgoing toes b/l .
MICROBIOLOGY: Urine Culture [**11-14**] No growth Blood Culture [**11-13**] No growth .
PERTINENT STUDIES CXR [**11-14**] Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
Hilar lymphadenopathy is better seen in prior study.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Aside from minimal opacities in the left lower lobe that are likely atelectasis, the lungs are clear.
Moderate degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
Brief interpretable segments between EMG show diffuse background slowing and attenuation, no alpha rhythm, but no focal slowing or epileptiform discharges.
Indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, etiologically nonspecific.
CT spine [**11-13**] IMPRESSION: No fracture or subluxation within the cervical spine.
Mild degenerative changes.
CT head [**11-13**] IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial findings.
Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved and is now mild.
No overt pulmonary edema.
New retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.
No pneumothorax.
New retrocardiac atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Improved pulmonary vascular congestion, now mild, without pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 67 year-old female with history of schizophrenia, with recent admission for altered mental status and slurred speech, who re-presents with altered mental status.
CT showed no acute intracranial process.
Seizure was initially felt to be a possibility given rhythmic movements of facial muscles; however, no focal slowing or epileptiform discharges were seen on EEG.
She had no electrolye abnormalities and a negative tox screen, making ingestion unlikely.
Infection was considered given initial leukocytosis, but urine and blood cultures were negative and leukocytosis resolved on its own by [**2139-11-19**].
Psychiatry was consulted and felt that the patient's decreased responsiveness represented a catatonic form of schizophrenia.
Atrial fibrillation: During this admission, the patient had episodes of rapid ventricular rate with an ECG showing strain on [**2139-11-18**].
Labs showed a small troponin leak and cardiology was consulted; they felt the elevated troponin represented strain secondary to increased rate.
# FEN: Speech and swallow recommended supervision, thin liquids, ground solids.
# Anemia: Hematocrit at recent baseline.
Medications on Admission: 1. senna 8.6 mg PO BID as needed for constipation.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation .
3. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2561**] - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Altered mental status, likely secondary to decompensated schizophrenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Instead, it was thought that your schizophrenia had worsened or was not responding to your usual medications.
