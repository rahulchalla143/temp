She was brought to the ED on [**8-7**] with persistent abdominal pain.
A CT of the abdomen on admission demonstrated mild sigmoid colonic wall thickening with adjacent fat stranding.
A CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy airspace disease concerning for edema/infection, and subsequent CXR was concerning for a LLL infiltrate.

II/VI syst murmur heard best at apex ABD: soft, NT, mildly tender in suprapubic area, NABS.
No masses or HSM appreciated.
No rebound elicited.
No ulcerations.
CT abd: There has been interval development of a short focal segment of mild bowel wall thickening involving the sigmoid colon with subtle adjacent fatty stranding.
There is no free air or free fluid.
No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
CXR: Tip of right jugular CV line is in region of cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax.
There is cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement, consistent with CHF/fluid overload.
In addition, there are bibasilar atelectases.
The stability of associated consolidation in the left lower lobe cannot be ruled out.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) leukocytosis/UTI/?colitis: The patient was admitted to internal medicine for evaluation and treatment of her UTI and her ?colitis seen on her CT abdomen.
The patient was evaluated by the surgical service, who was concerned that the inflammation around the colon could be infectious, and recommended antibiotic coverage to include diverticulitis and c. diff colitis.
The possibility remains, however, that the bowel wall thickening is merely a post-operative and post-XRT change from her bladder cancer.
Her urine culture from [**8-7**] then came back growing Pseudomonas Aeruginosa sensitive to ceftazidime as well as enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.
She was continued on flagyl as well for concern for intraabdominal process.
MICU TRANSFER: On the morning of [**8-16**], the patient was noted to have a WBC jump from 24 to 30, with low systolic pressure down to 80s-90s, as well as hypoxia at 88% on 3L (increased from her baseline of 2L), necessitating NRB.
A CXR showed worsening CHF and persistent LLL opacity.
She was semi-electively intubated in anticipation of fluid requirements for hypotension in the face of a presumed failing heart with pulmonary edema and cold, clammy extremities.
She had a L subclavian central line placed.
She had an abdominal x-ray which showed a vague increased density over the bladder of unclear significance, without apparent free air or obstruction.
She was aggressively hydrated, but despite this, had increasing pressor requirements.
Given her CHF and cold extremities, as well as known RV failure, there was concern for a cardiogenic source of her shock.
A stat echo showed normal LV function with marked dilitation of the right ventricular cavity as well as severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis and 4+ TR.
PE was considered, however the patient was too unstable to have a CTA, and the echo result was not significantly changed from prior echo subsequent to which a CTA had been negative for PE.
Her pressor requirement gradually escalated over the course of 8 or so hours, until she was maxed out on 4 pressors with fluids running wide open.
2) CHF: Per report, the patient had been treated with Lasix 80mg PO daily until recently, when her low blood pressures became prohibitive.
The patient had bibasilar crackles in the ED, and was given Lasix 40mg IV x1 with good urine output response.
However, the patient subsequently became hypotensive and required 250cc boluses x3 with improvement to BPs of 90s over palp.
The patient's blood pressures remained low throughout her stay, and her CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.
It was decided that a blood transfusion would improve bother her anemia as well as her intravascular volume status, and so a transfusion on 1u PRBC was given, with improvement of SBP to the low 100s.
Per previous echocardiogram reports, the patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, and so is likely preload dependent and difficult to keep her lung exam from seeming wet.
She was on 2L by NC for the majority of her stay, however had a rapid deterioration on the morning of [**8-16**], as above.
