Admission Date:  [**2160-4-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-4-8**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Digoxin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, tachycardia, fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Continued ventilation  History of Present Illness: Pt is an 82 yo female with atrial fibrillation, HTN, amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism, s/p trach/peg and chronically vented, who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and fever to 103.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (3) 95595**] with pneumonia from likely rhinovirus with bacterial superinfection.
The above was further complicated by likely ventilator associated pneumonia.
Additionally, the patient, who has tachy-brady syndrome, had many episodes of afib/flutter and RVR with aberrancy (and rate related LBBB).
Endocrinology followed Ms. [**Known lastname 95596**] for her amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism and a slow prednisone taper was planned.
Also, per report secretions for 4-5 days but noticed to have frank bleeding since yesterday afternoon.
Also with sputum from [**2160-4-3**] growing pseudomonas aeruginosa (sensitive to zosyn MIC 64, and gentamicin MIC 4).
She also received 6 mg of adenosine x1 and then 12 mg of adenosine, and broke into sinus tachycardia briefly.
-Pump: Echo from [**2-/2160**]- Normal wall motion and EF; 1+AR, 2+ TR  -CAD: Stress ECG in [**June 2157**] with borderline EKG evidence of myocardial ischemia in the absence of anginal symptoms with 6min  on [**Doctor First Name **].
Hypertension 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Chronic cough followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] 6.
Back pain - DJD of L4-L5 and L5-S1 and spondylolisthesis followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] of Ortho.
Amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism  Social History: Prior to last hospitalization, lived alone in same building as her son.
No history of smoking.
MODERATE GROWTH.
[**2160-4-5**]- blood culture x 2- pending [**2160-4-4**]- c diff negative  Brief Hospital Course: Pt is an 82 yo female with atrial fibrillation, HTN, amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism, s/p trach/peg and chronically vented, who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation with SOB, fever, and tachycardia.
The current respiratory failure is likely secondary to a ventilatory associated pneumonia.
Sputum from [**Hospital1 **] grew out pseudomonas, sensitive to gentamycin (MIC 4) and Zosyn (MIC 64) only.
HD 2, pt had tachypnea after a few minutes on pressure support.
Will treat pseudomonal infection as above and UTI with linezolid x 14 days (last dose 5/31).
Additionally, pt has bilateral pleural effusions.
Given the multiple likely etiologies for fever, and the fact that the pleural effusions are bilateral, they were not tapped.
Her fever resolved with antibiotics and her leukocytosis slowly trended down.
Tachycardia/ atrial fibrillation- Patient has known tachy-brady syndrome with history of SVT with aberrancy.
Initial component of tachycardia was secondary to hypovolemia which was corrected with IVF on admission.
Given guaiac positive stools and anemia, pt's outpatient cardiologist was emailed who is conteplating the necessity of anticoagulation for the paf.
LLE swelling- mildlower extremity swelling L>R.
Neurology saw patient for LLE pain/weakness and thought that her exam was most likely consistent with a mypoathy, likely from both steroids and deconditioning.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventilator associated pneumonia Urinary Tract infection Atrial fibrilation GI bleed   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were diagnosed with a ventilator associated pneumonia.
Your rehab facility should have you re-evaluated if your respiratory status worsens, you have increased secretions, or fevers.
Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for  your atrial fibrilation and Tachy Brady syndrome.
You were found to have occult blood in your stool.
This is probably secondary to gastrits from your prednisone.
