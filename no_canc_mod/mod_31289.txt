In the right clinical context, atypical pneumonia can also have this appearence.
Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
No pneumothorax, no pleural effusions and no free air under the diaphragm.
CT Head: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2104-9-15**]: TTE:IMPRESSION: Mild biatrial dilation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Matched area of increased mean transit time, decreased blood flow, and decreased blood volume in the right MCA distribution, compatible with acute MCA ischemia/infarcts.
No intracranial hemorrhage, no CT evidence of significant parenchymal edema.
Intraluminal filling defect within the distal segment of the right M1 segment, representing a non-occlusive thrombus.
No distal occlusion.
Hypoplastic basilar artery with bilateral fetal PCAs.
Bilateral mild atherosclerotic plaques at the proximal ICAs without stenosis by NASCET criteria.
3-mm right upper lobe nodule.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] guidelines, no follow-up is needed if the patient has no known risk for lung cancer.
Acute focal infarction in the right frontal cortex; the area of ischemia/infarction is moderately smaller than predicted by the CT Perfusion study.
Old lacunar infarcts as described.
Intraluminal defect in the right M1 segment not visualized in the current MRA brain, could represent interval resolution or difference in technique.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: This is a 68 yo F w/PMHx IDDM type 2, Afib, HTN, Stroke (in [**2103**]) and Dementia brought in by [**Year (4 digits) **] due to hypoglycemia (blood glucose nadir of 51) and a brief period of unresponsiveness.
#Unresponsive episode/Diabetes: likely due to hypoglycemia.
Infectious workup was negative; CXR findings were more likely due to incomplete inhalation rather than atypical pneumonia.
She is being discharged on a decreased lantus dose (28u) due to an A1c of 6.8 and symptomatic hypoglycemia at home.
Per old PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] on coumadin possibly because of risk of bleeding given h/o multiple falls.
After receiving, 2 doses of Diltiazem(total 120 mg), she developed episodes of bradycardia and AV block for which she was monitored.
#Ischemic stroke: on hospital day 5 the primary medical team was called at 6pm due to nursing concern for new weakness.
The patient was evaluated immediately and noted to have left sided facial droop, left sided upper and lower extremity weakness and significant dysarthria.
CT perfusion with increased MTT in the R MCA distribution.
Dysarthria has resolved and only has very mild left facial droop and full strength in the left.
MRI head did show a small right frontal infarct in superior MCA region.
CHADS score is 4, has now had 2 ischemic strokes.
Transitional Issues: - d/c sitagliptin, digoxin, aspirin, plavix - decreased diltiazem from 240mg qd to 120mg qd - decreased lantus from 34u to 28u, could consider restarting sitagliptin versus starting metformin in the future if necessary for further glycemic control - started Pradaxa 150mg [**Hospital1 **] - close pcp [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] for ongoing evaluation of T2DM and Afib management  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Diltiazem Extended-Release 120 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia Bradycardia Atrial fibrillation Ischemic (embolic) stroke  Chronic issues: Dementia (?Mixed vascular and Alzheimers)   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), likely related to too much lantus insulin and sitagliptin.
Also you had episodes of bradycardia (slowing of your heart) and irregular heart rhythm.
You also had a stroke which was treated quickly; you have no deficits from this event.
