There were T wave inversions present in leads 1, 2, AVL, AVF, V4, V5.
ST elevations were present in 2, 3, AVF, V3 through V6.
In the MICU he was emergently dialyzed for hyperkalemia and uremia.
MICU course was notable for hypoglycemia as low as 9.
He had known history of hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia and adrenal insufficiency and thought to be in a great amount of stress.
Hypoglycemia was managed initially with D50, then D10 drip and then D5 with subsequent improvement of hypoglycemia.
He was seen by neurology who believed that his altered mental status was secondary to metabolic derangement including uremia, hypoglycemia and recent Heroin use.
EEG was obtained to rule out non convulsive status.
3) Status post pacemaker AICD secondary to prolonged QT syndrome.
4) History of Heroin use.
5) Mitral valve endocarditis.
6) End stage renal disease on hemodialysis for the past three years.
10) Recurrent C. diff infection.

Extremities, clean, dry and intact, no swelling.
Neurology:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13469**] had altered mental status, likely secondary to uremia, hypoglycemia, recent Heroin use.
They could not find any indication of prior ventricular tachycardia in the last few days.

This suggested possibly aspiration in the setting of altered mental status.
Repeat chest x-ray showed no infiltrate or effusions.
Uremia secondary to non compliance.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
