He got out of his car and had the acute onset of a severe ([**9-9**]) throbbing midline headache radiating from his forehead to his occiput which worsened over the course of 30 minutes.
After the HA began he went to sleep and subseuqently had partial resolution of his symptoms when he awoke.
These episodes are occasionally accompanied by  iziness and occasionally nausea although he has not vomited.
He states that a few years ago he had a similar episode of vertigo that lasted several days, at that time he had no HA.
he denies any diplopia, has not fallen, and denies phophobia or photophobia during these episodes.
Notably history includes epidural steroid injections for chronic low back pain (last [**2157-1-25**]).He also reports a similar sort of diziness related to Lipitor use some time ago.
He says he had been taking the lipitor for several years, and subsequently developed some muscle weakness and diziness which resolved when he stopped the medication.

VP shunt runs down right scalp, overlying skin intact with no erythema Neurologic: no focal deficits, alert, oriented, speech fluent, CNII-XII intact, motor- normal tone/bulk with full strength throughout.
Enlarged ventricles compatible with communicating hydrocephalus with a small amount of transependymal flow of CSF.
Scattered calcifications in the white matter may relate to prior infection or inflammation.
No acute hemorrhage.
MR brain [**2157-2-25**]: There is a 1.3 cm cystic lesion in the 4th ventricle causing obstructing hydrocephalus.
These findings in combination with the bilateral calcification seen on CT are highly suspicious for neurocysticercosis.
Because of the high degree of obstructive hydrocephalus, lumbar puncture is contraindicated.
No focal signal abnormality noted in the spinal cord.
No evidence of significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.
No abnormal enhancement.
Mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, with new left paracentral disc herniation at L4-L5 level contacting traversing left [**Name (NI) 13032**] nerve root.
Shunt series [**2157-2-28**]: Views from the skull to the upper abdomen shows placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt that extends to the upper abdomen with the tube curled somewhat on itself so that the tip then goes to the mid portion of the abdomen on the right  CT abdomen2/5/12: No abnormality seen along the course of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 39yoRHM who presented with a week long history of headaches that were consistent with increased intracranial pressure.
Imaging revealed a large cyst in the 4th ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus.
He ultimately was diagnosed with neurocystircercosis and treated symptomatically with a VP shunt until surgical resection of the cyst could be performed.
Neurologic: Patient presented with signs of increased intracranial pressure and clinically deteriorated on first day of admission.
He remained clinically stable but did have continued mild nausea and vomiting likely due to the location of the cyst.
However, his abdominal pain persisted so given the shunt (placement in right perihepatic region), both neurosurgery and general surgery were re-consulted.
He continued to have fluctuating mild pain but it overall improved prior to discharge.
Infectious disease: The radiographic evidence was consistent with neurocystircercosis.
ID was consulted and per recommendations, in addition to cystircercosis serology being checked, so was a PPD, RPR, and HIV.
Also checked was a total spine MRI and ophthamologic exam for other cystircercosis.
There is a consensus opinion from 3 senior nationally recognized ID attendings that surgical removal is the safest option.
GI: Pt continued to have nausea and vomiting throughout hospitalization.
Zofran was used symptomatically and famotidine started due to epigastric discomfort afterwards.
You were admitted for headache and were found to have a cystic lesion in your fourth ventricle of the brain.
This causes fluid buildup and the headaches you experienced.
The [**Last Name **] problem was the cyst, which was due to an infection called neurocystircercosis.

You may take ZOFRAN as needed for nausea (one tablet as often as every 8 hours).
You may take OXYCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN as needed for pain (one tablet as often as every 6 hours).
