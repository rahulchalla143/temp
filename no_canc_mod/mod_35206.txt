There is no pericardial effusion.
There are multiple mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
For the example, the largest lymph node in the pretracheal region measures 0.9 cm in short axis and 1.8 cm in long axis.
There is an enlarged right hilar lymph node that measures 1.0 cm in short axis and 2.0 cm in long axis.
Numerous prevascular, subcarinal and paratracheal lymph nodes are noted that measure less than 1 cm in greatest dimension.
Several small bilateral axillary lymph nodes are seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There are scattered bilateral patchy opacities in both upper and lower lobes as well as bibasilar patchy consolidations involving short aspects of both lower lobes.
This may be either iatrogenic or related to recent stab wound.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
There is a small, somewhat rounded 6 mm lucency in the sternum (series 3, image 48), which most likely reflects a focal area of rarefaction in a patient without known malignancy.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral patchy opacities in both upper and lower lobes, which may be either infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
Enlarged mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes.
A followup dictated chest CT is recommended when the patient's condition improved, to evaluate for interval change of pulmonary opacities and lymphadneopathy.
There are some small prevascular and AP window lymph nodes.
There has been worsening of ground-glass opacities, now involving a large portion of the left upper lobe, which were previously much more focal, and there has been coalescence into a more consolidative focal opacity in the posterior left upper lobe with air bronchograms (series 2, image 27).
More inferiorly, in the right middle lobe, there has also been slight improvement with a more ground-glass rather than dense consolidative appearance compared to the previous study.
In the left lower lobe; however, the ground-glass opacities appear to have slightly worsened and are more extensive involving the superior segment now to a greater degree than previously, and the consolidative focal area of opacity in the left base appears roughly stable though slightly changed in configuration.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There has been a midline incision with skin staples still noted.
There is a small amount of postoperative fluid just inferior to the incision line with a focal area along the inferior incision, where the staples have been removed.
Within the left lobe of the liver, there is a fluid collection measuring 3.8 x 2.9 cm with small foci of air within it non-dependently.
Just posterior and possibly continuous with this, there is a second fluid collection measuring 3.6 x 2.6 cm, also with a small focus of air within it and probably within the liver capsule as well (series 2, image 65).
Apart from these areas, there is no free intra-abdominal air remaining.
Small retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes are identified, measuring up to 9 mm.
A small amount of ascites tracks into the pelvis.
As above, there is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
As described above, there is a small amount of fluid just under the area of incision along the abdominal and pelvic midline, which is probably related to postoperative seroma, although infection cannot be excluded.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There are no fractures apparent.
Within the dermis of the posterior left chest, just behind the scapula, there are two radiodensities, which are somewhat linear and may represent a skin staples.
Multifocal ground-glass and patchy opacities involving both lungs, some areas which have demonstrated improvement in the right lung, however, some areas in the left lung which have worsened since the previous study.
Fluid collections with small foci of air as above within the left lobe of the liver.
A small pocket of fluid just under the incision line in the lower abdominal/pelvic midline.
Infection in these areas cannot be excluded.
Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
Preprocedure scanning demonstrates a 3-cm heterogeneous predominantly cystic collection in the left lobe of the liver.
Using ultrasound guidance, a 20-gauge spinal needle was advanced into the collection and approximately 5 cc of bloody fluid was aspirated with near complete collapse of the fluid collection.
The sample was sent for microbiologic analysis.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.
Moderate sedation was provided using 2 mg of Versed and 100 mcg of fentanyl in divided doses, and the patient's hemodynamic parameters were monitored continuously throughout the 20 minute intraservice time.
The attending radiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was present and supervising throughout.
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided aspiration of left hepatic fluid collection, with drainage of 5 cc of bloody fluid, sent for microbiologic analysis.
Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted to the Trauma service and taken to the operating room urgently for exploratory laparotomy, oversewing of stomach laceration, control of liver laceration bleeding and irrigation and closure of left chest laceration.
There were no reported complications.
Postoperatively he was taken to the Trauma ICU where he remained for several days.
He did have significant pain management issues; initially he was on PCA narcotics with IV for breakthrough and once he was able to tolerate po's he was changed to short acting narcotics.
He was noted to become very sleepy with higher doses of short acting narcotics.
The Acute Pain Service was consulted to optimize his pain regimen; Neurontin and NSAID's were added.
He was noted with a fever spike to >103 F; he was cultured, chest xray done which revealed a significant pneumonia.
Despite his fevers and consistent reinforcement from medical and nursing staff he contiued to leave the hopsital to smoke cigarettes; he did this multiple times during the day.
Social work was closely involved during his hospital stay because of issues surrounding his substance use, nature of the trauma and his homeless situation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.

Return to the Emergency room if you develop any fevrs, chills, headache, dizziness, increased shortness of breath, productive cough, chest pain, abdominal pain different from the pain you have been experiencing [**Last Name (un) 5720**] your recent surgery, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increased redness or drainage from your incision and/or any otehr symptoms that are concerning to you.
