Over course of a few minutes, she became unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli.
Head CT revealed a large subdural hematoma in the high left frontal parietal region with large subfalcine shift of 2 cm.
Hypertension 2.

HEENT - Left periorbital ecchymosis.
Neck - Hard cervical collar.
Lungs - CTA bilaterally.
No rebound or guarding.
No response to verbal stimuli, sternal rub, nasal tickle.
Blurring of temporal margins of optic discs.
III, IV, VI - No oculocephalic or oculovestibular reflexes.
IX, X - No gag reflex.
Decreased tone in bilateral upper extremities.
Increased tone in bilateral lower extremities.
No spontaneous movements.
Pertinent Results: Head CT [**11-12**] - There is a 23 mm thick mixed density convexity subdural hematoma on the left side.
There is extensive mass effect with a 16 mm shift of normally midline structures to the right.
There is distortion and dilatation of the ventricular system.
There is incipient left uncal herniation.
A small amount of fluid is visualized in the right maxillary sinus.

Head CT at [**Hospital3 10310**] revealed large subdural hemorrhage with subfalcine herniation.
On initial exam, there was evidence of brainstem compression with absent pupillary, corneal, oculocephalic and oculovestibular responses, as well as absent gag reflex.
Minimal respiratory effort above the ventilator.
Due to absent brainstem reflexes at presentation, she was felt not to be a surgical candidate.
Due to trauma as a likely cause of the patient's subdural hemorrhage, the medical examiner was notified.
