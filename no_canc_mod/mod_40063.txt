The right M1 segment of the MCA is hyperdense and there are multiple hyperdense branches in the sylvian fissure.
These findings are consistent with a large right MCA infarction with occlusion of the M1 and Sylvian branches.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, or mass.
There is no shift of midline structures.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with age-related atrophy.
No suspicious osseous lesions are identified.
CT PERFUSION: There is a large area of increased transit time in the right MCA distribution, extending into the anterior cerebral and posterior cerebral distributions.
There is decreased cerebral blood volume in the right MCA territory.
Thus, there is a matched deficit in the MCA distribution, with penumbra in the adjacent right ACA and MCA distributions.
HEAD AND NECK CTA: The right internal carotid artery is occluded from its bifurcation to the petrous portion of the internal carotid artery, where flow is reconstituted.
3D reconstructions demonstrate occlusion of the right MCA in the distal M1 region.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation.
There are atherosclerotic changes in the bilateral cavernous portions of the internal carotid arteries.
There is a 14mm nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid (4:71), and a calcification in the right lobe.
There is no cervical lymphadenopathy.
There are multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Large infarct involving most of the right MCA territory.
There is evidence of poor flow in the right ACA and PCA territories.
Occlusion of the right internal carotid artery from the carotid bifurcation to proximal to the petrous portion.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
14mm thyroid nodule.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 year-old right-handed man with PMH significant for BPH who presents with acute onset left sided facial droop and left hemiplegia, NIHSS 19.
Initial exam was notable for left neglect (visual and sensory), right gaze preference (but full EOMs), left facial weakness, left hemiplegia, and left sensory defecits greater in upper than lower extremity.
On CT, there was a large hypodensity noted in the right MCA territory.
CTA showed complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at the bifurcation with reconstitution distally as well as an occluded right middle cerebral artery.
His symptoms improved, with decreased neglect and slight finger flexion on left arm and [**3-11**] proximal and 4+/5 distal strength in the lower extremities.
Given the stability of his neurologic deficits he was transferred to floor on [**11-21**].
On the floor, he continued to have headaches and c/o nausea requiring IV ondansetron.
He was tolerating ground solid food, but severe nausea and depression precluded appropriate oral nutritional intake.
He will require continued monitoring and treatment of his lipids and sugars in order to decrease future stroke risk.
Thyroid nodule: incidental finding that should be followed by his PCP.
BPH: he did not remember the medication he was taking for BPH, he might require initiation of BPH medication if he begins having symptoms of urinary retention.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right MCA embolism with infarction Right ICA occlusion  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You had a stroke which affected the right side of your brain.
On imaging, you were found to have a 14mm nodule in your thyroid.
