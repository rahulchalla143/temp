HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve replacement times two, history of congestive heart failure who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in [**2153-3-26**] with respiratory distress.
His percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was complicated by hematoma in his intra-abdominal area and it was also complicated by renal failure, necessitating dialysis as well as multiple aspiration pneumonias.
Respiratory failure - On [**2153-5-20**], the patient had an acute worsening of his respiratory failure with a temperature of 101.7, respiratory rate in the 40s.
He was diagnosed with an aspiration pneumonia and [**Location (un) **] sepsis.
Eventually his gram negative rods grew out of his sputum which were speciated as Enterobacter and Pseudomonas.
Hypotension - The patient became hypotensive again on [**5-21**], thought secondary to pneumonia and sepsis.
Renal failure - The patient has become dialysis-dependent, receiving hemodialysis three times a week.
Abdominal hematoma - The patient initially suffered a large abdominal hematoma in the setting of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement and anticoagulation.
However, with maintaining the INRs in the 2.5 to 3 range, he has maintained his hematocrit as stable and he has not had any further intra-abdominal bleeding.
Mitral valve replacement/atrial fibrillation - The patient requires anticoagulation for prosthetic valve as well as atrial fibrillation.
Should his INR get above 3, Coumadin needs too be decreased because he has had large intra-abdominal bleeds in the setting of INR greater than 3.
Diabetes - The patient is tolerating tube feeds at goal and subsequently has required insulin requirement.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, mitral valve replacement.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
Prolonged ventilation secondary to congestive heart failure plus aspiration pneumonia, now status post trach and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, requiring a prolonged trach wean.
Restrictive lung disease thought secondary to ankylosing spondylitis.
History of gastrointestinal bleed and duodenal ulcer.
Intra-abdominal hematoma secondary to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and anticoagulation.
Renal failure, now necessitating hemodialysis.
History of brain abscesses, secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis.
