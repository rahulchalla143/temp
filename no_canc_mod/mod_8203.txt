Admission Date:  [**2144-1-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-1-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-2-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Allopurinol And Derivatives  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**] Chief Complaint: anemia, renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD endotracheal intubation CVL placement arterial line placement paracentesis  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 29436**] is a 55 y/o M w/ ESLD [**2-12**] EtOH cirrhosis c/b ascites, SBP on ppx, portal HTN w/ portal HTN-ive gastropathy, and hx chronic anemia requiring weekly transfusions, who presented to ED after labs from [**Hospital3 2558**] rehab drawn [**2144-1-2**] showed Hct 16 (baseline is 24) and Cr 2.0 (baseline 1.6).
He c/o chronic BRBPR but denies hemoptysis, lightheadedness, dizziness or tiredness.
He was recently admitted in [**2143-11-11**] for similar asymptomatic anemia (Hct 18.6) for which he received 3 units pRBCs and subsequently had hematemesis, requiring admission to the ICU where he declined EGD; he received 2 more units pRBCs.
Since then, he has had periodic labs and weekly transfusions.
No EKG changes.
In addition, since he was due for surveillance RUQ u/s, this was performed in the ER which showed ascites, splenomegaly and patent umbilical vein.
Patient has history of grade I varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient had no complaints.
No nausea or vomiting following episodes this morning.
Recent pRBC Transfusions: first [**2143-12-31**]: 2 units [**2143-12-24**]: Hct 16.5, received 2 units [**2143-12-17**]: 2 units [**2143-12-13**]: 2 units [**Date range (3) 29443**]: admitted for anemia, received 5 units  Past Medical History: -ETOH Cirrhosis diagnosed [**12/2142**]: c/b portal hypertension, jaundice, hypertensive gastropathy, grade 1 esophageal varices, ascites, SBP -angioectasias of ileum/rectum (LGIB, [**Last Name (un) **] [**2143-4-9**], biopsy neg)  -HTN -DJD of R hip -Gout -Bowel perforation: lap-assisted R colectomy [**5-18**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] for cecal perforation while on steroids for gout flare -Legally blind .
Physical Exam: VS: 97.1 100/54 77 14 100% RA GEN: chronically ill-appearing frail M w/ temporal wasting and marked limb muscle atrophy, appearing much older than his stated age wearing baseball hat in NAD, comfortable, appropriate HEENT: sclerae anicteric, EOMI, PERRLA LUNGS: CTAB/L no wheeze or rales CV: RRR nl S1 S2 no murmurs appreciated ABD: +BS, markedly distended but soft w/ + fluid wave, tympanic to percussion, non-tender no rebound/guarding.
+umbilical hernia  EXT: 4+ pitting edema B/L LE, pedal edema to upper thigh, massively edematous and unable to ambulate due to this, although no UE edema, w/ diffuse UE muscle wasting.
SINGLE SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The lung volumes are slightly low, but there are no focal airspace consolidations, pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
Mild vascular calcification is noted in the aortic knob.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the visualized thoracolumbar spine are mild-to-moderate.
Ascites secondary to cirrhosis with patent umbilical vein, unchanged.
Hyperechoic focus in the region of the gallbladder neck may represent a nonshadowing stone or polyp.
No complications.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-8-2**], the cardiac findings are similar (ascites and left pleural effusion are now seen).
No evidence of hydronephrosis or renal mass.
Unremarkable Doppler examination of the kidneys, with no findings to suggest renal artery stenosis .
Technically successful diagnostic paracentesis, with a total of 1.8 L of yellow ascites removed.
Multiple bilateral nodular pulmonary opacities, concerning for infection or aspiration.
Enteric contrast above the ETT balloon is presumably from gastroesophageal after from tube-adminstration of contrast for CT. 2.
Progressive bibasilar atelectasis, with near-complete right lower lobe  collapse.
Cirrhosis, borderline splenomegaly, and persistent large-volume ascites.
Pancolonic edema, likely due to third spacing.
Atrophic kidneys.
Mildly displaced left subcapital femoral fracture.
Previous pulmonary edema has resolved and right perihilar consolidation substantially decreased, probably a combination of clearing of edema and atelectasis.
I would recommend radiographic followup in case the findings are due to aspiration, which would put the patient at risk for pneumonia.
Left lower lobe consolidation has similarly improved, but warrants surveillance.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
Friability, petechiae and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with severe portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old male with end-stage liver disease  Alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by  ascites, gastrointestinal varicies, portal hypertension with portal hypertensive gastropathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis on ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis, chronic gastrointestinal hemorrhage from angiodysplasias, requiring frequent transfusions transferred from rehab with asymptomatic anemia and acute on chronic renal failure, now with hospital course complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleed from portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Prior to admission, his health care providers and insurance company impressed upon him the importance of designating a HCP given his advanced liver disease, to which he continually declined.
Mr. [**Known lastname 29436**] has shown no signs of recovery.
Shock- suspect from hypovolemia- [**2-12**] UGIB from portal hypertensive gastropathy.
EGD showed portal hypertensive gastropathy with active bleeding, and fungating mass in antrum of stomach.
Only evidence of infection at this time is development of asterixis this morning, suggesting possible SBP, although lactulose doses were missed overnight last night.
Underlying cirrhosis is also likely contributing via low SVR.
Working diagnosis was septic shock from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
This worsened long-standing hypervolemia, as patient was admitted with 4+ pitting edema in his lower extremities.
IR-guided paracentesis confirmed SBP.
Required mechanical ventilaiton in setting of unstable upper GI hemorrhage, and could not wean secondary to sedation and worsening hypervolemia.
Acute on chronic kidney injury: most likely prerenal in the setting of low blood volume.
However, ischemic ATN is also possible as pt was hypotensive in ED.
FeUrea is 16.6% on admission, which would be consistent w/ pre-renal azotemia.
Hepatorenal syndrome also on differential.
Renal team was consulted, and microscopic analysis suggested ATN as etiology of anuric renal failure.
Patient was not a candidate for renal replacement therapy given unstable GI bleed, and patient was not a transplant candidate given chronic anemia and lack of psychosocial support (see below).
Alcoholic cirrhosis:  Patient was never placed on transplant list given chronic GI bleed and lack of psychosocial support.
Held nadolol given bleed, held lasix, held lactulose in setting of GIB, GI irritant.
