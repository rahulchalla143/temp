Dynamic blood pool images were initially unremarkable, but subsequently demonstrated brisk bleeding first noticed at approximately 70 minutes.
The serpiginous nature of visualized bowel, and lack of progression to the rectum at 130 minutes, suggests site of bleeding is likely in the proximal small bowel.
There is, however, no evidence of bleeding proximal to the ligament of Treitz.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 86 yo F with a hx of recent R colectomy for Tumor T3N0 in [**9-10**] who presented with 1 episode of BRBPR on [**11-29**].
On the floor, she was noted to have 2 more episodes of bloody stools.
In the ICU she continued to have bleeding and underewent a tagged RBC scan which was positive and demonstrated bleeding in the jejunum at 70 mins.
The patient declined angiography and thus no procedure was performed.
GI thinks that the source is AVM and felt strongly that the patient needed a therapeutic intervention.
IR angio was willing to intervene but patient was nervous about signing consent.Then patient began to have hourly large maroon and red bowel movements.
She again had a positive scan but this time bleeding was seen in the colon and it was unclear if the bleeding was new or residual blood from earlier bleeding passing into the colon.
On the floor, she was monitored and remained stable, her last bm was on [**12-2**] which was guaiac pos (her stools will likely remain guaiac + given recent bleed) but did not show obvious bleeding.
Pt and family told that it is not possible if and when this will happen again but if she starts to have GI bleeding again, she should go to ED right away.
there was no fresh blood and stool was formed.
#Dementia - pt contined on Aricept and celexa.
Pt did not develop any delirium issues during hospitalization  #hx of CVA/Carotid stenosis/PFO - per Cards, not on coumadin given hx of bleeding before.
#FEN - Low salt, low fat diet #DVT pro - Ambulate frequently, pneumatic boots while in bed #Code status - DNR/DNI #Dispo - pt was weak and using cane/walker at home at baseline and after hospital stay, had more deconditioning.
We did a nuclear study that showed that bleeding is likely occuring in your small bowel.
The next step would have been to do an angiography and clot off the bleeding vessel but you were not sure if you wanted the procedure.
Your bleeding has stopped now.
After discussion w GI doctors and your cardiologist, we decided to resume your aspirin only.
Please return to ED if the bleeding recurrs, or if you have fevers, dizziness, abdominal pain  Followup Instructions: 1.
