Past Medical History: hepatitis C infection s/p subarachnoid hemorrhage chronic sudbural hematoma s/p PEG [**2164**] interstitial lung disease arthritis polymyositis  Social History: h/o polysubstance abuse   Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: 97.9    P 119   BP  138/89   RR 20      99% 2L   Wt 62kg Alert, not oriented, agitated, chronically ill appearing L frontal craniotomy site C/D/I CN 2-12 intact, moving all extremities, 5/5 strength Tachy, no murmurs CTA bilat Soft, nondistended, Diffuse tenderness, worst at G tube site, assoc erythema & crepitus, +purulent drainage  Pertinent Results: [**9-25**] CT head: Subacute to chronic left subdural hemorrhage causing moderate amount of mass effect in the left hemisphere and shift of normally midline structures to the right (approximately 5 mm).
There is probably also mild right ventricular dilatation.
There is no evidence of leak of air or contrast to the peritoneum or to the subcutaneous tissues.
There is a small amount of contrast and air exiting the stomach through the G-tube tract.
Inflammatory changes around the G-tube in the subcutaneous tissues without evidence of fluid collections.
Low-attenuation area with calcifications in the walls in the mid pole of the right kidney likely representing a cyst with thin calcifications in the wall versus a calyceal diverticulum with milk of calcium.
Atelectatic changes of the lungs.
No extraluminal contrast identified.
[**9-25**] wound culture: MRSA, CORYNEBACTERIUM SPECIES (DIPHTHEROIDS), PROBABLE ENTEROCOCCUS, LACTOBACILLUS SPECIES, YEAST  [**9-25**] stool culture: C diff+  WBC: 18.9 to 15 to 12.6  [**2166-9-29**] [**Month/Day/Year **]-10.2 (trough) & 32.6 (peak)  Brief Hospital Course: In ED, G tube site showed subcutaneous air but no fluid collections or fascial involvement to necessitate emergent surgery.
subdural drain placed on HD2 with release of high pressure fluid.
CARDS: initial tachycardia improved with hydration.
DC'd on atenolol for BP control.
It was felt on reviewing the patient's clinical course, careful examination of the patient and examination of her outside CT scan and repeat CT scan here that she did not have necrotizing fasciitis and that the subcutaneous air was related to escape of gastric air into the subcutaneous tissues.
Also her stomach was anchored to the abdominal wall likely from scar from a previous G-tube with a well-established tract, such that there was no intraabdominal infection.
Her WBC was felt to be related also to the c-diff and UTI which were treates.
She remained hemodynamically stable and without fever, and with decreasing WBC and resolution of the minimal erythema at the tube site.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 1-2 mg Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
