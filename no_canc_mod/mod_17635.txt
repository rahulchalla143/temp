Now having angina at rest that resolved with SL NTG.
Past Medical History: CAD HTN acoustic neuroma elev.

Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
Small secundum ASD.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate-severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Severely depressed LVEF.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo; apex - hypo;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
The patient had moderate hypokinesia of the septal wall on initial TEE probe placement.
However within a few minutes started developing EKG changes and hypotension associated severe wall motion abnormalities in the anterior, anterior septum, septum and inferior walls.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
4.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Anterior septum and septum are mildly hypokinetic.
Trace Mitral regurgitation present.
Few speckles of color flow across the interatrial septum.
On transfer of the patient from operating room table to bed there was diffuse ST elevation in all leads.
However TEE findings were unchanged (mild hypokinesis of septum and anterior septum noted as before) and the hemodynamics were stable.
Again are seen bilateral pleural effusions, which appear to have increased slightly in size since the prior radiograph.
There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery.
There is patchy bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
IMPRESSION:  Minimal increase in bilateral pleural effusions since the prior day's radiograph.
Tiny area of erythema noted at inferior aspect of sternal incision.
