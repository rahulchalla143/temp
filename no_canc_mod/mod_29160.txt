He underwent cardiac catheterization that showed left main tight stenosis with 3-vessel disease.
Past Medical History: Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Gout Chronic renal insufficiency Functional AV fistula Polycystic kidney disease Prior Inferior MI Hemodialysis AF w/ DCCV at [**Hospital1 **]  Social History: Lives with wife.
Physical Exam: 95.9 116/72 84 Regular  97% 3L GEN: Pleasant, Alert gentleman that is using accessory muscles HEENT: NCAT, Anicteric sclera, clear OP, +JVD, no bruits CARDIAC: Tachycardic, difficult to hear heart sounds, Nl S1-S2, LUNGS: Poor inspiratory effort, shallow breathing, crackles [**12-17**] way up lungs with some inspiratory wheezes ABD: Benign EXT: 2+ pulses, no edema.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior, lateral, distal septal, inferolateral and apical hypokinesis.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with severe three vessel disease.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve.
[**2148-11-19**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound Mild plaque/wall thickening is present in the carotid arteries bilaterally.
However, there is no significant carotid stenosis on either side (evaluated as less than 40% stenosis bilaterally).
[**2148-11-19**] Renal Ultrasound Bilateral renal cysts.
No evidence of normal renal parenchyma.
Underlying masses cannot be excluded.
[**2148-11-26**] CXR Stable left base effusion and atelectasis.
[**2148-12-2**] CAR Bilateral Pleural effusion, Stable cardiomegaly  [**2148-11-25**] EKG Sinus tachycardia Atrial premature complexes Ventricular premature complex Left atrial abnormality Consider left anterior fascicular block and/or pssible prior inferior myocardial infarction Nonspecific ST-T wave changes Since previous tracing of [**2148-11-25**], first degree A-V delay absent and ventricular ectopy seen  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2148-11-17**] for further management of chest pain.
This revealed a 90% stenosed left main, a 90% stenosed left anterior descending artery, a 90% stenosed circumflex, a 90% stenosed obtuse marginal and an occluded right coronary artery.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which revealed mild (<40%)plaque/wall thickening present in the carotid arteries bilaterally.
A renal ultrasound was also performed which showed Bilateral renal cysts, no evidence of normal renal parenchyma and underlying mass could not be excluded.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have episodes of atrial fibrillation which was treated with beta blockade.
On [**2148-11-20**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels and a mitral valve repair.
A fistulogram was performed with angiodilation of an outflow stenosis.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have runs of atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was started.
