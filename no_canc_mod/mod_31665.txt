Admission Date:  [**2188-9-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2188-9-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2118-2-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxia, hypotension and hypercarbia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post intubation on [**2188-4-4**] and coronary artery disease who presented to [**Hospital6 256**] with hypoxia and hypercarbia requiring intubation, as well as hypotension requiring pressors.
The patient presented several times this year to the Emergency Department for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, only once requiring intubation ([**4-5**]).
During his [**2188-4-4**] Medical Intensive Care Unit admission, stress echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization were performed to rule out ischemia as a cause of low O2 saturations.
The stress echocardiogram showed anterior abnormalities and the cardiac catheterization showed mild to moderate coronary artery disease with no flow limiting lesions; normal filling pressures, left ventricular ejection fraction equal to 55%.
On this admission, the patient states that he had had fevers the night prior to admission and increased wheezing and shortness of breath over the past week due to the "hot weather."
On the night prior to admission, the patient became very short of breath without relief from his albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
The patient denies any chest pain, hemoptysis, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema.
On the date of admission, the patient was playing cards with friends, had an episode of nausea and vomiting which was followed by the patient being found outside gasping for air and asking for oxygen.
His chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
His electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block which was intermittently seen on prior electrocardiograms during his [**2188-4-4**] admission.
Initial laboratories on admission include:  White blood cell count 12.9, 58% neutrophils, 32% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes and 3% eosinophils.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - PFTs in [**7-6**] were:  FVC equal to 85% expected, FEV1 equal to 52% expected and FEV1/FVC equal to 60% expected.
Coronary artery disease - ejection fraction equal to 55% in [**2188-4-4**], 1+ mitral regurgitation, hypokinetic basal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall on stress echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization showed 40% occlusion of the mid left anterior descending, 40% occlusion of the mid circumflex, 20% occlusion of the left main with a normal proximal left anterior descending and normal septal branches.
Lungs:  Severe expiratory wheezes throughout the chest anteriorly.
Heart:  Tachycardiac with a normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities had poor capillary refill.
No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit Team to be intubated for his acute respiratory failure, as well as the hypotension which initially required pressors.
As per the Medical Intensive Care Unit Teams evaluation, the patient likely experienced acute respiratory failure in the setting of rate related diastolic heart failure with likely demand ischemia, possibly related to increased use of his albuterol.
Follow-up chest x-ray on [**9-25**] showed clear lungs, no effusions and no congestive heart failure.
The patient began to have improved po intake with significantly increased urine output.
The patient should not use albuterol nebulizers as he gets anginal symptoms and tachycardic secondary to those nebulizers and likely becomes ischemic due to demand.
This is likely related to his episode of congestive heart failure.
The patient denies any chest pain at this time.
Psychiatric:  The patient has a history of depression and anxiety.
for a ten day course for treatment of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation/bronchitis.
Sputum showed moderate oropharyngeal flora, likely not a good sample.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with associated hypotension/resolved.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease.
