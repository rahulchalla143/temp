In the ED, the patient was found to have a new RLL infiltrate concerning for PNA (not seen on CXR [**5-2**] done at NEBH), received ceftriaxone/flagyl for community-acquired.
He was tachycardic and borderline hypotensive, unclear if SBP dropped below 90 mmHg at any point, lactate 2.9 on presentation down to 1.9 with IVF.
RLL process appeared worse on his second CXR (after fluid resuscitation).
Labs notable for: low nl WBC count with 16% bands; Hct drop from 42% by CBC to 35% by VBG after IVF; BUN 24/Cr 1.2, likely some renal insufficiency given his age and weight; AP 434, [**Doctor First Name **] 104; TnT 0.03, other enzymes pending; urine concentrated, acidic, otherwise clear.
APACHE II score around 14, with subsequent mortality estimate around 18%.
After receiving 5L NS in the ED, he was found to have worsening hypoxemia, currently only 90% on 100%NRB face mask.
ED staff to re-examine pt and check repeat (3rd) CXR to look for new pulm edema in setting of aggressive volume repletion, and to give Lasix if evidence of new CHF.

CLINICAL HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with fever and bandemia.
Basilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions are identified.
No focal liver lesion is identified.
Multiple low density lesions are seen within bilateral kidneys, the right is more complex with septation.
The pancreas demonstrates diffuse calcification, which may represent chronic pancreatitis.
A hiatal hernia is present.
Second portion of the duodenum is somewhat dilated, the remainder of the small bowel is normal in caliber, without evidence of obstruction.
There is small aneurysms of bilateral renal arteries.
No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
No free fluid or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
BONE WINDOWS: There is diffuse demineralization of the bones.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracolumbar spine.
THere is pagetoid change within both femurs and iliac bones.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Diffuse calcifications throughout the pancreas likely representing chronic pancreatitis.

FINDINGS: Lung volumes are low, with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
Linear atelectasis is seen in the left perihilar region.
There is an area of increased density in the right lung base, which may represent pneumonia or aspiration.
There is a tortuous aorta.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is definitely seen on single projection.
There is a marked levoconcave scoliosis of the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Increased density in the right lung base may represent pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis.

Hypoxemic resp failure: Cause of respiratory failure was pneumonia in setting of chronic respiratory failure and aspiration.
Sepsis: Presumed source was the PNA, no loci of infection found in abdomen/GU with negative CT abdomen/pelvis.
cdiff negative x 3 (although presumed infection due to infected partner), legionella neg x 1.
Sepsis resolved after 1st 24 hours after 11 liters of fluid resuscitation.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: During hospital course, patient had episode of afib in the setting of infection.
Elevated PTT: During hospital course was found to have an elevated PTT secondary to infection.
Values returned to [**Location 213**] and DIC workup negative, Continue to follow PT/PTT/INR, most likely secondary to poor diet, low vitamin K. .
Elevated alk phos: also in the setting of cholestasis and sepsis, which decreased from 434 to 248 to 232.
FEN: now cleared to have thickened liquids.
