LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild MS (MVA 1.5-2.0cm2).
Conclusions: Pre - CPB No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
There is hypokinesis of the inferolateral mid and apical segments, in addition to hypokinesis of the apex.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
He did have some rapid A Fib, and cardioversion was attempted, but unsuccessful.
He developed a phlebitis on his right forearm, presumable from an IV catheter which has been removed.
