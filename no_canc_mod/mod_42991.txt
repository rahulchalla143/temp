The bleeding progressed to bilateral involvement and he was not clearing the brisk [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was intubated for airway protection and a right Epistat was placed by ENT.
Bronchoscopy in the MICU showed minimal clot burden and was otherwise normal.
The patient did receive intermittent IV Lasix (20 mg IV x 2) given some volume overload concerns while in the MICU (net negative 1L for [**1-5**] prior to transfer, but positive LOS fluid balance of 3L).
He did have some ICU-delirium concerns requiring Haldol IV.
While on the Medicine floor, the patient was noted to have substantial hypoxia to the 80% on room air with evidence of an A-a gradient and persistent cough concerns.
He was dosed Lasix 60 mg IV, received Albtuerol nebs and his CXR showed stable frank pulmonary congestion with minimal bilateral effusions and no evidence of consoldiation.
Of note, a positive sputum culture from [**1-4**] showed sparse coagulase positive Staphylococccus.
Given his worsening acute hypoxic failure (ABG 7.43/27/55 on facemask) and concern for acute congestive heart failure decompensation, he was transferred to the CCU.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus.

No nausea or vomiting, denies abdominal pain.
No dysuria or hematuria.

Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 68M with a PMH significant for coronary artery disease (s/p PCI with stenting of LAD, [**4-/2195**]), alcoholic vs. infarct-related dilated cardiomyoatphy (EF 20-25%), s/p biventricular [**Year (4 digits) 3941**] placement in [**6-/2195**], persistent atrial fibrillation (s/p multiple cardioversions), h/o embolic renal infarct ([**2-/2195**]) with prior left atrial appendage thrombus, alcohol abuse who presented with severe epistaxis and coagulopathy requiring intubation for airway protection who was stabilized and subsequently extubated, now with worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis with AG-metabolic acidosis and acute renal insufficiency.
PLAN: # ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE - The patient initially presented with epistaxis requiring intubation for airway protection and was weaned from ventillation on [**1-5**] without issues.
Since floor transfer, the patient had developed worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure with oxygen desaturations to the 80s on facemask with exam showing elevated JVP, inspiratory crackles and peripheral edema; CXR with evidence of pulmonary congestion with bilateral pleural effusions concerning for overt overload.
On admission, the etiologies we considered were congestive heart failure exacerbation (most likely) vs. pulmonary embolism vs. ARDS vs. TRALI or late-transfusion related reaction vs. reactive airway disease vs. infection or pneumonia (coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] in sputum culture from [**2199-1-4**]).
His clinical exam and imaging suggested that an acute systolic failure exacerbation was most likely and we performed aggressive diuresis.
We deferred antibiotic treatment for his sputum culture, given that his leukocytosis improved and he remained afebrile.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION - The patient had a prior 2D-Echo from [**4-/2198**] showing LVEF of 20-25% with LV cavity that was moderately dilated with some severe regional LV systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior/inferolateral akinesis and basal inferoseptal akinesis with anterior and anterolateral hypokinesis elsewhere.
3+ TR and 1+ MR at that time was noted, with mild pulmonary artery HTN and no pericardial effusion.
This admission, he presented with coagulopathy and epistaxis requiring 4 units FFP and 1 unit PRBCs (net positive 3L for LOS on CCU transfer) with clinical exam suggestive of over volume overload.
Etiologies or triggers for acute decompensation would include: ACS/MI vs. infectious etiology (positive sputum culture) vs. volume overload in the setting of [**Year (4 digits) **] product administration vs. worsening valvular disease.
Based on our assessment, he appeared volume overloaded in the setting of product administration.
We also removed his LV pacing and a repeat 2D-Echo showed 18% improvement in his stroke volume without the pacing of the left ventricle, so this remained off.
# ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY, METABOLIC DERRANGEMENTS - The patient presented with a baseline creatinine of 0.7-0.9 with evidence of acute renal insufficiency to 1.2 trending to 1.7.
Patient also had an anion-gap metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory component (and primary respiratory alkalosis given work of breathing) with a lactate of [**6-26**], leukocytosis trending from 13 to 18 (afebrile) which was suggestive of poor forward flow and impaired perfuson of peripheral tissues in the setting of decompensated heart failure with or without an infectious source.
# ACUTE LIVER INJURY, TRANSAMINITIS ??????
The patient presented with no prior known liver dysfunction or evidence of liver failure on exam with mild transaminitis in the past attributed to Amiodarone use?
; acute liver injury with moderate-severe transaminitis noted on admission with AST 6854 and ALT 4790 with hyperbilirubinemia to 5.1 and mild jaundice.
Etiologies that we considered: congestive hepatopathy vs. ischemic hepatopathy (recent hypotension) or shock liver vs. acute viral hepatitis vs. toxin-mediated or medication-induced (Amiodarone) vs. alcoholic liver disease vs. metabolic.
No prior ultrasounds or imaging was noted in our system.
No sequelae of chronic liver disease and no evidence of ascites was noted.
Evidence of natural immunity to hepatitis B and prior hepatitis A exposure was noted based on hepatitis serologies.
We employed supportive management given his evidence of transaminitis with coagulopathy and hyperbilirubinemia with hypoalbuminemia.
Hepatitis serologies (HbsAg negative, HbsAb positive, HbcAb positive, HCV-Ab negative, HAV-Ab positive) were consistent with prior hepatitis A exposure and immunity due to natural infection of hepatitis B.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS - the patient presented without initial leukocytosis; but had coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus sputum culture, MSSA ([**1-4**]) with WBC trend from 13 to 18 (94% neutrophilia) this admission; but he remained afebrile.
Infectious work-up in the setting of acute decompensated failure was reassuring and we deferred antibiotic therapy.
He steadily improved, with normalizing WBC and he remained afebrile this admission.
His CXR showed some concern for consolidation, but this was conservatively monitored and not treated.
# CORONARIES - Coronary angiography last performed in [**4-/2195**] showed a right dominant system with an LMCA with modest calcification, the LAD had a hazy 80-90% stenosis in its proximal portion and was stented.
The LCx was a non-dominant vessel with a 60% mid-segment lesion in the AV groove.
The RCA was a dominant vessel with mild luminal irregularities.
Patient had no complaints of chest pain this admission, but he did have notable bleeding concerns on admission.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, RHYTHM - The patient had placement of a biventricular pacing device-[**Year (4 digits) 3941**] with OptiVol in [**2195**] with last interrogation in [**10/2198**] that was reassuring; patient is atrially paced with biventricular pacing.
Interrogated on [**1-7**] (this admission) which showed no arrhythmia events.
History of persistent atrial fibrillation s/p multiple cardioversions (last in [**2195**]) and on chronic Amiodarone therapy.
His Coumadin was resumed on [**1-10**] when his coagulopathy had resolved and he had no further bleeding concerns.
# SEVERE EPISTAXIS, S/P IR-GUIDED EMBOLIZATION - The patient presented with left-sided posterior epistaxis and coagulopathy with INR of 5.2 requiring ENT consultation and Epistat packing bilaterally.
The bleeding progressed and required IR-guided successful embolization of the right sphenopalatine artery and embolization of the left sphenopalatine artery and left desecending palatine artery utilizing coils ([**1-4**]) without further bleeding concerns.
He had no further bleeding concerns and his epistaxis improved.
# HYPERTENSION - Home regimen includes ACEI, beta-blocker, loop diuretic; we restarted his agents as clinically indicated given acute CHF decompensation.
# ALCOHOL ABUSE HISTORY - He appears to have a history of chronic alcohol abuse with current moderate-social alcohol intake; monitored for withdrawal this admission, and he had no evidence of withdrawal.
Lidocaine level sent (patient transiently on Lidocaine gtt given his ventricular tachycardia) and should be followed-up by Cardiology.
He had episodic somnolence while being dosed this medication.
Started Aldactone 25 mg PO daily given his heart failure symptoms and heart failure class.
Patient remains on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
