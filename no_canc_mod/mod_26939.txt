Admission Date:  [**2128-8-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-8-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-11-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: sepsis, altered mental status, renal failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 79 yo female with pmhx significant for paranoid schizophrenia, dementia, a-fib, diabetes, who was brought to the ED from her nursing home for worsening renal failure, increased confusion, and a supratherapeutic INR of 6.8.
A UA was suggestive of infection with >50 WBCs, many bacteria.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn and the pt was given a dose of Vanc, Levo, and Flagyl for empiric coverage.
CXR showed atlectasis, no consolidation.
Past Medical History: Afib - on coumadin Hypertension Hypothyroidism NIDDM psychotic senile dementia paranoid schizophrenia cataracts OU B12 deficiency Knee effusion  Social History: babbles at baseline, feeds self  Family History: Non contributory  Physical Exam: vitals: temp 97.3/ bp 86/46/ 128/ 21/ 96% on 2L GEN: awake, moaning, non-verbal, obese HEENT: atraumatic, anicteric, dry mucosa NECK: no JVD, no LAD, no carotid bruits CV: tachy, irregular, no murmurs appreciated LUNGS: rhonchi B/L at bases, no crackles,  no wheeze, no accessory muscle use ABD: distended, soft, no rebound, no guarding, hypoactive BS EXT: warm, dry.
No erythema or increased warmth.
SKIN: Multiple ecchymoses, chronic venous stasis changes on LE B/L NEURO: awake, non-verbal.
Toes downgoing B/L, reflexes diminished B/L, no myoclonus.
Linear opacity at the lung bases consistent with scarring or atelectasis.
No consolidation is seen.
[**8-12**] KUB: There is massive dilation of the stomach and some of the small bowel loops also appear dilated.
Diffusely distended air-filled bowel loops are noted, which appear chronic and nonspecific in character.
There is no definitive evidence of acute obstruction or ileus.
[**8-13**] RUQ US: Cholelithiasis with ultrasound findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 79 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted to [**Name (NI) 153**] for presumed sepsis, uncontrolled a-fib with [**Name (NI) 5509**], increased confusion.
# Sepsis - the patient initially presented with hypotension and met SIRS criteria, with most likely source of infection being the urine on admission; however, diagnostic imaging on HD2 revealed eviwith evidence of cholecystitis.
# Hypotension - BP was initially somewhat responsive to IVFs although tachycardia did not improve.
UOP was adequate and stable; however was also thought be secondary to increased BUN.
The patient was given fluid boluses prn for resuscitation.
# abdominal distension: pt had evidence of increasing abdominal distension with somewhat localizing pain in the RUQ (difficult to assess per pt's mental status) with KUB showing evidence of dilated loops of bowel.
Admission labs with evidence of elevated transaminases, bilirubins, amylase and lipase.
On HD 2 RUQ US showed multiple gallstones and evidence of cholecystis, not ammenable to percutaneous drainage.
Obstructive gallstones were believed to explain elevated pancreatic and liver enzymes, and possible SBO as well.
# Acute renal failure- patient with baseline creatinine 1.1 6 months ago, most recent creatinine 1.28 in [**Month (only) 547**].
Renal failure was thought to be pre-renal with possible ATN component given hypotension in ED.
[**8-12**] renal US with e/o minimal hydronephrosis.
# Altered mental status- per nursing home, pt has had increased confusion from baseline dementia/schizophrenia.
Through her hospital course, the infection and renal failure were treated as above.
# A-fib with [**Month/Day (2) 5509**]- Patient with known a-fib, on AC with coumadin, rate controlled with lopressor.
Esmolol drip was started briefly on HD2 at low-dose to treat tachycardia for concern for demand ischemia; however, the patient did not tolerate this well with subsequent drop in BP so this was discontinued.
# Metabolic acidosis- with elevated anion gap.
Likely secondary to uremia as pt with normal lactate, no ketones on UA, no known ingestions.
# Hyponatremia- likely hypovolemic hyponatremia by exam.
hyponatremia was resolved by HD2 with IVF administration.
# Supratherapeutic INR- secondary to coumadin for a-fib, trending down from 11 to 4.4 with 2.5 mg Vitamin K given at NH.
# Anemia- normocytic, baseline hct 31-34.
Guaiac negative in the ED, no iron studies or colonoscopy/EGD on record.
There was no active signs of bleeding.
# Elevated troponin- pt poor historian but flat CK less suggestive of ACS.
Likely troponin leak from demand ischemia related to a-fib with [**Name (NI) 5509**], pt has had elevated troponin to .07 in the past.
# Code- DNR/DNI with no [**Name (NI) 14938**] or pressors.
