However, there is no malalignment or retropulsion of fracture fragments.
If focal neural deficits localize to the cervical spine, MRI may be useful to exclude cord contusion.
Extensive pelvic fractures as described above, most notably a markedly displaced anterior column right acetabular fracture, with large extraperitoneal hematoma causing mass effect on the bladder and uterus.
No evidence of bladder rupture or active arterial bleeding in the pelvis.
L1 compression fracture with 4 mm of retropulsion.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
No evidence of traumatic injury to intra-abdominal organs.
[**6-20**] XR Pelvis 5 views: There is a comminuted fracture involving the right iliac bone, including a vertical component through the main portion of the iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] and upper iliac crest, with displacement; and a comminuted fracture involving the supra-acetabular iliac bone, extending into the joint.
There is equivocal slight right SI joint diastasis.
No left SI joint or pubic symphysis diastasis is detected.
There is increased soft tissue density surrounding the right hip laterally, likely reflecting the presence of soft tissue edema and hemorrhage in the setting of the fractures.
[**6-20**] XR R Knee: There is mild soft tissue swelling anterior to the patella.
No fracture, dislocation, or focal bone lesion is identified.
[**6-22**] XR pelvis: Thirteen fluoroscopic images from the operating room of the right hemipelvis show interval placement of a fracture plate across the iliac bone extending into the iliopectineal line and pubic symphysis on the right side.
[**6-23**] XR abd: Satisfactory placement of an infrarenal retrievable IVC filter with no apparent complications.
No spinal cord signal abnormality is identified.
There is prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
[**6-24**] XR pelvis: Fracture plate across the iliac bone extending into the iliopectineal line and pubic symphysis on the right side is in near anatomic alignment, with fracture line still visible.
No evidence of hardware failure.
CT head and CXR neg, C5-6 teardrop fx on CT neck, L1 fx and mult pelvic fx on CT torso.
The patient was admitted to the TSICu under Attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], for serial HCT due to retroperitoneal hematoma.
Orthopedics were consulted for the pelvic fractures and decided upon operative management.
Went to OR and had open reduction internal fixation of right acetabular fracture, both columns and removal of traction pin.
An IVC filter was placed by Interventional Radiology without complications.
HOD6: POD 3: Neurosurgery determined there was no further neurosurgical evaluation or intervention warranted and signed off, requesting follow up with them in 6 weeks.
She is to wear TLSO at all times for L1 fracture and a hard C collar at all times as well.
She was eating a regular diet, voiding on her own, and had her pain controlled with oral medications.
Call your doctor or return to the Emergency Department right away if any of the following problems develop:  * New or worsening pain in your head, chest or abdomen (belly).
* Difficulty breathing or fevers greater than 101 degrees (F) * Numbness, tingling, weakness or shooting pain in an arm or leg.
