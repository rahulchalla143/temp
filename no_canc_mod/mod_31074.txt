HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 24735**] is an 83-year-old African American Male with a history of [**State 531**] Heart Association Class IV- heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2096**] with re-do in [**2108**].
Atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.2, status post AICD with biventricular pacer placed [**8-17**] who presented with hyperthermia and a temperature of 107 degrees.
The patient was recently discharged from the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service on [**2115-7-9**], the day before admission, after a three week hospital stay for acute congestive heart failure exacerbation complicated by difficulty diuresing and low urine output.
The patient was noted to have some convulsive and twitching movements in his facial muscles that were not rhythmic and in his extremities and was therefore given 4 mg of Versed intravenous and 4 mg Ativan intravenous with no improvement.
At this time the neurological exam revealed the patient to be unresponsive, not following commands, not withdrawing from pain but with spontaneous movements.
Coronary artery disease.
A Persantine MIBI on [**2115-4-29**] was noted to have moderate reversible defects in the inferior base, global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 21% with uninterpretable electrocardiogram changes secondary to a paced rhythm.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Class IV- congestive heart failure.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of around 2.
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.
Cervical spondylosis.
History of atrial fibrillation, status post implantable cardioverter, defibrillator with biventricular pacemaker in [**2114-8-16**].
Status post knee surgery and spinal cyst removal.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat he had bilateral cataracts, left greater than right with no pupillary response on the left and a sluggish pupillary response to light on the right.
There were bloody secretions in the oropharynx and a very poor dentition.
There was significant suborbital edema bilaterally.
Neck:  Supple with full range of motion and no elevation of the jugular venous pulsation.
Cardiovascular exam was without tachycardia with a regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No third or fourth heart sounds were heard.
Extremities:  1+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema in the feet and ankles.
Neurological exam revealed an unresponsive patient.
The patient did not respond to voice or commands.
No withdrawal to painful stimuli.
Chest x-ray showed an enlarged heart, no pleural effusions, patchy opacities bilaterally with less basilar atelectasis.
Head CT revealed no acute intracranial pathology.
Electrocardiogram revealed ventricular paced rhythm at 83 beats per minute, no acute T-waves or ST segment changes.
IMPRESSION:  83-year-old male with Class IV congestive heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 20%, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, status post AICD with biventricular pacer admitted with severe hyperthermia.
The patient's hyperthermia was thought to be due to heat stroke from the increased temperature in his apartment and his limited ability to regular his temperature secondary to his decreased cardiac output and chronic diuretic use.
Workup for septic or toxic etiologies was negative.
The patient has no history of taking neuroleptic medications.
A CT of his head showed no acute bleed or stroke.
An EEG done showed diffuse swelling and no seizure activity.
There was no further seizure like activity noted on exam and due to the lack of seizure activity and the likelihood that the seizure were due to his hypothermia the Dilantin was discontinued on [**2115-7-13**].
It was felt that the patient's fever was due to heat stroke as there were no signs of infection or sepsis and and developed during his stay.
The patient was continued on Levofloxacin and Metronidazole for possible aspiration pneumonia.
The patient had acute on chronic renal failure with a creatinine of 4.0 up from his baseline of 2.2.
The acute renal failure was most likely due to a combination of factors including rhabdomyolysis with myoglobin induced tubular damage (CK 1671), hypotension with pre-renal failure and ATN.
A subsequent electrolyte panel and Arterial blood gases showed metabolic alkalosis so his fluids were changed to normal saline.
The patient was 9 liters positive and still aneuric.
Renal ultrasound was done and showed no Foley in the bladder.
After voiding the patient began to decrease his respiratory rate and increase his tidal volume.
The following day the patient's exam was consistent with congestive heart failure so he was given Lasix 160 intravenous with no urine output.
Foley was again flushed with no return.
Considering his history of coronary artery disease he was transfused one unit packed red blood cells to maintain a hematocrit greater then 30.
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with Troponin of 27, CK of 1881.
A lead electrocardiogram showed paced rhythm and could not be evaluated with ST changes.
In addition the patient was having more trouble oxygenating which was thought to be the result of his congestive heart failure and he was mildly hypertensive with a blood pressure of 160/80.
It was later noted that the increased blood pressure and decreased oxygen sat was likely secondary to pain from urinary retention.
He was therefore, extubated on [**2115-7-12**] with no complications.
Speech Pathology was consulted to evaluate for aspiration precautions.
