History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 52719**] is an 86-year-old female with a history of critical aortic stenosis, systolic congestive heart failure, and deconditioning due to arthritis, who presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2159-11-17**] with shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
These symptoms were suspected to be due a CHF exacerbation from her critical AS.
This was her second CHF exacerbation with the first being in [**9-/2159**] when she was first diagnosed with AS.
She has never had angina or syncope however she has had lower energy level for at least a year that she was not able to explain.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath and further evaluation of her severe AF.
Of note, she was also complaining of URI symptoms which resolved during that admission, except for persistent cough.
She did not have any fevers or chills.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation of operative candidacy for aortic valve replacement.

When she was in her 20's she smoked but "never inhaled" - EtOH: rare - Illicits: none  Family History: Father died of MI at 74 Mother died of ADPKD at age 37 No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
RR, [**3-11**] crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur that radiates to carotids.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema in LLE, 1+ pitting edema in RLE SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

The LAD had a 50% mid-to-distal stenosis; there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the diagonal branch.
The large dominant RCA had a 30-40% stenosis in the proximal portion of the vessel.
4) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated left-sided filling pressures, with a mean wedge pressure of 35 mmHg, and marked pulmonary arterial hypertension, with a PA systolic pressure of 75 mmHg and a mean PA pressure of 49 mmHg.
These findings are consistent with aortic stenosis.
There was also marked systemic arterial hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 188/80 mmHg.
5) Estimated cardiac index by Fick principle was normal at 2.4-2.6 l/min/m2.
Critical aortic stenosis with markedly-elevated wedge pressure.
In the meantime, would recommend diuresis and volume status optimization.
Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate.
Left lower lobe consolidation that potentially may represent atelectasis, although infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.
Retrosternal component of large thyroid goiter, approximately 7 cm below the thoracic inlet.
Extensive coronary calcifications and aortic valve calcifications.
Compression fracture of lower thoracic vertebral body, most likely T11.
No other evidence of periradicular granulomas .
[**2159-11-28**] Intra-op TEE Conclusions There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta and complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
Trace paravalvular leak is seen.
There is trace aortic regurgitation.
There is echodense material around the aortic bioprosthesis however without blood flow into the echodense space consistent with normal postoperative changes.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade.
Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with borderline left ventricular hypokinesis.
Mild global right ventricular hypokinesis.

ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== # Acute on Chronic Heart Failure due to Critical Aortic Stenosis: - Will undergo AVR on [**2159-11-28**] - Patient improving with diuresis down to 89.4kg (197 lbs) from 213lbs on presentation to OSH.
# Cough/Wheeze: PFTs consistent with obstructive pattern.
Patient has no history of asthma or COPD and only minimal smoking history.
ABG on room air showed metabolic alkalosis (likely contraction alkalosis from diuresis).
No evidence of chronic C02 retention.
- Treatment of CHF as above.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== - Patient will need 8 week chest xray to evaluate left lower lobe consolidation seen on CT chest [**2159-11-23**] - Patient should follow-up with endodontist after discharge from rehab to evaluate 4th tooth.
PCP should consider further workup including possibly repeat PFTs if patient with persistent cough after improvement in cardiac function.

By the time of discharge on POD# 8 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
