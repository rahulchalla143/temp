HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old gentleman who presented with three days of abdominal pain and distention.
No nausea or vomiting.
The pain started three days prior to admission and was diffuse followed by abdominal distention.
He had no fevers or chills but did not have decreased appetite.
He noted the increased distention and was brought to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room for evaluation.
Bilateral inguinal hernia repairs.
Peripheral neuropathy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Abdomen was firm and distended with mild right-sided tenderness.
No percussion tenderness.
Abdominal x-ray showed dilated loops of small bowel with air/fluid levels.
Abdominal CT showed dilated small bowel with small pockets of free air, positive pneumatosis, and positive portal venous gas with distended small bowel.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction with a secondary diagnosis of ileus secondary to gallstone pancreatitis.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2190-2-28**], with a preoperative diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction and a postoperative diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction.
Findings included adhesive bands crossing the small bowel at the inferior portion of the prior midline incision.
It was noted that there were some areas of ischemic bowel, but nothing was gangrenous.
All small bowel was viable.
It was thought that the fever was likely due to pneumonia, and sputum cultures were taken which eventually grew out Citrobacter.
