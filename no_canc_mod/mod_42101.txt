Name:  [**Known lastname 2518**],[**Known firstname 2519**] N              Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 2520**]  Admission Date:  [**2147-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-1-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Levofloxacin / Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 203**] Addendum: Pt's discharge was delayed by ongoing tachycardia which was treated with further increases in her metoprolol to 100 PO tid.
This was based on the assessment that the risk of an elevated INR would be greater to her given her history of GI bleed and her poor ambulatory status than the reduction in risk of thromboembolic stroke from atrial fib/flutter.
