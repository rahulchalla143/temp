HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old male with diabetes, morbid obesity, CAD status post multiple MIs, and a history of V-fib arrest in [**9-2**].
He ruled in for a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction with troponin of 0.26.
On day one, he had a V-fib arrest/hypotension.
He was extubated, and then transferred to [**Hospital1 536**] after recovery on the [**9-11**] for cardiac catheterization and evaluation for ICD placement.
The Clostridium difficile colitis and renal failure improved, and the patient went for cardiac catheterization on the 17th.
Decision was made not to place ICD as the V-fib arrest was thought to be likely secondary to ischemia.
At 4 a.m., the patient noted an acute onset of shortness of breath and [**3-11**] dull chest pain.
The chest pain and shortness of breath persisted all morning on the day of admission to CCU.
Chest x-ray showed diffuse CHF.
Patient was admitted for elective intubation to the CCU, and then was to go to catheterization laboratory to rule out a LAD stent occlusion.
In general, he is an obese male, intubated, and sedated.
Chest x-ray demonstrated mild CHF with bibasilar effusions.
EKG showed paced rhythm in the 60s, no ST elevations or T wave changes.
Cardiovascular:  Patient underwent catheterization following transfer to the MICU, which demonstrated thrombolic occlusion within the distal left anterior descending artery stent which was treated with angioplasty.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis.
There still was severe disease in the distal left anterior descending artery, but no dissection.
During his course in the MICU, however, the beta blocker was later D/C'd when the patient became hypotensive and septic.
Patient required dopamine earlier on in his course during the MICU for low blood pressures.
Patient spiked a temperature and became septic on [**2173-8-29**].
Cultures have been drawn during these fever spikes and grew MRSA in aerobic bottles x2.
Patient had been treated previously with levofloxacin for questionable aspiration pneumonia as well as Flagyl for questionable anaerobes and aspiration.
The patient received Tobramycin on [**8-29**] for continued antibiotics.
ID was concerned for infective endocarditis on this patient as well as question of MRSA infection on the wire in his pacer.
They recommend continue to treat with Vancomycin and following his levels concerning his renal failure which began at the outside hospital.
Patient also developed Clostridium difficile, and was treated with p.o.
