BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM  Small Bowel Obstruction The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
Given her history of hepatic sarcoidsis, the patient underwent CT of abd/pelvis revealing a transition point in RLQ pelvis with fecalization of SB proximal to this pt.
Of note, prior CT on [**12-10**] had revealed cirrhosis and portal HTN with TIPS shunt occluded.
Intraoperatively she was found to have some adhesions with dilated loops of bowel but no transition point; the small bowel was dilated to the extent that an enterotomy was required in order to decompress the bowel and close the abdomen.
Esophageal Varices/Anemia/Portal Gastropathy She also had an EGD on [**12-28**] that revealed 3 nonbleeding grade 2 varices in distal esophagus and portal hypertension gastritis w small blood clot in stomach; no active bleeding.
She had a relatively stable anemia that trended down around [**1-20**] that was thought to be morst likely secondary to slow ooze from portal gastropathy.
On [**1-1**] she was noticed to be increasingly tender without bowel movements; KUB revealed persistent dilated small-bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels concerning for persistent small-bowel obstruction or post-operative ileus.
Acute Renal Failure    While on surgical service, the patient was also noted to have an increase in her creatinine from 1.3 to 2.2; this was thought secondary to large fluid losses from her JP drain in her abdomen; she was started on replacements 1/2 cc/cc with improvement in her creatinine to 1.2 on [**1-1**].
She was given albumin 62.5g on [**1-19**] and bicarb and blood on [**1-20**] for volume rescusitation.
The gap is likely from the renal failure and the non-gap from her diarrhea.
Hepatic Encephalopathy On the floor the patient was noticed to be increasingly less talkative with a dull affect, thought to be consistent with past episodes of hepatic encephalopathy.
She was given high dose lactulose PR with initial improvement in her mental status.
Secondary Bacterial Peritonitis    The patient had been improving, and so her NGT was discontinued.
Unfortunately, she then developed increasing abdominal pain; on [**1-5**] she underwent repeat CT scan of abd/pelvis that revealed persistent dilation of multiple loops of small bowel with wall thickening and mesenteric edema without a definitive transition point concerning for a mixed mechanical and functional obstruction, a cirrhotic liver with TIPS and portal hypertension, such as splenomegaly, and diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Cefepime was later changed to Meropenem due to concern for precipitating seizure.
The patient had been having low-grade fevers in the setting of steroids but no mental status changes at the time.
She was thought to have infected peritoneal fluid possibly secondary to the enterotomy, though the etiology is not completely clear.
Serial paracenteses were performed until pt no longer had evidence of bacterial peritonitis with <250 polys in ascitic fluid.
That said, the patient continued to have low-grade fevers throughout even though she was still on steroids (tapered to her home dose from admission) and multiple antibiotics.
She did have some tenederness on abdominal exam on [**1-15**], and so she underwent another CT scan that revealed increased ascites compared to prior study but no focal fluid collection to suggest abscess formation.
The patient did have diffuse anasarca and mesenteric edema; the small bowel was mildly dilated with mild bowel wall thickening, decreased since prior study, and there was no pneumatosis or free air.
Hypernatremia The patient also became hypernatremic to a high of 154 on [**1-14**](she was started on free water replacements), likely intravascularly depleted given her high BUN, and hyperchloremic with a low bicarbonate; the later two likely secondary to previous normal saline/TPN loads.
Altered mental status On [**1-13**] the patient was noted to be increasingly abulic, though paranoid appearing.
Given the results the patient did not undergo paracentesis even though this was one possible etiology for her AMS.
Her mental status waxed and waned with occasional episodes of increased awareness and pronouncing her name.
Her altered mental status was initially thought to be due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy [**3-15**] liver disease, infection, and underlying brain disease.
Her EEG on [**1-15**] was consistent with this and negative for seizure per neurology although there was a questionable focus in the frontal lobe.
Patient had paracentesis [**1-19**] with reduction in white cells but persistent bacterial peritonitis and gram negative rods on gram stain.
Patient had been on cefepime for klebsiella and [**Month/Day (4) 29565**] for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] since her initial tap.
Neurology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and initially did not think this was seizure activity but EEG was ordered to r/o myoclonic seizure.
It was unclear what precipitaed seizures but may have been form underlying brain disease (h/o CVA), hepatic encephalopathy, or med effect.

You were found to have a small bowel obstruction which required surgery to lyse adhesions in your abdomen.
You later developed an infection in your abdomen and were started on antibiotics.
A repeat paracentesis on [**2111-1-27**] showed that this infection had resolved but you should continue to tkae antibiotics through [**2-1**].
During your hospital course, you also developed kidney failure which may have been from one of the medications you were taking.
You also were confused so you were treated with lactulose and [**Month/Year (2) 8005**] for hepatic encephalopathy.
We held your diuretics (Lasix and Aldactone) since you had impaired kidney function.
We decreased your gabapentin to 300 mg once daily because of your renal function.
Please return to the ER or call your primary care doctor if you develop confusion, abdominal pain, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerning symptoms.
