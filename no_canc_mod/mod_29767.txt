Day prior to admission she had acute onset of abdominal pain while in bed.
Pain persisted overnight and worsened the next day so came to the ED.
Denies fever, chills, NS, dysuria, c/p, palpitations, back pain or other focal complaints.
In the ED, intial VS were T98.5, BP 164/78, HR 63, RR 18, O298%RA, Pain [**8-6**], exam notable for absence of CVA TTP.

CT scan of abdomen showed stranding around the R-kidney.
She reported [**8-6**] pain only with movement, but was otherwise comfortable.
ROS: + increased abdominal distension, otherwise no change to bowel habits.
During her hospital course her abdominal pain was felt to be radicular pain due to lumbar spinal stenosis.
In addition, on [**4-7**] she also developed new bilateral lower extremity weakness concerning for cauda equina compression given evidence of this on MRI.
She also developed altered mental status starting sunday [**4-8**].
She also developed progressive hyponatremia and hyperkalemia as well as worsening renal failure.
On the day of transfer to the MICU ([**4-9**]) she had a tunnelled line placed in IR due to lack of access as well as possible need for dialysis given worsening renal function.
ESRD due to diabetic nephropathy and hypertension s/p renal transplant [**2147**].

[**2153-4-12**] CXR New opacity in the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac area suggests aspiration given the clinical concern.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2153-4-10**] ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %) with more significant hypokinesis of the septum The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.
The severity of aortic regurgitation has increased.
[**4-10**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a slow and disorganized background indicative of a mild encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There are no epileptiform features noted.
[**4-9**] CXR: CVL tip at right atrium, no evidence of pneumothorax or apical hematoma, cardiomegaly still present, interval development of RLL opacity most likely aspiration or aspiration/pleural effusion, mild volume overload in perihilar areas.
[**2153-4-8**] MRI Head: No evidence of acute ischemia.
Extensive periventricular white matter  disease, consistent with small vessel ischemic change with more defined lacunar-type infarcts also noted.
Slight interval increase in fluid within the left sphenoid sinus, should be correlated for any signs of acute sinusitis clinically.
[**2153-4-7**] MRI CTL spine: Degenerative disc disease with evidence of spinal stenosis and spinal cord compression in the cervical spine.
Spinal stenosis and cauda equina compression in the lumbar spine.
Hyperintensity of lumbar intervertebral discs most marked at L2-3 and L4-5.
Although these likely reflect degenerative disc disease, the possibility of infection cannot be excluded.
A preliminary report was issued that read "spinal stenosis at C4 through C7 with severe disc protrusion and ligamentum flavum calcification effacing thecal sac, worst at C6-7.
No cord signal change.
Thoracic cord no compression.
If clinical suspicion for acute/subacute stroke, consider MR for further characterization.
The white matter changes appear well defined, markedly hypodense, and likely chronic.
I agree that MR may be helpful if there is continued concern of possible acute infarction.
Interval slight decrease in the pelvocaliectasis.
Prominent cisterna chyli.
Atherosclerotic vascular changes.
Persistent right renal cyst.

Acute on chronic kidney disease s/p transplant: Concerning for transplant rejection with worsening hyperkalemia and volume overload.
Other consideration is NSAID induced given that pt was taking NSAIDS for acute gout flare prior to admission.
Other possibilities are prerenal failure due to adrenal insfficiency vs poor cardiac output vs volume depletion.
FENA is consistent with prerenal etiology.
No evidence of post renal obstruction.
Pt did not require any additional sessions of hemodialysis, and temporary HD line was removed on day of discharge by IR.
# Acute mental status change: This was thought to be secondary to hyponatremia and uremia in setting of worsening acute on chronic renal failure.
MRI Head was negative for acute etiology.
Confusion resolved after several sessions of hemodialysis and resolution of hyponatremia and uremia.
Depressed EF - Can't exclude CHF as cause of renal failure, however stroke volume 5.5L per minute.
Unlikley that there has been an acute demise in her cardiac function, by exam not hypoperfusing, bounding pulses, limited treamtnet options.
Cards was consulted, and did not think her cardiac function was the cause for her worsening renal failure.
Hyponatremia: Thought hypovolemic hyponatremia by the floor team, with urine lytes consistent with prerenal syndrome.
Due to altered mental status she was transferred to the ICU for hypertonic saline.
Patient was given stress dose steroids, TSH was normal, ECHO with depressed EF to 40%.
Was likely secondary to acute on chronic renal failure and fluid overload.
# Back/Abdominal Pain: On admission, was initially thought to be secondary to pyelonephritis given dirty u/a and localized to lower abdomen, but given negative urine cultures and imaging, now thought to be most likely related to lumbar spinal stenosis and radiculopathy seen on CT abdomen/pelvis.
Pt experienced mental status change and developing weakness toward beginning of admission, and Neurology and Neurosurgery were consulted.
MRI head was negative for acute etiology.
Neurosurgery recommended conservative management during acute mental status change and uremia.
Following management of electrolyte abnormalities in the MICU, pt was transferred back to the floor with improvement in pain, but persistent weakness in hand grip and lower extremities.
Neurosurgery re-evaluated pt, and felt that though symptoms persisted, pt did show improvement, and thus would be able to consider elective surgery in outpt setting.
Pt will be following up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Neurosurgery to discuss possible surgical management of the cervical/lumbar stenosis as outpatient.
# Hand and lower extremity weakness: see above.
#Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - currently in normal sinus rhythm.
#Diabetes - Pt experienced hypoglycemia with bs in the 60s following her MICU stay, likely secondary to decreased PO intake.
# HTN - Pt's Lisinopril and Lasix were initially held on admission given acute on chronic renal failure.
# PPX- heparin sq while coumadin is becoming therapeutic, PPI .

You were found to have spinal stenosis, which is likely contributing to your pain as well as your hand and leg weakness.
Your hospital stay was also complicated by acute mental status change, caused by your worsening kidney function.
Your blood sugars have been low during your stay, likely caused by decreased eating.
