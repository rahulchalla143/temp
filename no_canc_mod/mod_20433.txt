Admission Date:  [**2145-5-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-10-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Weak/Lethargic  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation/Extubation   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 63 yoF w/ a h/o ESRD secondary to HTN and DM, failed renal tx (primary graft non function), and recent admission for staph epi bactermia thought to be related to an HD catheter infection presented initally to the ER at [**Hospital 6451**] with R sided weakness and blurred vision, the patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER after a Head CT without bleed.
Then the day of admission she began to feel as though her vision was "enclosed in glass" and she began to have abnormal speech and tongue swelling, she had some R sided weakness and was at that time her home health aide called 911.
EMS reported the patient had slurred speech.
In the ER she was noted to be hypotensive, anasarca with facial / tongue / arm swelling.
Neuro was consulted and thought a stroke versus septic emboli was possible.
Neuro recommended an LP and then anticoagulation for her possible intracardiac thrombus.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: - Stage V CKD secondary to hypertension/diabetes and was HD dependent (R sided indwelling line) s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2144-8-15**] c/b delayed graft function and wound infection  - Diabetes type II - Depression - multiple DVT - Atrial fibrillation in setting of parathyroidectomy.
- Coag negative staph bacteremia during [**3-/2145**] admission in which HD line was removed and replaced, which then needed to be replace and found to be Pseudomonas positive cath tip.
Seen to have clot at junction of RA and SVC, Cardiac surgery recommended completing antibiotics course.
Past Surgical History: - neck exploration and subtotal parathyroidectomy [**4-20**] - left upper extremity AV fistula - hysterectomy - s/p cadaveric renal transplant as above  Social History: She lives with her daughter.
Family History: Notable for two sisters with diabetes mellitus.

No acute intracranial hemorrhage or process.
Interval partial opacification of the ethmoid air cells and mild mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses.
No definite evidence of thrombus within the SVC.
Evaluation is somewhat limited due to cardiac motion and presence of central venous line through the SVC.
The azygos vein remains mildly dilated as seen on the previous study.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
The right-sided pleural effusion has increased in size since previous study and the left-sided pleural effusion has decreased in size.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
Small amount of free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.
Three large calcified gallstones noted within the gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid.
Findings are likely due to third spacing, but in the appropriate clinical setting, cholecystitis is not excluded.
Severe wedge compression fracture of L1, stable since [**45**]/[**2144**].
[**2145-5-4**] Unilateral LE U/S:Extremely limited exam due to diffuse edema and body habitus.
However, no evidence of DVT within the visualized veins.
[**2145-5-5**] EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and  disorganization of the background rhythm.
No areas of focal slowing, epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were seen during this recording.
There is no evidence of large acute infarction, mass effect, or hemorrhage.
A tiny focus of increased DWI signal in the right medial temporal lobe which may represent an artifact or less likely a very tiny acute infarct.
The right posterior inferior cerebellar artery is not visualized.
This might be secondary to its small caliber less likely disease process.
CTA can be considered if there is clinical concern.
[**2145-5-5**] ECHO: There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mitral regurgitation is probably moderate but was not fully assessed.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but was not fully assessed.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2145-5-5**] RUQ U/S: Cannot assess for acute cholecystitis given limitations and inability to asses for son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
Cholelithiasis and similar appearance of gallbladder as seen on recent CT. Small right pleural effusion.
# Blurred vision / R sided weakness: Symptoms resolved on admission to the ICU.
Echo with bubble did show evidence of pulmonary shunting.
MRI of the brain, however, was without evidence of stroke or bleed.
# Facial Swelling: Per medical records the patient commonly has increased upper extremity and facial edema related to her SVC stenosis.
She underwent CT Torso which showed no evidence of new clot.
Clinical presentation was not consistent with allergic reaction or angioedema so antihistamine treatments were discontinued.
# Hypotension: Patient was initially felt to be hypotensive and started on vanc/zosyn.
No evidence of infection based on culture data.
# Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated on arrival to the ED for depressed mental status.
# RA/SVC thrombus vs. vegetation: Patient with known mass that was evaluated on prior admission by CT surgery.
CT surgery team from prior admission was e-mailed and stated that in the setting of no known embolization (stroke/PE) they would not recommend surgical intervention at this time.
# Failed renal transplant: Patient had tenderness on flank over transplant site so started on steroids.
# Atrial filbrillation and h/o DVT: Patient temporarily taken off coumadin in case procedures were necessary.
Given her psychiatric history, psychiatry was consulted and they did not feel that she was depressed or psychotic.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
