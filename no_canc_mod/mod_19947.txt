CT chest [**2190-4-21**]: CTA CHEST: There is no evidence of filling defects in the pulmonary arteries bilaterally, concerning for pulmonary embolus.
There are bilateral pleural effusions with loculated fissural component along the left major fissure.
A vague nodular opacity is seen on series 4, image 49 in the right upper lobe measuring 6 mm.
There are atherosclerotic coronary calcifications.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.
Multliplanar reformatted images confirm the above findings.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Right pulmonary nodule.
Bilateral pleural effusions with left loculated fissural component.
Calcified mediastinal nodes consistent with old granulomatous infection.
Atherosclerotic coronary calcifications.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman with ESRD on HD, no IV access and clotted off IJs and subclavians bilaterally REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please check MRV of the chest to evaluate patency of vessels as it appears bilateral IJs and subclavians are occluded MRA OF THE CHEST.
CLINICAL HISTORY: Patient with history of multiple venous catheters secondary to hemodialysis.
Currently, inability to gain central access, evaluate for clot versus stenosis in central veins.
There is a mild stenosis present in the right subclavian vein approximately 1.7 cm from its [**Hospital1 **] with the right jugular vein.
Collateral vessels are seen in the region of the stenosis suggesting a chronic process.
With the exception of the filling defects, the venous structures fill with contrast and there is no significant stenosis or obstruction noted.
Non-occlusive thrombus in the left internal jugular vein is demonstrated.
The arterial structures of the thorax are unremarkable except for atherosclerotic changes in the aorta.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right.
Findings consistent with linear thrombus (age indeterminate) or a fibrin sheath from a prior catheter in the right brachicephalic vein and superior vena cava.
Non-occlusive thrombus in the left internal jugular vein.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  Reason: Please evaluate for epidural abscess and osteomyelitis Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman with concern for L2/L3 disciitis, with fevers, increasing back pain, and question of abscess.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please evaluate for epidural abscess and osteomyelitis CLINICAL INFORMATION: Concern for L2-L3 discitis, fevers, and increasing back pain.
There is some increased signal within the inferior aspect of L2 and the superior aspect of L3, and there is considerable contrast enhancement of both these vertebrae consistent with discitis and osteomyelitis.
There is no definite evidence of paravertebral abscess.
There is no evidence of epidural abscess.
At L4-5, there is moderately large left paracentral disc protrusion producing some encroachment upon the left lateral recess and mild central canal stenosis.
At L5-S1, there is also a broad-based left paracentral disc protrusion producing some encroachment upon the left S1 nerve root sleeve.
There is no evidence of foraminal compromise at any level.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with discitis and osteomyelitis at L2-L3.
Tunneled HD catheter placement: [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman with ESRD on HD needs permanent hemodialysis catheter; Catheter recently removed from LIJ b/c of MSSA bacteremia.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: TUNNELLED HEMODIALYSIS CATHETER; attempt right side first, if unable may use the left HISTORY: 65-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease requiring permanent hemodialysis catheter.
Local anesthesia with 5 cc of 1% lidocaine in the left arm.
Left upper extremity venography was performed through the sheath with imaging of the arm and thorax.
Mild stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein was present, however, no collateral veins were visualized; therefore, this is likely not a hemodynamically significant stenosis.
Note that a previously performed venogram from the right side, dictated separately under clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 62262**], demonstrated occlusion of the right brachiocephalic vein.
Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine in the left upper chest.
There were no immediate complications.
Mild stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein with no collateral veins, therefore, it is likely not of hemodynamic significance.
Left foot: Three views show soft tissue defect at the posterior aspect of the calcaneus.
Since the previous examinations of [**2189-12-30**] and [**2190-4-3**], there is no significant change in the appearance of the underlying bone.
No definite evidence of osteomyelitis, osteopenia.
A small inferior calcaneal spur is seen.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.
CT abdomen [**2190-5-12**] INDICATION: Recent angiography with 8-point hematocrit drop.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A small amount of fluid adjacent to the major fissure on the right, which was not included in the field of view on the previous study.
There is a small left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis which is slightly increased compared to the previous study.
No pericardial effusion is present.
There are aortic mural calcifications.
There are abdominal vascular calcifications seen throughout.
Renal calculi are seen bilaterally.
There is no evidence of obstruction.
There is stranding seen around the kidneys; however, there is no free fluid in the abdomen.
No findings to suggest retroperitoneal bleed.
No free air.
Small lymph nodes are seen in the retroperitoneum and mesentery, none of which are pathologically enlarged.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Fat-containing umbilical hernia is again identified.
There is a Foley within the collapsed bladder.
High-density material within the distal bowel is probably due to previous oral contrast administration.
No lymphadenopathy is identified.
In addition to the fat-containing umbilical hernia, there are several nodular densities in the anterior abdominal wall, the largest measuring 11 mm, of uncertain clinical significance.
Bone windows show no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.
IMPRESSION: No retroperitoneal hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo female with DM, ESRD on HD and HTN who presented with hypotension and UA suggestive of UTI, found to have MSSA bacteremia.
Her UA was c/w a UTI so she was initially thought to have urosepsis and started on levaquin.
Urine culture showed only genital contamination.
An MRV was subsequently done and showed thrombus in several vessels.
She remained afebrile for most of her hospital course but on [**5-1**] she became more lethargic, hypotensive to the 70s and had a low grade temp to 100.3.
ID was consulted and thought this could be [**1-7**] to c.diff, even though the pt did not have diarrhea at the time.
She was started on flagyl and had copious amts of diarrhea while in the ICU.
She also had an MRI of her L spine that showed osteomyelitis and disciitis at L2/L3.
She was being treated with vancomycin and cefepime, which was discontinued in favor of nafcillin, to be continued for a minimum of [**5-13**] weeks for high grade bacteremia and osteomyelitis.
She was also found to have a pseudomonal urinary tract infection, sensitive to cefepime, and she received a 7 day course of treatment for this as well.
Patient's blood cultures from [**4-23**] onward were negative for infection.
2) ESRD on HD (T/Th/Sa):  The patient was continued on her regularly scheduled dialysis on T/Th/Sa.
She had hypophosphatemia during her hospital stay, and required adjustment of her phosphate binders.
4) Hyponatremia: Pt was hyponatremic at admission and this resolved after fluid was removed during HD.
However, doppler studies were performed, which showed minimal perfusion to the LLE, and patient was taken by vascular surgery to angiography where stents were placed in the left external iliac and superior femoral arteries, with repeat doppler studies showing improved flow.
6) Umbilical hernia: Pt was noted to have an umbilical hernia at admission that was not clearly reducible and has been noted in prior discharge summaries but has never been imaged.
7) Bilateral pleural effusions: Pt had a left sided effusion with loculated component.
Patient was noted to have anemia of chronic disease.
She also developed acute blood loss anemia after her vascular intervention.
Hemolysis labs were significant for a low haptoglobin and an elevated reticulocyte count, which was thought to be consistent with recent vascular intervention.
16) Bilateral upper extremity clots.
Due to concern for high clot burden in bilateral upper extremities, patient was placed on anticoagulation with coumadin.
She was briefly taken off coumadin for her vascular procedure, and at time of discharge, awaiting therapeutic INR with goal 2.0 to 3.0. .
Thoracic compression fracture 3.
MSSA sepsis 4.
Left heel ulcer requiring vascular intervention 7.
Pseudomonas urinary tract infection 8.
C. difficile colitis 9.
Anemia, acute blood loss and chronic renal disease associated 11.
Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: If you develop nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, chest pain, or drainage or pus around your hemodialysis catheter site, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
