Reportedly, she developed urticaria in the ED and abdominal cramping.
She had no evidence of respiratory distress although she claimed chest tightness.
She was kept in the FI CU for 3 days to make she does not develop "cardiopulmonary arrest" as she claimed that her allergies were severe and had resulted in cardiopulmonary arrest in the past.
She said the following: she was unable to verify any history of severe allergic reactions including the claimed history of cardiopulmonary arrest.
She mentioned that the patient has many subjective symptoms, chronic drug seeking behavior specially narcotics for multiple somatic symptoms, and multiple psychiatric admissions.
She, again, received several doses of epinephrine and high dose IV Solu-Medrol but no true objective hives, wheels or throat/tongue/lips edema.
On the floor, the patient noted to have many subjective symptoms and claiming to have active severe allergic reaction requiring epinephrine and high dose IV steroids.
She also frequently asked for IV narcotics for simple headache.
Despite her claims of "closing throat" and urticaria, she had no true throat edema on inspection and she had no true urticaria or wheels or hives.
She was found to have just localized erythremia around the neck (sun marks) and on the proximal limbs, mostly induced by scratching and rubbing the skin.
The patient was noted to have severe anxiety and fears which is probably contributing to her sensation of worsening allergic reaction and sensation of "cardiac chest pain" and "throat is closing".
After additional 3 days monitoring on the floor, during which she had no true objective findings other that mild skin erythema, she was discharged home with quick Medrol taper as well as antihistamine.
