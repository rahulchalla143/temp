In association with the adjacent developmental venous anomaly and additional area of susceptibility in the right centrum semiovale, the hemorrhage likely is related to a cavernous malformation.
No definitely enlarged arterial or venous structures are seen to indicate underlying arteriovenous malformation.
CT [**3-16**] Unchanged appearance of right cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema; prior MR suggested the underlying lesion may be a cavernous malformation and is better characterized on that study.
