No ecchymoses.
ECG: NSR, no acute ST-T wave changes, essentially unchanged from prior tracings.
CXR [**2108-10-7**] Markedly abnormal but stable radiograph as detailed above.
As best can be determined, no definite gross acute pulmonary process.
no intrabdominal fluid collections or abscess; mediastinal asymmetry due to chronically elevated left hemidiaphragm.
moderately dilated aortic root, ascending aorta.
mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Trivial mitral regurgitation.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Distended gallbladder with wall thickness at the upper limits of normal and slightly greater than expected for the level of gallbladder distention.
No definite edema within the wall of the gallbladder.
No secondary sign of mesenteric ischemia, including no pneumatosis or portal venous gas.
Right-sided renal low-attenuation lesions previously characterized as simple cysts.
Redemonstration of chronically elevated left hemidiaphragm, causing rightward mediastinal shift.

Sepsis: Patient presented with hypotension, ARF, elevated LFTs and bandemia.
Positive UA and CT showed perinephric stranding.
Abdominal pain: Dilated colon on CXR and Abd CT.
Patient has a history of small bowel obstructions.
CT scan did not show evidence of obstruction, and was only remarkable for perinephric stranding.
He was seen by the surgical consult service for evaluation for bowel ischemia, and was felt not to have ischemic bowel.
Pain resolved with decompression, most likely secondary to constipation, and NG tube was removed.
Altered mental status: Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy or septic encephalopathy in setting of acute infection.
Hypotension: resolved, with end organ damage (kidney, liver) Shock liver with elevated enzymes which have since resolved.
ARF likely related to sepsis and hypoperfusion [**3-17**] hypovolemia: baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently elevated at 2.0 but trending downward.
He was not restarted on his lisinopril given his labile creatinine, but this should be restarted once his creatinine is rechecked in one week, and is back to baseline.
Thought to be secondary to glyburide, which was given for first few days of admission.
He needs assistance with meals; otherwise he eats minimally due to deconditioning and weakness.
Anemia: Baseline HCt is ~30; [**3-17**] apparent Fe deficiency anemia given Fe panel.
Also has pernicious anemia.
He will most likely autodiurese with improvement of his renal function, but may require intermittent doses of po Lasix to help with resolution of edema.
