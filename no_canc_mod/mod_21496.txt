Per report, pt presented to the OSH with altered mental status, headache (possibly her typical migraine), myalgias, n/v, and slurred speech; these symptoms had reportedly been present for 2 days.
At the OSH she was initially afebrile (100.7 orally) but soon spiked a temperature to 102; she was initially tachycardic but was otherwise hemodynamically stable throughout her time there.
Her physical examination was reportedly noteworthy for mild lethargy, slightly dry mucous membranes, and no meningeal signs; her exam was reportedly otherwise unremarkable.
U/A hazy, 3+ blood, 15-25 RBC, no WBC/bacteria.
LP not done due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.

Sepsis: The pt was initially empirically treated with Ceftriaxone for a presumed SBP, along with Vancomycin and Flagyl to cover possible secondary SBP and/or cholangitis.
An LP was preformed revealing no WBC's.
Blood cultures from the OSH however, grew out Klebsiella x2, sensitive to Levofloxacin, but only intermediately sensitive to Cefoxitin, so her Ceftriaxone was switched to Levofloxacin.
The patient did not have a repeat paracentesis because her white count continued to decline.
Levofloxacin will be continued for a total of 14 days from the start and she will be placed on Cipro 500 qd for SBP ppx.
Altered Mental Status: Altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2771**] to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy secondary to overwhelming sepsis.
Other etiololgies for altered mental status were investigated: An LP was preformed to rule out meningitis.
Ammonia levels were checked given her history of cirrhosis, and returned only mildly elevated at 49.
Respiratory Distress: On admission patient had a primary respiratory alkalosis secondary to persistent tachypnea, likely induced by her septic state.
In addition she had a lactic acidosis.
On HD1, after aggressive fluid ressucitation and receiving blood products, she became increasingly hypoxic secondary to pulmonary edema, and required increased PEEP's to 10 for adequate oxygenation.
She had no ongoing respirtoy issues.
ARF thought to be secondary to intravascular depletion secondary to over-diuresis.
Cirrhosis: The patient has decompensated liver failure with decreased synthetic function and portal hypertension.
She received an albumin infusion on HD 1 and 3 per SBP protocol to prevent hepatorenal syndrome sequelae.
Pt was transfused with PRBC's and HCT stabilized at ~30, with NG lavage back to bilious aspirates.
No evidence of hemolysis on lab data.
Thrombocytopenia: Pt has known baseline thrombocytopenia due to myelofibrosis and/or end stage liver disease of ~40.
Plt levels continued to drop during hospital course, with no evidence of obvious bleed or hemolysis.
The likely cause is splenic sequestration.
Pt was transfused to keep Plts >50 prior to invasive procedure, otherwise >10K unless suspicion for active bleed.
Transaminitis: Most likely due to mild tissue hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis, although liver enzymes may be elevated due to cholangitis as noted above.
Stress dose steroids were started in setting of sepsis in place of budesonide for total of 7 days.
Subconjunctival hemorrhage: pt developed a subconj hemorrhage post-extubation.
This was stopped on discharge because the patient's blood pressure was slightly low and she has no documented history of varices.
Abd Pain: Post extubation, pt experienced mild diffuse abd discomfort.
Given that she had no other sx's of pancreatitis, and no obvious cause, she was continued on clear sips and monitored closely for resolution.
In the subsequent days of admission, she had no abdominal pain.
F/E/N: Initial exam and labs were consistent with intravascular volume depletion.
After receiving aggressive fluids, albumin, blood and platelets, she became volume overloaded with pulmonary congestion and subsequent hypoxemia.
She was advanced to a full diet and tolerated this for many days withougt nausea or vomiting.
Hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO once a day as needed for itching.
