No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring is seen with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 5 mmHg).
There is no valvular systolic anterior motion ([**Male First Name (un) **]).
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
A small echogenic structure is noted to be in the left atrial wall, near where the native P1 and 2 would have been, about 1 cm cephalad to the mitral annuloplasty ring.
