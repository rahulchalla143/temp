He apparently then did arouse with slurred speech, although this may have been due to missing dentures.
The ambulance was called and he developed worsening confusion/mental status while en route to the ED and was on a face mask on arrival.
After intubation, OG tube placement yielded 500mL of dark bloody fluid that clear with 250mL of NS lavage.
He had guaiac positive brown stool.

CT head w/o contrast: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
EEG: This is an abnormal VEEG telemetry due to the presence of a generalized slow background rhythm of [**3-10**] Hz, with frequent periods of [**5-12**] theta activity, indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
This tracing is etiologically non-specific but indicative of diffuse encephalopathy such as metabolic disturbance, infection, or medication effect.
There are no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features noted.
CXR: Right middle lobe collapse.
Adjacent right lower lobe opacity could also be due to atelectasis, but appearance and clinical symptoms raise concern for pneumonia.
Video swallow test ([**2101-8-19**]): Aspiration with all liquid consistencies with oropharyngeal residue after swallow.
Video swallow test ([**2101-8-23**]): No aspiration or penetration is seen with multiple consistencies of barium.

1) Altered mental status: On admission, patient had altered mental status.
EEG and CT head were obtained to rule out intracranial bleed and seizure, which were negative.
2) Pneumonia: On arrival, patient was found to have clinical signs of penumonia including fever, sputum production, and cough.
CXR showed RLL pneumonia, so patient was started empirically on vancomycin + aztreonem + levofloxacin + flagyl for  ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Sputum culture showed H. influenza and beta Streptococci, thus he was narrowed to levofloxain, and completed a 7day course prior to discharge.
3) Aspiration: Initial video speech and swallow exam on the floor showed aspiration of liquids.
Repeat video swallow showed no more aspiration and patient was placed on thin liquid with crushed solid diet.
3) Upper GI Bleed: On admission, NG lavage was positive for blood.
Resuming aspirin should be reconsidered as outpt after Hct has been stable for several weeks.
4) Skin blisters on left back: There was concern for shinles at first, thus DFA, viral cultures, and HSZ/VZV serologies were sent, which came negative.
4) CHF/Afib/Hypertension: No evidence of heart failure.

Secondary: Upper GI bleed Pneumonia Schizophrenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 7356**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital because you were noted to have mental status changes, slurring of speech, and difficulty walking.
We also realized that you had blood in your stomach, and we were concerned you might be bleeding because of an ulcer.
You developed a rash on your back which we at first thought might be due to shingles, but after doing some tests decided it was not.
We gave you antibiotics to treat the pneumonia and you got much better.
We found out that you had an infection in your stomach by a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, which can lead to stomach ulcers and cause bleeding.
So we put a small tube through your nose into your stomach and gave you nutrition that way.
