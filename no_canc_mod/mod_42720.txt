(Y/N) Y  PTCA COMMENTS:   We elected to treat the totally occluded proximal LAD with PTCA/Stenting using heparin and integrilin prophylactically.
A Choice PTXS wire crossed into the LAD with significant difficulty (a Wizdom SS wire and several PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] Intermediate wires would not cross).
A 2.5 x 24 mm Taxus DES was deployed proximally and into the mid-LAD at 12 atm, and another 2.5 x 24 mm Taxus DES was deployed in overlapping fashion more distally at 12 atm.
There was significant spasm and no-reflow in the [**Last Name (LF) 12425**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] intracoronary nitroglycerin and nitroprusside were adminstered through the guide, and more intracoronary nitroprusside was administered through the lumen of a 2.0 x 30 mm Maverick positioned just distal to the second stent.
Final angiography demonstrated no dissection, no residual stenosis within the stented segments with loss of a major diagonal branch (closed at the start of the case), and TIMI-3 flow into a diffusely diseased distal LAD.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant system with two [**Company 12425**] CAD.
The left main had mild disease.
The LAD had a 70% lesion at it's origin and a 100% proximal occlusion.
The left circumlfex artery had a 70% lesion in the OM1 branch.
The RCA had mild disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 24 mm Hg and mean PCWP of 31 mm Hg.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension was present.
Markedly reduced cardiac index with elevated left and right sided filling pressures but normal central aortic pressure.
Acute anterior STEMI treated with primary PCI.
After a discussion with the patient's nephew, the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory where she was found to have occlusion of the LAD with 80% stenosis at OM1.
She was found to have a low cardiac index with low mvo2 during catheterization.
Hospitalization was complicated by increased bleeding at access site after catheterization, for which hemostasis was eventually obtained but integrellin was discontinued early.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also found to have a UTI for which she was treated with Levaquin.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - Acute Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: acute myocardial infarction dementia hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Return to the emergency department if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness.
