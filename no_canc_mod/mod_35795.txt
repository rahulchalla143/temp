Admission Date:  [**2187-10-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-10-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2136-3-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**] Chief Complaint: right arm pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: This is a 54 year old male with history of epilepsy that was found at the bottom of a flight of 15 stairs presumably after falling.
He was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where he complained of right arm pain and was combative.
He was intubated in the emergency department for airway protection secondary to his combativeness.
The patient was found to have a difficult airway and anesthesia was paged.
Neurosurgery has been asked to consult regarding the patients Head CT from [**2187-10-7**] which is consistent with a left frontal punctate hemorrhage.
Sleep apnea 4. psychosis secondary to seizure disorder  PSH 1.
S/P temporal lobectomy [**2168**] for intractable seizures 3.
Right upper extremity in cast- distal radial fracture Neuro: Mental status: intubated,Awake and alert, follows some simple commands, thrashing in bed Orientation,Recall,Language: unable to assess  Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3.5 to 3 mm bilaterally.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Right upper extremity:fingers move to command, ROM limited due to radial fracture and cast.
Non-displaced fracture of the posterior lateral wall of the left orbit.
Left frontal soft tissue hematoma.
[**2187-10-7**] CT C spine : No acute fracture seen.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine.
Bilateral posterior lung consolidation, could be aspiration or partial collapse.
Small anterior mediastinal hematoma with adjacent nondisplaced sternal fracture.
IVC filter in place with more distal IVC markedly attenuated, likely from chronic occlusion.
Hypodense left renal lesion, measuring Hounsfield units greater than that typical for a simple cyst.
Recommend further evaluation with ultrsaound in a nonurgent setting.
Right shoulder degenerative change with possible joint loose body.
Linear high density in sacral canal, could be calcification, or vessels.
[**2187-10-7**] right wrist : Comminuted fracture of the distal radius with mild displacement.
Mildly displaced fracture of the ulnar styloid.
Prominent soft tissue swelling.
Multiples vertebral body compression deformities in the thoracic and lumbar spine which appear chronic.
There is no evidence of underlying bone marrow lesions, suggesting that the fractures may be osteoporotic, unusual for the patient's age.
The most significant, moderate T12 compression fracture is associated with mild retropulsion and a mild kyphotic angulation at T11-12, without mass effect on the spinal cord.
Multilevel cervical spondylosis with approximately moderate spinal canal stenosis and moderate neural foraminal narrowing, somewhat suboptimally evaluated due to artifacts.
While the spinal cord is deformed from C4-5 through C6-7, no definite cord signal abnormalities are seen.
Multilevel lumbar spondylosis.
Severe right neural foraminal narrowing at L4-5 and L5-S1, with compression of the exiting L4 and L5 nerve roots.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
He was seen by the Ortho-spine service due to multiple compression fractures noted on CT to determine if they were old or new.
After reviewing the MRI with Radiology it was determined that all the fractures were old.
he had no back pain to palpation and his activity was changed to out of bed as tolerated.
His right distal radius fracture was splinted and xray confirmed good alignment.
He was able to walk with a rolling walker with platform and hopefully after a short term rehab stay he will be able to return home independently.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis S/P Fall, found at the bottom of 14 stairs 1. left zygomatic fracture 2. left sphenoid sinus fracture 3. left lateral orbit non displaced fracture 4. sternal fracture 5.
L3,T5,T12,C6 compression fractures 6. small anterior mediastinal hematoma 7. bilateral posterior lung consolidation 8. right distal radius fracture  Secondary diagnosis 1.
Sleep apnea 4. psychosis secondary to seizure disorder 5.
S/P temporal lobectomy [**2168**] for intractable seizures 7.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
