CV: [**Last Name (un) **], +2/6 SEM at RUSB and apex, [**2-17**] holosytolic murmur at apex ABD: Soft, nt, nd, nl active bowel sounds EXT: Trace peripheral edema bilaterally.
CN II-XII intact   Pertinent Results: TEE: [**2127-4-22**] Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No  spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
The severity of the aortic stenosis could not be assessed with Doppler.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Impression: No atrial thrombus seen.
NON CONTRAST HEAD CT [**2127-4-22**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
There is an old right insular cortical infarction.
Mild white matter hypoattenuation is consistent with microvascular ischemia and gliosis.
No new areas of cortical attenuation abnormality are seen.
There is fine heterogeneity of the skull attenuation, which is unchanged since the earlier CT.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No acute cortical territorial infarction is evident, but MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 99040**]I is a more sensitive study to evaluate for acute infarction.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation at ~80bpm.
Biphasic Ts in V1-V6, ST segment depressions in V4-V6, but most prominent in V4, and <0.5mm.
CXR: [**2127-4-19**] SINGLE PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Again seen is an enlarged heart, stable as well as calcifications of the aortic knob.
There is interstitial prominence as well as upper lobe pulmonary vascular redistribution.
IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure.
Last echo: [**2-17**] The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2124-2-28**], the severity of aortic stenosis has increased (calculated valve area now severe) and the severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation are slightly reduced (may be related to lower blood pressure).
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is also lower.
Prior Imaging: [**2127-2-19**] colonoscopy: Multiple severe non-bleeding diverticula with wide-mouth openings were seen in the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
[**2127-2-17**] - Bleeding Scan - No evidence of bleeding during the time  of the study.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression:  88 y/o woman with PMH significant for Atrial fibrillation (was not on BB at [**Hospital1 **]) off coumadin since [**2-21**] for LGIB, CHF with preserved EF, likely diastolic component, Severe Aortic stenosis, 2+ MR, who presents hypertensive urgency, volume overload, in congestive heart failure, Atrial fibrillation with Rate ~115, and with lateral ST depressions on EKG.
Unclear what precipitated the CHF exacerbation, worsening aortic stenosis vs. atrial fibrillation with RVR, vs. ischemic event vs. severe hypertension, or some combination thereof.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] agreed with cardiology team that pt is poor anticoagulation candidate, given her prior history of large lower GI bleed in [**2-17**] with coumadin being stopped then.
It was felt that a negative TEE would minimize the risk somewhat of thrombus formation and subseuent embolus propagation.
On the day of [**2127-4-22**], the day of TEE/cardioversion, the pt demonstrated ATN/shock liver [**1-16**] hypoperfusion from low flow state, poor cardiac outflow secondary to multiple factors including end stage diastolic dysfunction, critical aortic stenosis, dehydration and poor po intake and acute oliguric renal failure.
Her mortality from these diagnoses alone was high, but it was decided that the pt's best chance to improve forward flow would be to get her out of atrial fibrillation, restoring her atrial kick and improving output.
The TEE fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 99041**] and the EP fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 16645**] [**Name (STitle) 16646**] obtained consent as well and explained risks and benefits.
Pt underwent TEE [**2127-4-22**] showing no clot, and subsequently underwent DC cardioversion.
Since there was no evidence of clot on TEE, the pt was cardioverted.
Later in the evening of [**2127-4-22**], the pt started having left sided weakness/paralysis, and altered mental status.
The pt's daughter was telling the team not to place an arterial line or central venous line, given the pt had previously been DNR/DNI on prior admissions, and these were her wishes.
Neurology examined the patient, who by this time demonstrated no gag reflex, no corneal reflex, felt to have a basilar artery cerebrovascular accident either secondary to hypoperfusion or embolus.
The pt was felt to have had a basilar artery infarct/CVA secondary to hypoperfusion.
Coronaries:  No prior cath, but mult risk factors for CAD including age, hypercholesterolemia, HTN, smoking history.
With ST depressions in lateral precordial leads.
The pt received ASA in the ED, but was not given further ASA given her h/o prior upper GI bleed and gastric ulcer [**1-16**] aspirin use in the past.
Pump: Pt in heart failure with evid of vol overload on exam, elevated JVP to 10cm, bilateral crackles half way up lung fields.
Unclear what precipitated the acute CHF exacerbation: hypertensive, vs. worsening AS vs. atrial fibrillation with RVR.
It was evident the pt had poor cardiac index and output as demonstrated by low flow state from severe diastolic dysfunction and severe aortic stenosis.
The pt developed shock liver and acute tubular necrosis [**1-16**] hypoperfusion.
Suspect oliguric ARF [**1-16**] prerenal azotemia [**1-16**] poor forward flow (exacerbated by Atrial fibrillation, severe AS, dehydration, poor po intake).
Renal was consulted, and felt that there was no need for emergent HD, and recommended to address cardiac issues for low flow state, which was leading to hypoperfusion and ATN.
# Shock liver: Pt's bp on admission was 220s/100, lowered over 48 hours to 100-120 systolic.
Her post DC cardioversion course was complicated by severe hypotension requiring pressors.
