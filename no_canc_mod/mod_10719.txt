HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old white male with known coronary artery disease, type 1 diabetes, with triopathy, history of MRSA of the left heel, status post left fem PT bypass with partial calcanectomy in [**2102-5-27**] who was admitted in [**2103-10-27**] with gangrenous toes and arteriogram showed nonconstructible disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Coronary artery disease with P. MIBI in [**2103-10-27**] which showed severe three vessel disease with fixed defects, severe partially reversible defect in the inferolateral wall, ejection fraction was calculated at 11%.
An echocardiogram done previously in [**2103-10-27**] showed an EF of 20% with severe ventricular global hypokinesis.
Type 1 diabetes with triopathy.
History of hearing loss, blind bilaterally.
End-stage renal disease, on dialysis via Quinton catheter Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
The patient has undergone a left AV fistula which is not matured.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Remarkable for severe peripheral neuropathy and hearing loss.
General appearance:  This is a cooperative white male in no acute distress with severe hearing deficits.
The abdominal aorta is nonpalpable or prominent.

Bone/joints:  Moderate ankle edema bilaterally with ruborous right foot changes with desquamation of the dorsal foot epidermis.
Neurologic:  Except for the patient's deafness and blindness, the examination is nonfocal.

There was good bleeding at the tissue amputation site.
The patient was followed by the Renal Service during his hospitalization who managed his hemodialysis needs.
The EKG was without acute changes.
The patient was begun on dopamine for inotropic support.
They felt that the patient had ischemic changes secondary to hypotension and that beta blockage would not be recommended at this time and aspirin should be continued.
The blood pressure should be supported and if there were EKG changes or new symptoms to reconsult the Cardiology Service.
On postoperative day number three, the patient's dopamine was initially weaned off but the patient did have an episode of hypotension requiring transfusion of albumin with excellent response.
The patient showed independent functional mobility and could be discharged to home.
