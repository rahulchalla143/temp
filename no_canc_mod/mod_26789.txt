History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old male who presented to an outside institution after being found unresponsive.
He underwent endoscopy which demonstrated what appeared to be a colonic duodenal fistula or perforation.
CT scan was performed that demonstrated a large retroperitoneal abscess from a perforation, and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive treatment.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Large amount of fluid seen throughout the abdomen extending into the pelvis.
The fluid in the right posterior perianal space appears to have pockets of gas within, concerning for an infected collection.
Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, right greater than left.
Mild generalized bowel wall thickening of the colon, unchanged from the prior study, there is no pneumatosis.
Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent bilateral subsegmental consolidations.
No old films were available.
Regardless there is no misalignment and the fragments should be in good apposition due to the inapparent nature on these films.
Incidental note is made of degenerative changes at the MTP joint of the first digit.
No contrast leakage from bowel or findings concerning for perforation.
No change in size of right posterior pararenal space fluid collection with pigtail catheter, or anterior pararenal fluid collection.
Both of these appear heterogeneous, as does the fluid extending into the pelvis.
Decrease in overall ascites with small partially organized fluid collection along the anterior peritoneum within the pelvis.
Decreased wall thickening of the colon with resolution of wall thickening in some areas consistent with resolving colonic process.
No pneumatosis.
Unchanged pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
Persistent fracture lucency is seen through the distal fibula; however, it appears somewhat less distinct on the current exam as compared with [**2119-10-29**].
There is osseous demineralization, and dorsal spurs projecting from the talus.
No new fracture identified.
No significant interval change in the appearance of the complex retroperitoneal fluid collection, involving the anterior and posterior pararenal spaces, as well as a connection to fluid collection in the presacral space in the pelvis.
Reduced pleural effusions.
[**2119-11-16**] CT guided drainage of fluid collection   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the SICU and put on broad spectrum antibiotics and volume resuscitated.
He was taken emergently to the OR for exploratory laparotomy for surgical repair of a duodenal perforation.
He required pressor support secondary to sepsis and amphotericin was added to the antibiotic regimen of Vanco/Levo/Flagyl.
J-tube feeds were begun on POD2 but he continued to require sedation, pressor support, and he had evidence of developing acute lung injury that progressed to ARDS.
An echocardiogram was obtained on [**10-26**] which showed LVEF 70-80% with trivial MR. A CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on [**10-27**] showed fluid throughout the abdomen and bilateral pleural effusions in addition to a large right-sided retroperitoneal collection which was subsequently drained under CT guidance.
The JP drain had evidence of a bile leak at this point but it was well-drained.
A follow-up CT on [**10-29**] showed an interval decrease in the free fluid and in the size of the right retroperitoneal collection with the pigtail in place.
Culture data revealed VRE and the vanco was changed to Linezolid.
Cultures also grew klebsiella, MRSA, and yeast.
A vac dressing was placed on [**11-2**] for a small wound dehiscence.
He remained intermittently febrile.
Radiology performed a CT-guided drainage of the right retroperitoneum on [**11-16**] after a follow-up CT from [**11-15**] showed a persistent collection.
