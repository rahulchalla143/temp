Admission Date:  [**2156-1-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-1-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-5-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: Anterior STEMI   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary catheterization [**2156-1-16**]  History of Present Illness: 63 M with CAD s/p MI 2 years ago with RCA stent.
Presented to [**Hospital3 35813**] Center in [**State 792**]on [**2156-1-13**] with acute respiratory distress and hypotension.
An ECG showed sinus tach with RBBB and Qs in II, III, and aVF with STE v1-v5.
CXR showed pulmonary edema.
He was taken to the cath lab where he found to have 3vd with left main disease.
Also of note, WBC 24 and glucose 400, but without acidosis or an elevated anion gap.
No known EtOH.
Sclera anicteric.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Coarse ventilated breath sounds.
Abd: Soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: Bilat feet cool, but without edema.
Initial angiography revealed a 70% proximal rca in-stent restenosis and a 90% focal rca stenosis.
The ostial and proximal Lad had an 80% stenosis before tapering down to a small diffusely diseased vessel.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal rca with a 3x18mm vision stent and of the mid rca with a 3x30mm driver stent which were post dilated to 3.0mm.
Successful ptca and stenting of the proximal lad with a 2.25x18mm mini vision stent.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal/apical akinesis and inferoseptal hypokinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 63 year old gentleman who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after sustaining a large anterior STEMI.
His hospital course was complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring an intra-aortic balloon pump and a dopamine drip; and respiratory failure of unknown etiology for which the patient was intubated on transfer.
Over the next 2 days he developed significant pulmonary edema requiring CPAP, lasix drip, and pressor support with dobutamine and milrinone.
On [**2155-1-20**], he went into pulseless ventricular tachycardia for which a code blue was called.
The patient was coded for 29 minutes without resuscitation, and was pronounced dead at 7:49 PM on [**2156-1-20**].
CAD/Ischemia: Past medical history of known CAD with a prior MI s/p RCA stent.
On this admission, he presented with a large anterior STEMI and two-vessel disease on cardiac catheterization where Mid RCA 90% lesion, proximal RCA in-stent [**18**]% re-stenosis, and 80% proximal LAD lesion were stented.
His heparin gtt was discontinued on [**1-20**] as he was guaiac positive and on multiple blood thinners.
We were holding captopril and beta blocker for low BP .
Cardiogenic shock: His hospital course was complicated by cardiogenic shock, requiring IABP and dopamine gtt for pressure support.
Echocardiogram on [**1-15**] showing EF 35% with anteroseptal and apical akinesis and inferoseptal hypokinesis.
He was weaned off of pressors and IABP on [**1-17**], but developed new pulmonary edema requiring high flow mask with FiO2 of 1.00 on [**2155-1-20**].
Atrial fibrillation: The patient had atrial fibrillation with intermittent RVR, which initially responded well to an amiodarone load.
Fever & leukocytosis: unclear source.
Was being treated for presumed PNA at OSH, though CXR did not clearly show an infiltrate here, though difficult to visualize in setting of pulmonary edema.
Aspiration PNA was also on the differential as the patient is not fully able to protect his airway and was s/p extubation.
Line infection unlikely as he had fever and white count on presentation.
His stool was sent for C. diff toxin.
Respiratory failure: S/p extubation on [**1-18**], since then with a respiratory alkalosis and hypoxemia on ABG, which as responded to high flow oxygen mask initially, and then required CPAP.
His CXR was c/w pulmonary edema.
HIT work-up sent, but with low suspicion.
