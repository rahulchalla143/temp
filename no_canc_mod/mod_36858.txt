HA began as "achy" pain over right eyebrow, with no associated sx; she did not think it was worse with valsalva.
She has had no recent illnesses, and does not believe she has made any medication changes.
She was admitted to the neurology service in [**5-17**] with R occipital lobar hemorrhage - 8 cc - that had presented with headache and visual changes; she appeared to have a mild [**Doctor Last Name 4116**] syndrome at the time, with simultanagnosia on exam.
She was seen in the ER again in [**6-16**] when she had presented with headache and no other neurological sx; head CT was negative for new bleed, and she returned home.
Past Medical History: -History of multiple prior intracerebral hemorrhages.
Follow up MRI/MRA after the hemorrhage showed no vascular malformation.
Per daughter, patient had another hemorrhage in [**2122**] and then a third in [**2126**].
Daughter says that the [**2126**] hemorrhage left her with a period of severe word finding difficulties and a decline in her memory that improved a bit with time.

There is mass effect with compression of the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and posterior body of right lateral ventricle.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Again seen are hypodense areas in the right frontal, left parietal and left occipital lobes which are stable compared to [**6-28**] consistent with chronic infarction.
Of note, the patient had a prior right occipital hemorrhage in [**2131-5-21**].
The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are well aerated.
NCHCT [**8-13**]: IMPRESSION: No significant change since [**2131-7-13**].
There is no pleural effusion or other pleural abnormality.
Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Neuro ICU overnight on labetolol drip for BP control.
Coags were WNL and repeat head CT showed a stable 54cc right occipital hemorrhage, no hydrocephalus, no midline shift.
She initially complained of vision changes.
Her exam is complicated given her underlying dementia, mild perseveration, and the fact she has had an old left occipital hemorrhage and now a right occipital hemorrhage.
She has alexia and agraphia and simultagnosia (recognizing only pieces of a picture of her grandchild like the hair or eyebrow, not the whole face).
She does not clearly have ocular dysmetria or apraxia, she performs finger to nose well.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: amyloid angiopathy and intracerebral hemorrhage dementia   Discharge Condition: Stable - has simultagnosia, alexia, agraphia, visual acuity - counts fingers.
Please return to the ED if you experience much worsening of your headache or change in headache, new neurologic problems such as new troubles seeing, weakness, numbness, language dysfunction.
