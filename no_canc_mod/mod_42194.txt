She was satting well, but was tachypneic in the high 20s and noted to have patchy opacities on CXR.
Of note, the patient reportedly had been noted to have lung mass on CXR for which her PCP was in the process of setting up bronchoscopy.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she received another 5mg Vitamin K and CXR was repeated which showed bilateral patchy opacities.
Electrolytes unremarkable with exception of slightly elevated BUN of 25.
No T/S sent.
pt had another 30cc of hemoptysis upon arrival to ICU.
She was in moderate respiratory distress with accessory muscle use, and complaining subjectively of shortness of breath.
Respiratory and anesthesia were subsequently called and she was intubated without complication.

[**2178-6-8**] Bronchial washings   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Non-specific ST junctional depression.
Subtle density at the left retrocardiac area which may represent atelectasis or a developing infiltrate.
There are no signs for pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions.
Pneumatized soft tissue density in the right mainstem bronchus with imaging characteristics suggestive of secretions.
Diffuse bilateral centrilobular ground-glass opacities with more confluent opacities in the left lung and bilateral bronchiectasis.
Confluent soft tissue density in bilateral hila with calcifications.
Differential diagnosis includes atypical mycobacterial infection, sarcoidosis, lymphoproliferative disorder, and less likely Kaposis sarcoma.
Superimposed hemorrhage may also lead to ground glass opacities.
Coronary artery calcifications of indeterminate hemodynamic significance.
Partially imaged superior endplate vertebral body compression deformity of L2.
Bilateral pleural effusions are slightly worse.
There continues to be mild cardiomegaly.
There is lower lobe volume loss/infiltrate slightly worse than before as well.
RIGID BRONCHOSCOPY [**2178-6-8**] 79 yo f with massive hemoptysis.
Rigid bronchoscopy with flexible bronchoscopy with removal of endobronchial thrombus and blood but with no active bleeding seen on the right sided airways.
The RLL basilar main bronchus had mild mucosal erythema that although unlikely to be the primary source of hemoptysis, it was cauterized empirically to minimize chance of recurrent bleeding.
Interestingly no gross bleeding form the RML/Lingula where the bronchiectasis are located.
Likely source the RLL probably bleeidng due to pneumonia + bronchitis + supratherapeutic INR.
No complications.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79y/o lady with history of Afib (on Warfarin), CVA, and bronchiectasis who presented with respiratory failure from hemoptysis.
She was intubated, and in the MICU she underwent bronchoscopies to diagnose the cause: it is likely that this represented an acute exacerbation of her bronchiectasis in the setting of infection.
Hemoptysis: acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis in the setting of pneumonia.
She presented with hemoptysis in the setting of INR 2.9; she was transfused 1u pRBC and 4u FFP (both on day of admission).
Became hypoxic and was intubated; in the MICU she underwent flexible bronchoscopy on [**2178-6-6**] which showed no endobronchial tumors, but fresh blood and thrombus in the left lung which was suctioned.
The right middle segment thrombus was not intervened upon because it was thought that there was a lesion underneath in the right lung.
It was felt that there was massive hemoptysis from the right lung and right main stem bronchus.
Two days later on [**2178-6-8**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy with removal of the thrombus and blood; no active bleeding was seen in right side of the right lower lobe with purulent secretions removed.
It was felt that the patient likely had pneumonia and bronchiectasis exacerbation.
Developed leukocytosis to 12.8 but never developed fevers.
The bronchiectasis appeared more bacterial in nature; Aspergillus was not likely to be a causative pathogen (see below).
She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (who saw her as Pulmonary consult) in a few weeks, with repeat CT scan to evaluate interval change including the nodular infiltrates on her CT here.
No evidence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, particularly since she has not had a history of asthma, and her eosinophil count was quite low.
Aspergillus galactomannan test was negative, so less likely to have invasive Aspergillosis and there is no need for Voriconazole treatment per discussion with Pulmonology.
Atrial fibrillation: s/p [**Last Name (STitle) 5509**], on Warfarin with NEW INR GOAL OF 2.0-2.5.
Besides one self-limited episode of hemodynamically [**Hospital1 5509**] to HR 140's while on the floor, she had no more problems with [**Name (NI) 5509**] and HR is 70-90 at the time of discharge.
No issues with re-bleeding.
While intubated, she was on tube feeds and upon extubation was evaluated by Speech Therapy who felt that she was an aspiration risk.
On the day of discharge, she still reports coughing with eating but was re-evaluated by Speech and Swallow and was felt to be safe for a PO diet.
Of note, it is felt that much of her chronic bronchiectasis might be related to aspiration, so if there is concern for aspiration in the future she should be re-evaluated with a Speech and Swallow evaluation.
No new neurologic deficits at this time (has chronic mild gait instability associated with right-sided weakness).
She understands the risks associated with subtherapeutic INR (specifically, CVA) but she also agrees that the risks of a supratherapeutic INR are high given her recent hemoptysis.
Patient became hypertensive once bleed resolved, so she was initially placed on Captopril 37.5 TID, then was transitioned back to home dose Losartan which she should continue as an outpatient.
If there is concern for aspiration in the future she should be re-evaluated with a Speech and Swallow evaluation.
INR GOAL CHANGE: She requires DAILY checks of her INR with new goal 2.0-2.5 because of bleeding risk.
K-Dur 10meq daily 3. aspirin 81mg daily 4. simvastatin 20mg daily 5. furosemide 20mg po daily 6. levothyroxine 50mcg daily 7. warfarin 8. sotalol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] 9. tegretol 100mg PRN pain   Discharge Medications: 1.

You were intubated (had a breathing tube in) and underwent bronchoscopies (diagnostic procedure with a scope) that showed that the bleeding was probably from your known bronchiectasis as well as pneumonia in the setting of having thin blood from Warfarin.
In addition, you were treated for pneumonia with a course of antibiotics.
Also note that while you were admitted you had an episode of atrial fibrillation with a fast heart rate; for this, you have been started on a new medication (Diltiazem) and your heart rate is controlled.
Start Diltiazem for atrial fibrillation.
