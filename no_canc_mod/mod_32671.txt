Admission Date:  [**2160-1-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-1-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-9-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsive episode at rehab  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation.
History of Present Illness: 72 yo [**First Name3 (LF) 8003**]-speaking female with DM2, HTN, and prior CVAs was admitted to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital on [**2159-12-24**] for seizures thought to be [**2-9**] hypoglycemia and discharged to rehab on [**2160-1-4**] who presented [**1-6**] with unresponsiveness and hypoxia.
She was unresponsive at rehab on [**2160-1-5**]; oxygen sats were initially 99 on 2L, but then fell to 88% on 2L.
She was initially lethargic but then became unresponsive, and was brought to ED by EMS.
On exam in the ED, she was unresponsive and leaning to the right side.
Non-contrast head CT showed diffuse hypodensity in the left frontal, parietal and temporal regions, likely from prior CVA's.
A hypodensity in the superior frontal region and also suspicious region in the L basal ganglia were questionable acute infarcts.
However, after the neurology team reviewed the films with the radiologist, it was thought that these areas could not be definitively be labeled as new acute infarcts.
A UA showed a possible UTI and the pt received 500 mg IV levaquin.
She was extubated on [**1-7**] without difficulties.
CTA of the brain/neck showed subacute infarct in the inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery, carotid arteries were patent.
EEG showed a slow background which may be seen in a mild encephalopathy, or in the setting of extensive, bilateral or deeper midline subcortical lesions.
Stroke consult did not believe pt had acute stroke as she also did not demonstrate any focal neurologic defecits.
She was however started on Keppra and aggrenox for seizure and stroke prevention.
On transfer to the floor, patient denied any pain or SOB.
Her family was contact[**Name (NI) **] to inquire about her baseline mental status.
Past Medical History: DMT2 HTN Asthma COPD Hypercholesterolemia s/p Pacemaker (v-paced) h/o left frontal CVA ?
Seizure d/o -- had one seizure attributed to hypoglycemia prompting admission to hospital on [**2159-12-24**]; unclear if she has had seizures prior to this one   Social History: non-smoker, no [**Hospital 76954**] transferred from rehab  Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.9  BP 145/97  HR 70  RR 17  O2 sat 100% on AC 400 X 16 PEEP 5  FiO2 40% General: obese female, intubated and sedated Lungs: occ wheeze anteriorly Cardio: RRR, no m.r.g.
Diffuse hypodensity of the left hemisphere as described which is mostly chronic in nature.
Underlying acute infarction of left basal ganglia or the most superior portion of the frontal lobe can not be excluded.
MR of the head is recommended to assess for an underlying acute infarction in the left hemisphere.
No acute hemorrhage or shift of normal midline structure or brain herniation is noted.
[**2160-1-6**] EEG: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a slow background.
This may be seen in a mild encephalopathy, or in the  setting of extensive, bilateral or deeper midline subcortical lesions.
[**2160-1-6**] CTA Head & Neck: HEAD CT:  Hypodensity in the distribution of the left inferior middle cerebral artery likely represents a subacute ischemic event.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
HEAD AND NECK CTA:  The extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent without evidence of stenosis.
The distal cervical internal carotid artery measures 4 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left.
There is a cutoff of the left MCA inferior division.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation.
Assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma is slightly limited by respiratory motion.
No right-sided effusion is detected.
A right thoracic cardiac pacemaker is unchanged.
Left basilar atelectasis persists.
Persistent left basilar atelectasis.
[**2160-1-14**]: TTE: The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with low normal global systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year old female with COPD, h/o left frontal CVA and h/o hypoglycemic seizures admitted from rehab for unresponsiveness.
# MENTAL STATUS CHANGE: Patient was sdmitted from [**Hospital **] Health Care for unresponsive episode.
Initially there was a concern for acute stroke, but head CT and head CTA were negative.
There was also a concern for seizure since she has had hx of admission to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital for hypoglycemic seizures.
[**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and the neurology team, it was decided that she will be on Keppra 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis.
Her mental status change was attributed to hypercarbia, a urinary tract infection and dehydration.
After transfer out of the MICU to the regular hospital floor, patient's mental status gradually improved as her hypercarbia, UTI and dehydration were treated.
Her daughter [**Name (NI) 7019**] who is the primary caregiver, agreed that her mental status has improved.
# COPD: As described above, she was hypercarbic on admission and may be chronic hypercarbia from COPD and her large body habitus.
On echo, she has moderate pulmonary hypertension probably from COPD.
She may have obstructive sleep apnea, which may worsen her lethargy.
She should get a sleep study as an outpatient and arrange for CPAP accordingly.
# UTI: Enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin.
# FOOT PAIN: Bilateral diffuse feet pain on dorsum and plantar surface, likely from diabetic neuropathy.
She was taken off neurotin and oxycodone because of somnelence and was given Tylenol and lidocaine patch PRN.
# HYPERCHOL: Continue lipitor.
# DM: She has a history of hypoglycemic seizures and on discharge from [**Doctor Last Name 1263**], her Lantus was stopped and she was just on a regular insulin sliding scale.
During this hospital course, she was on a conservative regular insulin scale with no long acting agents.
