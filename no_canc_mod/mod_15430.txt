HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of panic attacks who came to the hospital on [**2159-7-9**], for a preoperative arteriogram for a scheduled left femoral popliteal bypass.
While in the far lobby the patient began to feel anxious and short of breath accompanied by chills and uncontrollable shaking.
The patient denied chest pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.
The patient thought he was having a panic attack but did feel that this was different than any prior panic attack that he had had.
The patient was thought to be in alcohol withdrawal versus PE versus myocardial infarction.
The patient was taken for a CT arteriogram of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolus which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
The CT did show evidence of tracheomalacia.
The patient was brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he continued to be tachypneic and tachycardic and received 80 mg IV of Valium which had no effect.
The patient continued to be tachypneic and hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 150.
Bilateral carotid stenosis 100% on the left and 80% on the right.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a sales representatives, married with no children.
In general, the patient was obese, now sedated on Ativan and Valium, with an erythematous face, very diaphoretic.
The patient was noted to have a thick neck.
The chest examination revealed tachycardia, regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Cool extremities bilaterally with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse on the right and a dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse on the left.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray revealed a rib fracture of the fourth rib of indeterminate age and presence of consolidation or effusion at the left base that could not be excluded.
Chest CT angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
It was positive for dependent atelectasis.
There was no mediastinal adenopathy.
There were multiple rib fractures and the liver was noted to have fatty infiltrates.
Urinalysis revealed pH 7.0, specific gravity of 1.010, negative nitrite, negative leukocyte esterase, negative ketones, negative glucose, no red blood cells and no white blood cells.
Alcohol withdrawal:  The patient required very large amounts of benzodiazepines on admission for withdrawal.
Initially the patient did well, however, he became very agitated on the 9th requiring 280 mg of Valium in six hours and 420 mg of Valium in 12 hours plus 55 mg of Ativan.
In addition, a labetalol drip was started on [**7-13**] as it was determined that the patient's labile blood pressure was due partly to withdrawal symptoms and partly to underlying hypertension.
The patient was started on ciprofloxacin and gentamicin on the 9th but, the patient continues to remain febrile on this drug regimen, therefore an abdominal ultrasound was obtained to rule out biliary obstruction.
This study was nonconclusive so a HIDA scan was ordered which showed no abnormalities of the gallbladder or biliary tree.
A follow-up abdominal CT showed an inflamed appendix with a fluid collection consistent with perforated appendicitis.
A CT of the abdomen showed a fluid collection in the right lower quadrant measuring 3 cm x 2.8 cm inferior to the cecum in addition to a possible second fluid collection of 1 cm adjacent to the terminal ileum, an 8 mm tubular structure that could represent an inflamed appendix was noted on reconstructed images.
This was thought to be consistent with perforated appendicitis.
Therefore, an abdominal CT was repeated on [**7-15**] in order to evaluate for possible abscess around the appendix which could be drained surgically.
Respiratory:  Initially the patient was hypoxic with a CT angiogram on admission which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus but did show severe tracheomalacia of unclear etiology.
The patient was intubated for progressive hypoxia for airway protection given his high benzodiazepine requirement.
The patient was initially given Lasix for some findings of EHF on chest x-ray.
The patient was switched to pressure control ventilation on [**7-14**] as he was noted to have some asynchronous breathing with the vent.
Hypertension:  The patient continued to have labile blood pressure during his MICU stay with blood pressures rising to 200/110 usually late at night and in the early morning.
The patient was initially treated with Valium as it was thought that the hypertension was secondary to withdrawal but then the patient was switched over to a labetalol drip for blood pressure control as it was thought that his hypertension was more long-standing in origin.
The patient had had a preoperative cardiac Persantine ETT and cardiac perfusion scan.
In addition, the cardiac perfusion scan showed an enlarged left ventricle with a calcified left ventricular end diastolic volume of 285 mL with a moderate defect of 8, inferior wall that was a fixed defect, a calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 49%.
The patient's acid based abnormalities on admission resolved quite quickly when he was started on ventilatory support.
