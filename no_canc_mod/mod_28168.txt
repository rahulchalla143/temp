Antepartum course was notable for twin pregnancy.
The mother developed pregnancy induced hypertension which prompted admission to [**Hospital6 3872**].
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] due to worsening hypertension.
Decision was made to deliver by Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia for worsening pregnancy induced hypertension.
General: Pink infant in mild respiratory distress, on continuous positive airway pressure.
Chest:  Mild retractions, fair air entry.
Cardiovascular:  No murmur.
Abdomen: Soft and flat, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Upon admission to the Neonatal     Intensive Care Unit, she had worsening distress and an     increasing oxygen requirement and was subsequently     intubated and received 2 doses of Surfactant.
She transitioned to nasal cannula oxygen on     day of life #9 due to clinical decompensation.
She was initially treated for apnea of     prematurity with caffeine which was discontinued due to a     cardiac arrhythmia.
One episode of brief bradycardia was noted during her eye exam yesterday but she has no further events since then.
Cardiac     echo was obtained on day of life #3 showing no PDA and a     patent foramen ovale versus an atrioseptal defect.
An EKG at that time showed     premature atrial beats and atrial bigeminy, normal     indices, no ventricular hypertrophy.
She continued to     have runs of supraventricular tachycardia.
On day of life #20, she     presented with abdominal distention and tenderness and     frank blood per rectum.
A contrast enema was     performed on [**2171-11-16**] and [**2171-11-27**], both studies were     within normal limits with no strictures or abnormalities     noted.
[**Known lastname **] was refed     slowly with breast milk and again on day of life #60, she     had reccurrence of bloody stools.
Gastrointestinal:  As previously mentioned, [**Known lastname **] had     presumed necrotizing enterocolitis and also concern for     cow's milk protein allergy.
[**Known lastname **] has     maintained a normal neurologic exam during admission and     there were no neurologic concerns at the time of     discharge.
[**Known lastname **] was     observed in her car seat for 90 minutes without any     episodes of bradycardia or oxygen desaturation.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers.
