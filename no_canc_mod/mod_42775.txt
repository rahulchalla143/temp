On evaluation at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], she was noted to have dysarthria and ataxia on exam.
Labs were wnl, and a CT head showed extensive deep white matter hypodensity extending to the subcortical regions most likely representing chronic small vessel ischemia, but no acute infarction.
CTA showed occlusion of the basilar artery and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2184-8-2**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Radiology: Non-Contrast CT of Head ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]): There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction.
There is extensive deep white matter hypodensity extending to the subcortical regions.
This most likely reflects chronic small vessel ischemia.
There is dense calcification of the cavernous carotid arteries bilaterally.
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] Brain MRI: Inferior left cerebellar infarct + a small right pontine DWI abnormality.
CTA shows an abrupt cut-off in the lower midbasilar with distal reconstitution and a hypoplastic L-VA. .
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2184-8-1**] 4:56 AM IMPRESSION:  Evidence of prior tuberculosis and potentially asbestos exposure (pleural plaques may also be related to tuberculosis itself).
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Acute infarct involving the inferior periphery of the left cerebellar hemisphere, likely embolic, related to the proximal basilar arterial thromboembolic disease.
Somewhat equivocal, less marked abnormality involving the right medullary pyramid, which may represent a more subacute infarct, perhaps related to the same source.
Expected abnormality of the basilar arterial flow-voids, with otherwise patent intracranial vasculature.
Post-surgical ocular findings.
There is no new parenchymal hypodensity to suggest interval infarction.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
Note is made of mucosal thickening as well as air-fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses, specifically involving the sphenoid and maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Evolution of left cerebellar infarction and chronic microvascular disease.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2184-8-4**] 4:45 PM IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe apical predominant centrilobular parenchyma.
No evidence of intrathoracic malignancy.
With large calcified right lung granuloma and few small calcified mediastinal lymph nodes, the ipsilateral-only, pleural calcification is more likely due to prior granumomatous infection than prior asbestos exposure.
No findings of either active infection or pulmonary asbestosis.
Small nodule in the right lobe of thyroid and left adrenal nodule should both be further evaluated with ultrasound, if not already performed.
Moderate coronary artery calcifications.
CTA HEAD AND NECK W&W/O C & RECONS	Study Date of [**2184-8-8**] 5:46 PM HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Again confluent areas of low attenuation are redemonstrated in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which are nonspecific and may reflect chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
A more conspicuous area is noted on the left pons related with ischemia and demonstrated on the prior T2-weighted sequence MR examination dated [**2184-8-1**].
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
The V4 segment of the right vertebral artery is not clearly identified and possibly this vessel terminates on PICA versus atherosclerotic disease.
Both posterior communicating arteries are patent, the distal branches of the middle, anterior and posterior cerebral arteries are not clearly identified, related with diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
CTA OF THE NECK: Significant atherosclerotic disease and plaques are visualized at the aortic arch, the origin of the supra-aortic vessels appears patent and also demonstrates multiple atherosclerotic plaques.
The right carotid cervical bifurcation appears patent with dense atherosclerotic plaques and soft plaques, the maximum caliber on the internal carotid artery in the proximal segment estimated in 6.5 mm and distally 5.3 mm.
The left cervical carotid bifurcation demonstrate atherosclerotic plaques with no significant stenosis, the proximal segment measures approximately 6.2 mm and distally 4.9 mm.
The right vertebral artery is nondominant and the V4 segment is thin, possibly terminating in PICA versus atherosclerotic narrowing.
The left vertebral artery appears dominant with no evidence of flow or stenotic lesions.
Visualized osseous structures demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes consistent with anterior and posterior spondylosis, more significant from C3 through C6 levels.
The lung apices demonstrate persistent atypical centrilobular emphysema and pleural thickening.
Chronic microvascular ischemic disease as described above, cerebellar infarctions as well as left pontine ischemic change, previously demonstrated by MRI.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Significant narrowing of the basilar artery, more significant at the mid segment related with atherosclerotic disease.

The V4 segment is not clearly identified, possibly the right vertebral artery terminates in PICA versus atherosclerotic narrowing.
Unchanged centrilobular emphysema and pleural thickening.
Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No definite structural cardiac source of embolism identified.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is an 82 year-old R-handed F who presented with acute onset of dysarthria and ataxia.
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] CTA showed an abrupt cut-off in the lower midbasilar with distal reconstitution and a hypoplastic left vertebral artery.
Her deficits were remarkably mild given the location of her occlusion, she was admitted to the Neuro ICU.
She was started on a heparin drip and an MRI/MRA was done that showed an inferior left cerebellar infarct and a small right pontine DWI abnormality.
The patient remained stable in the NeuroICU until she noted transient episodes where she noted new RUE weakness and worsening slurred speech.
Repeat head CTs showed no changes.
These were initially felt to be the result of hypoperfuion and she was treated with IV fluid boluses and continuous IV fluids to help support her BP and was kept in flat bed rest.
Latterly, it was discovered that she had these episodes regardless of BP or position and were anxiety related.
On [**2184-8-2**] the patient was transferred to the stroke step down unit and although she was initially very anxious and having multiple of these transient episodes, these settled and she was started on citalopram for anxiety.
Of note the patient has been having episodes of dysarthria, and subjective tingling sensation (sometime subjective weakness in the right hand).
These episodes are short lived, and will resolve in [**10-28**] minutes.
She has been re-scanned during these episodes and there has not been any evidence of new lesion and she has been therapuetic on coumadin.
These are likely anxiety related, and if they resolve she does not need further workup for them .
# Basilar clot: Patient has risk factors of HTN and HLD, ex-smoker.
She presented with acute onset dysarthria and ataxia.
Neurological examination revealed dysarthria and gait instability but normal cerebellar function and no other focal neurologic signs.
CT scan at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] was negative for acute infarct but CTA showed an abrupt cut-off in the lower midbasilar with distal reconstitution and a hypoplastic left vertebral artery.
Her deficits were remarkably mild given the location of her occlusion but warrant very close monitoring and thus she was monitored on the neuro ICU.
She was started on a heparin drip and an MRI/MRA was done that showed an inferior left cerebellar infarct and a small right pontine DWI abnormality.
Given smoking and asbestos hx with pleural plaques requested CT-chest which showed COPD changes and pleural plaques but no mass.
Echo showed mild pulmonary HTN, LVEF >55% and no cardiac source of embolism found.
The patient remained stable in the Neuro ICU until she noted transient episodes where she noted new RUE weakness and worsening slurred speech.
Repeat head CTs showed no changes.
These were initially felt to be the result of hypoperfuion and she was treated with IV fluid boluses and continuous IV fluids to help support her BP and was kept in flat bed rest and salt tablets were also trialled.
Latterly, it was discovered that she had these episodes regardless of BP or position and were anxiety related and these interventions were stopped.
On [**2184-8-2**] the patient was transferred to the stroke step down unit and although she was initially very anxious and having multiple of these transient episodes, these settled and she was started on citalopram for anxiety.
Repeat CTA head showed Significant narrowing of the basilar artery, more significant at the mid segment related with atherosclerotic disease in addition to diffuse atherosclerotic changes in the distal branches of the middle, anterior and posterior cerebral arteries.
# Pulmonary: Patient had chronic upper respiratory tract symptoms with cough productive of sputum.
This may be related to the CT-chest showed no mass but identified a large, calcified right lung granuloma and a few small calcified mediastinal lymph nodes.
There were no findings of either active infection or pulmonary asbestosis.
# Endocrine: Patient has no hx of DM and had HbA1c 5.8%.
Transitional issues: Radiology recommended U/S for small nodule in the right lobe of thyroid and left adrenal nodule identified on CT-chest.

You presented with slurred speech and unsteadiness.
You had several CT scans and an MRI scan which showed and small stroke in the left cerebellum which coordinates movement in the left side of the body and accounts for your reduced coordination on that side.
You also had episodes of worsened speech and generalised or right arm weakness.
These were initially thought to be due to reduced blood flow to the base of the brain but latterly was felt to be less concerning and also linked to anxiety.
