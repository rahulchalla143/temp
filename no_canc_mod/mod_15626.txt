He underwent an ETT on [**10-12**] where he exercised for 7.5 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol with ST depressions along with MIBI showing moderate to severe perfusion defects in the distal anterior wall and apex.

History of elevated cholesterol.
History of pancreatitis in [**2196-1-11**] secondary to HAART.
Sclera anicteric.
No JVD or bruits.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Urinalysis had a specific gravity of greater then 1.035 with negative nitrate and negative leukocyte esterase.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 39 year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization.
The patient initially underwent a cardiac catheterization, which was notable for the left main with no significant obstructive coronary artery disease.
The left anterior descending coronary artery had a mid to proximal 95% vessel true bifurcation lesion and to a diagonal branch.
The left circumflex had a serial 70% stenosis and the right coronary artery had a proximal serial 40 to 50% stenosis.
This catheterization was notable for 20% distal stenosis in the left main.
Left anterior descending coronary artery had approximately 20% with 90% bifurcation lesions involving diagonal branch along with a more distal 70% lesion and the left circumflex had a 70% serial lesion.
The procedure had been notable for successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the mid left circumflex along with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery with jailing of the D1.
This may have also been secondary to large vagal maneuver as well.
Otherwise the patient had an decrease in his hematocrit from admission of 27.1 to 22.5.
