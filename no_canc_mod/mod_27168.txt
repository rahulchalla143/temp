Admission Date:  [**2131-12-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-12-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-11-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: Palpitations and lightheadedness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 59 year old female with sarcoidosis, LBBB (known for at least 3 years) presents with lightheadedness and palpitations that lasted for 2 hours on day of admission.
She went to OSH where she was found to be in wide complex tachycardia.
They gave her adenosine which broke her out of SVT and back into sinus rhythm with left bundle, HR 80.
She denies any chest pain with this episode.
Past Medical History: Sarcoidosis LBBB Left breast ca s/p lumpectomy and XRT h/o hyperthyroidism Osteoporosis   Social History: Lives with husband.
Family History: Mother with CAD s/p CABG Father with CAD s/p CABG and "valve replacement"  Physical Exam: 97.8F HR 90 BP 128/79 RR 18 96%RA Gen: awake, alert, pleasant, sitting up in bed, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, MMM Neck: supple, no JVD CV: Distant HS, normal S1, S2 without mrg, RRR Pulm: CTAB, no w/r/r Abd: Normoactive BS, soft, ND/NT Ext: WWP, no edema   Pertinent Results: [**12-3**] CXR: Symmetric interlobular septal thickening in bilateral lower lobes.
This can be due to chronic congestive heart failure, however, there is no acute evidence of pulmonary edema or acute failure.
The possibility of underlying interstitial lung disease cannot be totally excluded.
Severely dilated left ventricular cavity size with severe global hypokinesis and focal inferior akinesis and mid-basal septal akinesis/dyskinesis.
No MR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
No MR evidence of right ventricular fatty infiltration/dysplasia.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
There was a 1 cm lymph node in the supracarinal region.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no evidence of coronary artery disease.
The LMCA, LAD, LCX, and RCA had no flow-limting lesions.
The LAD had a distal myocardial brige.
Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with a calculated ejection fraction of 23%.
Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 year old female with sarcoidosis and history of LBBB who presented with palpitations, lightheadedness and wide complex tachycardia.
# Arrhythmia:  Rhythm from OSH was reviewed by EP and appeared most likely ventricular tachycardia as opposed to SVT with aberrancy given a change in axis.
She had one episode on the floor at [**Hospital1 18**], associated with lightheadedness, self limited, which also appeared consistent with VT.
Given her history of sarcoidosis and LBBB, there was certainly concern for infiltrative granulomatous cardiac disease.
A cardiac MRI was obtained to further evaluate for evidence of cardiac sarcoid, which revealed severe LV hypokinesis (EF 28%); however, was not consistent with cardiac sarcoid.
Cardiac catheterization was done which did not reveal evidence of coronary artery disease.
She had an electrophysiology study at which time she went into complete heart block and she was transferred to the CCU with a temp wire for further monitoring prior to device placement.
# Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction:  An echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate her known LBBB which revealed global hypokinesis with ejection fraction of [**9-30**]%.
She has never had symptoms of heart failure, but was started on beta blocker and ACEI for LV systolic dysfunction.
As above, she underwent cardiac MRI to further evaluate the possibility of cardiac sarcoid, which was not consistent with this diagnosis.
# Sarcoidosis:  She was originally diagnosed in approximately [**2123**] when she was found to have hilar/mediastinal LAD on imaging.
