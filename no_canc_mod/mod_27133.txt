History of Present Illness: This is a 79 year old female with known history of coronary artery disease,  mitral regurgitation and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
She presented to [**Hospital1 **] complaining of acute shortness of breath awakening her from sleep.
Chest x-ray at that time was consistent with pulmonary edema.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 60% in-stent stenosis in the proximal LAD stent and a patent RCA stent.
Left ventriculography confirmed 4+ mitral regurgitation and estimated LV function around 60%.
Prior to transfer, she was started on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.
