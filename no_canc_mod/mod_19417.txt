Admission Date:  [**2124-6-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-7-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-4-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Shellfish / Latex / Ivp Dye, Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement  History of Present Illness: 79 y/o male with PMHx significant for CABG and porcine AVR in [**2116**] who presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] with cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
Patient states that shortness of breath was the primary symptom where he could not even take a few steps without getting short of breath.
At [**Hospital3 4107**] it was felt that he had a RLL pneumonia and started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
During his hospital stay he suddenly became nauseous and had episodes of dry heaves x 5; denies any emesis.
After the episode of dry heaves patient developed chest tightness which he states was relieved with aspirin.
His cardiac enzymes became positive and peaked with TropI of 1.48 and CK of 103.
Also rather tightness than pain.
Never had CP during the time of his CABG (was just found to have an old MI on stress test).
He has a dry cough with occasional sputum production (clear).
Sick contacts significant for his daughter who had similar symptoms two weeks ago and was treated with abx.
No urinary symptoms.
No recent changes in his bowel movements.
Other Past History: DM type 2, diet controlled per patient Hyperlipidemia HTN H/O nephrolithiasis H/O VRE H/O C. diff TIA in [**2116**] after CABG operation   Social History: Significant Asbestos exposure in Navy.
Mother and father with heart disease.
Family History: Mother and father with heart disease.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: Mild  crackles at bases, no wheezes or rhonchi.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
EKG at OSH demonstrated NSR, LBBB pattern with diffuse ST changes but no change compared to an EKG from 3/13 per EKG report at OSH.
Nuclear stress test at OSH on [**2124-3-3**] showed large, moderately severe, fixed defect in lateral wall and large, severe, fixed defect in inferior wall.
Also severe hypokinesis with LVEF of 24%.
Left-sided pleural thickening may represent malignant or nonmalignant (loculated effusion) pleural based disease and not fully characterized.
Ovoid opacity along the major fissure likely represents fluid.
Right lung base opacities not fully characterized.
Echo [**2124-6-9**]: Left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity enlargement and extensive regional and global biventricular systolic function c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No evidence of lobar pneumonia.
Bilateral partially loculated pleural effusions in the upper portion of the chest and bilateral areas of smoothly marginated pleural thickening in the lower portions of the chest.
Evaluation of pleural disease is limited in the absence of intravenous contrast.
Diffuse pleural thickening can be seen as a sequela of prior asbestos exposure, and at least one calcified pleural plaque is identified.
Malignant pleural disease is more typically unilateral than bilateral but a malignant etiology cannot be excluded.
Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy with additional nodes in the supraclavicular and retrocrural region.
If the patient has experienced recent CHF in a setting of the history of myocardial infarction, the nodes could potentially be related to this condition.
However, short-term followup CT in [**3-24**] weeks may be helpful to ensure resolution and to exclude a neoplastic cause such as lymphoma or metastatic disease.
Diffuse ground-glass opacities with mild septal thickening.
Although non-specific, this is very likely due to hydrostatic edema.
Incompletely imaged 8.5 cm left renal cystic lesion.
Dedicated renal ultrasound could be performed for complete characterization if warranted clinically.
Moderate right pleural effusion has changed in distribution, still substantially fissural, but not in overall volume.
The smaller left pleural effusion is stable.
The portions of the lungs not obscured by pleural abnormality are grossly clear.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetes originally admitted to OSH with severe dyspnea where he was treated for presumed pneumonia, transferred for cardiac catheterization which was deferred secondary to ongoing pneumonia and decompensated CHF.Pt was intubated on the floor for hypoxic respiratory [**Hospital 73895**] transferred to the MICU.
Pt had a long MICU course complicated by FUO along with rash which resolved secondary to discontinuation of zosyn which was being given empirically for presumed pna.
failed extubation secondary to pulmonary edema in the context of pt's extremely low EF.
Pt's HD status remained tenous throughout with daily episodes of transient hypotension mostly responsive to fluid boluses and later responsive to transient pressors as attempts were being made to diurese patient for immienent hypotension.
also treated for psuedomonas VAP with tobramycin and ceftazadime.
Renal function worsened and multi-system failure ensued.
