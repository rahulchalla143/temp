History of Present Illness: This is an 81 year old male with a history of paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation who was recently admitted to OSH with chest pain.
Cardiac workup included a nuclear stress test that showed no evidence of ischemia.
However, he again had left sided chest pain associated with a racing heart rate and presented to the OSH ED.
Further cardiac workup included cardiac angiogram that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease.
He presents to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of coronary artery revascularization.

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace mitral regurgitation is seen.
An epiaortic scan was performed which confirmed dilated aorta with no significant atheromatous disease at canullation or cross clamp location.
Minimal pericardial air inclusion might be present at the level of  the aortopulmonary window.
Unchanged left rib fractures and area of mild  pleural thickening might have increased in extent.
Pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis is improving.
No pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumonia.
All chest tubes, invasive lines and epicardial  pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol and without complication.
By the time of discharge on postoperative day nine, the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with Percocet.
There was very minimal sternal drainage and PO antibiotic was changed to a one week course of Keflex.
The cardiac surgery office will also arrange a chest CT scan with contrast in approximately one year time to re-evaluate his dilated ascending aorta.
