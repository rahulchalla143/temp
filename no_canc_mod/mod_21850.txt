This pregnancy was complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension.
Maternal proteinuria and blood pressure's in the 180s/100.
History of ulcer and migraines.
Due to concerns of fetal deceleration and progressive maternal preeclampsia, the infant was delivered by cesarean section.
However, minimal aeration, increased work of breathing, so the baby was intubated and given the first dose of surfactant.
Small hypotonic premature infant with respiratory distress.
Lungs with poor crackly aeration yet symmetrical.
CV:  No murmurs.
No sacral anomalies.
He remained on CPAP until day of life number eight when he was reintubated for increased work of breathing.
During this time, he had several attempts off CPAP which required resumption of CPAP because of increased work of breathing.
It was discontinued at this time and  the baby has been free of apnea and bradycardia for greater than seven days.
Per the recommendation of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37305**], a cardiac echocardiogram was done to assess for pulmonary hypertension on [**2123-1-18**].
The study revealed normal cardiac anatomy and no current evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
He had some transient hyper/hypoglycemia which responded to glucose infusion rate alteration.
Caloric density was then increased to 30 calories of breast milk with ProMod at 150 cc per kilogram.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The baby was treated for physiologic jaundice.
He was also initially thought to possibly have a left inguinal hernia.
He was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 38447**] from the Surgical Team at the [**Hospital3 1810**] who did not find a hernia on exam at the time of his consult and was not palpable at the time of discharge.
The parents have been instructed on how to assess for an inguinal hernia.
He also has a small soft umbilical hernia.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The baby had an initial CBC drawn and blood culture because of his premature birth.
Cultures remained negative and the neutropenia was thought to be related to his growth restriction.
He has had no further issues with infection.
NEUROLOGY:  The baby has had serial head ultrasounds showing no intraventricular hemorrhage and no periventricular leukomalacia.
OPHTHALMOLOGY:  The baby has had serial eye examinations, the last one being on [**2123-1-20**] which showed regression of his retinopathy of prematurity, currently in zone III with a plan to follow-up in two weeks.
CARE/RECOMMENDATIONS:  Continue ad lib feedings of breastfeeding or E20 with iron with Fer-In-[**Male First Name (un) **] supplementation, as stated above.
Influenzae immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against Influenzae to protect the infant.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome with chronic lung disease.
Status post apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
Retinopathy of prematurity.
