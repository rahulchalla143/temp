STUDIES: EKG [**10-30**] (OSH): NSR @ 68 bpm, ST elevation in I, aVL, V2-V5; ST depression in II, III, aVF EKG [**10-30**] ([**Hospital1 18**]): 87 bpm, ST elevations in V2-V6, TWI in aVL, V1, V2, Q waves in I, II, aVF, V1-V6.
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had 40% ostial stenosis at its origin.
There was further 95% stenosis in the proximal vessel.
The LCX was a large vessel and widely patent.
Successful primary PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0 Cypher DES.
There was no residual stenosis at the stent site, however 70-80% stenoses in the mid and distal LAD were left untreated.
The final angiography showed TIMI III flow in the distal vessel and no evidence of dissection, embolization or peforation.
