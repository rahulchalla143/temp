Strips by EMS showed inferior STE with worsened lateral ST depression.
Started on nitro drip and heparin, emergent cath there showing vein grafts down and patent LIMA to LAD with retrograde filling through re-stenosed old DES, no culprit vessel was identified.
He was transferred here to the CVICU for consideration of repeat bypass--films reviewed by CT surgery & pt not felt to be a candidate.
Nitro drip weaned over the course of the day with 1 episode of [**12-30**] chest pain lasting a few minutes.
Pt CURRENTLY denies chest pain/pressure and shortness of breath.
Also denies groin pain, leg pain, leg numbness.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Pt denies: paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
No hematoma, but tender in right groin SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
EKG: several strips reviewed -initial EMS strip [**1-12**]: STE (2mm in II, III, aVF), worsened downloping ST depression I, AVL, V4-V6.
on a 12-lead, but recurred at 5:30 on a strip labeled 'with pain' -last 12-lead from CVICU showing resolved STE and lessened lateral ST depressions .
Brief Hospital Course: 42 yo M with CAD s/p CABG presented to OSH with CP & STE, Emergent cath revealed no culprit vessel.
CP & STE resolved without PTCI.
# Transient STE/NSTEMI: Patient underwent emergent cath for chest pain and transient ST elevations, but no culprit vessel was seen on OSH cath.
He was taken for a repeat catheterization to determine whether PTCI could be performed on a re-stenosed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 8532**] to LIMA touchdown, but was seen to have 90% stenosis of LAD proximal to LIMA insertion which was not amenable to PCI, and distal LAD sub-total occlusion.
# PUMP: Ventriculogram at OSH 30%.
Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and apical akinesis/dyskinesis with depressed free wall contractility.
No signs of fluid overload, cardiomyopathy likely ischemic in origin.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Non-ST Elevation Myocardiac Infarction s/p cardiac catheterization without intervention  Secondary Diagnosis: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital for chest pain and you were found to be having a heart attack.
You underwent cardiac catheterization and it showed blockages in the arteries supplying your heart.
