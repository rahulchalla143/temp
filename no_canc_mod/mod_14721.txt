Orthopedics and Neurosurgery were immediately consulted because of her injuries.
Her C2 dens fracture was managed non operatively with a hard cervical collar to be worn until follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**], Neurosurgery, in 6 weeks.
She was started on Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
Her pain was initially managed with PCA Morphine; this was later changed to longer acting narcotics which will likely require further adjustment given her increased pain postoperatively.
Because of pain control issues and her deconditioned status patient had required supplemental oxygen to maintain her saturations >93%.
Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have recommended short term rehab stay.
Her insurance carrier has denied her rehab stay, despite appealing the initial denial, based on their criteria that patient has not met for acute and subacute facilities.
