Admission Date:  [**2161-4-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2161-4-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-2-1**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIAC CARE UNIT  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain for 24 hours.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 44-year-old male with sudden onset of substernal chest pain around 9:30 pm on [**4-21**] while working.
He reports associated shortness of breath, nausea, but denies any lightheadedness, syncope, or back pain.
He went to the outside hospital on [**4-22**], and was found to have a slight troponin leak, but no electrocardiogram changes consistent with acute ischemia, and was started on some nitroglycerin with some relief of pain.
CT scan of the contrast films from the outside hospital was reviewed by our in-house radiologist, and showed no signs of dissection or aortic hematoma.
Cardiac catheterization was done showing a large ascending aortic aneurysm, severe [**2-10**]+ aortic regurgitation, but no aortic dissection.
The transesophageal echocardiogram was done on arrival to the Cardiac Care Unit showing bicuspid aortic valves, [**2-10**]+ aortic insufficiency with an ejection fraction of 25-30%, borderline dilated left ventricle, moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, and markedly dilated ascending aorta of 5.1 cm.
No aortic valve stenosis was seen.
There are no vegetations on the transesophageal echocardiogram that was seen.
The patient had 1+ mitral regurgitation.
MEDICATIONS:  No medications.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No known drug history.
FAMILY HISTORY:  He reports a family history of coronary artery disease in his uncle.
He is a middle aged man sedated in no acute distress.
Heart was a regular, rate, and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border with 1/6 diastolic murmur with the right upper sternal border with a left ventricular heave.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
There is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema in his extremities.
Troponin peaked at 1.6 and decreased thereafter.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed normal sinus rhythm at 92 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, normal intervals, Q in [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in I and V6, J-point elevation in V1 through V3 with some ST elevations, T-wave inversion in I and L, V4 through V6, left ventricular hypertrophy by criteria.
CHEST X-RAY:  Widen mediastinum with mild congestive heart failure, small left pleural effusion.
CT scan from the outside hospital showed a 5.5 cm descending aortic aneurysm with no dissection or hematoma.
Trivial mitral regurgitation, 3+ aortic regurgitation, and minimal aortic stenosis.
The patient was admitted for treatment of his congestive heart failure as well as close monitoring of his hemodynamics.
He was started on Lasix and for diuresis, and started on an ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction.
The patient's aortic insufficiency was thought to be chronic due to his congenital bicuspid valve.
His thoracic aneurysm was thought to be due to his uncontrolled hypertension, however, his RPR and ESR were sent.
The patient was also started on nicotine patch for his nicotine withdrawal symptoms.
He was followed by Cardiothoracic Surgery who felt that the patient required surgery for valve repair and aortic aneurysm repair.
He remained stable, and was discharged home with a diagnoses of aortic insufficiency, congenital systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, thoracic aortic aneurysm without rupture.
