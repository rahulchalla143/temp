He underwent a chest x-ray which showed no injuries.
A CT of his head showed right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with contusion, small bilateral subdural hemorrhages, and a large left frontal subgaleal hematoma.
A CT of his cervical spine showed no injuries.
On CT imaging of his torso, three vessel coronary artery disease involving the LAD was observed, as were multiple renal cysts consistent with polycystic kidney disease, particularly in combination with his elevated serum creatinine.
Plain films of his left shoulder and elbow showed a proximal humeral fracture.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended admission to ICU with q1H neurochecks, serial head CT scans, and dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Orthopedics recommended a sling for comfort Mr. [**Known lastname 34393**] was admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit were he was monitored closely including q1H neuro checks, and was started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
They felt that the most likely cause of his symptoms was dilantin toxicity, recommended holding his dilantin and checking serial levels.
They also suggested MRI/MRA of head and neck to rule out aneurysm, vertebral artery dissection or stroke.
The patient became repeatedly agitated in CT, requiring two attempts to obtain the MRI, as a result the MRA of the neck was not done.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**] right frontal hemorrhagic contusion and bilateral frontoparietal subdural hygromas, with [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**] frontal and right parietal subdural hematomas.
No infarctions were seen.
These findings in combination with the patient's improved mental status, dysarthria and ataxia prompted neurology to recommend cancelling the MRA neck.
