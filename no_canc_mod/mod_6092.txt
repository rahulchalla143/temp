right great toe with ulcer with surrounding erythema to DIP.
A routine CT scan of his abdomen showed intra-abdominal free air but this was thought to be due to his recent PD catheter manipulation.
Two hours after his initial examination his pressor requirement increased.
He was confused initially post-extubation but this cleared as his condition improved.
As he remained in the ICU for a number of days post-extubation he did develop multifactorial delerium.
This was not believed to be due to infection as he was afebrile with a normal WBC count and negative culture data.
He did develop a-fib with rapid ventricular response requiring an amiodarone drip and digoxin.
Pulmonary:  After extubation he continued to have volume overload due to IVF resuscitation.
He did have small bilateral pleural effusions that improved with CVVH.
The night before he expired he did develop tachypnea and increased oxygen requirement.
A CXR obtained at that time showed pulmonary edema.
The following morning he again became tachypneic with increased anxiety requiring reintubation.
Final pathology was consistent with ischemia.
Due persistent pressor requirements and a persistent leukocytosis he underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement on [**2193-3-14**] due to concerns for cholecystitis.
A CT scan of his abdomen showed no intra-abdominal pathology to explain the rise in WBC.
900cc was removed and he became hypotensive requiring a small IVF bolus.
It was thought that he had line problems as they were too short and not reaching his right atrium.
At this point a CT scan was obtained and it revealed no intra-abdominal pathology.
The flagyl was discontinued but due to his elevated WBC it was resumed empirically.
On POD3 he still had a pressor requirement and a leukocytosis so he receieved a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
Bile cultured from this tube was negative for bacteria.
Endocrine:  He is a diabetic and required an insulin drip due to hyperglycemia.
Skin:  He developed a pressure ulcer on the posterior aspect of his neck from the device used to secure the ETT.
