Admission Date:  [**2131-8-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-9-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-7-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status/Hyponatremia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 y/o woman with a PMHx of chronic hyponatremia (131-133) of uncertain etiology, osteoporosis, and b/l hearing loss p/w AMS after being found unresponsive in bed on [**2131-8-30**] in the morning by husband.
Pt started taking bowel prep at 6pm on [**8-29**] for routine colonoscopy scheduled for the morning of [**8-30**], and took a second dose at 1:15am, after which she has no memory.
Code stroke was called for NIHSS of 9 (inability to follow comands, disorientation, severe aphasia, severe sensory loss).
Patient was sent for STAT head CT that demonstrated old lacunar strokes; CTA did not demonstrate vessel cut offs or dissections, and CTP did not show perfusion abnormalities.
On further exam, she demonstrated increased tone in her bilateral extremities, dry mucus membranes.
Neuro evaluated patient in ED, did not believe patient was having a stroke, but could not rule out seizures or osmotic demyelinating syndrome.
Past Medical History: - Chronic Hyponatremia (131-133 in past, uncertain etiology, thought to be [**2-14**] polydipsia) - Diverticulosis - Chronic Otitis Externa - [**Doctor Last Name **] bullosa - Hyperlipidemia - Depression  Social History: Pt lives at home with husband in [**Name (NI) 745**].
Family History: No history of strokes.

CT Brain Perfusion & CTA Head w/ & w/o Contrast ([**2131-8-30**]): FINDINGS: NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures.
There is a hypodense area in the right frontal periventricular location, with mild dilatation of the adjacent portion of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and hence likely old.
A small hypodense focus noted adjacent to the right side of the third ventricle is indeterminate.
Mildly prominent ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are noted, related to volume loss.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells.
Slightly increased MTT in the thalami on both sides is of uncertain significance.
The major intra- and extra-cranial arteries are patent without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 3 mm within the resolution.
Mild contour irregularity of the cavernous carotid segments, with tortuous arteries with mild focal prominence noted on the right side.
Mild degenerative changes are noted in the cervical spine.
The distal cervical internal carotid artery measures 4.9mm on the right and 3.4mm on the left.
Evaluation of the proximal cervical internal carotid artery is limited due to dental artifacts.
Mild contour irregularity of the distal cervical internal carotid arteries is noted related to atherosclerotic disease.
Mucosal thickening is noted in the sphenoid sinus.A few small scattered nodes are noted.
There are areas of scarring in the lung apices on both sides.
Mild fullness is noted in the piriform sinus and can be correlated clinically on the right side.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Small hypodense focus adjacent to the third ventricle on the right side is of indeterminate age.
While there is no obvious asymmetric perfusion deficit in the imaged portions of the brain, this does not include the MCA territory completely.
Consider MR of the head if not contraindicated to evaluate for acute infarction.
Patent major intra- and extra-cranial arteries without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or obvious aneurysm.
Mild contour irregularity noted related to atherosclerotic disease.
Evaluation of the proximal cervical internal carotid artery limited due to artifacts.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE Patient is 72 y/o woman with a PMHx of baseline hyponatremia (131-133) presents with diarrhea, vomiting, and AMS in setting of SSRI and bowel prep, found to have Na of 113. .
# Hyponatremia - Patient presented to ED with Na 113, in setting of undergoing bowel prep for colonoscopy and SSRI use, but was euvolemic or slightly dry on exam.
Urine Osms were notable for inappropriate concentration, presence of inappropriate Na, which would argue more for SIADH than a hypovolemic picture.
There is some suspicion that polydipsia may have contributed to her hyponatremia.
# AMS - The originally broad differential for her AMS was narrowed by reorientation concordant with normalizing Na.
# Depression - We held fluoxetine on this admission as well as on discharge.
We performed a number of laboratory blood tests and found that you had a very low level of sodium in your blood.
We believe that there were three reasons that you had a low sodium.
1) Your bowel prep may have caused salt loss 2) You may drink more fluid than your kidney can tolerate 3) Your fluoxetine have have had an idiosyncratic drug reaction known as the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH).
This is equivalent to 5 small cups or 4 cans of diet coke or 3 regular sized water bottles.
