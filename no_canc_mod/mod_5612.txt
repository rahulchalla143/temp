Admission Date:  [**2129-4-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2129-4-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2059-3-27**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease suffered an acute myocardial infarction in [**2128-4-14**], and she was taken to catheterization laboratory and found three vessel disease with successfully stented left anterior descending artery, found to have left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction of 57% with anterior apical dyskinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis.
In [**2128-11-14**], the patient returned to [**Hospital3 **] for chest pain.
Catheterization revealed totally occluded left anterior descending artery with brachytherapy.
Echocardiogram in [**2128-11-14**] showed an ejection fraction of 50%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hypokinetic anterior wall and kinetic anteroseptal wall, hypokinetic anterior apex, akinetic septal apex, and lateral apex and akinetic apex, 1+ mitral regurgitation.
On the morning of admission, she awoke, had a bowel movement, and shortly after that, she developed severe substernal chest pain [**6-23**] radiating to the back, positive diaphoresis, no nausea or vomiting.
No change in weight.
She has dyspnea on exertion with walking one block, no stairs.
Died at age 56 of a myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease in [**2129-11-14**], received brachytherapy through a restented left anterior descending artery, instent restenosis in [**2128-4-14**], stented left anterior descending artery.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, O2 dependent at night.
Peripheral vascular disease status post aorto-bifemoral bypass.
Congestive heart failure.
ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
A postcatheterization electrocardiogram showed atrial flutter/fibrillation, left axis deviation, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in V2 through V4, T-wave inversions in V2 through VI, poor R-wave progression.
HEENT:  No lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Pulmonary:  Bivalve sounds secondary to emphysematous changes.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities: No edema, no pulses, dopplerable, no cyanosis or clubbing.
Coronary artery disease/ischemia:  The patient was found to have a large acute myocardial infarction.
In the post myocardial infarction period, she did have a period of tachycardia to 160s, which was found to be VT.  For this she was bolused with lidocaine and put on a lidocaine drip.
She has an outpatient with this EP in approximately four weeks from discharge for followup and further discussion of risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiac arrhythmias.
Nevertheless, after the first 24 hours, she did not have any recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias.
The lidocaine drip was weaned off for 72+ hours prior to discharge, she was off lidocaine and had no further arrhythmic events.
There was no drop in hematocrit.
No recurrent gastrointestinal bleed.
Heme:  The patient did receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a decreased hematocrit, which was most likely secondary to the prior gastrointestinal bleed.
No acute issues.
Coronary artery disease.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure.
Ventricular arrhythmia.
Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
