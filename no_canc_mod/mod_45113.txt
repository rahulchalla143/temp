Since [**8-15**], the patient was continued with left lower extremity pain (predominantly foot) with some left buttock pain as well.
The patient's neurologic examination remained unchanged for the remainder of the hospitalization with minimal sensation in the left later foot, minimal voluntary movement below the left ankle, and pain on passive movement.
A hip/pelvic CAT scan from [**8-5**], on re-read, demonstrated swelling and potential fluid collection in the region of the left piriformis.
With concern for potential piriformis syndrome, the Pain Service was consulted for evaluation and potential injection.
A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis and left hip was obtained on [**8-21**] which again demonstrated swelling in the region of the piriformis, however, decreased swelling since prior CAT scan.
The study also demonstrated persistent collection in the left gluteus medias consistent with myonecrosis and fibrosis with normal sacral roots.
After consultation with both the Neurosurgical Service and Pain Service, the patient was continued on medical management for chronic pain with physical therapy.
The patient's anemia was felt secondary to acute renal failure documented in the earlier portion of the hospitalization.
The patient was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and treated with a 10-day course of oral Flagyl with complete resolution of both diarrhea, fever, and white blood cell count.
The patient was followed by Psychiatry for depression and anxiety.
Acute renal failure.
Aspiration pneumonia (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).
