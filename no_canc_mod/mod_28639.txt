History of Present Illness: 69 year old man with a history of endstage cardiomyopathy (NYHA class 4) and severe CHF with an EF of 15% (EF of 20% on milrinone drip) as well as severe MR p/w increasing shortness of breath an O2 requirements on increasing doses of Lasix.
The pt's wife also noted increased abdominal girth and pedal edema.
The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission for ventricular tachycardia controlled on amiodarone.
His course was complicated by episodes of acute pulmonary edema.
Following his discharge on [**2155-8-12**], the patient was able to ambulate and breathe comfortably until [**2155-8-16**], when he began to develop shortness of breath and developed an oxygen requirement that was increased from 2L to 4L on the day prior to admission.

No LAD, supple CARD: RRR, diffuse PMI, holosystolic murmur at apex.
No thrills, lifts.

CXR [**2156-8-18**]: Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.
The vertical central lucency projecting over the mid of the thoracic spine suggests sternal dehiscence that may be worse compared to the prior film.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, increased since the prior film as well as there is new worsening of the left lower lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis.
There is mild vascular engorgement consistent with mild failure, but unchanged since the prior study.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are three aortic valve leaflets which are mildly thickened.
Aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
IMPRESSION: no intra-atrial thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 69 year old man with a history of end stage cardiomyopathy (NYHA class 4) and severe CHF with an EF of 15% (EF of 20% on milrinone drip) as well as severe MR p/w SOB, DOE, PND, weight gain of 6lbs in a week, likely due to CHF exacerbation.
# CHF/Pump: On physical exam the patient appeared to be in volume overload with JVD to angle of the jaw, bibasilar rales, 1+ pitting edema in the lower extremities, and distended abdomen.
This was consistent with symptoms of SOB, PND, DOE and likely secondary to systolic and diastolic HF secondary to increased intravascular volume.
# CAD: He has a history of CAD, CK negative on this admission with no chest pain and EKG that is unchanged.
CHF exacerbation unlikely to be secondary to ACS in this setting.
# Respiratory: SOB and increased O2 requirement were likely secondary to CHF exacerbation and resultant pulmonary edema.
# Rheumatoid Arthritis: Swan neck deformities were stable.
