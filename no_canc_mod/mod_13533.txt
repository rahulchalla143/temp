Prenatal course was notable for amniocentesis with 46XX, otherwise benign.
Mother presented in spontaneous labor and had a precipitous delivery with meconium stained amniotic fluid and nonreassuring fetal tracing.
She was noted to have two cyanotic episodes and was rushed to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further care.
There was an epidural anesthesia.
No maternal fever.
Rupture of membranes was 15 minutes prior to the delivery.
No intrapartum antibiotics.
Upon arrival to the unit the infant had three cyanotic episodes, all associated with apnea with desaturations to 58, 68 and 70 percent.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has been without murmur    throughout her hospitalizations and has been    hemodynamically stable.
Due to infarct noted on head a CT    and echocardiogram were obtained on day of life number two    which showed mild to moderate left ventricular    dysfunction.
RESPIRATORY:  Due to apneic spells the patient was    intubated in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit on day of    life number one.
A KUB    was obtained which showed dilated loops but was otherwise    unremarkable.
On day of life number 5 she passed a    heme negative stool and had no further blood noted from    her nasogastric tube and therefore was allowed to start    feeds.
On day of    life number four when she had these guaiac positive    stools, temperature and disability, blood culture was    resent.
The antibiotics were discontinued and she had    no further infectious disease issues.
She had an abnormal PT PTT for which    hematology was consulted.
Right posterior cerebral artery infarction.
Mild left ventricular dysfunction.
