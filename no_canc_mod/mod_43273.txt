HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for aneurysmal clipping secondary to seizure disorder on Dilantin, heroin abuse on Methadone, who presented from detoxification with change in mental status.
She was noted to have a facial droop and some somnolence which prompted her to be sent to the Emergency Department.
In the Emergency Department, she was noted to have right-sided weakness, progressively decreasing mental status and alertness, and an absent gag.
At this point, her CT scan had been read as negative, and she had been seen by both the Stroke and Neurological Services who felt that she was not suffering from either an acute seizure or an acute stroke.
Uterine cancer status post surgery; no chemotherapy and no radiation therapy.
Seizure disorder secondary to aneurysmal clips.
Status post aneurysmal clipping times three.
Question of early onset of Alzheimer's disease.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive tobacco, positive heroine, positive alcohol.
There was a 2 out of 6 ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheezing.
[**Street Address(2) 103493**] depressions in II, III, and AVF, with T-wave inversions in the same leads, biphasic T-waves in V5 and V6, compared an electrocardiogram of [**2100-11-23**].
The ST depressions appeared deeper; however, there was a poor baseline on the prior electrocardiogram.
IMAGING:  Head showed an old left hypodense lesion with metal artifact from a clip, no acute bleed, no evidence of stroke.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for careful monitoring status post overdose presumed secondary to narcotics.
She was extubated uneventfully and did well from a pulmonary standpoint.
She was seen by Neurology and the Stroke Team who felt that this was unlikely to represent either ................. or stroke given the findings on CT scan and her abrupt resolution of symptoms with the administration of Narcan.
At the time of discharge, the most likely diagnosis was felt to be an overdose of narcotics given the response to Narcan.
This was done, and she had no further issues from a psychiatric standpoint.
Given the cocaine in her urine toxicology screen and minimal ST depressions on electrocardiogram, she was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Upon admission, she had a urinalysis which was consistent with infection and received Bactrim double strength for five days for this.
It was felt that this temperature and white count was either likely due to an exacerbation of her urinary tract infection or a small aspiration pneumonitis.
There was no evidence on a repeat chest film of severe pneumonitis or pneumonia.
She did state that she had a history of emphysema for which she has not been treated, and chest x-ray showed some nodularity in the periphery which can be consistent with talc granulomatosis secondary to heroine use.
At the time of this dictation, she is medically stable, and the plan is to discharge her to detoxification for further management of her acute addiction issues.
