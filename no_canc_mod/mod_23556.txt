No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Interval development of soft tissue stranding and haziness in the anterior mediastinum concerning for mediastinal hematoma.
Interval placement of a right chest tube with interval decrease in size of right pneumothorax, now small, and with decreased shift of the mediastinum.
Subcutaneous emphysema extending along the right lateral and posterior chest, abdomen and pelvis.
Multiple right-sided rib fractures, with a displaced fracture of the right posterior 8th rib and multiple additional nondisplaced fractures, as above.
Left upper lobe ground-glass opacity, may represent pulmonary contusion.
Multiple areas of mesenteric stranding and haziness likely reflect mesenteric contusions with more confluent area inferior to the spleen containing areas of high density, likely reflecting small hemoperitoneum.
Multiple pelvic fractures including right superior and inferior pubic rami with extension into the right acetabulum and a right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture.
Right pelvic hematoma adjacent to the right superior pubic rami fractures, grossly stable in size as compared to the prior study.
Large lateral right buttock hematoma with extensive overlying contusions/soft tissue induration.
Mild anterolisthesis of L4 over L5 of indeterminate age, but moderate adjacent degenerative changes suggests this could be chronic.
Collapsed distal descending colon/proximal sigmoid colon with suggestion of mild wall thickening, new since prior study, bowel injury cannot be excluded.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Study not tailored for evaluation for dissection.
Multiple incidental findings, including cholelithiasis.
Innumerable splenic calcifications as well as calcified mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes, most likely reflect prior granulomatous disease.
No evidence of fractures or misalignment of the cervical spine.
Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes along the cervical spine, most severe from C3 through C7, with associated moderate spinal canal stenosis.
Small left acute subdural hematoma overlying the left temporal lobe, without significant mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Large right pneumothorax, with shift of the mediastinum to the left, suggestive of tension.
Small focus of contusion within the left upper lobe in the lung.
Patchy areas of stranding throughout the mesentery, suspicious for mesenteric injury.
Small focus of hemoperitoneum inferior to the tip of the spleen, without definite splenic injury identified, though limited by respiratory motion.
Mildly displaced fractures involving the right inferior and superior pubic rami, likely extending into the acetabulum.
Mildly displaced right eighth rib fracture.
Marked atheromatous disease of the abdominal aorta, without definite acute aortic injury.
Minimal subarachnoid hemorrhage now detected.
No mass effect.
Minor sinus mucosal changes in the ethmoidal sinus.
New surgical staples at the skin overlying the right parietal bone towards the vertex.
[**2175-10-14**] CXR : No evident pneumothorax.
He was seen by the Cardiology service as he had ST depression anterior, septal and laterally on his EKG.
There was no wall motion abnormalities and his EF was normal.
The EKG changes were due to demand ischemia (ie pain, trauma ) in the setting of anemia.
Due to his rib fractures and uncontrolled pain, he had a paravertebral block placed for pain control which also helped his pain from a right chest tube placement for pneumothorax.
He remained in the ICU for close neuro monitoring due to his left subdural hematoma.
He had no neurologic  deficits and a repeat head CT was unchanged.
During his stay in the ICU he was evaluated by the orthopedic service for his pelvic fractures and they will be treated in a closed manner therefore his weight bearing status is advance weight bearing as tolerated.
His chest tube was removed on [**2175-10-14**] and a post pull film showed no pneumothorax or effusion.
Hopefully after a stint in rehab he will be able to go home with increased independence.
