male with history of juvenile stroke and resulting right sided hemiparesis, currently followed by neurology for a cerebellar aneurysm.
When the patient presented to the ED, he had been found down with a sub-therapeutic dilantin level, reporting that he felt similar to his previously experienced seizure auras/post-ictal states.
He was admitted to the floor where his nurse witnessed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
They recommended a head CT-angiogram, which showed a stable cerebellar aneurysm, no new intracranial hemorrhages, and no new aneurysms.
His depression and anxiety were managed with his normal outpatient regimen with the exception of stopping his wellbutrin given the side effect of increased seizure threshold.
