No evidence of abscess formation or perforation.
Dilated main pancreatic duct worsened since [**2147-9-28**].
Transplanted kidney shows decreased enhancement consistent with history of evolving transplant failure.
There is slightly increased perinephric stranding, but no evidence of abscess or acute infection.
No pneumothorax is present.
New, however, is a density occupying the left lower lobe basal portion and obliterating the diaphragmatic contours, most likely representing a new retrocardiac atelectasis, not identified on the next previous study of [**11-6**].
No other new abnormalities are seen.
IMPRESSION: Development of sizeable left lower lobe atelectasis in retrocardiac position.
There is no hydronephrosis and no perinephric fluid collection is identified.
No cyst or stone or solid mass is seen in the transplant kidney.
Within the superficial tissues a heterogeneous mass is again identified previously presumed to be a hematoma.
Mildly elevated resistive indices are seen in the intraparenchymal arteries.
No hydronephrosis or collections identified.
Similar size and appearance of the subcutaneous hematoma in the right lower quadrant.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-8-6**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced (but was only mild on review of the prior study).
CT abd/pelvis showed uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis.
Due to asymptomatic relative hypotension after transfer to the medical floor, midodrine was started with improvement in blood pressure.
Metoprolol was discontinued due to hypotension.
