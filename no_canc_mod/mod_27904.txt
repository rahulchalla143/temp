Pt had flipped a mattress the previous night, and experienced b/l shoulder achiness that evening.
She also had chest tightness that she associated with an ongoing cold, and tightness was relieved with [**Last Name (un) 18774**] Vapor Rub.
This am, she thought she felt cold symptoms coming on, took a dose of Robitussin, and proceeded to have SOB with vomiting of clear/white phlegm, non-radiating substernal chest tightness, and bilateral shoulder pain.
Patient had symptoms at rest.
There is no history of PND, orthopnea, presyncope, syncope, or palpitations.
She has noted having decreased exercise tolerance over the past week.
Pt has been admitted for hypertensive ?urgency in [**6-4**] after inadvertantly holding all her BP and insulin/anti-glycemic medications prior to cataract surgery.
Pain had completely resolved from [**3-6**]->0/10 after Labetalol gtt and Morphine.
CXR prelim read showed mild heart failure, with moderate cardimegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 83 y/o F with HTN, DM2 on insulin, CKI, no prior CAD hx who presents with L shoulder pain and EKG changes in setting of hypertensive emergency.
# Hypertensive emergency: Patient initially on nitro gtt then weaned off as BP improved on PO medications.
Hypertensive emergency was thought to be multifactorial and secondary to med noncompliance.

# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Satting high 90s on room air.
Started on lasix 40mg daily which she tolerated well with slight bump in creatinine on day of discharge.
# CAD: Pt had NSTEMI in setting of hypertensive emergency.
# Stage III CRF: Cr on admission 1.3 (baseline at or above this level), now 1.7 after gentle diuresis with lasix.
