No acute intracranial process.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism although evaluation of subsegmental arteries in right lower lobe is suboptimal due to patient respiratory motion.
Prominent bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes some of which are enlarged.
Recommend clinical correlation with history of prior infection, inflammatory process, or concern for malignancy and further evaluation per clinical history.

Brief Hospital Course: 51 yo M with hx of ETOH abuse, CHF with EF 10-15%, HTN, Vpacer for bradycardia, CAD s/p MI in [**2189**] who presented intoxicated, febrile, and hypotensive.
# Altered mental status - Patient found to be intoxicated with ETOH level of 239, hypotensive with blood pressures in the 60s, and initial rectal temp of 103.
There was initial concern for meningitis given febrile with altered mental status and patient was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone and acyclovir at meningitis dosing.
Patient was monitored overnight and given afebrile, improvement in mental status, lack of nuchal rigidity and photophobia antibiotics were discontinued.
# Shock - Patient had presenting blood pressures in the 60s and was febrile to 103.
There was initial concern for distributive shock due to possible sepsis and he was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acylovir for potential meningitis.
However infectious workup negative and patient was afebrile, without leukocytosis, and clinically improved with IV fluids.
He was likely volume depleted in the setting of acute intoxication.
There was no clinical evidence to suggest primary distributive or cardiogenic process leading to his hypotension.
# CHF with EF 10-15% - Home antihypertensives including toprol, lisinopril, lasix and spironolactone initially held.
# hx of PE and LV thrombus - previously on warfarin/lovenox.
Lovenox and warfarin were held during admission given risk of bleed due to history of intracranial bleed.
# CAD ??????
His ACE and beta blocker were initially held due to hypotension, but restarted by time of discharge.
# Type 2 DM - Home metformin and glyburide held.
==================================================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Prominent bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes some of which are enlarged on CTA.
# his pacer appearred to be pacing at ~100bpm.
You were admitted for fever and low blood sugars.
Because of your heart failure, weight yourself daily.
