[**Numeric Identifier 46950**]  Admission Date:  [**2162-12-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2163-1-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-7-4**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) **]-Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 42915**] is a 73 year old male with a past medical history significant for obstructive sleep apnea requiring CPAP, rheumatoid arthritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, status post cerebrovascular accident of the left temporal lobe, frequent and recurrent urinary tract infections, complicated by urinary retention.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2162-12-11**] with pyuria, rigors, fevers to 106 and mental status changes as well as bilateral flank pain, urinalysis with 25-30 white cells but culture negative.
Blood culture during admission grew 202 bottles positive for Providencia Alcalifaciens sensitive to Imipenem and Levofloxacin.
Renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis resulting in the potassiums of 6, anuria, worsening acidosis requiring hemodialysis; 2.
Distributive shock secondary to gram negative sepsis requiring Dopamine drip, antibiotic coverage with Levaquin, Gentamicin and Imipenem; 3.
Subendocardial ischemia with a peak troponin of 1.47; 6.
Toxic metabolic encephalopathy that has since resolved; 7.
Respiratory failure, the patient was initially intubated for airway protection after failing CPAP due to his mental status changes.
Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP; 2.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease; 3.
Cerebrovascular accident with a left temporal lobe stroke in [**2156**], possibly a cavernous hemangioma; 5.
Urinary tract infections frequent and recurrent; 6.
Urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Slightly decreased breathsounds at bases.
No suprapubic tenderness.
Chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure, possible right lower lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 80, normal axis, normal intervals, T wave inversions in the inferior and lateral leads, isolated Qs in L, slight ST depression in V4.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 73 year old white male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea requiring CPAP, history of rheumatoid arthritis on Enbrel, admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**12-11**] with likely pyelonephritis and gram negative sepsis causing multi-organ dysfunction including renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis requiring hemodialysis, DIC subendocardial ischemia, toxic metabolic encephalopathy and hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred from the outside hospital for further management at the family's request.
Infectious disease - The patient was admitted with a resolving pyelonephritis and gram negative sepsis as well as a possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient remained afebrile with a normal to slightly elevated white blood count.
The patient's Foley catheter was changed on [**12-27**] and a repeat urinalysis was read as no evidence of infection.
He was noted to have decreased responses at 4 AM.
His arterial blood gases was 7.26, 54 and 71, showing a hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
The patient had increasing oxygen requirement over the following hours and was unresponsive to medications.
At 7 AM he was found to be unresponsive and a code was called.
The patient was intubated but became hypotensive after intubation requiring transient pressure support with Dopamine.
MICU evaluation suggested that the patient suffered a respiratory arrest likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
A neurologic event was considered as the cause of this, however, the patient had a head computerized tomography scan with no significant changes.
Sputum cultures in the MICU grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient was started on Vancomycin that was dosed renally by prn Vancomycin levels.
Abdominal computerized tomography scan showed no other obvious infections source.
His computerized tomography scan on [**2163-1-1**] showed bilateral pneumonia with no effusions, essentially normal abdomen.
The patient's bilateral aspiration pneumonia responded well to Vancomycin.
On transfer to the floor the patient denied any specific complaints.
He denied shortness of breath and stated that he was ready to leave the hospital.
The percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was used for tube feeds on [**2163-1-4**] without complications.
The patient was also noted to have elevated transaminases during his admission.
It was felt that this was likely secondary to his hypotensive episode after the respiratory failure on the floor.
Renal - The patient, as stated above, had acute tubular necrosis secondary to his gram negative sepsis and hypotension.
He required no further hemodialysis and continued to have good urine output.
Genitourinary - The patient was followed by Urology while he was in-house for his urinary retention.
They recommended Flomax and that the patient have indwelling Foley catheter to prevent further episodes of retention and urosepsis.
The patient was continued on Flomax with no difficulty.
Neurological - The patient's sepsis as stated above was complicated by encephalopathy.
The patient also had a left temporal hemorrhage which was noted on magnetic resonance imaging scan and computerized tomography scan.
The patient received Vitamin K for this purpose.
There was some concern that this hemorrhage might reflect malignancy/brain metastases, therefore the patient had pan computerized tomography scan which all ruled out malignancy.
Pulmonary - The patient was extubated on day #3 of initial MICU course, transferred to the floor and then, as stated above under Infectious Disease, the patient had a recurrent episode of respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
For his obstructive sleep apnea the patient utilized his CPAP.
Cardiology - The patient had suffered a non-Q wave myocardial infarction at the outside hospital.
