HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] number 2 is a 1310 gm, 28 and 6/7 weeks gestation male, twin number 2 born to a 30-year-old G1, P0 now 2 mother by caesarean section for spontaneous progression of preterm labor with known antenatal diagnosis of hydrocephalus.
This was an IVF twin pregnancy complicated by cervical shortening, with mother on bed rest since [**9-26**], subchorionic hemorrhage on twin 1, and ventriculomegaly with 2 vessel umbilical cord on twin 2.
MRI subsequently showed diffuse moderate ventriculomegaly and irregularity of the ventricular walls, possibly associated with hemorrhage as well as possible inferior vermian hypoplasia.
Rupture of membranes was at the time of delivery with clear amniotic fluid.
There was no maternal fever.
He subsequently received blow-by oxygen with mild grunting respirations and intercostal retractions.
His HEENT examination was significant for microcephaly with anterior fontanelle that was full but soft and mild splaying of the sutures.
He was nondysmorphic with an intact palate and mild nasal flaring.
His chest examination revealed intermittent grunting respirations with moderate intercostal retractions and fair breath sounds bilaterally with scattered coarse crackles.
Abdominal examination revealed a soft, nondistended abdomen with liver 2 cm below the right costal margin, no splenomegaly, no masses, active bowel sounds, a 2 vessel umbilical cord, and a patent anus.
Neurologic examination showed an active male responsive to stimulation with decreased tone symmetrically, but moving all extremities with an intact gag and grasp reflex.
HOSPITAL COURSE AT THE TIME OF THIS INTERIM DICTATION:  Respiratory:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] was intubated for respiratory distress at less than 1 hour of life.
He did develop apnea of prematurity and was started on caffeine on day of life 5.
Baby boy [**Known lastname **] developed hyperbilirubinemia with a maximum bilirubin of 5.5 on day of life 6.
Infectious disease:  In light of his prematurity and unknown GBS status, CBC and blood culture were sent on admission and baby boy [**Name (NI) **] was begun on ampicillin and gentamicin.
This showed a question of heterotopia with a hypoplastic vermis and fusion of the thalami.
There was massive hydrocephalus with dilatation of both lateral ventricles but a relatively normal third and fourth ventricle.
MRI was obtained on the same day, which confirmed the findings of the head ultrasound, but did not delineate between aqueductal stenosis and cerebral dysgenesis.
Neurosurgery felt that as long as head ultrasound and head circumferences remained stable, a shunt should be deferred, as there was no evidence at the present time for increased intracranial pressure.
Head ultrasound on day of life 11 showed increase in the ventricular size.
Neurosurgery attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 56743**], planned to take him to the operating room on [**12-1**] for a subgaleal shunt.
In light of concern for cerebral dysgenesis and a question of holoprosencephaly, a genetics consult was obtained on day of life 1.
He also had an ophthalmologic examination, which was normal.
Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
Apnea of prematurity.
Massive hydrocephalus.
Anemia of prematurity.
