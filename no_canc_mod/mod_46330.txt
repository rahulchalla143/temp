The pathology report from the surgery described the tissue samples as aortic valve leaflets with calcification and degenerative changes, no mention is made of rheumatic changes.
The echo report from the outside facility also describes the mitral valve leaflets as thickened from degenerative changes.
Given that the valvular changes are degenerative not rheumatic the acute on chronic heart failure is also felt to be a result of these same degenerative changes to her valvular structures.
