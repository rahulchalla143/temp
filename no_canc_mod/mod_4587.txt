HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had an echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] of this year which showed critical aortic stenosis and preserved left ventricular function with a valvular area of 0.6 cm sq, peak gradient of 60 and mean gradient of 40.
In [**Month (only) **] of this year also she had a Persantine Myoview that showed a relative decreased uptake within the anteroseptal wall.
This represents a submaximal stress test.
However, the patient had been experiencing left sided pain below her shoulder radiating to her back and shortness of breath over the last several months with activity.
She has these symptoms after walking about a ??????
She has not experienced these symptoms at rest.
She denies orthopnea, edema and lightheadedness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for aortic stenosis, diabetes mellitus, renal calculi, fibrocystic breasts, trigger finger, carpal tunnel syndrome.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes a nephrectomy secondary to renal stones in [**2087**], a hand operation and a hysterectomy in [**2083**].
Neck is supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Abdomen soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities are warm, right femoral and dorsalis pedis pulse left femoral and dorsalis pedis pulse, no bruits.
In summary, the cath report showed aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of .6 cm sq, a mean gradient of 50, preserved ventricular function with an EF of 50% and an RCA with an 80% mid vessel stenosis.
At the time of transfer the patient had a right arterial line, a Swan Ganz catheter, ventricular and atrial pacing wires, two mediastinal and a left pleural chest tube.
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period, however, after several hours in the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit she became hypotensive with increasing chest tube output and she was brought back to the operating room for re-exploration of her mediastinal bleeding at which time it was found that she had a coronary sinus injury.
In addition, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, however, somewhat hypertensive and she was begun on Nipride to control her blood pressure.
Hemodynamically she remained stable but somewhat hypertensive and therefore remained on Nipride.
Aortic stenosis, status post AVR with a #21 pericardial valve.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting with an SVG to the RCA.
Diabetes mellitus.
Renal calculi.
Fibrocystic breasts.
Carpal tunnel syndrome.
Heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 with no murmur.
Abdomen soft, non distended, nontender with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with 1+ pedal edema bilaterally.
Her left upper thigh incision is closed with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry, moderate hematoma at the left upper thigh incision.
