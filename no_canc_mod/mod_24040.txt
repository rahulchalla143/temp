The pt remained in house for the last 3 days of the hospital course only for titration of BP meds.
1) Hypertension: Admitted with HTN emergency.

2) Respiratory distress.
Likely metabolic acidosis with inadequate respiratory compensation.
-consider outpt stress .
-continue renagel and calcium -closely monitor lytes in the setting of hyperkalemia .
7) CHF: [**Month (only) 116**] have had some subendocardial ischemia given small trop leak, was likely [**1-16**] fluid overload and hypertension.
8) Anemia: Most likely chronic anemia [**1-16**] ESRD with superimposed UGI bleed.

If you have bleeding in your stool, or in your urine, or if you have chest pain or trouble breathing, please call your doctor or come to the emergency room.
He will need to schedule you to have a stress test.
If that is normal, you can then proceed to have further work-up of the intestinal bleeding you had.
He will also follow your urine and if you have recurrent bleeding in your urine, you will need a referral to see a urologist.
