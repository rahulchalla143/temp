Physical Exam: VS: 98.8 143/64 111 25 95% 4L 49kg GENERAL: thin female, sitting up in bed tremulous, in mild respiratory distress.

CHEST/BACK: Kyphosis; ?pes excavatum LUNGS: Moving air reasonably well with increased expiratory phase.
Decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
no ST-T wave changes, inferior Q waves (old)  CXR [**12-24**]: Portable upright AP chest radiograph is obtained.
There is a stable appearance of bibasilar linear opacities, which likely reflect atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
No definite pleural effusions are appreciated.
There is no pneumothorax.
Extensive ribcage deformity and thoracic kyphosis are again noted.
No evidence of pneumothorax.

Lateral aspect of the left lower chest is excluded from the examination.
Multiple healed rib fractures are seen on both sides of the chest.

No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o female with severe COPD and frequent flares who presents with dyspnea, admitted to MICU for respiratory distress.
In addition, she was given azithromycin and ceftriaxone to treat a suspected pulmonary infection, which might have triggered her COPD flare.
She then developed altered mental status and agitation requiring quetiapine and haloperidol, which was attributed to steroid psychosis and which improved with tapering of her steroid dose.
She was initially ruled out for an MI in the setting of her shortness of breath, with three negative sets of enzymes and a CXR which did not suggest heart failure.
She was tachycardic and hypertensive while in respiratory distress, but this improved with improvement in her breathing.
Her creatinine was slightly elevated on admission to 0.9, which improved with hydration.
She was continued on calcium and vitamin D for her osteoporosis and her pain was controlled with a fentanyl patch, lidocaine, nortryptilline and percocet.
The nortriptylline was discontinued in the setting of mental status changes.
