Night nurse went to check on her early this monring and witnessed a generalized tonic clonic seizure.
Per nursing home staff, she has had seizures in past in setting of urinary infections.
Per Heathwood staff, patient has had seizures before in setting of UTIs.
Later, had second seizure with foaming, teeth  clenching, generalized convulsions .
No length of seizure, but on order of minutes per ED staff.
She became hypertensive and tachycardic during seizure.
After Diltiazem and preintubation meds, patient became transiently hypotensive.
No bleeding noted on scan.
No complaints.
No fevers, chills, recent illness.
Atrial fibrillation with recent discontinuation of coumadin 3.
Hypertension 4.
Mild dementia  Social History: DNR/DNI.
Has been wheelchair bound and in nursing home since stroke in [**2123**].
No rebound or guarding.
No speech output.
Unable to appreciate fundi III, IV, VI: Assessment of oculocephlic limited by neck stiffness.
Internal rotation of left arm to noxious.
Sensation: Withdraws right arm and leg to noxious.
Internal rotation of left arm to noxious.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right 3 3 3 2 3 with sustained clonus at ankles Left 3 3 3 2 3 with sustained clonus at ankles  Left grasp.
No acute infarctions identified.
No intraaxial or extraaxial masses or hemorrhages.
Chronic right MCA territory infarct.
Mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion appear normal.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion  EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of a slow, low voltage background rhythm in the delta and mid theta frequency ranges.
Generalized delta frequency slowing was also seen.
These findings suggest deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and are consistent with an encephalopathy.
Note was made of an irregular neuro-complex tachycardia suggestive of rapid a-fib on the cardiac monitor.
No epileptiform or clearly lateralizing abnormalities were seen in this recording.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo F with h/o large right MCA infarct [**2123**] with residual hemiplegia, RAF, HTN, presenting with GTC x 2 (one  at NH, one witnessed in ED).
Exam notable for stiff neck with [**Month (only) **] ROM, decreased withdrawal on left side compared with right, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, clonus, upgoing toes.
Likely had GTC with old infarct as focus.
However, hypotension and lactate of 9.0 concerning for sepsis.
An EEG was performed while she was still in the ICU that showed the presence of aslow, low voltage background rhythm in the delta and mid theta frequency ranges.
Generalized delta frequency slowing was also seen.
These findings suggest deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and are consistent with an encephalopathy.
Note was made of an irregular neuro-complex tachycardia suggestive of rapid a-fib on the cardiac monitor.
No epileptiform or clearly lateralizing abnormalities were seen in this recording.
She did have evidence of pneumonia and was treated for htis.
She also had evidence of pulmonary edema and was successfully diuresed for this as well.
She also showed some evidence of pneumonia on her CXR and the vantin was continued for this as well.
She was afebrile during her admission.
She did have intermittent atrial fibrillation during her hospitalization and she was restarted on her coumadin once stroke or hemorrhage was ruled out.
She also showed some signs of CHF during the last 3 days of admission and was started on lasix, first IV bid, then switched to PO prior to discharge.
Derm: She developed a petechial rash on the L side of her face on HD 3.
Dermatology was consulted who felt that it was secondary to capillary rupture during intubation, and recommended simply following it.
Code: DNR, reconfirmed with family  Update [**2128-5-24**]: tx to floor; kub looked okay; hydral given for htn  [**5-26**] - CXR showed worsening CHF = is getting lisinopril, lasix if needed  Medications on Admission: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 36748**] rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: seizure   Discharge Condition: improved, with L sided hemiparesis which is at her baseline, mild respiratory distress  Discharge Instructions: please take all medications as prescribed she will need [**Hospital1 **] oral lasix until her respiratory status has improved, then can wean the lasix.
