Admission Date:  [**2145-6-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2145-7-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2104-11-11**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Acove  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of C3-C4 quadriplegia, chronic adrenal insufficiency and history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia presenting to the Emergency Room with mental status changes.
Of note, she had recently been admitted for hypoxia and similar symptoms.
At rehabilitation, the patient was found to be very lethargic with O2 saturations at 80% and she was sent to the Emergency Room where she received Narcan and immediately improved with her mental status.
She complained of pain all over and was given 4 mg of morphine and became unresponsive again and was once again improved with Narcan.
She was noted to have left basilar opacity and left pleural effusion on chest x-ray.

Chronic pain 7.
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia  ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN AND SULFA  Of note, the patient has been intubated multiple times over the past several months and required hospital admissions for this.
The first was fourth degree pressure ulcer over the sacral region which is approximately 2 inches deep and 4 inches wide with mostly granulation tissue covering the wound surface.
There is no appreciable fluctuance or a closed cavity.
The patient's left shoulder had a second degree pressure ulcer with an eschar over it.
Admission chest x-ray showed the presence of a left basilar opacity which was new as well as a small left pleural effusion.
Urinalysis showed large blood, positive nitrites, 6 to 10 red blood cells and greater than 50 white blood cells.
Admission head CT was negative for intracranial hemorrhage.
Admission abdominal KUB showed there was no evidence of intestinal obstruction or fecal impaction.
Pulmonary:  The patient presented with history of C3-C4 quadriplegia presenting with decreased oxygen saturations.
The decrease oxygen saturation is likely secondary to causes including oversedation due to her pain medications as causing decreased respiratory drive as well as left lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient has had a sputum culture during this hospital admission which grew out coagulase positive Staphylococcus.
Also of note on the patient's pain regimen, she was responsive without episodes of oversedation.
Endocrine:  The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency and was treated with high doses of hydrocortisone in the Emergency Room and her prednisone was continued throughout the hospital admission.
Infectious disease:  The patient has etiologies of infection including pneumonia given chest x-ray.
The repeat urinalysis was unremarkable and the cultures for the urinalysis showed no growth.
The patient also had wound swabs which were performed and the wound swabs were notable for 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes as well as 2+ gram negative rods.
The wound culture also grew out Pseudomonas which was sensitive to cefepime and intermediate to ceftazidine.
Wound ulcers:  The patient has a history of the sacral decubitus ulcer as well as the grade 2 ulcer on the right chest wall.
The plastic surgery team felt that there is no acute evidence of cellulitis and there is not a need for debridement or reconstruction at the time.
However, she may follow up as needed for future consideration for possible reconstructive measures in the plastic surgery clinic.
They recommended continuing current wet to dry dressing changes, as well as preventing pressure with frequent position changes.
