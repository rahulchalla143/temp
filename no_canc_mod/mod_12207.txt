He went to an area facility for further evaluation and was sent home but presented again to the same facility with increased nausea and vomiting.
He underwent repeat head CT facility which revealed new head bleed.
L pelvix fx./fx jaw.
CT HEAD  INDICATION: 45-year-old male with lethargy and trauma two days ago.
FINDINGS: There is hyperdense material within the sulci overlying the right convexity as well as the right temporal region.
There is subdural blood extending along the right convexity and along the anterior falx and anterior to the left frontal lobe.
In addition, there are large areas of parenchymal hemorrhage involving the right frontal, right temporal, and right parietal lobes.
There is no significant midline shift identified.
There are large areas of hypodensity within the right frontal lobe and a smaller area in the left frontal lobe which were present on the prior study and are most consistent with encephalomalacia, either from prior surgery or prior insult.
There is an overlying craniotomy defect noted.
In addition, there are two fracture planes extending through the craniotomy defect.
There is edema along the lateral aspect of the right lateral ventricle, somewhat compressing it.
Note is made of a small lacunar infarct in the lentiform nucleus on the left.
Incidental note is made of a small retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
Subarachnoid, subdural, and parenchymal hemorrhage as described above with edema causing mild mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle.
No significant midline shift is identified.
Skull fracture planes extending through the craniotomy site on the right.
Large areas of encephalomalacia involving the right frontal lobe as well as a smaller area involving the left frontal lobe, which may be either related to previous injury or post-surgical change.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: interval change  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 45 year old man with history of traumatic brain injury and R frontal craniotomy, admitted with after being dragged by a car, found to have R frontal and parietal ICH and SAH.
Now complaining of worsening headache.
CLINICAL HISTORY: History of traumatic brain injury and right frontal craniotomy.
Evaluate parietal intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: Previously described subdural/subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal, temporal, parietal is largely unchanged.
The small left frontal and parafalcine subdural is also unchaged.
There has been no change in the degree of mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and associated sulcal effacement.
No new areas of hemorrhage are identified.
The small lacunar infarct involving the lentiform nucleus is noted once again.
A small retention cyst is noted in the left maxillary sinus.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinus.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in the appearance of the subarachnoid, subdural, and parenchymal hemorrhages.
FINDINGS: The visualized spinal cord demonstrates no signal abnormalities.
No abnormalities are detected at the craniocervical junction on the sagittal images.
There are no areas of STIR signal abnormality.
No evidence of edema or abnormalities to suggest traumatic injury.
For further evaluation of this area, dedicated axial images through this region would be recommended.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 45 year old man with stable ICH and equivocal bedside eval.
The patient demonstrated markedly poor oral control with moderately reduced laryngeal elevation and mild swallow delay.
Psychiatry was consulted for this patient because he initially was refusing all services and because of his traumatic brain injury, the patient was initially unable to make decisions for himself.
Psychiatry saw the patient and felt that his mentation had improved and cleared him for decision making.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for pain: Take this medication for pain first before taking percocet.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Fall intracranial bleeding 2 new skull fx.
Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD or return to the Emergency Department if you have any chest pain, loss of consciousness, fevers/chills/rigors/temperature>101.5, loss of function of any of your extremities, or any other major problems that concern you.
Inform the office that you will need a repeat CT scan of your cervical spine for this appointment.
