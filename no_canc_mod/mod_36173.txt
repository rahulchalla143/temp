hypertensive encephalopathy or stroke given elevated BP on presentation) effectively r/o due to negative head CT and MRI.
Left with likely etiology involving hypoglycemic event given family's history of low blood sugar on night PTA, low blood sugar with poor response to D50 on presentation to ED.
Possible that pt experienced sz in response to low blood sugar (as were evidence of sz including bite marks on tongue on exam), although no evidence of sz activity was noted during hospital course w/ EEG demonstrating solely diffuse slowing c/w toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.
Also possible that some component of acute on chronic [**Month/Year (2) **] failure participated in patient's mental status changes and extended recovery, as she had an elevated potassium and Cr on presentation to ED which began to normalize with peritoneal dialysis in ICU.
Seizure: Pt with history of poorly defined seizure dz, thought to be primary vs secondary to hypoglycemia, although possible that a sz could have contributed to mental status changes that pt presented w/ (?

Troponin elevated to 0.28 on admission (elevated from 0.24 on recent hospitalization d/c that had been trending downward from peak of 0.46 on [**2204-5-31**]), and trended down to 0.26 during hospital stay.
Therefore likely a small troponin leak due to underlying condition that caused her MS changes.

Hyperkalemia - on presentation, K+ elevated to 6.3, normalized during hospital stay with PD per [**Month/Day (2) **] recs.
