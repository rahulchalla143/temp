HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old woman with known coronary artery disease status post Persantin MIBI on [**2190-2-5**] showing a moderate reversible inferior defect at which time she had refused cardiac catheterization.
Three days prior to admission, she developed four out of 10 substernal chest pain which continued through the night prior to admission actually preventing her from sleeping.
She was brought to the Emergency Department by ambulance where on arrival she had 2/10 chest pain with EKG showing biphasic T waves in III and aVF, 0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in II and III, 0.5 mm depressions in I and aVL.
Coronary artery disease as above.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 50%.
High cholesterol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the CCU, patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98.5 F, blood pressure 113/37, heart rate 76, respiratory rate 18, pulse oximetry 97% on two liters.
She was pain free.
Heart was regular, rate and rhythm without any audible extra heart sounds.
Her abdomen was benign with normal bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Her extremities revealed no edema with faint distal pulses.
Her skin findings were significant for psoriasis.
EKG on admission to the CCU revealed sinus rhythm at 73 beats per minute, normal axis, QTC of 453, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in II, III and aVF, Q waves were now present in II, III and aVF as well with T wave inversions in I and aVL.
Left heart cath revealed mild LV diastolic dysfunction with mild to moderate aortic stenosis.
Angiography revealed right dominant system with 50 to 60% left main coronary artery lesion.
LAD had an 80% distal lesion.
Left circumflex had an 80% stenosis at the origin and right coronary artery had a 95% osteo stenosis and 70% mid vessel stenosis with TIMI-II flow into the distal AV groove.
Plavix was not continued as the patient did not have any intervention.
It was recommended based on the cath results of left main disease with three vessel disease, that the patient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting.
Initially patient refused coronary artery bypass and a question was raised of the patient's competence to make medical decisions given her history of paranoid schizophrenia and occasional episodes of confusion.
An echocardiogram was done to evaluate her LV function which revealed a mildly enlarged left atrium, mild LVH with impaired relaxation.
Ejection fraction of 30% down from 50% in [**2190-1-12**], moderate to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior and lateral walls and apex.
The right ventricle seemed to be dilated with depression function.
Aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened, but not stenotic.
She had trace AI and 1 to 2+ MR.  She had moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension without pericardial effusion.
basis with Lasix for pulmonary edema with improvement of her creatinine from 1.8 down to 1.4 prior to discharge.
PSYCH:  Patient has a history of paranoid schizophrenia for which he had been on an outpatient regimen of Haldol 1 mg q. day.
After cardiac catheterization, she was very agitated and Psychiatry was consulted regarding further management of her schizophrenia.
In addition, they recommended withholding any further use of Ativan or Ambien which could have contributed to her delirium at the time.
In addition, Psychiatry was consulted to evaluate the patient in terms of competency to make decisions regarding her cardiac surgery which the consultants did feel that she was competent.
Given her significant coronary artery disease, she was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells prior to discharge.
Coronary artery disease, Left main and three vessel disease requiring coronary artery bypass graft.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30%.
