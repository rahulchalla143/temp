HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old female with multiple medical problems who was brought to the Emergency Room after complaining of fatigue and slumping over in the chair, although reportedly not losing consciousness per her family.
She was last dialyzed on Saturday, and upon reaching the Emergency Room, the patient was found to be in wide complex bradycardia without discernable P-waves, question of complete heart block with an increased potassium.
After treatment, she returned to narrow complex atrial rhythm at a rate of 50.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2132**] with LIMA to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
Most recent cardiac catheterization in [**2143-3-28**] showed elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with prominent V-wave and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracing, preserved cardiac output, left main coronary artery with a 95% hazy lesion extending into the proximal left circumflex.
It also showed secondary pulmonary hypertension, hemiballismus.
History of ventricular tachycardia for which Amiodarone was started.
Left ventricular thrombus.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25-30% which was recently decreased to 15%.
Question of apical akinesis as well.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis times two months.
History of cerebrovascular accident with questionable residual right upper extremity weakness in the presence of hemiballismus in the acute setting.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Diabetes mellitus, dependent on Insulin.
No peripheral edema.
Pulmonary:  Lungs coarse with diffuse rales.
Neurological:  No focal or neurological deficits.
Electrocardiogram showed non-sinus atrial rhythm.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with bilateral effusions.
Arrhythmia:  His bradycardia and hypertension was attributed to a combination of Amiodarone and beta-blocker used in the setting of end-stage renal disease with hyperkalemia.
Withholding of Amiodarone and beta-blocker together with treatment of hyperkalemia and dialysis allowed the patient to return to normal sinus rhythm.
This anatomy results in a falsely low blood pressure in the left arm, both by manual cuff and by arterial line.
Manual blood pressure taken on the right arm is consistently about 20 points systolic higher than a blood pressure taken on the left and correlates better with clinical status.
It is unclear how much of this blood pressure support was necessary given that the story behind the blood pressure discrepancy had not yet been discovered, and the patient was likely in early sepsis, as described below.
Fluid status:  The patient is essentially aneuric.
She became hypoxic on the morning after admission secondary to pulmonary edema failure.
She was continued on hemodialysis while in-house every other day with removal of 2.0-2.5 L of fluid by ultrafiltrate at each dialysis session.
Dialysis with removal of fluid allowed for complete resolution of these symptoms.
and developed a leukocytosis to 18.
A respiratory source was suspected, as blood cultures remained negative, urine cultures remained negative, and one respiratory culture showed rare growth of ..................  She will be continued on renally dosed Levaquin through [**2143-5-18**], to complete a 10-day course.
Anticoagulation:  The patient is maintained on Coumadin as an outpatient for her left ventricular thrombus.
She was advised to stay away from foods that were high in potassium, given the implication of hyperkalemia and the etiology of her symptoms causing this hospitalization.
Symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension secondary to Amiodarone and beta-blocker use in the setting of end-stage renal disease and hyperkalemia.
Sepsis of unknown etiology.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
