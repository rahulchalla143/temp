Admission Date:  [**2156-9-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-9-13**]   Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Oxacillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with 2 stents placed in RCA  History of Present Illness: 87 y/o with history of HTN, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia presents with sudden onset of CP at 2am .
No dyspnea, diaphoresis at OSH.
He was found to have inferior ST elevations and complete heart block w/BP 96/53, HR=43, RV4 w/ST elev.
In cath lab, he was found to have RCA totally occluded in mid section w/prox stenosis as well, and a tight OM1.
PVD (MRA BLE [**5-/2156**] showed 90% stenosis of superficial femoral artery on right, 70-80% stenosis of prox popiteal artery on left, severe stenosis of right ant tibial artery and occlusion of bilat peroneal arteries) 4.
COPD 5.
Blind in R eye [**3-15**] chol emboli 6.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.
GIB [**6-/2156**] with EGD showing 2 small duodenal ulcers, prior gastric ulcer 9.
Depression 10.
No MRG, No carotid bruits.
The LMCA was a short vessel with no angiographically apparent disease.
The LCx was diffusely diseased in the mid-vessel with a long lesion up to 80%.
A large OM1 branch had a 50-60% proximal stenosis.
The RCA was calcified with a total occlusion in the proximal vessel.
Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right- and  left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 16 mmHg, mean PCW 22 mmHg).
There was moderate pulmonary artery hypertension (mean PA 32 mmHg).
Elevated filling pressures.
Acute inferior MI, terminated by primary PCI.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior akinesis and inferolateral hypokinesis.
Right ventricular free wall is not fully visualized but systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2152-12-29**], regional wall motion abnormality is new and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
Patchy right lower lobe opacity, likely represent atelectasis.
The previously described hazy opacity overlying the right hemithorax is less apparent on the current study.
Small left pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted from the cath lab after stenting of his RCA to treat his ST elevation inferior MI and complete heart block.
He recovered well from his MI and heart block and was discharged to acute rehab due to deconditioning and recent issues with falling/loss of balance.
No additional chest pain during the admission.
Pump issues: He had an echo which showed an EF=45-50%, with some akinetic areas.
3.EP/cardiac rhythm: He initially had a prolonged PR interval and RBBB.
Also has h/o A fib.
He will need close follow-up of this NSVT to determine effectiveness of amiodarone.
He was discharged to rehab for acute conditioning.
He has also been having increased number of falls and reports feeling unsteady when walking.
Does not sound like an acute event (stroke), but rather a chronically progressive issue for him.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1.Inferior ST elevation Myocardial Infarction 2.Atrial fibrillation 3.COPD 4.Chronic Renal Insuffciency 5.GI BLEED   Discharge Condition: Pt was stable without any chest pain.He did have some SOB with activity and some unsteadiness when attempting to walk.Eating well and no issues with cognition.
Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience new chest pain or shortness of breath.
