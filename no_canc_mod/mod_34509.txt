No change in left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, small focus of hemorrhage within the septum pellucidum and small acute subdural hematoma along the left temporal lobe.
Chronic bifrontal subdural collections with interval slight increase in density compared to the study today at 9:17 a.m. consistent with rebleed or possible communication with the left temporal subdural .
Mildly displaced fractures of the right medial and lateral pterygoid plates, not completely included in the field of view.
9-mm focus of hemorrhage within the septum pellucidum is unchanged.
Susceptibility artifact and blooming on the gradient echo images is evidence that this does not represent a colloid cyst as on the non-contrast CT done earlier, there is no evidence of calcification in this to explain the susceptibility effect.
No short interval change in the left temporal parenchymal contusion.
