Admission Date:  [**2112-7-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-7-16**]   Service:  MEDICINE [**Hospital1 **] FIRM  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension who was living at home by herself and had been lethargic, fatigued and dehydrated the past week because of a heat wave, fell down two days prior to admission and had been down for approximately 36 hours when she was then found by her son.
She was taken to [**Hospital3 42966**] where her sodium was 115, potassium 2.5 and a head CT revealed an subacute subdural hematoma.
Upon arrival, she had dried blood on her scalp and appeared slightly confused at times, but was occasionally oriented x3.
Hypertension x10 years 2.
Levobunolol eyedrops GGTS  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
She had no appreciable jugular venous distention.
CARDIAC:  She had an irregular heart rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur that radiated to the carotids.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nonfocal.
The patient's electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with decreased ST segments in V5 and V6.
Chest x-ray also by report from [**Hospital3 3765**] showed an obscured right heart border and a cervical spine by report from [**Hospital3 42966**] showed no fracture or dislocation.
During her Medical Intensive Care Unit course, the patient's repeat head CT showed subdural hematoma which was unchanged to slightly smaller.
The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes, despite the electrocardiogram changes persisting.
The patient was felt to have hypovolemic hyponatremia and was started on normal saline infusion with improvement of her sodium from 115 to 120, as well as improvement of her mental status.
She had an episode of chest pain during her second Medical Intensive Care Unit day, but the electrocardiogram was unchanged.
The patient was given intravenous Zantac as well as Protonix for likely epigastric pain presenting as chest discomfort with no relief of her chest pain.
At this point, it was felt that the patient was too drowsy in order to adequately monitor her neurologic status and there was some question of whether or not there was a depression in her neurologic status despite the morphine.
She was then sent again for a repeat CT scan which showed no change in her subdural hematoma and the patient denied any further chest discomfort from then on.
The patient was taken off of aspiration precautions after a speech and swallow consultation.
The patient was treated for her hyponatremia with fluid restriction, thought likely to be SIADH given her subdural hematoma.
The patient was found to have some congestive heart failure and was occasionally given Lasix diuresis as needed.
The patient had an echocardiogram which was completed on [**2112-7-11**] which shows severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild dilated left atrium, hyperdynamic left ventricle with an ejection fraction of greater than 75%, aortic valve leaflets severely thickened and deformed, moderate aortic stenosis, mild mitral stenosis, 1+ to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation according to telemetry and repeat electrocardiogram with slight decrease in the level of ST depression from the baseline electrocardiogram.
Cardiology was consulted in order to determine how best to manage her atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, but also given her contraindication to anticoagulation given her intracranial bleed.
At that point, cardiology's recommendations were to continue to rate control her with Diltiazem 180 mg q day and not cardiovert her secondary to the contraindications, as well as not give her aspirin secondary to her bleed.
The patient was treated for a urinary tract infection during the course of her stay with Levaquin 250 mg every day with a total course of seven days.
The repeat urine cultures showed no growth which indicated that there was adequate coverage with the antibiotic chosen.
GENERAL:  The patient was alert and oriented in no acute distress.
NECK:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
LUNGS:  Minimal bibasilar crackles at the base, otherwise are clear to auscultation.
She continues to have an irregularly irregular heart rate with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur that radiates to the carotids.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema and distal pulses are palpable 2+.
She will then choose a cardiologist to follow up with on a regular basis, as well as having a repeat head CT in four weeks and a follow up appointment with neurosurgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
