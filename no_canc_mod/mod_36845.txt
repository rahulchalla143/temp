Pt was complaining of left sided chest pain but was drowsy on arrival.
At midnight, pt was noted to be having possible seizure activity with left eye deviation and foaming at his mouth.
He was intubated with etomidate and rocuronium due to concern for inability to protect his airway.
Pt remained mildly hypotensive and hct came back at 24 (down from baseline of 30).
OG tube was placed and there was no evidence of hematemesis.
He received Aspirin 325mg, Zofran, Protonix, Vanc & Zosyn for possible sepsis and was transferred to the ICU.

He has a history of alcohol abuse, with DTs and detoxification, with last drink on [**Holiday 1451**].
Skin: Numerous macular lesions diffuse over the trunk and limbs.
Abd: Soft, mildly distended.
No rebound or guarding.
Pertinent Results: CT head [**2156-2-26**]: FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct.
The 3.4 x 1.1-cm hyperdense mass overlying the right occipital bone is unchanged compared to [**2152-4-29**].
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
There is a moderate right effusion with associated right lower lobe volume loss.
There continues to be pulmonary vascular redistribution with perihilar haze, however, this is improved in appearance compared to the film from three days ago.
No intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.
No significant gallbladder disease with redemonstration of a tiny gallbladder polyp and likely adenomyomatosis.
Increased hepatic echogenicity suggest diffuse fatty infiltration although more advanced forms of liver disease such as fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded.

# Hypotension: Suspected etiology most likely hypovolemia exacerbated by GI bleed, with further drop peri-intubation.
Given lack of tachycardia, fever or leukocytosis, sepsis was considered unlikely.
Pt remained in baseline Wenkebach with rate in 70s-80s, without any additional symptoms or episodes on telemetry, specifically no intermittent complete heart block.
BP improved with volume resuscitation.
# MS changes/Seizure?
CT head negative for acute IC pathology.
OG did not reveal any coffee grounds but frank red stool in vault.
Hematocrit stabilized after 2 units of PRBCs, although with persistent maroon stools.
On discharge pt was still having guaiac positive stools but Hct remained stable at 28.4.
# Resp Failure: Pt was mildly hypoxic on arrival and CXR showed vascular congestion.
Ultimately, pt was intubated after possible seizure activity and decreased responsiveness with successful extubation on [**2156-2-26**].
He presented with CP and new TWIs in V2-V6.
Pt may be in decompensated heart failure but unclear given unusual presentation.
# ESRD on HD: Pt was maintained on his usual HD regimen and tolerated all dialysis sessions well.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] [**Hospital 2256**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Syncope, GI bleed  Secondary: h/o GI bleeds, ESRD on [**Hospital 13241**].
The gastroenterology team evaluated you and decided there was no need to re-scope your colon, but recommended that you get a small bowel capsule study as an outpt.
