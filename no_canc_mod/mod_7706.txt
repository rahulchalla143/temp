FINDINGS: No evidence of aneurysm, significant stenosis or AV malformation.
Of note, mild plaque near the origin of the right internal carotid artery, but no high grade stenosis.
Conventional 4 vessel cerebral angiogram [**2132-5-27**]- Right common carotid artery, Right internal carotid artery, Right vertebral artery, Left common carotid artery, Left internal carotid artery, Left vertebral artery.
FINDINGS: Evaluation of the above vessels demonstrates no evidence of aneurysm, significant stenosis, or arteriovenous malformation.
There is a tiny infundibulum of the left anterior choroidal artery.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of aneurysm or AV malformation to explain the patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W& W/O CONTRAST  [**2132-6-3**] There is no evidence of abnormal flow voids identified on pre- contrast images.
Following contrast administration, no abnormal vascular enhancement seen within the spinal canal in the cervical region.
Multilevel mild degenerative changes are seen extending from C3-4 to C6-7.
There is no extrinsic spinal cord compression seen or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes.
No evidence of abnormal vascular enhancement to indicate arteriovenous malformation.
THORACIC SPINE: FINDINGS: No evidence of abnormal flow voids seen in the thoracic region.
No abnormal enhancement or vascular enhancement seen on the post-gadolinium images.
Mild multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the disc.
No evidence of acute compression fracture or marrow edema seen.
No evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities or extrinsic spinal cord compression.
IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes.
No evidence of abnormal flow voids or vascular enhancement to indicate arteriovenous malformation in the thoracic region.
LUMBAR SPINE: FINDINGS: From L1-2 to L4-5 mild degenerative changes seen.
At L5-S1 level, disc degenerative change and a broad-based right-sided protrusion seen in contact with right S1 nerve root without displacement of the nerve root.
There is no evidence of abnormal flow voids seen within the thecal sac in the lumbar region.
IMPRESSION: Mild multilevel degenerative changes.
Small right-sided protrusion at L5-S1 level.
No evidence of abnormal flow voids within the thecal sac or along the distal spinal cord to indicate arteriovenous malformation.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motionis normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
CT HEAD: There has been resolution of previously noted high-density material within the prepontine cistern extending into the interpeduncular fossa.
No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified and there is no shift of normally midline structures or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
HEAD CTA: The Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and its major branches are patent with no evidence of stenoses.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormality.
Resolution of previously noted subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Patent Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] without evidence of aneurysm or vasospasm.
He had a cerebral angiogram that did not show any evidence of an anuersym or malformation.
On HD#5 he developed fevers to 101-101.5 Cultures from [**5-25**] revealed no growth.
On [**5-27**] he underwent a second cerebral angiogram which showed no aneurysm.
The patient had low sodium levels while in the hospital and he was started on a fluid restriction and was given salt tablets.
Blood cultures from [**5-28**] grew coag + staph aureus.
On [**5-29**] he was found to have a DVT in the right cephalic vein as well as an infection in the left at the site of the a-line, after it was removed.
The swab from the a-line site grew out coag + staph aureus as well (MSSA).
He had a transcranial doppler which showed slightly increased velocity, inconclusive vasospasm (doppler measure: bilat MCA ave. 100, no ICA measurement).
His fevers came down and he had no evidence of vasospasm, so he was tranferred to the step-down unit on [**5-31**].
On [**6-3**] he had an MRI of the spine which showed no evidence of a vascular abnormality.
His CTA on [**6-4**] showed resolution of SAH, patent circle of [**Location (un) **], no vasospasm.
Echocardiogram revealed preserved LVEF, no valvular vegetations, and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
