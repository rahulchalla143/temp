Admission Date:  [**2119-6-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-7-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin / Verapamil / Univasc  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1572**] Chief Complaint: Lower extremity swelling   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right internal jugular line placement with replacment over a guidewire PICC line placement  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with asthma, atrial fibrillation on Dabigatran and s/p dual-chamber (RA-RV) PPM in [**5-31**], hypertension, and heart failure with preserved EF (EF 55% on [**2119-6-28**] TTE but normal E wave, low deceleration time 133 msec) and moderate pulmonary hypertension by TTE (TR Gradient + RA = PASP: 44 mm Hg) who presented to the ED with lower extremity edema.
She reported considerable problems with lower extremity edema over the weeks preceding admission with an approximately 12-lb weight gain and [**2-23**] pillow orthopnea.
She further reported dyspnea on exertion but not at rest.
She had been doing reasonably well despite persistent lower extremity edema until the day prior to admision when she tripped and was unable to get herself off the floor for a few hours due to weakness.
She denies having any shortness of breath, chest pain, dyspnea on exertion or palpitations in association with this.
Her grandson eventually was able to help her to her feet and she seemed well without confusion so no additional assistance was pursued at that time.
She did report three days of persistent cough, intermittently productive of whitish sputum but denied any fevers.
The morning after her fall (the morning of admission), her family decided to bring her in for further evaluation given her persistent cough and leg swelling.

[**2119-6-26**]: Ventricular paced rhythm with a seven-beat run of an irregular intrinsic wide complex rhythm of uncertain mechanism but may be atrial fibrillation.
[**2119-7-11**]: Atrial paced rhythm.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific but cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
Tib/Fib XRay ([**2119-6-26**]):  No acute fracture or dislocation in either tibia or fibula.
Right Shoulder XRay ([**2119-6-26**]): No acute fracture or dislocation.
Findings suggestive of underlying rotator cuff disease.
[**2119-6-26**]: Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Opacities within the lung bases may represent atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
[**2119-6-27**]: Bilateral pleural effusions blunt the pleural sinuses and obliterate the diaphragmatic contours.
They also conceal major portions of the cardiac silhouette which undoubtedly represents marked cardiac enlargement.
The pulmonary vasculature is congested with perivascular haze and hazy peripheral densities in the mid lung field which have now increased in comparison with the last study and suggest development of pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax has developed.
There is no evidence of central airway occlusion and occlusion atelectasis related to mucus airway plugging.
Comparison is made with multiple chest examinations obtained during the last week and they disclose findings consistent with CHF, continues progression of pulmonary congestion.
[**2119-7-5**]: There is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pulmonary vascular engorgement.
Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate-to-large on the right and moderate on the left are stable, obscuring cardiac silhouette, which is probably enlarged but not changed in the interim.
No pneumothorax.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
TTE ([**2119-7-11**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-6-28**], severity of tricuspid regurgitation and degree of pulmonary hypertension have both decreased.
Discharge Labs: Creatinine 1.9 Potassium 4.7 Sodium 140  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with CAD, atrial fibrillation c/b tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM placement, CKD, asthma and heart failure with preserved EF, who presented with cough, lower extremity edema and hypotension.
Patient was initially treated with Norepinephrine for hypotension and diuresed on a Lasix drip, with a loss of approximately 12 pounds.
Chest radiography revealed a possible infiltrate and the patient received 8 days of antibiotics for a health-care associated pneumonia (Vancomycin plus Zosyn, which was switched to Cefepime, and, finally, Levofloxacin to complete the course).
No definitive cause of her initial hypotension was identified, though interrogation of pacemaker early in her hospitalization revealed several prolonged episodes of atrial tachycardia (one lasting approximately 50 hours).
Such episodes may have lead to a loss of atrial kick with subsequent drop in cardiac output.
TSH was elevated but did not indicate significant hypothyroidism (see discussion below).
The patient was subsequently transfered to the inpatient cardiology service to continue care for her hypotension and acute on chronic kidney disease.
Patient developed a persistent metabolic alkalosis and her serum creatinine remained elevated at approximately 2, up from a baseline of 1.5, which was concerning for overdiuresis.
Urine lytes were not helpful in assessing for intravascular volume depletion (FEUrea ~ 43%, UNa 33).
A TTE did not reveal evidence of worsening cardiac function or valvular disease but did reveal a near-normalization of pulmonary artery pressures as well as loss of a TR gradient, which fit with a clinical picture of overdiuresis.
Atrial Fibrillation c/b Tachy-Brady Syndrome: Patient had dual-chamber (RA/RV) [**Company 1543**] pacemaker placed on [**2119-5-26**] for Tachy-Brady Syndrome.
Pacemaker interrogation on admission revealed frequent and prolonged episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Metoprolol required dose reduction due to hypotension and at discharge was prescribed as metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL) 25 mg PO daily.
Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline creatinine in recent months was ~ 1.5.
Left Lower Extremity Erythema: Patient was treated for cellulitis during a recent admission in [**5-1**].
At that time a LLE US was without evidence of DVT to explain the asymmetry between the LLE and RLE.
Her erythema gradually improved throughout the hospitalization and at the time of discharge looked like the chronic changes of stasis dermatitis.
Leukocytosis: Patient presented with WBC count of 13.4 with neutrophil predominance though no bands or atypicals.
Cough and CXR suggestive of consoliation concerning for HCAP, for which she received 8 days of appropriate antibiotics.
Patient remained afebrile following transfer to the cardiology service.
Ultimately, it was likely due to possible infection or stress response.
Metabolic Alkalosis: Patient developed elevated serum bicarbonate (peak of 45) in setting of diuresis.
This was likely due to volume contraction/overdiuresis.
Abnormal Thyroid Function Tests: Baseline TSH 1.5 prior to initiation of Amiodarone.
Elevated TSH may reflect a consequence of significant iodine load from Amiodarone though it is difficult to interpret in the setting of an acute illness.
T4 is within normal limits and T3 is reduced which is more consistent with a sick euthyroid state in the setting of an ICU stay.
Asthma: Patient initially managed with Levalbuterol however was transitioned to salmeterol given concern for worsening tachycardia and compromising hemodynamics.
Right Shoulder Pain: In ED patient complained of right shoulder pain in the setting of a recent fall.
Shoulder xray revealed no fracture but did indicate chronic rotator cuff disease.
Close monitoring of symptoms of diastolic heart failure.
