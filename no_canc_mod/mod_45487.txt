RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  [**Known lastname **] was intubated for increased respiratory distress.
He received two doses of surfactant for management of respiratory distress syndrome and extubated to continuous positive airway pressure on day of life two.
He continued on continuous positive airway pressure until day of life 24 and has remained on room air throughout his hospital course until [**5-15**] when he had the onset of increased oxygen requirement and occasional desaturations surrounding a difficult feeding.
Chest X-rays on  [**5-15**] and [**5-18**] revealed only basilar ut A chest x-ray a subsequentn [**5-21**] revealed a right upper lobe pneumonia likely due to aspiration.

The infant had been attempting oral feeds until [**5-22**] when he was noted to have increased desaturations with feedings; likely aspirating during his oral enteral feedings.
GASTROENTEROLOGY ISSUES:  The patient was treated with phototherapy for mild hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity.
Hematology has been consulted and requested to visualize the blood smear to see if there was any concerning findings, especially in light of the possibility of myelodysplasia associated with trisomy 21.
A repeat complete blood count two days later was not concerning for infection but had a persistent white blood cell count of 4.2.
