HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female nursing home resident with a history of vascular dementia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on warfarin anticoagulation), congestive heart failure, and hypertension who was found to be more confused than her baseline.
On transfer to the [**Hospital1 69**], her hematocrit was found to have decreased from 46% to 34%.
Congestive heart failure; an echocardiogram in [**2175-12-29**] showed an ejection fraction of 60% to 70% with 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on anticoagulation); of note, her INR was 8 on presentation here.
Chronic pain.
Multivitamin/zinc/vitamin C supplements.
Serial creatine kinases and troponin levels did not reveal a myocardial infarction.
Urinalysis revealed the presence of a urinary tract infection.
A chest x-ray showed questionable right lower lobe opacity.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed some erosions in the antrum with otherwise normal findings to the second part of the duodenum.
The colonoscopy revealed multiple nonbleeding diverticula with small openings in the sigmoid colon.
There were large deep oozing ulcers in the rectum and the distal sigmoid colon as well.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable, and she was transferred to the Medicine Service to continue treatment of what was ultimately identified as a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Of note, she required increasing doses of Fentanyl patch transdermally for pain control.
