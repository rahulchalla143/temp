The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is a bidirectional shunt across the interatrial septum at rest (minimal color left to right, saline contrast right to left).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-4-15**], the degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has probably increased.
A small ASD with mild bidirectional shunting is now appreciated.
Progression of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and significant worsening of diffuse bilateral airspace disease consisting of ground-glass opacities and patchy and confluent consolidations on a background of diffuse interlobular septal thickening.
Findings are nonspecific and can be seen with pulmonary edema, hemorrhage and/or infectious process.
Increased size of bilateral pleural effusions and abdominal ascites.
Stable cardiomegaly and coronary artery disease.
Redemonstration of bilateral lower lobe interstitial opacities and bronchiectasis suggestive of chronic underlying interstitial pneumonia versus scarring.
Enlarged pulmonary trunk, likely related to pulmonary arterial hypertension.
[**2191-8-7**] cytology bronchial washings NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2191-8-7**] US No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right upper extremity.
[**2191-8-12**] CT Head No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute infarction.
[**2191-8-15**] EEG This is an abnormal waking EEG because of slow background mostly  in the theta but some intermixed delta activity.
There are frequent bursts of frontally predominant but generalized polymorphic delta activity.
These findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy with possible accentuation of midline structures and may be representing a metabolic dysfunction related to the respiratory condition.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma, with bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities, right slightly more than left.
Unchanged appearance of the moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette.

On morning of hospital day 2 patient was noted to become hypoxic during turning to 70s and required intubation.
# Respiratory Failure Patient intubated on morning of hospital day 2 due to hypoxia.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy with specimens sent for micro and cytology.
While no microbiologic cause of respiratory failure was identified the patient was maintained on an empiric 7 day course of broad spectrum antibiotics.
Following extubation patient did not complain of dyspnea and was noted to be saturating well on supplemental O2 by nasal canula.
# ARDS Patient with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and low PaO2/FiO2 consistant with ARDS.
# [**Last Name (un) **] Experienced oliguria and progressive Cr increase after a hypotensive episode with intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation.
Patient subsequently became polyuric and her Cr began to trend down, consistant with a diagnosis of ATN.
# Electrolytes Patient intermittently required free water repletion for hypernatremia and various electrolyte repletions during her critical illness.
# Encephalopathy Following improvement of patient's ventilatory status major barrier to extubation became altered mental status.
Patient would wax and wane throughout the day and had minimal purposeful movement.
Patient's mental status was noted to progressively improve and she became capable of interacting and asking complex questions.
URI symptoms with labs showing leukocytosis.
Initial presentation concerning for sepsis vs pulmonary edema.
# QTc prolongation Followed with daily ECG in setting of QT prolonging medications.
Was treated with Levofloxacin in spite of prolonged QTc as atypical causes of pneumonia could not be ruled out and patient's respiratory status represented a major life threat.
Transitional Issues: -check electrolytes on [**2191-8-19**] to assess for hypernatremia -adjust amount of free water intake based on sodium levels -please check speech and swallow eval so that patient can take POs.
