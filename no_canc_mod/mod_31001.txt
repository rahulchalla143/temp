Admission Date:  [**2126-9-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-9-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-11-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Codeine / Dalmane  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: fevers, rigors  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: pacemaker extraction pacemaker extraction via re-do sternotomy   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 71yo man who has a pacemaker and bioprosthetic mitral and aortic valve replacements who presented with rigors and a fever to 103.2 with mental status changes on [**2126-9-5**].
He was found to have pacemaker endocarditis and 6/6 bottles of blood cultures were positive for staph aureus.
PFTs mild obstruction.
Patient given rifampin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, gentamicin and 1L of NS for hypotension, which improved his blood pressures.
He did have his pacer interrogated which revealed underlying SB 50's.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue heart valve, and mitral valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 70723**].
-Hep C, chronic, no cirrhosis -History of cocaine use; history of IVDU -Lung cancer, s/p resection of L upper lobe -Multiple cysts removed -Spine surgery, metal rods in place -Asthma -stroke   Social History: The patient lives by himself in an apartment as part of a group home.
Works at Salvation Army as drug counselor now   Family History: Mother-deceased of MI at age 65.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
LUNGS: CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
ABDOMEN: Soft, no distension.
mild tenderness to palpation.
No HSM or tenderness.
No cyanosis, edema.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, or xanthomas.
systolic murmur III/VI heard best at apex.
No ecchymosis.
Right sided pacer pocket with staples in place, non-erythematous, dry, no discharge.
LUNGS:  CTAB ABDOMEN: normoactive bowel sound, NTND EXTREMITIES: no peripheral edema, 2+ peripheral pulses.
Status post left upper lobectomy.
Extensive venous collaterals in the anterior mediastinum with some of them located right underneath the sternotomy.
Small bilateral pleural effusion.
Extensive mitral annulus calcification.
Several pulmonary nodules.
Followup of this patient given the presence of the nodules, several mediastinal lymph nodes and prior lobectomy should be obtained in three months with conventional chest CT.
Right middle lobe subpleural opacity most likely represents atelectasis, but pleural plaque would be another possibility and can be also reassessed on the subsequent study.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is a large vegetation 1.3 cm x 1.3 cm on the posterior annulus of the mitral bioprosthetis.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral stenosis.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
IVC is dilated (2.9cm) with preserved respiratory variation although small.
There is systolic flow reversal at the hepativ veins.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2126-9-15**] CT Head No Contrast No acute intracranial process.
If clinical concern for stroke is high, MRI is more sensitive.
[**2126-9-18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is echodense thickening of the posterior annulus of the mitral bioprosthesis measuring 1.3 cm x 1.1 cm.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is focal echodense thickening of the posterior annulus of the mitral bioprosthesis with gradients higher than expected for this type of prosthesis.
Given the history of mitral bioprosthesis endocarditis on recent TEE dated [**2126-9-11**], a healed vegetation cannot be excluded.
CXR [**2126-9-15**] FINDINGS: The patient is status post median sternotomy, aortic valve replacement, as well as left upper lobe resection.
Interval resolution of congestive heart failure and associated decrease in size of right pleural effusion with residual small pleural effusion remaining.
Left pleural effusion is small and similar to the prior study.
IMPRESSION: Resolution of congestive heart failure and improved right pleural effusion.
CT Thorax [**2126-9-19**] Air and fluid collection with enhancing walls as discussed in the suprasternal notch.
This finding is suspicious for early abscess formation.
No evidence to suggest osteomyelitis.
Right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Extensive vascular calcification within the common and external iliac arteries.
In combination with the extensive streak artifacts from the vertebral column hardware, evaluation of lumen is difficult.
If there is clinical concern for significant stenosis MRI can help better evaluate the vasculature.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2126-9-25**] 05:40AM BLOOD WBC-9.8 RBC-3.26* Hgb-9.4* Hct-27.9* MCV-86 MCH-28.9 MCHC-33.8 RDW-14.8 Plt Ct-325 [**2126-9-25**] 05:40AM BLOOD Glucose-123* UreaN-15 Creat-2.0* Na-136 K-3.6 Cl-98 HCO3-26 AnGap-16 [**2126-9-25**] 05:40AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-4.1 Mg-2.1  Brief Hospital Course: 71M PMH CAD-CABG and bioprosthetic MVR/AVR, DM, HTN, HLD, lung cancer s/p resection, Hepatitis C, and dual-chamber PPM implanted in [**2118**] for symptomatic sinus bradycardia, followed by pocket revisions in [**2119**] for infection and [**2120**] due to painful location, who presented to [**Hospital6 1597**] with mental status changes on [**2126-9-5**], and was found to have fever to 103 with 6/6 bottles with Staph Aureus, and an 8mmx8mm vegetation on the RV lead seen on TEE, now transferred for further care and lead extraction, s/p lead extraction, with atrial lead initially retained.
ACTIVE ISSUES # MSSA Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient initially presented with sepsis to the OSH, but was hemodynamically stable throughout his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].
The source of the infection was not clear.
His wounds from the sternotomy and the pacemaker extraction remained clean, dry and intact with no erythema throughout his hospitalization.
He did have nightly fevers in the 2 weeks subsequent to his surgery despite blood cultures remaining negative and treatment with the antibiotics.
It was thought that his fevers may have been drug fever but resolved spontaneously.
Out of concern for his nightly fevers, the patient was pan-scanned and a small sub-sternal fluid collection was visualized.
He also developed a transient leukocytosis which resolved and he was consistently tachycardic in the 90-110 range during his hospitalization.
The patient did have some wound-associated discomfort but refused opioid medication due to his history of heroin abuse.
# Diarrhea: the patient developed diarrhea after initiation of antibiotics.
He was treated empirically for c. diff with Flagyl.
This was transition to PO Vanc given that pt had ongoing fevers without clear source.
Pt continued to have occasional diarrhea.
We opted not to treat with anti-motility agents given that no clear cause of diarrhea was identified.
# Acute Kidney Injury: the patient's creatinine was 0.8 at baseline and trended up as he was initiated on gentamicin.
# Chest Pain associated with surgery: the patient had some minor pain associated with his surgical wounds.
The picture was not consistent with hemolysis.
# Hepatitis C: chronic, no cirrhosis.
# Pt found to have normocytic anemia that should be worked up further as an outpatient.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: primary diagnosis: endocarditis of the pacemaker, coronary artery disease, bradycardia, diabetes, hypertension secondary diagnoses: hepatitis C, hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) **], You were admitted to the hospital because you had an infection in the wires of your pacemaker.
One of the antibiotics caused kidney dysfunction but this was stable at the time of discharge and we expect it to get better quickly.
