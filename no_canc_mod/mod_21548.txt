By 7:15 am she had taken an aspirin and experienced no relief.
The patient felt weak and perhaps a little dizzy.
She then took a second aspirin, but started to experience pain that radiated to her left shoulder blade.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for just a single episode of chest pain six months ago.
Patient denies dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, and syncope.
The patient does have edema of bilaterla lower extremities, but has history of vascular surgery for her veins.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: No other chronic problems mentioned by patient Surgeries: cataracts, vascular surgery on right leg for veins, tonsillectomy, appendectomy, basal cell cancer removal, tumors in vertebrae removed in [**2093**]-[**2094**]  Social History: -Tobacco history: None -ETOH: None Lives alone at home.
CARDIAC: S1, S2, no murmurs auscultated.
LUNGS: CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
Systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
Elevated left-sided filling pressures.
Echo [**2126-11-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.

Her echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function (LVEF > 55%).
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Patient denied symptoms of right-sided heart failure.
On the morning of [**2126-11-4**], the patient awoke to a coughing fit and some dyspnea.
Her dyspnea improved, but given the lack of other symptoms of heart failure, her cough may have been the result of a chronic post-nasal drip, as the patient reports cough for many months.
# COUGH, LIKELY SECONDARY TO POST-NASAL DRIP: During the patient's hospitalization, she demonstrated a regular cough.

Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack, and an artery in your heart had a blockage.
Do not stop taking Plavix or miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11302**] tells you it is OK. You may have another heart attack if you do not take aspirin and Plavix daily.
