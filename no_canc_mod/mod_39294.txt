Admission Date:  [**2147-12-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-1-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-1-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: Back pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: T12-L2 anterior fusion with instrumentation   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 91386**] was in his usual state of health until until [**12-10**] when he fell from the second rung of a ladder at his home.
He had immediate and severe pain in his lower back at that time.
He was discharged to rehab on [**12-16**] with weakness in his lower extremities R>L per discharge summary, as well as some weakness in his bilateral upper extremities.
On [**12-18**] he was being repositioned at rehab and heard a snapping sound in his back followed by intense pain in his back and across his abdomen.
He did not have any loss of sensory or motor function.
He was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-22**] because of persistent pain.
He had an MRI at that time which revealed recurrent instability, so he was taken back to the OR for T12-L2 reconstruction of ankylosing spnodylitis type fracture with a lateral trans-diaphragmatic approach.
On [**12-28**] he was being positioned for a CXR and he heard a snap and noticed that the pain he had been having in his back since the operation disappeared.
Past Medical History: PMH: - Obesity, 300 lbs, 66 inches tall - Chronic pain in neck, per patient [**2-22**] to arthritis - Burst fracture of L1, s/p transpedicular decompression of L1, laminectomies of T11 and 12, and L2 and L3, fusion of T10-L3, instrumentation T10-L3, and autograft on [**12-11**] - Renal cancer, s/p unilateral nephrectomy, - IDDM, poorly controlled per patient - HTN, poorly controlled per patient - R knee replacement in [**5-21**] DJD - S/p thyroid surgery for goiter 10 years ago   Social History: Married with 2 kids, lives in [**Location 7658**] with his wife.
Family History: Dad - CAD [**Name (NI) 21206**] - CAD, CVA from DVT that left her comatose for several years  Physical Exam: On Admission to [**Hospital1 18**]: A&O X 3; uncomfortable appearing in a stretcher RRR CTA B Abd soft NT/ND; obese BUE- good strength at deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist flexion/extension, finger flexion/extension and intrinics; sensation intact C5-T1 dermatomes; - [**Doctor Last Name 937**], reflexes symmetric at biceps, triceps and brachioradialis BLE- good strength at hip flexion/extension, knee flexion/extension; ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, [**Last Name (un) 938**]/FHL slugish but present; sensation intact L1-S1 dermatomes; - clonus, reflexes symmetric at quads and Achilles  Prior to discharge: 98.1 100/52 62 18 93% on 2L General: Calm, obese man lying in bed, stated age, NAD, with a foley catheter in place.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, limitation of rotation, flexion, and extension of neck, left more limited than right.
Pulmonary: CTAB Cardiac: Heart sounds distant, RRR, S1/S2 poorly differentiated with unspecified murmur heard throughout precordium.
Extremities: wwp, no clubbing or cyanosis.
Trace pitting edema in bilateral feet, non-pitting edema in bilateral arms and hands Skin: No rashes appreciated.
Hearing is mildly reduced on the right compared to the left.
New horizontal fracture through T10 vertebral body.
The possibility of instability at that level cannot be ruled out.
Hyperintense signal in the thoracic spinal cord at T9-T10 level which is likely due to cord infarct or progression of cord edema.
Post-operative changes in the form of posterior fusion hardware from T10-L3 level with interbody cage at L1 level.
Particularly, somewhat distorted appearance of the spinal canal and spinal cord at T9-10 level appears to be secondary to artifacts, but given the appearance on axial T2 images, an actual narrowing in the region cannot be completely excluded.
CT T/L spine [**12-27**]: Per radiology report, very limited study due to streak artifact from the orthopedic hardware.
There are postsurgical changes status post T10 to L3 fusion, resection of posterior elements and spacer.
There is no evidence of new fracture or retropulsion.
The evaluation of the spinal canal from T8 to T10 is very limited, otherwise there no gross evidence of cord compression at other levels.
Postsurgical changes in the posterior soft tissues.
There are bilateral lung infiltrates and a right pleural effusion.
MRI is recommended to evaluate for cord infarct and to try to better visualize the T8 to T10 levels.
Particularly, somewhat distorted appearance of the spinal canal and spinal cord at T9-10 level appears to be secondary to artifacts, but given the appearance on axial T2 images, an actual narrowing in the region cannot be completely excluded.
CXR [**12-28**]: No evidence of pneumothorax.
Small-to-moderate layering right pleural effusion.
CT Thoracolumbar spine [**2148-1-2**]: Again fixation hardware is redemonstrated consistent with transpedicular screws at T10, T11 and T12 vertebral bodies with a cage at the level of L1 and transpedicular screws in the upper lumbar spine at L2 and L3 levels.
In comparison with the most recent CT examination, the previously noted new fracture at the level of T10 on the right appears more conspicuous; however, the remainder levels are intact.
Persistent anterior displacement of the cage at L1 with areas of low attenuation in the surgical region, difficult to assess due to metal artifacts.
Multilevel ankylosing spondylitis is redemonstrated.
The prevertebral soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable, persistent right pleural effusion and consolidation on the right lung base with air bronchogram.
IMPRESSION: The fracture identified at the right side of the T10 vertebral body appears more conspicuous, the other levels are unchanged since the most recent examination.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: =================================== 65 yo man with h/o DM type 2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, ankylosing spondylitis, renal cell carcinoma s/p nephrectomy, and L1 burst fracture after falling off step stool s/p T11-12 and L2-3 laminectomies on [**2147-12-11**] who was admitted for fusion of T12-L2 with instrumentation on [**12-25**] who on POD #3 developed numbness and paraplegia in his bilateral lower extremities from an apparent anterior spinal artery infarction.
ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== # Acute Lower Extremity Paraplegia: He has no motor function in his lower extremities and a pinprick/light touch deficit level at T12, with a temperature deficit level at T9.
Given lack of external compression of the thoracic cord on imaging these deficits correspond with a likely anterior spinal artery infarction of unclear etiology at about [**Name (NI) 91387**].
There are significant limitations to imaging due to nearby hardware and extensive soft tissue making clear diagnosis difficult.
He does not have any obvious risk factors for an embolic etiology and this would also be a very rare presentation.
- PT with ROM exercises to prevent frozen joints - AFO's to prevent foot drop - Monitor for pressure sores - Discharge to Acute rehab for intensive therapy - Patient needs repeat CT of thoracolumbar spine ~7 days after discharge.
Follow-up after that with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] or colleague.
# Cervical Spinal disc disease: Patient had cervical cord impingement noted on CT from OSH.
This is a chronic issue but continues to be a major source of discomfort and disability for the patient.
This is likely the cause of his effort-related bilateral arm weakness and neck pain.
He may benefit from wearing the collar during movements and transfer to decrease pain related to transfer.
- Shoulder pain treated with lidocaine patches, gabepentin, and oxycodone .
# Type 2 Diabetes, uncontrolled with comps: Patient on high doses of insulin at home (levemir 80 [**Hospital1 **] plus intensive humalog sliding scale ranging from 20-30 units of humalog).
This was presumed to be because of decreased PO intake.
# Asymptomatic Pyuria: discovered incidentally when looking for proteinuria.
No treatment indicated.
CHRONIC ISSUES: ============== # Normocytic Anemia: Appears to be chronic with some superimposed blood loss from surgery.
# Hyperlipidemia: - continue home atorvastatin and gemfibrozil .
# Ankylosing Spondylitis: Likely this is responsible for the severe nature of his initial fractures on [**12-10**] which were out of proportion to the expected injury from a fall from the second rung of a ladder.
Follow-up after that with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] or colleague.
- Home insulin regimen decreased while inpatient due to poor appetite.
- Foley catheter changed [**2148-1-4**] - Workup for osteoporosis or other causes of pathologic fracture if indicated when patient follows-up with PCP  Medications on Admission: - Levemir 'pen' 80 units [**Hospital1 **] (breakfast and dinner) - Novolog 'pen' 20-30 units per sliding scale at meals - Allopurinol 100 mg QD - Diovan HCTZ 160/25 QD - Lipitor 10 mg QD - Gemfibrozil 600 mg QD - Previously taking ASA 325 mg - no longer taking, stopped in [**Month (only) 547**] for knee surgery and did not restart.
7. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for pain or prior to transfers.
16. sodium chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**1-22**] Sprays Nasal TID (3 times a day) as needed for congestion or dryness.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: L1 burst fracture T10 anterior spinal cord infarction Paraplegia  Secondary Diagnoses: Ankylosing Spondylitis Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Hyperlipidemia Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Several days later, you developed a fracture of the T10 vertebral body and infarction of the spinal cord at that level.
Your ongoing neck, back, and shoulder pain was managed with a new oral pain control regimen.
If the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet.
