Admission Date:  [**2103-5-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2103-6-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2040-11-29**]     Sex:  F  Service:  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Fever and shortness of breath.
She was found to have a right lower lobe pneumonia on her chest x-ray, and was given two days of levofloxacin.
On the day of admission, she noted increased work of breathing and cough and chest pain.
She was fluid resuscitated and given IV levofloxacin, and admitted to the MICU for increased respiratory distress.
History of bipolar disorder.
History of stroke with left sided paralysis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Her HEENT reveals dry oropharynx without lesions and pupils that are equally, round with the left being slightly dilated and unreactive.
Her lungs reveal crackles at the right lung base.
Her cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia with slight grade 1/6 systolic murmur at the right lower sternal border.
Extremities revealed a left below the knee amputation with dressing and no pus expressed.
Neurologic examination reveals left sided weakness in the arm and leg.
The chest x-ray as noted revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient's levofloxacin was changed to ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover for atypicals and fluoroquinolone resistant bacteria.
She was also noted to have an effusion on the chest x-ray and remained in respiratory distress without needing intubation initially.
Thoracentesis was performed on the day following admission of which 5 cc of purulent pleural fluid was removed and the fluid was sent for culture eventually growing out MRSA.
She was followed by Cardiothoracic Surgery in addition to the MICU team for plan for decortication and video assisted thoracoscopy.
After the first chest tube was placed, the patient was noted to be going into hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.
She was kept on supportive care and IV antibiotics for her sepsis that developed.
Because of concern of tension pneumothorax, chest tube was placed on the left, but there was no air noted to be rushing out.
It was felt that due to the ET tube and the O2 saturation monitor, the patient's O2 saturations was not indicative of a true hypoxia while in the operating room.
She was noted to be hypotensive and became septic on the night following VATS with an increase on her white blood cell count to 24,000.
She was fluid resuscitated and was given dose of ceftazidime to cover for more Gram negatives.
She was also cultured for additional organisms which did not reveal any other bacterial organisms.
She did have some episodes of supraventricular tachycardia that resolved with adenosine that made use of dopamine less desirable, however, she responded well to both pressors.
She continued to be septic and was kept on Vancomycin, and ceftazidime, and given supportive care and fluid resuscitation.
She did become hypotensive on the fourth postoperative day with evidence of sepsis again.
Additional anaerobic coverage was added after she became hypotensive the second time with a consideration of a Clostridium difficile infection which was not borne out by microbiology specimens.
Her ceftazidime was discontinued on the [**4-28**] since we had no evidence of organisms that would benefit from ceftazidime and gentamicin for double gram-negative coverage.
She had also undergone two bronchoscopies, one immediately post VATS decortication to clear out secretions and one on the [**4-29**] to clear her secretions and to prepare her for extubation as she became less vent dependent and was able to tolerate pressure support generating spontaneous breaths as well as low respi's indicating that she would be okay to extubate.
In the meantime, her healthcare proxy was kept up to date on progress of her empyema given its difficult course, she was made DNR/DNI.
The bronchoscopy just prior to extubation did reveal some congestive heart failure with bronciotracheomalacia.
As stated, her blood pressures remained better indicating that her sepsis was resolving.
She was administered 6 mg of IV adenosine after a 12 lead electrocardiogram was performed to confirm evidence of supraventricular tachycardia.
Cardiovascular:  The patient did rule in for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with troponin peak to 4.5.
