Mild resting LVOT gradient.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets.
No MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Conclusions Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-4-30**], the mitral valve has been repaired (ring annuloplasty); however, there is now systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet with mild left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
POD#1 he had a near syncopal [**Known lastname 10718**] and was treated with volume for orthostatic hypotension.
EKG changes postop were evident with ST elevations and a intermittent LBBB.
