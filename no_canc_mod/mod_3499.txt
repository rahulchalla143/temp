He returns now with a right first toe ischemic bullous changes times one week.
It was first noted secondary to drainage on his socks times two days.

He shows dry skin with psoriatic changes on the left elbow.
Pulse examination shows palpable carotids with no bruits.
He had an arteriovenous fistula with thrill.
His femoral pulses were palpable, but diminished with no bruits.
He had absent popliteals bilaterally and absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the right.
The heart was a regular rate and rhythm without extra heart sounds, murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen was protuberant, soft, with diminished bowel sounds, no bruits.
The right first toe showed a bullous lesion the size of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] with ruborous changes.
Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of 63, borderline first degree A-V block with a right axis deviation and a right bundle branch block.
No IVs or blood draws were requested from the left arm secondary to his A-V fistula.
Because of his virus resistant Enterococcus and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus history, he was placed on precautions.
His Coumadin was held in anticipation for arteriogram.
The patient had lower extremity and upper extremity arm vein mappings to assess for conduit.
He had arterial noninvasives which showed significant right aortoiliac and right tibial disease.
He underwent arteriogram on [**2100-6-30**] which demonstrated aorta and iliacs were patent with no focal stenosis or pressure gradient.
There was diffuse disease of the superficial femoral artery and popliteal arteries.
There was mild stenosis of the common femoral and some tibial disease with occlusion of the anterior tibialis, peroneal with a dominant run off vessel with reconstitution of attenuated dorsalis pedis which profused .....................
The patient underwent a right hallux amputation without complications.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  His weight bearing status should be nonweight bearing if not tolerated; if tolerated, then partial right heel weight bearing.
