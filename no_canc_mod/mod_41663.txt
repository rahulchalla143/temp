Has had ~10lb weight loss in last year.
No hemoptysis.
His most recent hospitalization was [**Date range (1) 32177**] for a COPD exacerbation.
Of note he had ~6 hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations in the last year from [**2145-11-6**]-[**2146-9-7**].
He uses intermittent home oxygen , ~2.5L in am and if he gets dyspneic with acitvity.
of lingular infiltrate  Past Medical History: - Mod-Severe COPD: PFTs ([**2145-6-10**]): FEV1 .80(40%) FVC 2.81(88%)  FEV1/FVC 45% - CAD: single vessel in LAD with 60% stenosis on cath [**2128**].
- Exercise MIBI on [**2144-7-15**] with mild inf wall rev defect - Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin - Hypertension - Status post right total hip arthroplasty - s/p rotator cuff repair *2 on right shoulder   Social History: Pt lives alone in [**Location (un) 2312**], MA.
Father had MI in 70's.
Brother with extensive cardiac history including multiple bypass surgeries.
CV: irregularly irregular rhythm, tachycardic, no M/R/G.
Pulm: markedly decreased breath sounds throughout all lung fields.
No wheezes, rhonchi appreciated.
EXT: warm, dry, 2+ distal pulses, no edema or cyanosis.
Atherosclerotic calcifications again involve the aortic arch.
Hyperinflated lungs are consistent with history of obstruction.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax .
CT Chest ([**2-15**]): Severe emphysema is diffuse, associated with bronchial wall thickening and irregularity, suggesting small airway disease.
Areas of peribronchial, peribronchiolar and peripheral consolidation are bibasilar, mostly on the left, consistent with multifocal pneumonia, less likely aspiration.
5-mm nodular portion of the left lower lobe consolidation (4:150) warrants further followup.
Lingular ground-glass opacity and mucoid impactions are present.
Upper lobe centrilobular ground-glass nodules could be related to infection or respiratory bronchiolitis if the patient is a smoker.
A right calcified granuloma is tiny.
2-mm lung nodules are as follows: Subfissural right upper lobe (4:76), lingula (4:142) and left lower lobe (4:188).
Coronary artery calcifications are heavy.
Aortic annulus and valvular calcifications are scattered.
There is no lymph node enlargement using CT criteria.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
This study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note severe aortic and vascular calcifications.
Degenerative changes of the spine and prior surgery of the right humeral region are present.
There is no bone lesion suspicious for malignancy.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no sign of mass, mass effect, edema, or acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is also moderate periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity, most consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Vascular calcifications are present in the bilateral carotid siphons.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid air cells.
There is partial opacification also of the left mastoid air cells.

No change in color or quantity of sputum, no increased cough, no fevers or chills.
These symptoms were in the setting of a recent decrease in his steroid dose from 10mg every other day to 10mg every 4 days (although there is no documentation in medical record of this change and outpatient pulmonologist denies having changed his dose).
On admission a Chest X-ray showed possible lingular infiltrate that could be consistent with pneumonia therefore levofloxacin was started as well as high dose oral steroids for COPD exacerbation.
Clinically patient improved within 36 hours and we were considering discharge to home, however on Sunday at ~7am, he became acutely dyspneic, tachypneic, tachycardic and hypertensive.
Once weaned from CPAP, he again became dyspneic and it was thought to be largely due to his increased work of breathing, as his ABGs were consistent with chronic COPD.
He also was believed to have a componenet of diastolic heart failure that was contributing to hic clinical condition and rate control was achieved with diltiazem.
Back on the medicine floor, patient's respiratory status remained tenuous with continued dyspnea and tachypnea at rest.
A repeat Chest X-ray showed possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
At this point, patient had completed 5 days of oral antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia therefore he was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for possible hospital acquired pneumonia.
He was also restarted on azithromycin for immunomodulatory effect as well as IV steroids given his tenuous respiratory status.
A follow-up Chest CT confirmed a bilateral, multifocal pneumonia and antibiotics were continued to complete a 7 day course of vanc/Zosyn (last day on [**2-21**]).
Benzodiazepenes were continued to control dyspnea and sensation of air hunger leading to increased work of breathing.
Head CT was negative for acute bleed, urinalysis was negative, ABG was normal with no electrolyte abnormalities therefore this was thought secondary to benzos which were withheld.
During this time however he also developed urinary retention with 1000cc in his bladder after voiding.
They stated that he likely had chronic prostate issues and would need a Foley at discharge with urology follow-up.
He gets dyspneic with minimal exertion, but can ambulate to restroom with assistance.
He is being discharged to pulmonary rehab for continued recovery.
