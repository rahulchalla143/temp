The degree of bony changes limits evaluation for osteomyelitis.
No definite evidence of osteomyelitis is seen, although there does appear to be increased bone resorption compared to the most recent comparison radiograph.
CT Pelvis Interval further osseous destruction of distal femoral stump and interval increase in size of surrounding soft tissue phlegmon and fluid collections   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 9427**] is a 38 year old male with PMH significant for paraplegic [**1-17**] gunshot wounds, bilateral BKA/AKA with history of recurrent osteomyelitis on Vanc/Flagyl with noncompliance now presents with increase pain & worsening ulcer on AKA stump.
He was evaluated by vascular surgery who took the patient to the OR and debrided the wound and performed a flap closure.
His Hct was found to be 20.8 and he was noted to have active bleeding from his stump site.
He was transfused an additional 2 U of blood, given 1 L NS and vascular evaluated him and changed the dressing.
He was transferred to the MICU for hypotension where he was monitored until [**7-12**] when vascular took him to the OR for revision of his stump wound.
He had arterial bleeding ligated and his wound was closed with resolution of his bleeding.
After his ligation he remained without bleeding from the site and his Hct increased to 30 on the day of discharge without requiring further transfusion.
