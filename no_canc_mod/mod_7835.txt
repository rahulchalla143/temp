Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course: 85 yr old female patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8579**] with hx of CAD, CABG [**2131**] and stenting in [**2162**] as well as left leg angioplasty [**2158**], s/p right leg stents [**2-28**], also has a left common femoral aneurysm (still present after thrombin injection), on coumadin for PAF, who presents for elective cardiac catheterization after worsening angina.
# Coronary artery disease and catheterization complications - Patient admitted for pre-hydration prior to catheterization.
There was total occlusion of her LAD with 70% in-stent restenosis and evidence of thrombus in her proximal SVG-LAD.
PTCA/stenting of her LAD venous graft was complicated by graft perforation into the thorax without evidence of tamponade after the procedure.
Post-procedure TTE did not show evidence of pericardial effusion.
# Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: She developed fevers while being intubated.
Urinary tract infection:  Weeks into the hospitalization, while on the regular medical floor, the patient became acutely lethargic and cultures were taken.
Urinalysis was highly suggestive of infection and she was empirically started on Cipro.
Renal ultrasound was obtained to r/o abcess which was negative for abscess or pylo .
Left wrist and hand cellulitis with LUE DVT:  Her wrist and thenar eminence became quite swollen, erythematous, and painful on movement.
A LUE ultrasound revealed a non-occlusive thrombus in the basilic vein with extension in the subclavian.
She was not started on heparin due to ongoing melenotic stools as well as a hematocrit in the low 20s.
Wrist cellulitis improved on discharge .
# Hypernatremia: Na+ rose in setting of poor PO intake.
# Nutrition: After extubation, PO intake was markedly decreased, as patient refused to eat.
Her mental status continued to improve with mild increases in PO intake, so the decision was made to monitor her nutritional status as an outpatient.
This continued despite correction of her hypernatremia and treatment of her VAP.
She was treated with haldol with little effect and [**Doctor First Name **] modifications.
Her UTI and left hand cellulitis caused another acute change in her mental status, which improved with proper treatment of these infections.
# Acute Kidney Injury - Patient's renal function initially deteriorated following catherization, likley secondary to contrast nephropathy.
# Scleral/conjunctival hemorrhages: She developed sigificant bilateral eye hemorrhages during admission, likely related to anticoagulation + coughing while intubated.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Now in sinus consistently.
Her CHADS2 = 3, and given her risk of bleeding is relatively low and she is a potential fall risk, we decided to hold off on coumadin.
# Hyperlipidemia: Crestor was initially held given [**Last Name (un) **], but then restarted once patient was extubated and able to tolerates POs, and her renal function improved.
# Hypertension: Losartan and and metoprolol (increased to 100mg daily) continued on discharge.
# GERD: While intubated and s/p intubation, her PPI was changed to Lansoprazole which she should continue.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You had chest pain and a complicated cardiac catheterization to find out the cause of your chest pain.
The vein graft to a heart artery was opened using a bare metal stent but a small perforation developed and was closed with two Grafmaster covered stents.
You required a breathing machine for low oxygen and medicine to keep your blood pressure up.
Antibiotics were given for pneumonia, a urinary tract infection, and a skin infection involved your left hand and wrist.
Start colace, miralax and senna to prevent constipation 4.
Start tylenol as needed for pain 7.
Start vitamin c and Iron to help your anemia 13. finish a 7 day course of Cefpodoxime to treat your urinary infection and the cellulitis on your left arm.
