Admission Date:  [**2184-10-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-10-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-1-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**] Chief Complaint: confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: mechanical ventilation via trach  History of Present Illness: 77yo woman with vent dependency, hx of COPD, sleep apnea here with increasing confusion at NH.
Minimal response although BS up to 146.
Spoke with family: they report that she has been increasingly confused and has almost daily episodes of "deep sleep."
OB negative, Head CT neg for hemorrhage or shift.
CXR showed stable pleural effusion R>L.
Past Medical History: OSA - failed CPAP at nights [**12-26**] agitation, trach placed [**8-27**] COPD: PFTs [**2180**] with FEV1/FVC: 131, nl TLC CHF: mild symmetric LVH, mild MR CAD: documented but no studies on record hyperchol DM2 Gout Afib on coumadin   Social History: Lives at rehab.
NAD HEENT: MMM, JVP flat, PERRLA, CARDS: irreg, tachy 2/6 systolic murmur LUNGS: coarse bilat with crackles R>L ABD: obese, BS+ NT ND soft no rebound EXT: edema.
[**3-27**] distal upper strength.
TW flattening V2, otherwise no change.
No major vascular territorial infarct is apparent.
No osseous abnormality is detected.
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Small right pleural effusion.
Minimal-moderate amount of abdominal ascites.
Multifocal bilateral pneumonia.
Large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion in the setting of cardiomegaly consistent with moderate CHF.
Possible acute cholecystitis.
[**10-16**] CT Head: No acute intracranial process.
Brief Hospital Course: 77yo Italian speaking woman with hx of OSA, obesity, afib, DM here for worsening confusion, poor PO intake, and hypoglycemia.
# Confusion: Ddx included hypoglycemia, sedating medications, infection, central neuro process, malnutrition., hypercarbia.
Initially, mental status improved with minimal intervention.
Then on [**10-16**], she developed increased somnulence.
ABG showed slight increase hypercarbia.
# Resp failure: Hx of OSA and COPD now with trach.
She had mild hypercarbia but we did not clearly believe this was cause of her delirium.
# ID: Elevated WBC on admission and has recently been treated for many infections.
Also has hx of C. diff and MRSA PNA.
- We did attempt thoracentesis of right sided pleural effusion to help guage therapy.
- A sputum culture grew Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, with sensitivities similar to what had been obtained at rehab.
She had no clear infiltrate on chest CT, but given her initial respiratory failure, we empirically began a 7-day course of meropenem (for the Pseudomonas) and tobramycin (for the Acinetobacter) for presumed tracheobronchitis.
**** - We continued PO flagyl for her C. Diff colitis; she will continue this until 14 days after completion of all other antibiotics.
OB neg stool but she has not been on PPI.
Her hematocrit remained stable in the mid-/high-20s, and no further transfusions were needed.
Iron studies not c/w iron def anemia.
retic count quite low suggestive of marrow suppression.
Hemolysis labs negative.
# CHF: Right sided failure vs periph edema on exam.
Previous echo here not with profoundly depressed EF but does have some diastolic dysfunction.
We continued to hold her Isordil in order to allow for diuresis with her Lasix.
# Cardiac; ischemia: No new EKG changes.
Cardiac enzymes were not indicative of active myocardial ischemia.
# Atrial fibrillation: We initially held her coumadin in the setting of her low hematocrit, but this was resumed on [**10-18**].
He metoprolol was uptitrated since she was having bursts of atrial fibrillation with RVR.
No oral agents.
Given low-dose sliding scale.
Continued neurontin for neuropathic pain .
# Hyperlipidemia: No active issues.
# Gout: Does not report any joint pain at this time, no evidence of acute flair.
# Dispo: She is being discharged to [**Hospital **] rehab for continuation of her above antibiotics, continued respiratory support for her chronic obstructive sleep apnea, and for continued nutritional and physical support, as above.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: hypoglycemia delirium respiratory failure anasarca  Secondary diagnoses: obstructive sleep apnea, status-post tracheostomy chronic obstructive pulmonary disease chronic diastolic congestive heart failure atrial fibrillation anemia hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with confusion and low blood sugars.
