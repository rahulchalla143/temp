No ST-T changes.
There are multifocal patchy areas of increased opacity in the right mid and left lower lung zones, with otherwise grossly clear lungs.
No pleural effusions are identified.
IMPRESSION: Patchy right mid and left lower lung zone opacities, which may relate to patchy atelectasis, aspiration, or early infection.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are persistent perihilar opacities that most likely reprsent atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 year-old female with a PMHx significant for HTN on multiple out-patient antihypertensives, atrial fibrillation now off Coumadin X 2 months, admitted with bradycardia and hypotension, as well as respiratory failure requiring intubation.
The etiology of her bradycardic and hypotensive event was somewhat unclear on admission.
An echo was performed on [**2188-2-21**], which revealed normal EF, no abnormalities.
In the CCU, however, she had recurrent bradycardia and hypotension when Dopamine was weaned, and she underwent PPM placement on [**2188-2-22**].
No anticoagulation since she is at high fall risk.
A CXR was initially suspicious for RML and RLL pneumonia, and she was started on Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone.
Her sputum cultures also grew E.coli, pansensitive.
Of note, a repeat PA/lateral was negative for pneumonia.
4) FEN/Renal: Ms. [**Known lastname 10446**] had a metabolic acidosis on admission due to lactic acidosis, ARF (peak creatinine [**1-2**] on admission), and elevated LFT's felt secondary to hypoperfusion in the setting of drug-induced bradycardia.
Her metabolic acidosis quickly resolved with resolution of the renal failure and improved hemodynamics.
Brinzolamide 1 % Drops, Suspension Sig: One (1) drop Ophthalmic  TID (3 times a day) as needed for Glaucoma.
