The patient stated that he had been feeling poorly with shortness of breath for one and a half weeks prior to admission.
Also he noted a cough that had become increasingly purulent.
He disappeared from home for one to two days and when he returned he had a fever, cough and chills.
After initial improvement in his symptoms they then returned and became progressively worse.
In the Emergency Room he had worsening shortness of breath requiring intubation.
Chest x-ray demonstrated left upper lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He does smoke and unclear number of packs per day, history of intranasal cocaine use, no known history of intravenous drug use.
In general he was originally speaking in full sentences with no use of accessory muscles or dyspnea.
Chest, left-sided rhonchi, wheezes and crackles with egophony.
Cor, tachycardiac with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia with ST elevations in V2 and V3.
Pneumonia - Chest x-ray on admission demonstrated consolidation of left upper lobe.
Chest computerized tomography scan revealed extensive consolidation of left upper lobe with gas products worrisome for cavitary necrosis.
In the Medicine Intensive Care Unit he was started on steroids for hypotension and presumed sepsis.
Necroscopy was performed which revealed bloody secretions aspirated from the trachea.
No frank hemoptysis or endobronchial lesions were noted.
Culture data revealed Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient did have occasional temperatures which initially were started on Oxacillin.
The patient had repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest which revealed a large cavitary lesion, 10 by 6 left lung as well spinal anesthesia left-sided pleural effusion with enhancement on computerized tomography scan.
Sepsis - The patient had hypotension following his pneumonia.
This was felt to be secondary to his Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was felt to have adrenal insufficiency in the setting of sepsis and was treated with a course of Hydrocortisone.
Anemia - The patient had an episode of hemoptysis following intubation.
No identifiable lesion was seen on bronchoscopy.
Titers revealed elevated ferritin but low iron.
It was felt the patient did have an iron deficiency anemia.
Acute renal failure - The patient came in with a creatinine of 3, likely secondary to prerenal azotemia.
The patient did not have any signs of withdrawal on the floor.
The patient did not wish to have any inpatient evaluation done.
He was seen by Psychiatry on the floor and they felt that he either had bipolar disorder or schizo-affective disorder based on available information.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] also had an electroencephalogram performed due to question of seizure activity which revealed moderate encephalopathy which was likely in the setting of his infection.
Atrial fibrillation - The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation upon his admission to the Emergency Department.
The patient did not have any further episodes of atrial fibrillation during his hospital course and this likely occurred in the setting of infection.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which demonstrated normal systolic ejection fraction greater than 55%, trivial mitral regurgitation, trivial tricuspid regurgitation, otherwise normal echocardiogram with no signs of endocarditis.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  Upon hearing that thoracentesis was requested, the patient became very angry and did not want to have this procedure done.
He was upset at the change of plans for thoracentesis on [**6-28**], and had planned for thoracentesis on [**6-29**].
The patient was explained that due to his spiking temperatures on [**6-29**] and the presence of a pleural effusion empyema could not be excluded, the patient understood the risks and chance of death and stated he wished to have a second opinion by somebody out of this institution.
