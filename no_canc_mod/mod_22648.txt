He was admitted to the floor o/n, with normal BPs and HR in 100s, and was found to have continuing dropping HCT 29 on admission -> 23 -> 1UPRBC -> 19.9 in setting of severe thrombocytopenia.
Initial evaluation in the ED for DIC was negative (see hematology note) and he was felt to have either drug induced TP, ITP or HIT (no evidence of thromboses).
Of note, he has had guaiac positive stools but no melena or hematochezia.
Per discussion with patient and Admission notes, he was in USOH at rehab until AM of admission, when he noticed small red dots all over his legs, which proliferated through the day.
He also noted slight bleeding from his mouth/lips.
[**Name (NI) **] exposure to ticks or recent bug bites."
He did not feel he was confused, but could not perform calculations or attention tasks.
He has no HA, vision changes, numbness, but states that Right leg has had different sensation over the past few weeks.
Vascular was asked to evalute the lower extremity ulcer for possible osteomyeleitis and intervention - found pulses palpable with doppler, recommended non invasive lower extremity studies and antibiotics (Vanc, Cipro, Flagyl).
Heme reviewed peripheral smear which did not reveal schistocytes and thought this to be secondary to drug reaction or ITP and advised to wait on transfusing plt, reverse INR, and start prednisone 50mg Daily."
Past Medical History: -DM: diet-controlled, not insulin-dependent -chronic L foot ulcer (per OSH records, cx'ed Pseudomonas and MRSA on [**6-30**]: PA sensitive to cefepime and amikacin; MRSA sensitive to Bactrim, gent, vanc, rifampin) -HTN -CAD: [**3-/2102**] MIBI from OSH showed 53% EF, small inferior scar w/ minimal peri-infarct ischemia -PVD sp left toe ([**1-3**]) amputation ([**2102-4-29**] - [**Hospital3 **]), s/p L -iliac stent c/b RP bleed while on AC.
Hx of prior DVT, ?
on coumadin for this though no documentation of DVT at OSH records.
-Chronic Left Foot Wound -AAA < 3cm, intra-abdominal -ischemic colitis [**2095**] -HL -carries a diagnosis of mild dementia (per son no dementia, since starting dilaudid has seen the changes).
- Illicits: denies.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dMM, palatal petechiae, tobacco stain on mustache Neck: supple, no JVD.
Moderate sized retroperitoneal hematoma involving the right psoas and iliopsoas muscle.
An additional fluid collection within the retroperitoneum abutting the transversalis muscle on the right also likely represents a separate site of hematoma given the clinical history.
3-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
No evidence of active bleeding.
Small right pleural effusion.
Scattered centrilobular nodules, tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, and mild bronchial wall thickening all suggestive of underlying infectious bronchiolitis, possibly aspiration related.
Given size and appearance a followup CT in three to six months can be obtained to document resolution after appropriate treatment.
Prominent pancreatic duct and common bile duct with no obstructive mass lesions seen.
While this may reflect underlying ampullary stenosis, differential diagnostic considerations for the dilated pancreatic duct includes main branch IPMT.
If alteration in care will occur, can consider correlation with MRCP or ERCP.
Left adrenal adenoma.
Moderate-to-severe sigmoid diverticulosis with no findings of acute diverticulitis.
Probable Paget's disease of left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**].

The patient was noted to have a severe, normocytic anemia.
There was no evidence of hemolysis: per Heme, no sign of hemolysis on smear, labs not suggestive of hemolysis.
A CT scan on [**2102-7-10**] showed a large fluid collection in the right transversalis muscle measuring 6.9 cm (AP) x 3.4 cm (transverse) x 13.1 cm (CC), most consistent with a retroperitoneal hematoma.
His retic was 1.4, an inappropriately low response in setting of a severe anemia, implicating involvement of the BM.
The patient's Hct remained stable subsequently without need for further transfusion.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE:  The patient arrived with severe thrombocytopenia, with a plt count less than 5K.
There was no evidence of DIC.
The differential included ITP and drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
The HIT Ab came out as being mildly positive (patient had Hx of hep on [**6-27**] at rehab), but the likelihood of having HIT was deemdd low.
He received one unit of platelets on [**7-11**] with a bump in platelet levels to 91K.
It is unclear whether he had ITP or drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
# Coagulopathy:  The patient was found to have an elevated INR to 3.7 upon admission.
Per history from an outside surgeon, the patient was on coumadin for a presumed, acute occlusion of the left foot that led to ulcerations.
# PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITH CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA remity Ulcer: S/p amputation of toes [**1-3**].
Vascular surgery saw patient and said there was no operative management necessary.
There was no evidence of osteo on XR.
Foot ulcer grew Pseudomonas and MRSA on [**6-30**].
Has hypokinesis of basal inferolateral flow on echo in [**Month (only) 547**].

You were admitted with very low platelets and a low blood count.
It is very important that you follow up with your doctors at rehab and the Hematologist as you need to have your blood counts followed.
You were also found to have blood in your stool, so you should have a colonoscopy as an outpatient.
