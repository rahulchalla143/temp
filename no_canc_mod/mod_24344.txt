The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal grayscale appearance of the liver without biliary ductal dilatation.
Small right pleural effusion and trace right perinephric fluid.
EEG ([**11-28**]): IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow background with bursts of additional generalized slowing.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.
There is no change in the left retrocardiac consolidation with air bronchogram that might be consistent with infectious process.
There is slight interval improvement of pulmonary edema which is currently mild to moderate.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present.

# Liver failure, hepatitis.
Pt was seen by liver service who felt underlying etiology was secondary to chronic tylenol in setting of ETOH abuse.
RUQ u/s was negative for abnormalities.
When she follows up in clinic on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**12-9**] liver enzymes should be rechecked to assess for resolution of hepatitis.
She was initially on propafol for sedation but this was discontinued due to elevated lipase.
A CXR was obtained that showed RLL opacity and sputum cultures grew out MRSA.
She denied respiratory complaints at time of discharge; she was afebrile with a white count of 11.

Breakthrough pain was treated with oxycodone.

# Elevated lipase.
# Smoking cigarettes.
# Social work.
