In the ambulance to the ED he developed substernal chest pain.
He denies SOB, nausea, or palpitations.
His pain improved with NTG but recurred.
An ECG there showed ST depressions in V4-6 with an intial set of negative CEs, but follow up CEs were positive with a TnI of 1.34 from 0.12 8 hours prior.
At that time his WBC was notable for 3.5 and he had a low grade fever.
Given his ECG changes and elevated TnI he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.
He was started on eptifibatide and a NTG drip for ongoing chest pain and transfered to the CCU.
He denies SOB at rest, orthopnea, or LE edema.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for presense of chest pain for the past several days for for the past month with exertion as well as dyspnea on exertion.
He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Cerebral aneurysm - Colostomy with reversal - Ruptured diverticulum s/p Colostomy [**6-23**] - Cerebral aneurysm [**2182**] s/p VP shunt (subsequently removed) - Hernia repair - Hip Surgery [**2156**] - Arthritis - Diabetes, now off hypoglycemics and insulin - HTN - HLD .
Physical Exam: GEN: NAD, diaphoretic VS: 100.0  82  125/59  21  100% on RA HEENT: JVD to the angle of the jaw, no LAD, neck is supple CV: RR, distant, NL S1S2 no S3S4 +II/VI systolic murmur at the LUSB PULM: Prolonged expiratory phase relative to inspiration, crackles at the bases L>R ABD: BS+, soft, NTND, no HSM LIMBS: No LE edema, mild clubbing SKIN: No hair of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 22595**], no skin breakdown NEURO: Reflexes are 2+ diffusely PULSES: Radial, femoral, TP, and DP pulses are 2+ bilaterally POST CATH CHECK groin without murmur, masses, bruit, or hematoma .
ECG: Sinus, 82/min, leftward axis, RBBB, ST-T in I, II, aVL, V4-5, TWI in I, II, III, aVF, V1-6, and possible ST-E in aVR and V1.
The LMCA had no angiographic evidence of disease.
Resting hemodynamic reveal transient systemic hypotension that resolved after fluid resuscitation.
CABG vs PCI of LAD and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be discussed with primary cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and CT surgery.
CXR [**12-24**]: The heart is normal in size and lungs are clear without vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis (inferior wall worst affected) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD (inferior ischemia/infarction).
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Trace aortic regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o M with h/o CAD s/p PCI (DES in [**Month/Year (2) **], OM1, and LAD), DM, and a heavy tobacco histroy who was transfered from an OSH for NSTEMI and was found to have 80% proximal LAD lesion, 90% [**Month/Year (2) **] in stent restenosis, and a fully occluded RCA with collaterals as well as a fever and a possible LLL PNA.
# CAD: NSTEMI with Trop peaking of 2.17 at OSH now s/p cath showing 80% proximal LAD lesion, 90% [**Month/Year (2) **] in stent restenosis, and a fully occluded RCA with collaterals.
He was briefly on a NTG drip for pain and to decrease cardiac work.
While in hospital, we changed home metoprolol succinate 50 mg PO daily to metoprolol tartrate 25 mg PO daily to decrease cardiac work and cycled his cardiac enzymes.
# PUMP: Initially presenting with some crackles on exam, JVD elevated and mildly hypoxic, but he may have TR on exam and has a heavy smoking history.
# Fever: Febrile on admission and at OSH.
He also had a low WBC count, but his workup for possible neutropenia was negative and his WBC count rebounded prior to discharge: (WBC 2.6 on [**12-23**], and up to 4 on [**12-28**]).
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Leukopenia Hyponatremia Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and a cardiac catheterization showed some blockages in your heart arteries.
Your left groin site had some pain last night but there is no evidence of bleeding under the skin this morning.
You should watch the site for any new bruising, bleeding or increasing pain.
