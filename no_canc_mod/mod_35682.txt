Admission Date:  [**2182-9-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2182-10-3**]    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old man with history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, PVD, admitted day #4 postoperatively for elective L4,5 lumbar His operation was uncomplicated, however, he had a presumed aspiration day #1 postoperatively which led to respiratory distress, unresponsiveness requiring intubation and he was transferred to SICU.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2182-9-24**] with finding consistent with bleeding from ETT trauma and positive evidence of food in lower airway consistent with aspiration.
ENT consult noted no significant laceration, patient's SICU course was notable for extubation on [**9-25**], he continued hemodialysis per renal team and unexplained hypotension despite increased fluid volume.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, status post right fem tib bypass, status post right toe amputation, pulmonary nodule awaiting biopsy, LBP, L4,L5 stenosis, status post L4,L5 decompressive laminectomy on [**2182-9-23**], glaucoma, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, positive PPD.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, oropharynx clear, mucus membranes dry.
Neck, no jugulovenous distension.
Cardiovascular, irregular irregular, no audible murmurs.
Abdomen soft, non distended, nontender with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities without edema and palpable pulsations bilaterally.
Right second toe status post amputation.
Skin reveals two skin ulcers with clean dressing, two dry necrotic toe like small ulcers on each foot.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 77-year-old man who was admitted for decompressive laminectomy L4,L5, who developed postoperative day #1 aspiration resulting in respiratory distress requiring transient intubation, who was initially hospitalized on SICU and then transferred to medicine for further management for dysphagia.
His treatment consisted of oxygen through nasal cannula but patient was not on antibiotics since he remained afebrile throughout the course of hospitalization.
Dysphagia:  The patient developed severe dysphagia postoperatively, failed three swallowing video studies for solid and liquid food.
He had PEG placement inserted on [**2182-10-2**] without complications.
If this result is positive, patient should be treated with antibiotics since this could be cause for his findings during endoscopy.
The cause of his severe dysphagia was believed to be due to mechanical cause and patient might be evaluated in several months with additional swallowing study.
Renal, patient has end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, continued hemodialysis during hospitalization without complications.
Swallowing study revealed aspiration involving thick as well as thin barium, no cough reflex was elicited.
EKG revealed sinus rhythm, borderline first degree AV block, left atrial abnormality.
Biopsies from the stomach ulcer are still pending on the day of discharge.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease.
