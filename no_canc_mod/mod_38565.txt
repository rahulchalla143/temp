[**2198-4-20**] CT C-spine IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation is identified within the cervical vertebrae.
Degenerative changes are seen at multiple levels, most pronounced at the C5-C6 level, with moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis CT of Abd/Pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
Small extracapsular hematoma adjacent to the right posterior liver.
Small low attenuation left hepatic focus, which is too small to be characterized.
Small right pleural effusion.
Defect of right L3 lamina, which does not appear to be an acute finding.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta, mesenteric and renal vessels  EEG [**2198-4-23**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a slowed background rhythm with intermittent generalized delta frequency slowing.
These findings suggest deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and are consistent with an encephalopathy.
Common causes include infection, metabolic abnormalities, and medication affects.
No lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were seen.
Brief Hospital Course: TSICU [**Date range (3) 93066**] After initial stabilization in the trauma bay, the patient was taken to the CT scanner for imaging studies.
His only significant injury related to the trauma of the MVC was a small subcapsular hematoma of his liver.
However, the patient began to develop shortness of breath in the trauma bay after obtaining his CT scans.
An ECG did not show any ischemic changes.
The patient has severe underlying cardiac disease with a depressed ejection fraction predisposing him to pulmonary edema.
The patients blood pressure climbed to 200/100 and he was tachypneic and tachycardic.
Throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, serial HCTs were done and they remained stable indicating no significant bleeding from the hematoma.
The patient has an underlying severely compromised cerebral blood as evidenced by prior MRI/MRA.
The patient was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy who found him to have good strength and mobility but to be of considerable safety risk to himself in that he was unable to answer appropriately when asked the names/doses of his medications, what he would do in an emergency and also was noted to have difficulty in tasks with concentration and memory.
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 160-800 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for UTI for 5 days.
You should eat a cardiac low sodium diet.
Return to the emergency room if you develop fevers, chills, chest pain or shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, black or bloody stools, weakness in your arms or legs, changes in speech, inability to urinate or any other concerning symptoms.
