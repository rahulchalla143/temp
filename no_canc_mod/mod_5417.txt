Admission Date:  [**2133-7-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-7-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-12-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath Hypoxia Hypercapneic respiratory failure Pulmonary hypertension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2133-7-6**] Cardiac Catherization  History of Present Illness: 67yo male with h/o liver transplant [**2126**], severe OSA, pulmonary hypertension, and progressively worsening dyspnea over the last two weeks, admitted for diuresis after elective cardiac cath revealed biventricular elevated filling pressures, and now transferred to CCU in setting of acute on chronic respiratory acidosis requiring treatment with BiPAP.
Patient has had mild dyspnea on exertion at baseline for approx.
last 1-2 years, but over past several weeks has noted progressively worsening dyspnea.
Recent work-up by his pulmonologist, including PFTs, indicated severe restrictive pulmonary dysfunction with reduced lung volumes, but normal DLCO when calculated for lung volumes.
His pulmonologist also felt there may be a component of diastolic heart failure contributing to his worsening dyspnea, and he was referred for an elective right cardiac cath which was performed earlier today.
Cath revealed severely elevated biventricular filling pressures, as well as severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with only moderate elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance.
After cath, patient was admitted to the cardiology service for diuresis, as it was felt his dyspnea was primarily related to cardiac etiology vs. a pulmonary etiology.
On arrival to floor, he appeared lethargic and was difficult to arouse.
An ABG revealed a respiratory acidosis: 7.23/70/73/31.
He had been started on a nitro gtt in the cath lab after SBPs noted to be elevated to 200s, and after arrival in CCU his nitro gtt was titrated to keep SBP <160.
Patient denied any chest pain, abdominal pain or nausea.
No recent fevers, chills, or rigors.
No history of asthma or COPD, but patient does have h/o smoking 1-1.5 PPD for 45 years.
He has a h/o OSA and has been non-adherent to using CPAP in the past.
Of note, patient has hematoma in right neck after failed right IJ placement for procedure; procedure performed through left femoral.
Past Medical History: Morbid Obesity Tobacco Dependence (quit 1 yr ago, now using e-cigarettes) EtOH Cirrhosis and portal hypertension; s/p liver transplant [**4-/2127**] Splenorenal shunt Renal Insufficiency Restrictive pulmonary dysfunction Pulmonary Hypertension Obstructive Sleep Apnea DM Type 2 - resolved, occurred after OLT in setting of steroids  s/p incisional, ventral hernia repairs c/b infection   Social History: Married but currently separated from his wife for 15 years.
Physical Exam: VS: T=95.5 BP=176/86 HR=100 RR=32 O2 sat=100% on 5L NC GENERAL: Lethargic appearing, awakes to voice, but falls back to sleep within sevearl minutes.
Sclera anicteric.
NECK: Right sided hematoma at site of attempted right IJ, dressing stained with blood but no evidence of active bleeding, hematoma has not increased in size since markings previously drawn.
Unable to assess JVD given body habitus.
slight systolic murmur but difficult to assess as heart sounds distant LUNGS: Slightly labored breathing, but no significant accessory muscle use.
Poor airmovement bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at bases.
Abdominal incisional scars.
EXTREMITIES: Bilateraly lower ext edema 3+ to level of knees.
SKIN: Chronic venous stasis changes with brawny discoloration and verrucous appearing areas, more notable on left.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-10-2**], there is no definite change.
Unable to compare pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimates.
There is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with worsening pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions.
Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base, and the possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot be definitely excluded (especially in the absence of a lateral view).
New right lower lobe and middle lobe atelectasis.
Improvement of degree of vascular congestion in both lungs.
Stable moderate cardiomegaly and right pleural effusion .
[**2133-7-10**] CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum, right middle lobe and left lower lobe atelectasis are unchanged.
Moderate right pleural effusion.
EKG [**2133-7-8**]: Sinus rhythm and atrial ectopy, atrial bigeminy.
The T wave inversion previously recorded in leads I and aVL persist and the T waves are now biphasic to inverted in leads V3-V6 and the ST segments are downsloping in lead II with associated T wave inversions.
These findings raise question of active anterolateral and apical ischemic process.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart filling pressures with RVEDP 24 mmHg and PCWP 38 mmHg.
There was severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 96 mmHg.
Severely elevated biventricular filling pressures.
Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with only moderate elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance.
No evidence for intracardiac shunt.
Brief Hospital Course: 67yo male with h/o liver transplant [**2126**], severe OSA, and pulmonary HTN, admitted after elective right cardiac cath revealed severely elevated biventricular filling pressures as well as severe pulmonary artery HTN, and who was transferred to CCU in setting of acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.
# Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis - After cardiac cath, patient noted to be lethargic, and ABG revealed pH 7.23, pCO2 70.
This acid-base disturbance was thought to be an acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, most likely due to increased sedation in setting of cardiac cath with underlying obesity hypoventilation syndrome and pulmonary HTN.
COPD seemed less likely given recent outpatient pulmonary work-up, which was more consistent with restrictive physiology, however the patient does have a significant smoking history.
Repeat ABGs showed a persistent acidosis, with mild improvement in hypercapnia following BiPAP.
The patient was prescribed nebulizers with some symptomatic improvement, and these were no longer needed prior to discharge.
He became more drowsy and disoriented at times, and this was thought to be due to his respiratory status - his ammonia was only mildly elevated at 63 and there were no indicators of infection.
Repeat ABGs revealed a similar respiratory acidosis profile despite therapy, but he improved clinically.
#) Pulmonary HTN - Patient noted to have severe pulmonary HTN during cardiac cath, which was likely contributing to his dyspnea.
The differential diganosis for the cause of his pulmonary HTN is broad, and includes left heart diastolic failure, severe OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, autoimmune causes, neuromuscular disease, and liver disease.
Outpatient pulmonary work-up revealed severe restrictive pulmonary dysfunction with reduced lung volumes, but normal DLCO when calculated for lung volumes, suggesting pulmonary HTN not related to a primarily pulmonary vascular etiology.
A pulmonary consult was called, and the team felt the patient would not be an ideal candidate for a vasodilator challenge at this time, but that the issue could be re-addressed once the patient had undergone diuresis for his diastolic heart failure exacerbation.
Could consider autoimmune work-up and evaluation for neuromuscular disease (note normal CK 71), however dCHF and OSA are most likely etiologies of his pulmonary HTN.
# Diastolic Heart Failure -  Biventricular elevated filling pressures demonstrated on cardiac cath c/w diastolic heart failure.
These elevated pressures are significantly elevated from previous cardiac cath in [**2125**] which showed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures and mild/moderately elevated left-sided filling pressures.
Echo obtained [**9-/2132**] demonstrated normal ventricular systolic function with LVEF>55%, and moderate pulmonary HTN.
Repeat echo this admission again revealed LVEF >55%, RV free wall hypertrophy, and increased LV filling pressures, but could not compare pulmonary artery systolic pressures to previous studies given suboptimal image quality of echo.
He was also started on a beta blocker, to allow for increased filling time.
He was not started on an ACE inhibitor in the setting of his liver transplant and impaired renal function.
#) Renal insufficiency - Cr 2.0 on presentation, and had been 1.8-2.0 over past several months prior to admisison.
Urine electrolytes obtained, and were consistent with a pre-renal etiology.
Liver team did not feel cyclosporine toxicity was responsible for the acute rise in Cr, however his cyclosporine dose was decreased and his levels were monitored.
The patient was noted to have taken NSAIDs prior to admission, which may also have contributed to acute kidney injury.
#) Hypertension - Patient hypertensive with SBP in 200s in cath lab, was started on nitro gtt, and had SBP in 170s on arrival to CCU.
Per the liver team, he should not be started on an ACE inhibitor in the community, but he might benefit from the addition of amlodipine if he becomes increasingly hypertensive on his current regimen.
He was continued on his home dose of mycophenalate mofetil, as well as prophylactic Bactrim.
The liver team recommended checking daily LFTs and INR to monitor his graft function.
# Chronic venous stasis changes - Patient seen by wound care nurse, who recommended aloe vesta be applied to bilateral lower extremity venous stasis lesions twice daily.
Outpatient Physical Therapy Patient can walk with a walker or other assistance.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Pulmonary hypertension Diastolic heart failure Acute on chronic renal failure  SECONDARY: Hypertension Obstructive sleep apnea s/p liver transplant on longterm immunosuppression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You presented on [**2133-7-6**] for an elective right heart catheterization following workup by your pulmonologist, who had found abnormalities on your pulmonary function tests.
The concern was that a degree of heart failure was contributing to your underlying chronic lung problems, most likely due to smoking and being overweight, which can make breathing more difficult.
Prior to admission you had noticed worsening shortness of breath especially in the past 2 weeks, and this was severely limiting you even with eating.
The catheterization revealed high pressures in both sides of the heart and severe pulmonary hypertension (see explanation below).
Pulmonary hypertension is the progressive constriction of blood vessels supplying the lungs, which leads to progressive stiffening of these blood vessels.
Therefore less oxygen is available to the body, especially during exercise, which leads to shortness of breath.
It was felt that the [**Last Name 16423**] problem leading to your shortness of breath was heart failure causing fluid build-up in the lungs.
The reason for this is likely a combination of your obstructive sleep apnea, heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
On [**2133-7-10**] you had an episode of worsening shortness of breath, but your chest X-ray showed improvement and there were no abnormalities on the heart tracing (ECG).
We started you on a beta-blocker called metoprolol which takes some of the strain off the heart by slowing the heart beat and we changed you from intravenous to an oral diuretic called torsemide.
