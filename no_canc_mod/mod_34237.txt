She developed substernal chest pain the AM of admission at her Psychiatric group home which was not relieved with nitroglycerin.
She also noted dizziness and lightheadedness while standing.
She notes she may have syncoped, but this was unwitnessed and she denies LOC or head trauma.
EMS arrived and administered ASA 325 mg. Of note, she reportedly has chronic dyspnea and often hyperventilates.
EKG was concerning with new small TWI in lead I, aVL; Cardiology felt no urgent intervention was necessary given recent reassuring MIBI (1/[**2138**]).
She had a CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrating an occlusion of the left subcalvian vein and collaterals to the LUE from the right with a thrombus in the right innominate vein graft with trace flow.
There was no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
There was a round structure in the anterior chest wall in the subcutaneous tissue could which was thought to be a sebaceous cyst.
Of note, the patient was seen in the ED on [**2139-5-25**] for a vulvar abscess which was I&D'ed with wick placement.
Prior to that the patient was discharged on [**2139-5-7**] after admission for a viral-like syndrome with negative blood cultures.
She was admitted to the MICU complaining of chest pain localized substernally with pain from the telemetry stickers on her chest; associated with generalized body pain.
Currently, the patient denies chest pain or lightheadedness and dizziness.
She has no vision changes or headaches; denies nausea or vomiting, currently she is without abdominal pain; she is anuric; denies numbness or tingling.

IMAGING: [**2139-6-16**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO - Occlusion of the left subcalvian vein and collaterals to the LUE from the right (could be from an intercostal vein.
Thrombus in the right innominate vein graft; however, there is a trace flow in a portion of the thrombus.
No pulmonary embolus or thoracic aorta dissection.
No bowel obstruction.
Small kidneys with no hydronephrosis.
Increased density in the skeleton which could be from renal osteodystrophy.
Round structure in the anterior chest wall in the subcutaneous tissue could be a sebaceous cyst, correlate with clinical exam.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 45F with PMH significant for ESRD (on HD), chronic abdominal pain on narcotics, type 2 DM, HTN, HLD, CAD (h/o inferior MI, normal MINI [**11/2138**]), h/o DVT, with extensive psychiatric history admitted on [**2139-6-16**] to the MICU for chest pain and hypotension requiring pressors.
PLAN: # HYPOTENSION - The patient presented with a repored history of SBP 80-90s at baseline without symptoms and with good mentation.
However, it appears that given her extra dialysis session prior to admission, she may have developed some pre-syncopal symptoms of lightheadedness and dizziness prior to her admission with hypovolemia.
Per Endocrine, the patient was noted to have likely dysautonomia from her long-standing diabetes and a possible elements of mineralocorticoid deficiency.
Her random cortisol in the MICU was 22.2 and she had no evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
The patient was also started on Midodrine 2.5 mg PO TID in the ICU to support her pressure, but this was subsequently discontinued prior to discharge.
Her vitals were supportive of orthostatic hypotension.
It was felt that dysautonomia in the setting of an extra HD session may have precipitated her lower systolic pressures.
We recommended that she consider outpatient tilt table testing, if a diagnosis of dysautonomia is in question.
# EKG CHANGES - The patient has baseline tri-fascicular block (RBBB and LAFB) and also LVH and therefore T wave changes were difficult to interpret and non-specific (furthermore, discordance between ST and T wave is normal with BBB's) - T wave prominance could have been exacerbated by K+ (received single dose of Kayexalate).
She had her troponins trended given some chest pain and the above EKG changes on admission, and these values were reassuring.
She had a MIBI perfusion study performed in [**11/2138**] without perfusion defect noted.
# HYPERKALEMIA - admitted with K+ 9.2(hemolyzed) in the setting of ESRD on HD and possible mineralocorticoid deficiency; received 30 gm Kayexalate x 1 with good response for repeat elevated potassium in the range of 5; EKG changes may have been augmented given hyperkalemia, but less likely.
# LEFT SUBCLAVIAN VEIN OCCLUSION - left subclavian vein occlusion noted with collaterals from right, see on admission imaging; unlikely need for anticoagulation and patient compliance is a concern and the fact that collateral flow suggests chronic thrombus and no evidence of acute neurologic findings were noted.
# CHRONIC HYPONATREMIA - noted since [**Month (only) 547**] of this year; improved with HD; likely occurring in the setting of volume overload - no mental status changes or neurologic concerns.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA - platelet trend 157 - 156 - 125; no evidence of petechiae or active bleeding; will follow-up as outpatient.
# CAD - The patient is status-post inferior MI and MIBI in [**11/2138**] was reassuring without a perfusion defect.
Her 2D echocardiogram demonstrated an EF > 55% - though she had complaints of diffuse chest discomfort which resolved.
There was some concern that hypovolemia or hypotension may have precipitated demand ischemia, but her troponin and EKG findings were reassuring.
We avoided beta-blockade and ACEI in the setting of hypotension concerns.
# CHRONIC PAIN COMPLAINTS - suspect somatization or psychiatric component given poor history and vague complaints in the setting of multiple imaging modalities that have failed to yield an etiology.
The patient has had reassuring abdominal imaging on this admission and we continued her medications including: Flexeril, Gapabentin, Seroquel, Ativan and her Dilaudid dosing.
# ESRD ON HEMODIALYSIS - continued on HD regimen per Renal recommendations - M/W/F - continued nephrocaps, sevelamer and monitoring electrolytes.
# TYPE 2 DIABETES - Her last HbA1c 6.0% in [**2135**], has been on Levemir and sliding scale insulin at home; evidence of ESRD, peripheral neuropathy - we opted to maintain her on glargine 18 units QHS with plans to return to Levemir when she is discharged.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the Internal Medicine service at [**Hospital1 1535**] to the medical ICU and then transfered to CC7 regarding management of your hypotension and chest pain concerns.
You had a reassuring cardiac evaluation.
Your hypotension was attributed to diabetes-induced dysautonomia (or dysfunction of your blood pressure-neurologic response).
An endocrine/hormone evaluation revealed no acute abnormalitis.
Your blood pressure improved and your chest pain resolved, thus you were discharged home.
Please call your doctor or go to the emergency department if: * You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
* You develop new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
* You are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids, or your medications.
* If you are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include: dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
* Your pain is not improving within 12 hours or is not under control within 24 hours.
* Your pain worsens or changes location.
* You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
