Admission Date:  [**2190-3-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-3-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2122-6-10**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67 year-old male with a history of degenerative joint disease who was admitted for a left total knee replacement after three Synvisc injections provided only temporary relief for a few months.
He noted no chest pain, fevers or chills, frequency, dysuria, urgency or hematuria on admission.
Asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2180**] with persistent disequilibrium.
His initial left sided weakness has resolved.
Type 2 diabetes diet controlled with no neuropathy.
History of prostate cancer with a PSA of 8.3 and a [**Doctor Last Name **] score of 6.
Degenerative joint disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well developed obese man in no acute distress with a blood pressure of 164/82, pulse 97.
He is normocephalic, atraumatic with anicteric sclera.
His neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy.
He has no thyromegaly.
His heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
His extremities are warm with trace left ankle edema.
On postoperative day number one he was noted to have slight shortness of breath with a question of an asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
He was started on nebulizers but had persistent tachycardia and a mild shortness of breath.
A CT angiogram on the [**12-11**] revealed a left lingular pulmonary artery filling defect consistent with a small PE.
Shortly thereafter he suffered a hypercarbic respiratory arrest with associated hypotension that required intubation and briefly pressors.
He had a short episode of acute renal failure associated with hypotension that resolved with a return of his blood pressure to normal and with hydration.
As his sedation (Ativan and Fentanyl) was lightened, evidence of alcohol withdraw became apparent again and he was started on Valium and a CIWA scale until he became asymptomatic.
He exhibited delirium immediately after extubation that slowly improved with a return to his baseline mental status by the time of discharge.
He did have an exaggeration of his baseline dysmetria that was concerning to the patient and his wife.
He was continued on his aspirin once per day for cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis.
An arm rash was noted after the CT angiogram as well as some complaints of dyspnea, which raised some concern of an anaphylactic reaction to the contrast dye.
However, there were multiple other contributing factors that could have been involved in his respiratory arrest namely his hydromorphone epidural, his reactive airway disease flare and possibly his obstructive sleep apnea given his body habitus.
Degenerative joint disease status post left total knee replacement.
Asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2180**] with a residual dysmetria.
