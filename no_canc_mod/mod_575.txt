Admission Date:  [**2138-7-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-9-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-7-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory Failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy Intubation R Thoracentesis (x2) Central Line Placement PICC Line Placement HD line placement Hemodialysis (CVVH) PEG Placement   History of Present Illness: 61 year old man, PMH of DM type II, with recent hospital admission ([**5-22**]) for enterococcal bacteremia and aortitis, presented to OSH on [**2138-7-22**] complaining of 6 weeks of back pain and bowel incontinence.
Patient said onset of severe back pain began approximately 6 weeks ago in lower right side, worse with sitting or standing.
If attempted to stand, he experience pain shooting up his back.
The pain has been stable, not worsening.
He reports mild improvement.
Two weeks ago, patient developed bowel incontinence.
He has loss of stool approximately 3-4x/day.
Also reports decreased urine output with no leakage or dribbling.
He decided to go to the hospital when after attempting to get out of bed he felt very dizzy and "things went black."
Also became concerned about his decreased urine output.
At OSH: MRI was notable for an L2-L3 epidural abscess.
Notable findings at the OSH include ampicillin sensitive enterococcal bacteremia, CT scan findings of possible aortitis and a right pleural effusion.
Mr. [**Known lastname 6228**] is a 6xyo male with DM, CAD recently s/p NSTEMI with EF 20-30%, PVD, hypoalbuminemia and COPD initially transferred from OSH for management of C5-6 and L2/L3 osteomyelitis and enterococcal bacteremia.
Past Medical History: 1.CAD, NSTEMI [**5-22**] refused Cath -complicated by cardiomyopathy, with EF =45% -negative stress test [**11/2137**] - ECHO in [**5-/2138**] with reported paradoxical motion of LV apex, hypokinesis of septum and anterior wall infarct ischemia.
2.Diabetes Mellitus Type II 3.Peripheral vascular disease -s/p left great toe ampuation 4.History of enterococcal bacteremia -Admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital with this earlier in [**5-22**].
Received ampicillin and gentamycin, and there was suspicion for aortitis vs infected clot.
HTN 6. h/o osteomyelitis 7.
100 pkyr tobacco hx, prior ETOH use 6pk/day (quit 6mos ago), no illicit drug use  Family History: Sister Diabetes [**Name2 (NI) 6229**] deceased at age 65  Physical Exam: at micu admission  VITALS: T 94.4 BP 103/66 HR 86 O2Sat 95%RA * PHYSICAL EXAM Gen: Elderly male lying in bad in moderate distress with movement HEENT: EOMI, PEERL, anicteric, oropharynx clear NECK: supple, no [**Doctor First Name **], CHEST: poor air movement, diffuse wheezes throughout Back: No vertebral tenderness, R paraspinal tenderness at T8 CV: RRR, S1S2, no m/r/g Abd: protuberant, tympanitic, nontender, distended, + BS Ext: L foot s/p great toe amputation, flaking, red skin with partial thickness ulcer on L foot Scrotal Edema Neuro: CN II-XII intact, B/L UE 5/5 strength, B/L hip flexors [**3-20**] limited by pain, Dorsi/plantar flexion [**4-19**], Sensation saddle-decreased but present,  Pertinent Results: Initial MRI L Spine: Findings indicative of discitis and osteomyelitis at L2-3 and L4-5 level.
Inflammatory changes posterior to the thecal sac at L2-3 level could be due to phlegmon or a small epidural abscess.
MRI C/T/L spine [**2138-7-27**]: Discitis and osteomyelitis at C5-C6 level.
No overt change in the extent of discitis and osteomyelitis at L4-L5 level, incompletely assessed at L2-L3 level.
TTE [**7-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall, moderate hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall, and extensive apical akinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant), although small vegetations cannot be excluded with certainty.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 6228**] is a 66yo male with DM, CAD recently s/p NSTEMI with EF 20-30%, PVD, hypoalbuminemia and COPD initially transferred from OSH for management of C5-6 and L2/L3 osteomyelitis and enterococcal bacteremia.
His hospital course is summarized as follows: He was initially followed on the medical floor for medical management of his MI and bacteremia but then transferred to the MICU on [**7-29**] when he became hypoxemic with an associated respiratory acidosis.
However CXR more consistent with worsening CHF and pleural effusion.
CXR revealed moderate R pleural effusion as well as worsening CHF.
Respiratory Failure: Pt was initially intubated for respiratory distress with subsequent multiple failed planned and self-extubations throughout MICU course.
His respiratory failure was likely secondary to large pleural effusions [**1-17**] CHF (EF 10-15%).
Hypoalbuminemia due to nephrotic syndrom also playing large role as pt reaccumulated fluid s/p thoracentesis and additionally, he has underlying COPD.
CXR improved following but clinical scenario without change.
Pt refused re-intubation overnight.
On [**8-13**] Pt self-extubated and [**8-14**] re-intubated secondary to increasing hypoxia, hypercarbia.
On [**8-20**] extubated x1hr to speak with wife but was briefly hypotensive with reintubation, requiring levophed.
[**8-26**] R Thoracentesis removed 1.8 L, stopped due to hypotension requiring levophed temporarily.
Hypotension: Pt originally presented hypotensive: Thought most likely cardiogenic shock, although he did have many reasons to be septic (osteomyelitis, TV vegetation, retropharyngeal fluid collection).
Also considered component of hypovolemic shock given depleted intravascular status w/ hypoalbuminemia, pt transfused to HCT 30 ([**2061-8-12**]) w/o improvement in pressor requirement (continued levophed requirement).
The pt had 2L dialyzed off on [**8-24**] and pt with hypotension w/ sbp 70 overnight responsive to 750 cc bolus.
On [**8-26**], temporary hypotensive episode requiring levophed due to 1.8L volume removal thoracentesis.
Anxiety / depression:   Patient intermittently angry, attempting to lash out at nurses and making rude, offensive statements.
-Unclear if pts current "anger" is part of his pre-morbid personality vs delirium.
After psych evaluation began Haldol 5mg IV BID, then held Celexa in setting of poor renal function.
Tracheitis: pt w/ thick secretions decreasing.
Renal Failure: F: likely prerenal F, as pt w/ hypotension and pressor requirement.
Pt also w/ diabetic nephropathy.
Hypoalbuminemia playing large role in cardiovascular compromise as pt third spacing tremendous amount of fluid (+8L prior to CVVH, now +7L on intermittent HD).
CVVH used as temprorary bridge for volume removal.
IP performed thoracentesis on [**8-26**], removed 1.8 L on [**8-26**], stopped fluid removal secondary to hypotensive episode.
Continued appearance of edematous and enhancing C5 vertebral body and C [**4-20**] interval disc space.
Ortho spine evaluated and no concern for fluid collection itself compromising vital structures; therefore no need surgical intervention.
Enterococcus bacteremia per OSH (E. Faecalis):  Was on amp/gent from OSH for synergistic coverage for presumed endocarditis.
tx for endocarditis and osteo: abx x minimum 8wks.
8 wk course = ampicillin until [**9-28**] for osteo and endocarditis.
The pts sugars elevated when steroids started so insulin drip was used.
L foot ulcers: Likely secondary to poor wound healing and Diabetes, no evidence of osteo on foot films.
Also small ulcer on right foot.
Aortitis: There was a oncern for infrarenal aortitis on OSH studies.
On vascular read, also with possible ascending aortitis.
Abdominal pain: Pt had intermittent episodes of abdominal pain [**Date range (1) 6232**], appear to have resolved though pt intubated/sedated: central/RUQ.
Chest pain worked up as above.
[**8-11**] RUQ US -, LFTs nl except mild lipase elevation at 64.
Chest pain: Intermittent episodes of chest pain during MICU admission.
The last episode  [**8-18**] early morning pt hypotensive w/ chest pain and diaphoresis.
The levophed increased, pain resolved.
At micu admission pt w/ known CAD, cardiac ischemia, elevated troponins (~6) w/ hypotension and tachycardia thought to be likely demand ischemia versus ACS.
We were unable to pursue cath at this time due to + valve vegetations .
On [**8-10**]: pt converted to NSR at ~1030 On [**8-11**]: pt w/ irregular rhythm, ?
Medications on Admission: Meds: on admission to OSH: Nitro PRN Flomax pravastatin ASA NPH folic acid .
Haloperidol Lactate 5 mg/mL Solution [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1)  Injection TID (3 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Enterococcus Sepsis Endocarditis Vertebral Osteomyelitis Retropharyngeal Abscess Tracheitis Renal Failure Respiratory Failure s/p tracheostomy Hypoalbuminemia Hypernatremia Recurrent Pleural Effusion CHF AFib CAD Diabetes Mellitus Anxiety   Discharge Condition: Alert, able to communicate and speak via Passy Muir Valve.
Able to sit for short periods in chair.
