Pt denies blood in the vomit or diarrhea.
She was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after being admitted with LE swelling and found to have DVT and a proximal aortic thrombus, for which she was being anticoagulated and monitored expectantly.
ROS negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, swelling in the extremeties.
Past Medical History:  - LLE DVT (on coumadin)  - descending aortic arch thrombosis  - hyperlipidemia  - appendectomy  Social History: smoking - 1 PPD x 36 years, occassional ETOH 2 drinks/month, no recreation/illicts, widowed without children  Family History: mother with DM  Physical Exam: VSS, afebrile Neuro: Intact, A&O X3 Cards: RRR Lungs CTA Pulses: DP/Pt palp Lateral Abdomimal  wound- sutures/steri strips Below umbillicus- suture/opening 1cmX1cm  Pertinent Results: CTA [**2124-8-10**] 1.
Status post SMA embolectomy, with patent proximal mesenteric vessels.
Pre-SMA mesenteric induration with trace intermediate density fluid and tiny foci of free gas, likely expected post-surgical change.
No focal collection.
CT [**2124-8-11**] Interval development of extensive ischemic bowel with pneumatosis of ascending colon and distal small bowel involving ileocolic and right colic territory.
Some nonocclusive thrombus is likely still identified within these distal branches.
Extensive portal venous and mesenteric venous gas.
No specific findings to suggest recurrent bowel ischemia.
Intact anastomosis in the right upper quadrant, however, there is a small focus of fluid and air bubbles adjacent to the anastomotic site, likely postoperative, however attention on follow-up exams is recommended.
Small fluid collections within the mesentery and lower midline subcutaneous fat, both of which appear more discrete than on prior exams, including enlargement of the central mesenteric fluid collection following surgery.
There is no substantial rim enhancement or fat stranding about the collection.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 18654**] was admitted on [**2124-8-8**] with possible acute mesenteric ischemia.
On [**8-9**] her wound remained oozy and she received FFP.
On [**8-11**] she developed severe abdominal pain and diarrhea, for which the acute care surgery team was consulted.
She had a CT performed that showed portal venous gas and pneumatosis of the large and small bowel.
She went to the OR emergently for an exploratory laparotomy, where they found a mid-gut infarction secondary to distal superior mesenteric artery occlusion.
She developed abdominal pain and a temperature of 100.9 on [**8-17**], for which she had blood cultures drawn and chest and abdominal x-rays done, none of which showed evidence of infection.
She began having bowel movements again [**8-19**], which became liquid and melanotic.
She had a minimal amount of serosanguinous drainage from the inferior aspect of her laparotomy incision on [**8-25**], which likely represented drainage of a seroma.
On [**2124-8-31**], she was cleared by phiscal therapy for discharge and a chair car has been scheduled for transportation home.
