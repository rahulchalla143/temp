Admission Date:  [**2142-4-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-4-23**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 3253**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old female who has past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, GI bleed and anemia who presented with an acute GI bleed to the [**Hospital1 69**] MICU.
She had several repeat episodes of emesis of 200 cc of bright red blood and her systolic blood pressure dropped to 92.
An EGD showed no varices, but a clot in the fundus.
By the time patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**], patient had no complaints.
There was no abdominal pain.
She had no difficulty urinating.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 91 with normal axis and left bundle branch block with repolarization abnormalities.
She received an urgent EGD the night of [**2142-4-19**] which showed a large, 2 to 3 cm ulcer with clot on the posterior wall of the antrum in the immediate prepyloric region.
The fundus was without clot and within normal limits.
The presence of coffee grounds indicated acid which made pernicious anemia an unlikely previous diagnosis.
Question of pernicious anemia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No history of tobacco or alcohol use.
In general, she was a well appearing, Caucasian female in no acute distress.
Chest exam revealed lung fields that were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
Chest x-ray on [**2142-4-20**] showed no CHF and no pneumonia.
However, there were dense nodules in the left middle lung zone and possible calcified pleural plaques at the left lung base.
The patient had several large episodes of melena before coming to [**Hospital1 18**] and continued to have them until [**2142-4-22**].
EGD at the outside hospital on [**2142-4-19**] showed no varices, but a clot in the fundus.
Repeat EGD at [**Hospital1 18**] showed a large, 2 to 3 cm ulcer with clot in the posterior wall of the antrum in the immediate prepyloric region.
Fundus was without clot and within normal limits.
The presence of coffee grounds indicated acid and so pernicious anemia was judged to be unlikely.
On transfer to the floor from the MICU patient did not have further episodes of melena, never complained of abdominal pain, never experienced lightheadedness or dizziness and never had any presyncopal or syncopal episodes.
The patient has a history of CAD, however, aspirin, beta blocker and digoxin were held on [**4-19**] in an attempt to render the upper GI bleed situation less complicated by medications.
Patient never complained of chest pain, shortness of breath or radiating pain.
EKG on [**4-19**] showed an axis at 120 degrees, left bundle branch block, ST depressions in 2, ST depressions in V5, ST elevations in V1 to V2 and left ventricular hypertrophy.
There were some episodes of tachycardia that were attributed to anemia.
Routine chest x-ray revealed a pulmonary nodule in the left middle lung field, but there was no evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
Patient has been notified of this incidental finding.
Acute renal failure was noted at the outside hospital and treated with hydration, given the elevated BUN and creatinine.
This finding was likely due to volume depletion secondary to acute GI bleed.
Although patient was on Celexa in the past for depression, she experienced no episodes of depression during her hospital course.
Coronary artery disease.
Acute renal failure.
FOLLOWUP:  The patient was advised to follow up with her primary care physician in the next two weeks to discuss her hospital course and management of her cardiac medication list.
Patient was advised that should she experience and further episodes of melena, dizziness, lightheadedness or orthostasis, she should call her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2227**].
