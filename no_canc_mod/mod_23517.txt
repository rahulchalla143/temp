She had elevated troponins noted in the ED (peaked at 4.15).
TTE showed moderate to severe TR and pulmonary HTN, and she is scheduled for a cath on Monday for further workup.
She had attributed this to muscle weakness with her polymyositis.
She continues to have a frontal headache, though it is better than on admission, and she has mild back pain over her tailbone.

Brief Hospital Course: # Intracranial hemorrhage: Prior to admission, patient had been complaining of worsening headaches for 2 -3 days accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
She initially presented to an OSH where a noncontrast CT scan of the head was obtained which showed a right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, a Right subdural hematoma, and a small Right subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Upon arrival in the emergency room she was evaluated and found to have slight proximal muscle weakness secondary to her polymyositis.
She also complained of numbness in both calves, thighs, and on her abdomen up to her mid chest.
The CTA showed that there was a stable appearance of her intracranial blood and that there were no aneurysms appreciated.
Her MRI showed stable appearance of her bleed and no underlying mass but motion artifact resulted in non-ideal study.
While in the ICU she exhibited periods of confusion and impulsiveness, which resolved.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed tricuspid and atrial regurgitation as well as severe pulmonary hypertension ([**2120-6-27**]).
# Polymyositis: On admission patient had elevated CK up to 6490, which continued to trend down throughout the hospital course to 1294.
She did not report flare of her polymositis and was not currently on steroid treatment.

When you got here, we got CT scan of your head which showed bleeding inside and around your brain.
- Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
- Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
- If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
