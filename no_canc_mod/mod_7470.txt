Admission Date:  [**2136-9-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-9-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-5-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis .
Hemodialysis .
CT T-spine, L-spine ([**9-19**]): IMPRESSION:  Unchanged osteomyelitis at T7-8 thoracic vertebra with retropulsed fragment at T7-8 that causes severe spinal stenosis and is unchanged.
The paraspinal abscess is also unchanged.
CT Chest ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in size in bilateral pleural effusions.
We do not know the significance of the negative measurements of the pleural fluid (?fat content) Interval progression of the osteomyelitis centered at the T7/T8 levels with increased destruction of the vertebral body of T8 involving posterior margin with spinal canal  and with apparent fragment extending into into spinal canal with bony fragments going to the spinal canal.
Spinal canal stenosis at the level of L4/L5, appears to be slightly more severe than the prior study secondary to increase in disc bulge.
It is probably causing compression of the cauda equina at this level.
Increased signal in the disc of L4/L5 is unchanged when compared to prior studies and is likely degenerative since there is no involvement of the endplates and is stable.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
No evidence of biliary ductal obstruction.
History of Present Illness: 64 female with h/o mental retardation, DM, renal failure on TIW HD, recent hospitalization with epidural abscess s/p laminectomy and drainage of T11-S1, I&D of foot, drainage of sphenoid sinues, who was readmitted from [**Hospital3 7**] with intermittent fevers and back pain.
She is unable to give a good history, but according to her caregiver and the staff at [**Name (NI) **], she has been complaining of increasing back pain for the past two days.
She has not had fevers in the past week, but since her last discharge ([**2136-9-1**]) and last week, she has been having intermittent fevers.
She has also been noted to be intermittently hallucinating and paranoid since her last admission.
She complains also of intermittent abdominal pain.
She got an abdominal / pelvic CT scan which showed worsening bone destruction at T7,8 retropulsing into the thoracic canal concerning for osteomyelitis.

Brief Hospital Course: Impression/Plan: 64 female with MMP, recently admitted with MSSA epidural abscess s/p drainage of paraspinal abscess and laminectomy of T12-L1, now presents with fever, tachycardia, and increasing back pain, concerning for improperly treated paraspinal abscess .
Her urine returned positive for enterobacter which was sensitive to cefepime.
MRI obtained on [**9-18**] showed worsening of osteomyelitis with new compression deformity of T7 causing mass effect on the spinal cord at this level.
Ortho recommended a CT of T/L spine to further evaluate extent of progression of osteo/abscess, which showed soft tissue mass at T7 c/w abscess, unchanged from prior CT. ID consulted and recommend CT guided aspiration and Cx of T7 paraspinal abscess to determine if she still needs IV Nafcillin.
Fever: Concerning for untreated paraspinal abscess given that the patient was on IV Nafcillin for an extended course.
Radiology uncomfortable with performing CT guided aspiration of abscess given the level.
There was a consensus that the patient should not be put through any further invasive procedures (such as an open aspiration) to further speciate source of abscess.
She did get a thoracentesis with the anticipation that her pleural effusions were communicating with her abscess, but the pleural fluid was transudative in nature and did not subsequently grow out any bacteria.
She was continued on Vancomycin secondary to fevers on Nafcillin, and this was dosed for a level of 15-20.
A subsequent UA showed Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, and she was started on Linezolid on [**9-25**].
Renal failure: Secondary to ATN from sepsis in [**8-26**].
She received hemodialysis with her contrast studies.
She did have decreased UOP after a contrast CT which resolved.
Diarrhea:  The patient has persistent diarrhea, and her C diff negative times 3 Flagyl was discontinued with third negative result.
Abdominal pain: During prior hospitalization imaging revealed no etiology.
Likely chronic in nature.
Did not have any further problems with abdominal pain during her hospitalization.
She was not anticoagulated due to recent SDH.
DM2: She was maintained on an RISS with good glucose control as well as a diabetic diet.
Anemia: Appears to be anemia of inflammation / ACD.
Regular, renal, diabetic diet.
If develops fever, chills, low blood pressure, or any other symptoms, please contact the Infectious Disease specialist or proceed to the nearest ER.
