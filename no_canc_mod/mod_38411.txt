He went to his friend's house where he had a witnessed arrest with associated seizure like activity.
Pt was also given narcan and became combative.
Labs were notable for hyperkalemia of 6.5, troponin of 0.06.
In ED EKG showed STE in inferior leads, U/S showed paradoxical septal wall motion and overall hypokinesis, worsened by dopamine.
Sclera anicteric.
PERRL, OP with poor dentition and numerous loose teeth NECK: Supple, JVP not elevated CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RRR, heart sounds distant, difficult to hear any MRG LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Lungs with course sounds throughout but no crackles.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
DISCHARGE EXAM Vitals - Tm/Tc: 100.0/98.8 HR: 81 (81-98) RR: 18 BP: 104/66 (104-126/63-81) 02 sat: 91% RA  (91-98%RA) Weight: 91.8 kg GENERAL: Well developed, well nourished male in no acute distress CHEST: CTAB, no wheezes, no rales, no rhonchi CV: S1 S2, Normal in quality and intensity, RRR, no murmurs rubs or gallops ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended, BS normoactive.
EXT: wwp, no edema.
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had minor diffuse disease.
The LCX had a tubular proximal lesion of abotu 80% with possible thrombosis.
The RCA had a chronic occlusion mid-vessel with collaterals filling from the left coronary system.
Limited resting hemodyanmics revealed elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with PASP of 54mmHG and mean PCWP of 35mmHg.
Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with an estimated LV ejection fraction of less than 30%.
There was also [**3-6**]+ Mitral regurgitation.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis and anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis (LVEF approximately 35 percent).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2122-9-30**] CXR: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema predominantly in the right upper lung is new.
The large right lower lobe consolidation most likely aspiration pneumonia is stable, now accompanied by at least a small if not larger right pleural effusion.
No left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
[**2122-10-1**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
No prevertebral soft tissue edema or hematoma is seen.
Multiple small bilateral cervical lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria.
There is at least a moderate right pleural effusion.
Secondary interlobular septal thickening seen in the lung apices are consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
The patient is status post ORIF of a an old distal left fibular fracture, with lateral plate and interlocking screws.
Hardware is intact, in proper position and without signs of complication.
An old fracture is also noted of the distal tibia, with narrowing and large osteophytosis of the tibiotalar joint.
An ankle joint effusion and soft tissue swelling are seen.
No new fracture or dislocation is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 yo M with a reported hx of alcoholism but no know cardiac history admitted from osh with vfib arrest and STEMI, already intubated for airway protection.
# V-fib arrest: It is unclear how long pt was down prior to CPR initiation and shock, but on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was moving all extremities and responsive, thus cooling protocol was not initiated.
Etiology of arrest is most likely secondary to ischemia, given pt also presented with STEMI and cath lab revealed large circ lesion, as described below.
#Cardiogenic shock: Pt has no known history of CHF, but cath lab shows evidence of severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of 30% with global hypokinesis.
Also elevated CO (consistent with MR) and elevated left sided filling pressures.
There is no evidence of right sided strain and no evidence of tamponade.
Only unexplained factor is elevated mixed venous sats, which would raise concern for sepsis and a RLL opacity was shown on CXR, concerning for pneumonia (HAP v. aspiration).
Pt initially required IABP and pressor support to maintain adequate perfusion MAPs but as his pneumonia was being treated, he slowly recovered his vascular resistance and was weaned off the balloon pump and pressor support.
#RLL pneumonia: Pt had a WBC up to 20.2 with a left shift and RLL pneumonia became apparent on chest x-ray from [**9-28**] and pt was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl but as his sputum culture grew MSSA, he was only continued on cefepime and then PO cefpodoxime for a total 8 day course of antibiotics.
Pt does not have know history of cirrhosis or alc hep.
He had a mild alcoholic transaminitis on admission (but this also could be explained by acute ischemia), but his liver's synthetic function was normal.

Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and a fatal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation that required a shock.
You will need to take new medicines to help your heart recover and prevent another heart attack in the future.
Your heart is weaker after the heart attack and you will need to monitor yourself for fluid buildup at home.
Weigh yourself every morning before breakfast, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Your memory is only slightly impaired during the evaluation by occupational therapy.
You can call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91658**] if you notice that you are having any trouble with your memory or thinking.
START taking metoprolol to prevent another heart attack 3.
