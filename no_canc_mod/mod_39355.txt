Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 30% stenosis at the origin and a tubular 45% lesion after the large D2.
The D2 itself had a 30% stenosis at the origin.
The LCx had a tiny OM1, a modest caliber OM2 with diffuse plaquing distally, and a patent (large) OM3 and OM4.
The RCA was a tortuous lesion in its middle aspect with a large RPDA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed low-normal systemic arterial pressures, with a central aortic pressure of 104/58, mean 77 mmHg.
Bibasilar pulmonary consolidations, which likely include an atelectatic component, but superimposed aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
Bilateral loculated pleural effusions with surrounding hyperdense pleural thickening and calcification.
Ascending aortic aneurysmal dilation measuring up to 4.8 cm.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, renal masses, or nephrolithiasis bilaterally.
Mildly elevated RI up to 0.85 are noted, however there is no consistent evidence of tardus parvus to suggest renal artery stenosis.
[**2104-4-19**] Abdominal Ultrasound: There is a 3 x 2.8 cm hypoechoic lesion in the posterior left lobe of the liver, which is incompletely evaluated and of indeterminate etiology.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones.
No ascites is detected.
[**2104-4-21**] Intraop TEE: Pre-CPB: There is a wire from the ICD/Pacer which is associated with a great deal of thickened material and is possibly adherent to the tricuspid valve.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
with mild inferior hypokinesis.
There is mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a .8 x .8 cm mass on the prosthetic valve at the commissure of the left and right leaflets, though it seems mainly attached to the left.
The aortic root, especially off the left cusp, has an abnormal echogenicity and is likely the residual material of an abscess.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an aortic homograft in place with no AI, no leak and a residual peak gradient of 6 mmHg.
Biventricular systolic fxn is unchanged.
[**2104-4-22**] Head CT Scan: There is an approximately 1.9 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe with surrounding edema.
There is no significant mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no intraventricular extension.
There is no uncal or transtentorial herniation.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is a small calcification in the left parietal lobe that either represents a granuloma or vascular calcification.
No evidence of large acute vascular territorial infarction.
No fractures identified.
Slightly prominent soft tissues over the left parietal lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital6 16029**] with shortness of breath and low grade fever, blood cultures positive for coagulase negative staphylcoccus, and an aortic valve vegetation with root involvement.
The patient developed seizures in the immediate post-op period when sedation was weaned.
Head CT revealed left occipital hemorrhage concerning for underlying mycotic aneurysm.
Angio was deferred in the setting of acute renal failure- with hope for recovery.
Renal followed the patient as he had a baseline renal insufficiency.
GI was consulted on [**4-27**] for anemia and guaiac positive stool.
The patient was weaned and extubated on [**4-25**], however, required re-intubation on [**4-28**] for respiratory distress.
The evening of [**5-1**] the patient had new fever and hypotension concerning for new infection and CT showed large anterior pleural collection.
He was broadened to Vanco/Meropenem/Rifampin and once abscess cultures were negative, meropenem was stopped on [**5-5**].
He decompensated on [**5-9**] with respiratory distress, vomiting and diarrhea.
He spiked a fever and was started on empiric treatment for C Diff.
CT Torso showed bilateral pleural effusions and continued, but smaller anterior mediastinal collection.
On [**5-13**] HD line was placed and had continued fever and started vasopressors.
TEE on [**5-15**] did not reveal any valvular vegetation, abscess or pericardial effusion.
This was tapped and did not reveal infection or crystal process.
The patient struggled with tube feed intolerance with suspected aspirations.
He developed hypothermia, requiring active warming.
Fluconazole was added for concern of fungal infection.
Ventilator requirements increased.
This revealed a large left thalamic hemorrhage with extension into the intraventricular system with significant hydrocephalus.
He did not respond to any aspect of neurological exam including cough, gag, corneal reflex or noxious stimuli.
