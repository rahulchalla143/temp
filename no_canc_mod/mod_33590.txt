No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 12 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations which could be compressive atelectasis in the setting of effusions.
Superimposed infection is not excluded.
Mediastinal adenopathy, unchanged since the prior study.
Coronary artery disease, evidence of pulmonary hypertension, significant mitral annular calcifications are all unchanged.
Unchanged left hepatic lobe lesion could represent a cyst or a hemangioma.
Chest configuration indicates substantial COPD.
Moderate right pleural effusion unchanged since [**10-19**].
Left lower lobe opacification is probably atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Pulmonary vascular congestion is definitely present, and there may be mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo F with Hx of COPD with multiple past intubations, now presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension concerning for sepsis in the setting of several possible sources of infection.
# Respiratory failure - The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED intubated and sedated.
CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema versus interstitial infectious process.
CTA of the chest showed no pericardial effusion, unchanged mediastinal adenopathy, no PE, dilated main PA, normal aorta, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and moderate pulmonary edema.
Patient has been exposed to hospital pathogens with recent hospital admission for cellulitis.
On [**10-13**] pt was extubated again , however she quickly became hypertensive and tachypneic and required re-intubation.
Pt tolerated the procedure well with no complications other than residual pain at the site.
On [**10-17**], she had an episode of tachypnea and fever and CXR showed possible infiltrate.
She also had increased WBC and fever, she was started on empiric therapy for Ventilator-associated on [**10-18**] with vanco/zosyn for a planned 8 day course to finish on [**2138-10-25**].
# Hypotension/Shock: Unclear if septic etiology, or secondary to combination of medication administration and positive pressure ventilation.
However, given RLE cellulitis as a known source of infection and significant hypoxia pt was treated empirically for sepsis.
Hypotension resolved.
However, on [**10-18**], her worsening Tv, WBC and fevers led to empiric VAP coverage with Vanc-Zosyn for an 8 day course, to end on [**2138-10-25**].
# Anxiety - The patient frequently became very anxious, becoming hypertensive to the 200s/100s and tachcardic to the 120s.
EKG was checked and showed no QT prolongation.
# SVT - The patient had episodes of tachycardia, her longest being a run of approximately 30 seconds, which reached a peak of 200 beats per second before spontaneously breaking.
The SVT was thought to be multifocal atrial tachycardia and her beta blocker can be titrated up to suppress the ectopic atrial activity as tolerated.
# Adrenal Mass - Per final CTA read, patient needs follow up CT or MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] known adrenal mass (not needed in ICU).
# Transaminitis - This was thought to be secondary to hypotension and hypoperfusion of his liver.
# Guaiac pos, slow Hct decline - The patient's Hct remained stable throughout admission, but she needs a colonoscopy as an outpatient.

You were admitted with acute respiratory failure, and needed to be intubated to help you breathe.
Your respiratory failure was thought to be caused by a flare of your COPD as well as a possible infection.
We treated you with antibiotics that treated possible lung infections as well as the cellulitis of your right leg.
We tried to remove the breathing tube twice, however each time you had progressive difficulty breathing so we had to replace the breathing tubes.
You also became anxious, especially at night.
