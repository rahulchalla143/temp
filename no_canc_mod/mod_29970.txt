Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+   Pertinent Results: [**2165-3-18**] 07:05PM   WBC-9.0 RBC-4.79 HGB-14.6 HCT-44.6 MCV-93 MCH-30.4 MCHC-32.7 RDW-13.8 [**2165-3-18**] 07:05PM   NEUTS-68.0 LYMPHS-25.0 MONOS-3.1 EOS-2.4 BASOS-1.4 [**2165-3-18**] 07:05PM   PLT COUNT-298 [**2165-3-18**] 07:05PM   GLUCOSE-132* UREA N-24* CREAT-1.3* SODIUM-141 POTASSIUM-4.4 CHLORIDE-105 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-14 [**2165-3-18**] 07:05PM   CALCIUM-9.2 PHOSPHATE-3.9 MAGNESIUM-2.4 [**2165-3-18**] 07:05PM   PT-14.9* INR(PT)-1.3*  CT HEAD: There is a coil mass noted in the expected location of the basilar tip.
There is hypodensity noted in the left putamen and internal capsule, which could be related to age-indeterminate ischemia.
No acute hemorrhage is seen within limits of this examination.
There is intracranial vascular calcification of the cavernous carotid arteries.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:  No acute abnormalities.
Mild sequela of prior ischemia in the left internal capsule.
Evaluation of the lung windows demonstrates left apical scarring.
Additionally, there appear to be mild nodularities in the left lung posteriorly for which recommend correlation with dedicated CT of the chest.
There are multiple mediastinal lymph nodes noted, which appear to be slightly prominent in size.
There is apparent nonvisualization of the right subclavian artery beyond the takeoff of the cervical and costocervical trunks.
There is extensive calcification of the aortic arch.
There is atheromatous plaquing of the aortic arch.
There is a calcified plaque at the origin of the right ICA, as well as approximately 2 cm beyond the origin.
There is approximately 40% stenosis on the right.
There is also large calcified plaque in the left ICA at the origin with approximately 50% stenosis.
Evaluation of the right vertebral artery demonstrates calcified plaque at the junction of the V1 and V2 segments which cause mild stenosis.
There is some calcified plaque in the left V2 segment of the vertebral artery which causes mild stenosis.
Limited views through the brain demonstrate a probable coil mass at the basilar tip.
This examination does not assess for residual aneurysm at the basilar tip.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral ICA origin stenosis as above  Possible stenosis of the right subclavian artery.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 66 yo F with prior CVA, PVD, a fib and prior PE admitted with likely symptomatic carotid stenosis who underwent right carotid artery stenting.
# Symptomatic carotid stenosis.
# Loose stools.
No loose BMs during admission .
# Black stools.
Chronic intermittent complaint.
# Rhythm.
# Anxiety: Continued on outpatient regimen but patient reports still suffering from panic attacks.
# Lung nodules: Noted to have lung nodularities on CTA neck.
Disp:*6 syringes* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Bilateral carotid artery stenosis s/p stenting of right carotid bulb Secondary: Hypertension COPD atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Good, vital signs stable, neurological exam unchanged from baseline   Discharge Instructions: You had a stent placed to your right carotid artery.
The procedure was without complications.
Please contact your doctor or return to the emergency room if you develop any worrisome symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, bleeding, passing out, etc.
Have your coumadin level (INR) checked on Monday or Tuesday the latest.
