here had unimpressive LP with only high protien with traumatic tap.
given history of back pain (acute on chornic), some urinary incontince and history of IVDU in distant past pt underwent mri here which revealed ?
soft tissue density at t9-sacrum without contrast.
repeat mri revealed no epidural abcess, soft tissue mass outside her spinal canal.
no signs of hemolysis, pcp/pna so likley some kind of lymphoma (possibly the soft tissue mass seen on mri).
History of seizure disorder as a child due to head trauma.

Was on ceftriaxone 2 gm IV 12 then 1 gm IV 12 and then discontinued on [**2106-10-6**] secondary to no clear source of infection and mental status now at baseline.
It was felt that her AMS was probably secondary to doxepin and its associated cholingeric effects.
HIGH LDH, HIGH CK, T9 MASS: - With no evidence of hemolysis, liver enzymes elevated, but trended down quickly.
- Concern that LDH may be related to mass at T9, representing a lymphoma - CT torso on [**2106-10-7**] showed no evidence of lymphoma or [**Doctor First Name **] - Neurosurgery was consulted, requested gallium scan to better assess mass before considering biopsy - will get injection on Friday, [**10-8**] and scan (3 days total) beginning Monday as an outpatient.
- Other concern for myositis with elevated CKs, rheum was consulted, felt not an inflammatory myositis was less likely but possibly a steroid myopathy, will f/u with rheumatology as an outpatient.
PERSISTENT FEVERS - h/o spiking temps but has been afebrile since antibiotics d/c'd, concerned mass at T9 is infectious, check blood cultures.

Pain was well controlled on this regimen.
Anemia - Her anemia remained stable throughout the course and was felt to be due to chronic disease/inflammation and thus not amenable to Fe-therapy.
Discharge Instructions: Please return to the ER or call your primary physician if you experience any fevers/chills/rigors or night sweats, increased or new weakness, or increased/new pain.
