Admission Date:  [**2142-11-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-11-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-6-14**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female with short gut syndrome, status post ileal colectomy for volvulus in [**2120**] who is chronically TPN dependent and has TPN-induced liver failure.
She denied fevers and chills but did complain of abdominal pain as well as nausea and vomiting on the day of admission.
The patient was also confused and lethargic with much change from her baseline.
Multiple sclerosis which has presented with recurrent optic neuritis.
Degenerative joint disease.
Progressive liver failure.
At the time of admission, the patient was waiting to receive liver and small bowel transplant.
Anemia with a normal bone marrow biopsy.
Multiple line infections and episodes of sepsis.
ALLERGIC:  The patient is allergic to paper tape, Betadine, and also reports penicillin causes her GI upset.
HEENT:  Remarkable for a supple neck, marked conjunctival and scleral icterus and blindness.
The lungs had scattered bibasilar crackles but no dullness to percussion.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
She did have a left ventricular lift.
Abdomen: Minimal bowel sounds, firm, moderate to severe tenderness to palpation everywhere but worse in the lower quadrants.
Given the patient's guarding, it was difficult to assess for hepatosplenomegaly.
The patient had multiple healed surgical scars.
The patient had a Porta-Cath in her chest that was nontender with no expressible pus.
The extremities were remarkable for bilateral pitting edema in her lower extremities.
The patient's mental status was noted to be oriented times three but slow with responses.
The patient's CT, as read here, was notable for no ductal dilatation, no evidence of perforation, only for ascites.
The patient's pain initially resolved and the patient was much improved with stable blood pressures and tolerating p.o.
The patient had difficulty with potassium homeostasis on the floor and a rising white blood cell count; however, minimal abdominal pain and only low-grade temperatures.
Given the increasing white blood cell count, the patient underwent repeat abdominal CT which showed a large pancreatic pseudocyst.
The patient remained afebrile but did have blood cultures drawn from her Porta-Cath turn positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus 48 hours after they were drawn.
Gram stain from the drainage of the pseudocyst was negative for organisms.
After return from the procedure, the patient markedly became hypotensive to the 80s and had confusion.
She was bolused with 2 liters normal saline and had some improvement; however, the patient was febrile to 100.3 and given her hypotension and febrile state, she was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The question of removing the patient's Porta-Cath was discussed with Surgery and it was felt that the patient had not had any positive blood cultures since the initiation of vancomycin; therefore, Staphylococcus epidermidis was unlikely to account for this patient's hypotensive state.
It was unclear what the source of her bleeding was.
The patient had a diagnostic paracentesis due to concern of bleeding into her peritoneum secondary to the pseudocyst drainage; however, this revealed no white blood cells, minimal red blood cells, and no organisms.
Unfortunately, the patient also developed increasing coagulopathy and her BUN and creatinine began to rise.
Given the increase in belly pain, Surgery was consulted and declined to do any intervention given the high mortality associated with taking this patient to the OR.
However, it was decided after discussion with the patient's family and the attending that this patient would be DNR/DNI with no CPR indicated.
The patient continued to deteriorate and complained of extreme pain.
