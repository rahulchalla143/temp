Mechanical thrombectomy of the posterior tibial artery.
Exploration and balloon thrombectomy of the distal posterior tibial artery.
History of Present Illness: Pt is a 67M with a h/o PVD s/p s/p Aorto-Bifiem bypass, bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass who was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiology service.
He presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital [**2104-5-23**] wit complaints of L foot pain and numbness.
He was cardioverted, and post cardioversion he was noted to have a new RBBB and ST elevations.
He was taken emergently to the cath lab which showed 3VD including a total RCA occlusion and 90% LAD occlusion.
No intervention was done; and he was transfered here.
He has been on a heparin gtt, but no recent interventions have been performed on the leg.
Coronary Artery Disease, last MI [**2073**], no interventions 3.
Peripheral Vascular Disease, s/p aorto [**Hospital1 **]-fem bypass, s/p bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass (all @ [**Hospital6 **]- [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 27785**]).

There may be a small left pleural effusion.
Right lung shows mild pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
The abdominal aorta had previous aorto-bifem bypass with complete occlusion of the left limb of the graft.
The fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] fills the native popliteal but with very slow flow and limited filling.
There was evidence of extensive, layered thrombus in the distal native popliteal and in the TPT extending into the PT.
The PT is the only vessel runoff to the foot and had extremely sluggish flow noted.
No evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
Mildly elevated resistive indices bilaterally, of indeterminant etiology.
The liver demonstrates heterogeneous echotexture with focal areas of increased echogenicity.
This appearance is compatible with fatty liver; however, other liver disease and more advanced liver disease including cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Interval improvement in interstitial edema with persistent mild pulmonary edema.
Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly.
Neuro: The patient received a fentanyl drip initally with good effect and adequate pain control.
Post operatively, the patient was intermittently confused and agitated; Haldol and other sedatives were given.
Her cardiac enzymes were cycled, revealing an acute MI on POD [**2-10**].
On POD [**9-17**], the patient had 2 episodes of asystole with spontaneous recovery.
On [**6-8**], the patient had episodic bradycardia to the 40's.
Post operatively, the nephrology team was consulted for recommendations for acute renal failure; the creatinine was 1.6.
It was suspected that the renal insufficiency was secondary to rhabdomyolysis.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound care was also consulted for evaluation and treatment.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
STEMI s/p cardiac catherization @ outside hospital 2.
Respiratory failure 5.
