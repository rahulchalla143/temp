Cardiovascular is regular, rate, and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
There is an A-V fistula in the right upper extremity.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for problems with junctional tachycardia as well as hematuria and bladder clotting.
Multiple Foley attempts were made, ultimately Urology was consulted and placed a 24 French [**Doctor Last Name **]-way coude catheter for continuous bladder irrigation.
After this, the patient had no more difficulty with bladder clotting.
They felt his junctional tachycardia was likely secondary to his potassium of 6.7, which dropped to 5.5 after dialysis.
