was unaware of her deficits, and insisted she just needed to be helped up.
Brain CTA and perfusion was performed and showed a R MCA infarct and R MCA clot and no flow in distal L-ICA.
Angiography was peformed and IAtPA was administered to distal ICA and R MCA (12:15-12:45) with partial recanalization of the L-ICA siphon.
Past Medical History: - TIA, [**2125**], per Dr.[**Name (NI) 16937**] [**5-23**] note: On a recent trip to [**Country **] she suddenly had blurred vision and slurred speech.
She went to see a neurologist in [**Country **] and her symptoms improved over forty-eight hours.
However, a MRI showed a right subcortical paraventricular infarct.
- breast cancer (DCIS), s/p resection [**10-25**] (no XRT or chemo)  Social History: Lives with husband.
[**1-22**] beats of clonus on L, none on R.  Toes upgoing bilaterally.
Various consistencies of barium were administered and the swallowing was evaluated for aspiration or abnormalities in the phases of bolus formation and swallowing.
There is no evidence of aspiration or penetration.
Patient is status post acute embolic stroke of the right middle cerebral artery with developing right caudate, basal ganglia, and right temporal lobe edema.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-10-15**] QTc interval is slightly shorter.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild [1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic function.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
No definite cardiac source of embolism identified.
CTA HEAD & NECK W&W/O C & RECONS, CT BRAIN PERFUSION: Acute embolic stroke at the right internal carotid artery-middle cerebral artery junction.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage and minimal findings on non-contrast CT in terms of ischemia.
CT perfusion imaging demonstrates a right middle cerebral artery territory infarct.
No perfusion demonstrated within the right M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery.
CATH CAROTIDS & BRAIN: Long segment narrowing in the cervical internal carotid artery on the right as well as total occlusion in the distal cavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery.
After intra-arterial administration of tPA, there was slight improvement in the carotid siphon as well as minimal opacification of distal MCA branches.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: Status post acute embolic stroke at the right middle cerebral artery with interval development of a small paranchymal hemorrhage measuring 7 mm and no mass effect.
Lungs are clear except for minor areas of discoid atelectasis at the lung bases.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old with previous stroke (right subcortical), hypertension, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute onset left facial droop, left arm greater than leg weakness and left-sided neglect.
Neuro: Found to have right middle cerebral artery clot and right middle cerebral artery inferior division infarct.
Decreased density at R MCA territory especially at inferior division.
CTA showed narrow R ICA and cut off at R M1.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
A follow-up head CT with anterior choroidal and deep subcortical right MCA infarct, mainly inferior division.
Patient was placed on IV heparin and coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
Cards:  Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes negative x3.
Patient went into atrial fibrillation so she was started on anti-coagulation, heparin gtt as bridge to coumadin.
Please note that concurrent use of warfarin with levofloxacin will cause decreased metabolism of warfarin and thus elevated INR values.
UA was dirty so initially started Ciprofloxacin which was switched to Levofloxacin and Flagyl on [**5-15**] due to concern for pneumonia and chest x-ray with left basilar opacity on our read.
Urine culture with pan sensitive Proteus and Enterococcus sensitive to Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
RHEUM:  Patient developed erythema and pain in her right MCP joint thought was considered a gout flare given her history of gout.
Other:  PT/OT consulted and recommended acute rehab.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Acetaminophen 160 mg/5 mL Solution [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Six [**Age over 90 1230**]y (650) mg PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Please note that concurrent use of warfarin with levofloxacin will cause decreased metabolism of warfarin and thus elevated INR values.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Right middle cerebral artery stroke Atrial fibrillation Pansensitive Proteus urinary tract infection Left lower lobe pneumonia Right metacarpophalangeal gout flare  Secondary diagnosis: History of transient ischemic attack Status post hysterectomy Status post angioplasty and stent Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension Breast cancer (DCIS) status post resection   Discharge Condition: Fluctuating alertness but easily arousible.
Speech fluent with left side neglect.
You will need to follow-up with a stroke neurologist.
Please note that concurrent use of warfarin with levofloxacin will cause decreased metabolism of warfarin and thus elevated INR values.
If you have any questions or concerns, please call your primary care physician.
