Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after a motorcycle crash where you sustained a left scapula (shoulder) fracture and rib fractures.
You were also treated for a suspected pneumonia related to your rib fractures.
*  Your accident caused rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
