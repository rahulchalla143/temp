The abnormality suspected on CT in the right frontal lobe demonstrates hyperintensity both on diffusion and ADC map which is indicative of edema which could be related to contusion.
A small area of artifact in the left frontal lobe along the sulci is secondary to pneumocephalus.
Again noted is a small right-sided subdural collection with blood products measuring approximately 10 mm.
There is no midline shift seen.

Soft tissue edema is seen in parietal scalp region.
The abnormality seen on CT of [**2147-6-24**] in the right frontal lobe demonstrates no evidence of slow diffusion and corresponds to a hemorrhagic contusion.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with assault and intracranial injury, suggestion of ligamentous injury on CT, for further evaluation.
FINDINGS: At the craniocervical junction, no abnormal signal is identified or malalignment seen on the sagittal or axial images.
From C2-3 to C4-5, no significant abnormalities are seen.
There is mild widening of the facet joint seen on the right side with fluid within the facet joint.
However, there is no evidence of abnormal signal seen in the adjacent facets.
On the CT images at this level, mild irregularity of the articular surface and mild osteophyte formation is seen indicative of degenerative change.
No definite fracture is seen on CT in this location.
At C6-7, a small left-sided perineural cyst visualized within the neural foramen.
From C6-7 to T3-4, no evidence of disc bulge or herniation seen.
The ligamentous structures appear intact and there is no evidence of disruption of the anterior or posterior longitudinal ligaments or ligamentum flavum.
Subtle increased signal between the spinous processes of C4 and C5 could be due to a venous structure.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of ligamentous disruption or evidence of fracture identified.
Mild facet joint widening and fluid on the right side at C5-6 appears to be secondary to degenerative change with mild anterolisthesis of C5 over C6 and disc bulging.
No evidence of ligamentous disruption seen or spinal cord compression identified.
