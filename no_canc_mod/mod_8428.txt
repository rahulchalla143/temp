He was initially taken to [**Location (un) 620**], where CTA showed massive bilateral PEs.
He was also found to be in A. fib with RVR which resolved with oxygen, but no nodal agents.

Reports he is up to date on colonoscopy and PSA and carries no cancer diagnosis.
Patient reports he was highly mobile over the summer, but over the past 2-3 months has been primarily bedbound due to sciatica symptoms and deconditioning after recent stroke.
He got a CXR which showed no acute process.
Past Medical History: Left internal capsule lacunar infarct [**2180**] Hemmoragic stroke [**2185**] Hypertension Lumbar disc disease Hypercholesterolemia BPH- s/p TURP .
Currently with limited activity, bedbound secondary to sciatica and recent stroke, but was very active until 4 months ago.
No carotid bruits.
No murmurs heard.
No HSM Ext: No c/c.

[**10-17**] LENIS: IMPRESSION: Acute deep venous thrombosis within the left distal superficial femoral vein and extending into the popliteal and posterior tibial veins as described.
No deep venous thrombosis of the right lower extremity.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function.
Findings consistent with pulmonary emboli.
No ASD or PFO identified.
[**10-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with frequent premature beats, probably atrial premature beats with aberrant conduction.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-8-21**] rhythm is similar, T wave inversions in leads V1-V3 are now present.
[**10-18**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: No evidence of recent hemorrhage.
No fracture identified.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 31611**] is a 75 year old male with recent hemorrhagic stroke, HTN, BPH, HL, admitted for bilateral PE and LLE DVT.
Patient found to have bilateral central PEs and LLE DVT.
IVC filter placed and anticoagulation with heparin initiated in spite of recent hemorrhagic stroke (2 months ago) after discussion with neurology who recommended anticoagulation.
Echo showed evidence of RV strain and he was found to have elevated BNP on admission.
Etiology of PE likely secondary to prolonged immobility; no history of malignancy or prior clots.
History of hemorrhagic and ischemic CVA with minimal residual deficits.
Head CT on admission showed no acute event.
Left foot/toe pain: Pt c/o pain over dorsum of left foot/toes.
He did not have any focal tenderness or erythema.
XR only showed soft tissue swelling and no fracture.
He had edema in left foot, likely [**1-14**] DVT.
He was given 0.5 tab Vicodin with good effect as needed for toe pain in hospital which was improved at time of discharge.
Left lower extremity DVT Secondary Diagnosis 1.
Left internal capsule lacunar infarct [**2180**] 2.
HTN 4.
Lumbar disc disease 5.
Hypercholesterolemia 6.
BPH s/p TURP   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, oxygenating mid 90s on room air   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and low oxygen saturations.
You were found to have blood clots in your lungs and one in your left leg which were causing these symptoms.
Please return to the ER or call your primary care physician if you develop any chest pain, shortness of breath, leg swelling, changes in your vision or speech, numbness, weakness, if you notice any blood in your stools or if you have any falls or any other concerning symptoms.
