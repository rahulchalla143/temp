Admission Date:  [**2158-12-25**]       Discharge Date: [**2158-12-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-8-15**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL IC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44-year-old male with history of aortic valve replacement secondary to endocarditis, culture negative with aortic root abscess status post AV and aortic root replacement with homograft and reconstruction of coronary arteries in [**2157-12-30**] complicated by a LV abscess who presented to the emergency room on [**2158-9-24**] with complaint of fever, night sweats and cough for one month.
In addition, patient noted increased shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**] for two weeks and positional left chest discomfort for one week.
Admitted to rule out endocarditis.
Admission chest x-ray showed an increased cardiomegaly and EKG with new left axis deviation.
Chest CT Scan showed multiple ill defined nodules throughout both lungs, small left pleural effusion and 1.6 times 2.2 cm low attenuation lesion in the right hepatic lobe and evidence of prior infarcts in the left and right kidney.
General:  Pleasant male in mild distress.
Anicteric sclerae.
Neck is supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs: Crackles at the left base, otherwise clear.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, IV/VI diastolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, II/VI systolic murmur at the apex plus friction rub.
Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, mild left upper quadrant tenderness, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema, no petechiae.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was referred for bronchoscopy to evaluate right lower lobe lesion versus septic emboli.
Bronchoscopy on [**9-28**] revealed no intrabronchial lesions.
Following bronch, patient had an episode of respiratory distress with decreased oxygen saturation to 70% and was intubated for a anoxic respiratory arrest and transferred to the MICU.
Etiology of the respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to worsening AI and pulmonary edema.
TEE on [**9-27**] revealed 4+ AR, 2+ MR, dilated LV cavity, PA systolic hypertension and large anterior and posterior echo-free space possibly representing a paravalvular abscess.
Patient was maintained on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover for possible bacterial endocarditis.
PE complicated by new onset atrial fibrillation which spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm.
MICU course complicated by intermittent hypertension requiring Nitroglycerin.
Also complicated by pancreatitis requiring placement of post pyloric GJ tube.
Pancreatitis thought to be drug related and acute renal failure thought to be ATN secondary to prerenal azotemia due to AI.
From a respiratory standpoint, the patient remained persistently hypoxic with increased fio2 requirement thought secondary to ARDS versus congestive heart failure.
On [**10-27**], the patient was started on Dopamine for increased renal profusion, but subsequently urine output decreased and patient underwent hemodialysis for volume overload secondary to failed diuresis.
On [**11-1**], patient went to the OR for redo of homograft root replacement coronary artery bypass graft times two, SVG to the distal RCA and SVG to the LAD and a debridement of the mitral valve.
Patient required intraoperative CVVH for massive fluid overload.
Surgeon unable to close chest secondary to massive edema.
Patient received multiple blood products for bleeding and coagulopathy and received CVVH for total volume overload.
The patient developed funguria and was treated with amphobladder washings for five days.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed gallbladder sludge, but no evidence of cholecystitis given profound leukocytosis and evidence of bowel wall thickening seen on CT Scan.
The patient recovered renal function with increased urine output and CVVH was discontinued on [**2158-11-14**].
Neuro was consulted for an observed fascial twitching with a question of seizure activity.
The patient was started on Tegretol which was subsequently discontinued secondary to increased LFTs.
Bronch revealed heavy secretions and clotted blood consistent with tracheobronchitis.
In addition, the patient developed oral lesions found to be HSV1 and was treated with a 14 day course of Acyclovir.
On [**11-18**], Ophthalmology was consulted and found bilateral retinal hemorrhages and findings consistent with infective endocarditis with dissemination.
EGD showed a grade IV esophagitis, likely ischemic, with oozing in posterior pharynx.
CT Scan of the chest was obtained which revealed that esophagitis was not full thickness, no stranding or evidence of pneumomediastinum.
Large left pleural effusion was seen.
Repeat echo showed resolution of AR, ejection fraction greater than 55%, 4+ MR which was increased from 2+ previous echo, but no evidence of endocarditis.
Neurology was reconsulted for persistent fascial twitching and EEG showed no seizure activity.
On [**11-10**], the patient had a head which revealed right mastoid air cell opacification.
On [**2158-12-4**], patient had a MR of the head to rule out a new lesion which showed several small tiny foci, scattered diffusion abnormality involving the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] white junction of the cerebral hemispheres most likely consistent with small embolic subacute infarcts.
No major cortical infarct was demonstrated.
Also showed pan sinus disease, fluid retention within both mastoid sinuses.
On [**9-9**], the patient became hypotensive with increased heart rate and unclear [**Name2 (NI) 1440**] sounds.
Patient was taken urgently to the Operating Room for a thoracotomy and exploration of traumatic bleeding.
An area of discreet heavy bleeding was seen after clot removed.
Surgicel with Thrombin treated the bleeding with good control.
Repeat CT Scan of chest to evaluate effusions showed interval increase in opacification within the left upper lobe which may represent an aspiration or infection.
Bilateral pleural effusions showed some loculation within the right upper lobe, but slight interval decrease in the left sided pleural effusion.
The patient had repeated intermittent temperature elevations.
Infectious Disease recommended loculated fluid in the right hemithorax.
Repeat CT Scan of the chest on [**12-20**] showed an interval decrease in the size of the small bilateral pleural effusions with a small amount of loculated fluid at the bases which was too small to tap.
Area of consolidation seen in the posterior bilateral lower lobe concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.
Patient had evidence of pancreatitis based on elevated lipase, alkaline phosphatase and amylase.
Patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed no signs of cholecystitis.
Patient's belly remained nontender, thought to be secondary to chemical pancreatitis.
Ophthalmology reevaluated the patient and noted stable exam and embolic lesions for past several months.
Patient, however had repeat episodes of diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea which seemed responsive to Klonopin, Ativan and intermittently Haldol.
