CT abd/pelvis with contrast: No acute intraabdominal process with normal kidneys, appendix, gallbladder and pancreas .
EKG:  Compared to report of EKG (no image avail) from [**9-/2170**], sm inferior q waves and nonspecific T wave changes in V1-V3.
Unclear significance of diffuse ST elevations in II, III, F, V4-V6.
# Hypotension: Likely related to underlying infection despite negative imaging.
Her immunosuppressive medications increases our suspicion of and underlying infection cause and may explain the observed normal white count.
Likely component of adrenal insufficiency given chronic pred use and recent self discontinuation x 3 days - supported by hyponatremia.
She did not require pressors or additional fluid boluses once she reached the MICU.
Given immunosuppression with steroids and 6-MP, may not manifest leukocytosis.
Increased risk of infection given concomitant prednisone and 6-MP.
Repeat chest xray did not show progression or new findings after receiving IVF in the ED.
# productive cough: CXR unremarkable, Sputum culture was inconclusive as above, symptoms improved in house.
# [**Doctor First Name 48**]: Baseline creat 0.7 - noted to be 1.2 prior PCP visit now down to baseline after fluids overnight - most likely prerenal azotemia related to poor po intake prior to hospitalization.
Slight transaminitis - unclear significance, could be inflammatory although given recently initiated 6-MP, would confirm prior hepatitis w/u with PCP.
Disp:*8 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Fever, hypotension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for fevers and some low blood pressure.
You take prednisone and mercaptopurine for your rheumatoid arthritis which puts you at risk for infections.
You also had a chest xray and a CAT scan of your abdomen which were both reassuring without signs of acute infection.
