CRT [**2166**] who was recently admitted here [**6-30**] for ARF c/b SVT requiring version, NSTEMI who presents today from home c/o diarrhea, nausea, lightheadedness, vomiting, generalized weakness, diminished po intake for 4-5 days.
Renal transplant in [**2166**] secondary to chronic reflux nephropathy.
Osteonecrosis of feet c/b osteomyelitis now on IV Vanco 7.
Pertinent Results: RADIOLOGY: ========== CT abdomen without contrast: .
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or hemorrhage collection within the abdomen or pelvis.
This could be related to edema in this patient.
The stranding does not appear to be localized around any particular abdominal or pelvic structure.
Pneumobilia unchanged.
Diffuse diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Trace right pleural effusion.
IJ cordis placement: IMPRESSION:  Interval widening of the mediastinum status post right internal jugular line placement.
Given this patient's symptom of hypotension, further evaluation with a chest CT may be warranted if clinically indicated.
Renal U/S [**2176-7-28**]: IMPRESSION: No significant change in appearance of the transplanted kidney.
Acute renal failure of a transplanted kidney with good blood flow and normal arterial resistive indices is more commonly seen with cyclosporine toxicity than rejection .
ECHO [**2176-7-30**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not  present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**11-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion .
These findings raise the suspicion for an acute pulmonary embolus .
Lung Scan:INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate diffusely heterogeneous tracer activity without focal defect.
IMPRESSION: Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolus.
IMPRESSION: Increased bilateral pleural effusions.
CRT in [**2166**] with recent admission at [**Hospital1 18**] for ARF attributed to N/V and HCTZ who presents from home c/o LH, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea She was found to be profoundly hypotense requiring volume and pressors, WBC of 21 with bandemia.
She was admitted to MICU for sepsis of unclear etiology.
Her urine culture returned as Kleb pneumonia sensitive to levofloxacin and a number of other drugs.
The patient had stopped having diarrhea by this time for three days.
Of note, an echocardiogram revealed RV dilatation with wide open TR.
She did not have signs of R heart failure.
Cardiology was notified they felt no assessment or intervention was necessary on their part and recommended outpatient follow up.
With regard to her renal function, her creatinine was noted to improve with volume resusciation.
CXR reveal bilateral effusions.
As these were not imparing the patients functional capacity and were likely due to recovering myocardium, volume overload, and prolonged hospitalization, the patient was prepared for discharge.
