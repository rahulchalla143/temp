The patient is a resident of [**Hospital3 **] Home; where, on the day of admission, she was noted to develop acute shortness of breath, wheezing, and fevers.
She was in mild respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 24 and was saturating 96% on 4 liters.
However, since her arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient became hypotensive.
Her blood pressure stabilized; however, she then developed increased shortness of breath.
Questionable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General physical examination revealed an obese and lethargic female.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Cardiovascular examination revealed distant heart sounds.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The lung examination revealed coarse breath sounds bilaterally with diminished air movement in the right upper lobe.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Otherwise, the patient was uncooperative with neurologic examination.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was consistent with increased fluid overload and congestive heart failure.
No infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 102.
There were flat T waves in leads V3 through V6, I, aVL, II, III, and aVF.
FEVER AND HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was transferred from her nursing home with a fever.
Upon arrival in the Emergency Department, she was afebrile but soon became hypotensive and required significant fluid resuscitation.
The patient's examination on admission was consistent with shock, and there was concern that the patient might be septic.
Cultures were followed, and no organism was isolated.
The patient was thought to likely have a bronchitis, as no clear infiltrate was every isolated on her chest x-rays.
This was thought to represent a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with a superimposed infectious process.
This was likely due to congestive heart failure.
She also was started on nebulizers and prednisone to treat her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
As her symptoms improved, she was slowly weaned off the oxygen.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with an extensive smoking history and a questionable diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She was started nebulizers and a prednisone taper before being transitioned over to inhalers, and a steroid inhaler was added.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was admitted without a history of congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease; except for her hypertension.
The patient did develop congestive heart failure soon after admission with aggressive fluid resuscitation.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with her cardiac enzymes negative.
HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient's blood pressure medications were initially held on admission given concern for sepsis and her initial hypotension.
However, her blood pressure stabilized, and as she actually did become hypertensive at this point, she was started back on her verapamil and dyazide per her home regimen which she tolerated well.
SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with a complicated psychiatric history including schizoaffective disorder, depression, and a history of suicide attempts.
The patient was lethargic and confused on admission which was thought to be due to her infection.
These symptoms were treated.
In addition to her standing Lamictal and Seroquel medications, the patient also received Ativan as needed for agitation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed to follow up with her primary care physician in one week to have an outpatient stress test.
