He spiked a fever within 24 hours of admission and cultures were sent.
On [**5-3**], the patient had low urine output and was transfused 1U PRBC to improve his hemodynamics.
Given his rising creatinine despite apparently adequate fluid resuscitation, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 18821**] was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.
He had elevated serum glucose levels, and his insulin sliding scale was tightened.
On [**2127-5-6**], the patient had a 1 minute episode of ventricular tachycardia, which was self limited and did not recur thereafter.
The electrophysiology service was consulted, and recommended switching him to metoprolol from sotalol given his renal dysfunction.
His chest tubes were placed to water seal and removed sequentially thereafter without clinically significant pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
He was tolerating trach collar trials for increasing time periods.
