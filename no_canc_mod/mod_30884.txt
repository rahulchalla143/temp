He called his cardiologist few days ago and stated that he was having increased shortness of breath.
A TTE revealed severe aortic stenosis and he was referred for cardiac catheterization to evaluate aortic stenosis and for current coronary status.
His catheterization confirmed severe aortic stenosis and 70% lesion of his LAD.
