Chronic collection over inferior aspect of axillobifemoral graft just prior to crossover of femorals measuring 5.8 x 4.6 x 10.1 cm.
Significant endplate changes with erosive changes noted at L4-L5 which may represent an osteomyelitis.
Increased interstitial markings with tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] pattern which may represent infection and possible aspiration pneumonia.
Portable AP [**3-14**] No focal consolidation, however, there is subtle, ill-defined asymmetric airspace opacity in the left lower lobe, better appreciated on the prior abdominal CT, which may represent early infection, inflammation, and/or aspiration.
No acute infiltrates are present.
There is a prominent interstitial [**Doctor Last Name 5926**] again seen suggesting some chronic interstitial process.
Given these limitations, there is no gross change in findings at L4-L5 from [**2-15**] exam.
Suggest re- examination after sedation to exclude residual infection at this site.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST [**2175-3-23**] Pre lim read, no significant change in severe osteo, L4-L5 region Decreased inflammation adjacent to psoas muscle.
#) Hypotension/sepsis: Pt had several sources of infection that could cause hypotension including worsening L-spine osteomyelitis, line infection, axillary bifem graft fluid collection, aspiration pneumonia.
However, suspected hypotension related to severe dehydraton [**2-17**] gastroenteritis.
During prior admission, OB-GYN was consulted and stated that given that the string is no longer palpable, removal would require more invasive attempts usually performed under anesthesia - therefore rec'd leaving it in.
Pt was initially treated with cefepime, linezolid, and flagyl, but this was changed to vanc prior to transfer to floor, as it was believed pt did not have active bacterial infecion other than chronic osteo.
Pt afebrile with no diarrhea on floor.
[**3-21**] [**Month/Day (4) 4338**] with movement poor quality film.
Repeated [**3-23**] with no change in osteo, but no evidence of abscess and some improvement in inflammatory changes adjacent to psoas muscle.
[**3-21**] [**Month/Day (4) 4338**] with movement poor quality film.
Repeated [**3-23**] with no change in osteo, but no evidence of abscess and some improvement in inflammatory changes adjacent to psoas muscle.
At discharge to nursing home, no further positive blood cultures, osteo stable, vancomycin stopped after total 12 week course of Abx.
#) Infiltrate on CT scan: pneumonia unlikely as pt afebrile with no 02 req.
Aspiration precautions.
No evidence of pneumonic process.
#) Diarrhea/vomiting: possibly due to viral gastroenteritis.
No emesis since admission but diarrhea persistent until 4 days prior to discharge.
Stool cx's no growth.
Flagyl on admission, stopped after third stool sample negative for c-diff.
likely [**2-17**] volume loss from vomiting/diarrhea and less likely sepsis.Improved to 1.6 after aggressive IVF, so etiology likely pre-renal.
#) pAfib: pt no longer on coumadin due to anemia and hx of guaiac pos stools.
#) PVD: hx of ax-bifem graft with known post-surgical fluid collection (likely chronic).
Given strep viridans bacteremia and grafts, patient to be discharged on Cephalexin 500 mg daily.
#) Back pain: likely from chronic osteo.
#)Rash: Uritcarial rash developed 2 days prior to discharge.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1) treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
