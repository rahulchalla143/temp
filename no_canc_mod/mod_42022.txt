Stress testing at [**Hospital3 **] demonstrated inferolateral ST depressions along with anginal symptoms and SOB at 4 min.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated left main disease and two vessel coronary artery disease.
Cardiac Catheterization: Date: [**2108-9-18**]     Place: [**Hospital1 18**] The LMCA had diffuse disease with a distal 60% stenosis.
There was a superior dye stain that was likely an ulceration or fissure but could not exclude catheter dissection.
The LAD had a diffuse 80% lesion after D1.
D1 was a large vessel with a diffuse 80% stenosis.
The LCx had a 40% lesion at its origin and a OM lower branch had an 80% lesion.
The RCA had diffuse mild disease with 30-40% stenosis.
No AS or AI, no pulmonary hypertension.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no echocardiographic evidence of aortic dissection post de-cannulation.
Minimal left pleural effusion with left retrocardiac atelectasis, borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
Minimal plate-like atelectasis at the right lung base.
No evidence of pneumothorax  [**2108-9-28**] 04:20AM BLOOD WBC-11.1* RBC-2.92* Hgb-8.4* Hct-25.3* MCV-87 MCH-28.7 MCHC-33.1 RDW-14.8 Plt Ct-141* [**2108-9-27**] 03:48PM BLOOD WBC-11.6* RBC-2.97* Hgb-8.6* Hct-26.2* MCV-88 MCH-29.0 MCHC-32.8 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-134* [**2108-9-27**] 11:11AM BLOOD Hct-25.5* [**2108-9-28**] 04:20AM BLOOD Glucose-117* UreaN-17 Creat-0.9 Na-137 K-4.3 Cl-103 HCO3-30 AnGap-8 [**2108-9-27**] 03:48PM BLOOD Glucose-123* UreaN-16 Creat-0.9 Na-134 K-4.8 Cl-103 HCO3-29 AnGap-7* [**2108-9-27**] 02:10AM BLOOD Glucose-120* UreaN-17 Creat-1.0 Na-135 K-4.6 Cl-104 HCO3-27 AnGap-9 [**2108-9-26**] 01:56AM BLOOD Glucose-134* UreaN-21* Creat-1.0 Na-137 K-4.4 Cl-107 HCO3-25 AnGap-9 [**2108-10-2**] 06:15AM BLOOD WBC-10.2 RBC-2.93* Hgb-8.4* Hct-25.9* MCV-88 MCH-28.8 MCHC-32.6 RDW-15.0 Plt Ct-280 [**2108-10-2**] 06:15AM BLOOD PT-19.6* INR(PT)-1.9* [**2108-10-1**] 04:22AM BLOOD PT-13.7* INR(PT)-1.3* [**2108-10-2**] 06:15AM BLOOD Glucose-107* UreaN-24* Creat-1.2* Na-134 K-4.2 Cl-97 HCO3-29 AnGap-12  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 69 year old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism who presented for cardiac catheterization from OSH after ETT with ST depression in the setting of [**8-31**] months of progressive chest pain with exertion.
She was found to have 3 vessel disease and on [**9-25**] underent an urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4, left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, and saphenous vein sequential graft to obtuse marginal 1 and 2.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support and transferred to the floor on POD2.
She developed post-op afib that was difficult to rate control and was started on amiodarone, lopressor and diltiazem.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and her pain was controlled with Ultram.
