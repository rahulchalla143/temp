Admission Date:  [**2150-12-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-1-20**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Bactrim / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Syncope, shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 89 F with history of breast cancer s/p lumpectomy in [**2145**], dementia, atrial fibrillation, PSVT, orthostatic hypotension and history of syncopal episodes and multiple falls with recent C2/3 spinous process fractures in [**10-5**], who presents after a syncopal episode with C2 spinous process fracture on CT.
She cannot recall any prodromal symptoms other than dizziness.
She was brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where she was found to be hypoxic to 87% on RA, Head CT neg, CXR showed fluffy bilateral infiltrates read as pulmonary edema, shoulder and pelvic XRay without fracture, and CT neck showed "subacute C2 fracture."
The patient has had prior admissions for syncope, which is thought to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension.
She has had a 24 hour holter monitor during a symptomatic episode, which showed sinus bradycardia in the 50s.
She is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of gerontology for her othostatic hypotension, who recently increased her florinef to 0.1 mg daily in [**Month (only) 1096**] [**2149**].

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2150-10-4**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
-CXR [**2150-12-30**]: Diffuse bilateral opacities may represent pulmonary edema or ARDS, although infectious process not excluded.
-C-SPINE (AP, FLEX & EXT): No significant interval change.
Unchanged severe degenerative changes.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Diffuse bilateral ground glass and interstitial pulmonary opacities.
Differential includes ARDS or pulmonary edema.
Recommend chest radiograph after diuresis for further evaluation.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be reactive.
-ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**11-28**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-9-5**], the apparent pulmonary artery systolic pressure is markedly increased.
CXR [**2150-12-31**]: AP chest compared to [**12-30**] and baseline examination [**5-15**]: Symmetrically distributed coarse peribronchial opacification is probably pulmonary edema worsening in some areas of the lungs, relatively sparing others because of emphysema and relatively mild pulmonary fibrosis.
Moderate cardiomegaly with particularly severe left atrial enlargement is longstanding.
Pleural effusion is small if any.
An alternative to atypical pulmonary edema would be multifocal interstitial pneumonia and particularly viral.
Brief Hospital Course: Upon admission to the medicine team, she was afebrile, but had a chest xray concerning for multilobular pneumonia, and possibly also for changes consistent with pulmomnary fibrosis from Amiodarone, which she had been taking since [**2144**] for A Fib.
She was started on antibiotics (Cefepime, Cipro and Vancomycin for HAP), and methylprednisolone 80mg q8h for treatment of amiodarone toxicity, as well as albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for symptomatic treatment.
Over a period of four days her oxygen requirement improved from 6 liters to 3 liters and she seemed to be markedly improving.
On [**1-7**], tube feeds were started, and a CT of her chest was interpreted as an acute CHF exacerbation superimposed on chronic Amiodarone lung toxicity processes.
On [**1-10**] for elevated potassiums (with normal EKGs) she received kayexalate, and on [**1-11**] she was diursed with Lasix.
She became hypernatremic at 150, received D5W and free water tube feed flushes, and her hypernatremia resolved back into normal ranges by [**1-12**].
