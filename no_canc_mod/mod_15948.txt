Moderate diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
4.4 x 4.0 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm.
abdominal x-ray [**2187-7-15**]: No previous images.
Bowel gas pattern is essentially within normal limits without evidence of obstruction or significant ileus.
There are calcifications of the vas deferens bilaterally, suggesting the possibility of underlying diabetes.
ECHO:  Very poor image quality.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) with global hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Very poor image quality.
Moderately depressed LVEF (35%).
Compared to the prior report [**2187-7-16**] no definite change.
Minimally complex fluid in the left lower quadrant - consider CT if clinically warranted.
Small pleural effusion.
No hepatobiliary abnormality detected.
No left lower quadrant fluid collection is seen.
Minimal free fluid in the abdomen without organized collection.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta, coronary arteries, SMA, and renal arteries.
There is a 4.3-cm saccular infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, unchanged compared to prior.
Postoperative changes in the right groin.
Transplant nephrology was consulted for management of his immunosuppression and antihypertensives in the setting of sepsis.
On [**7-9**], the decision was made the the patient's right leg was not salvageable due to critical ischemia, and he underwent a right below-knee amputation with excision of his prior [**Month/Year (2) **].
The stump, thigh, and groin incisions were left open and packed, due to tissue and blood cultures positive for MRSA, and a JP drain was placed.
Due to patient's prior cardiac history, including a bypass and MI, serial troponins and EKGs (showing non-specific ST-T abnormalities) were obtained.
Patient was asymptomatic for chest pain and shortness of breath.
Cardiology was consulted and felt troponin elevation was due to demand ischemia.
On [**7-11**] patient went to the OR for closure of his stump, thigh, and groin wounds after clearance from cardiology.Patient was diuresed for fluid overload (h/o CHF with EF 25-30%), with improvement in blood pressure.
On [**7-15**] patient experienced nausea without vomiting.
Patient had loose stools without abdominal pain, but c diff antigen was checked and was negative.
He had no fevers and his Wc and decreased to normal.
However starting on [**7-16**] he began to have a rise in his creatinine.
Urine lytes looked c/w decreased pre-load but UA looked c/w ATN.
On [**7-22**] the patient had flash pulmonary edema and was transferred to the ICU.
However, on [**7-25**] he acutely became hypotensive and developed severe R thigh pain.
His left upper extremity fistula was difficult to access because it was too deep, so a right IJ tunneled dialysis line was placed by IR.
A VAC dressing was applied to his open thigh wound and eventually transitioned to wet to dry dressings.
Gastroenterology was consulted after he had several episodes of guaiac positive stools  Cdif was sent on multiple occasions but always returned negative.
Psychiatry was consulted for his depressed affect and he was started on citalopram.
Nutrition became an issue, as his appetite was decreased due to depression and he could not tolerate tube feeding via a dobhoff.
He worked with physical therapy and it was determined that he needed acute rehab.
