>>Pertinent imaging: [**2133-8-7**] EGD- Friability and granularity in the esophagus, with bleeding after biopsy at GE junction.
EGD PATHOLOGY FROM BIOPSY- Squamous and gastric type glandular mucosa with focal ulceration, acute and chronic inflammation, foveolar hyperplasia and multilayered epithelium.
No well developed intestinal metaplasia seen .
[**2133-8-13**] EGD- Mild Esophagitis in prox esophagus Necrotic esophagus with evidence of healing overlying 2 cords of Grade 1 varices Severe portal gastropathy Refluxing bile from pylorus Severe duodenitis, worst in the bulb Normal jejunum Otherwise normal EGD .
[**2133-8-14**] EGD- Successful NJT/OGT placement Grade 1 Varices New shallow based ulcer at distal esophagus (5 oclock) Healing necrotic esophagus from mid to distal esophagus Severe Portal Gastropathy Severe duodenitis D1/D2 Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
[**8-9**] MRI head, neck and MRA-  IMPRESSION: Slow diffusion in the right frontal and parietal lobes involving the motor cortex and supplemental motor area compatible with acute/subacute ischemia.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
Foci of increased DWI signal in the left precentral gyrus and left parietal lobe may represent additional foci of ischemic involvement or artifact.
Possible narrowing of the left vertebral artery V3/V4 segments.
No valvular pathology or pathologic valvular flow identified.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Large intra-abdominal ascites with cirrhotic liver.
Oral contrast retained within a tubular stomach which pools within the fundus and body.
Thick walled antrum ?
due to third spacing.
No contrast is seen within small bowel.
No free air.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.
Wall thickening of the pylorus, ascending and transverse colon is non-specific in the  non-specific in the setting of ascites and may be due to third spacing.
Moderate volume ascites and coarsened hepatic echotexture without evidence of biliary obstruction.
This could be related to the patient's ascites and third spacing.

# End stage cirrhosis: Currently not a transplant candidate at [**Hospital1 18**] due to continued drinking, age, comorbidities.
# Leukocytosis: WBC uptrended starting [**8-19**].
Pt remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Concern for acalculous cholecystitis given T bili uptrended with RUQ U/S [**8-22**] showing diffuse gallbladder wall thickening with sludge.
Pt also with intermittent RUQ tenderness on exam.
Pt with prolonged ICU stay and critical illness putting at high risk for acalculous cholecystitis, but percutaneous drainage too high risk in this pt per IR attending.
Diagnostic paracentesis neg for SBP [**8-24**] so not cause of leukocytosis and abd pain.
Could also be related to temp HD line infection but culture when line removed was neg.
Unlikely worsening pneumonia as patient appropriately treated (grew MRSA, completed 14d course of vancomycin with good troughs), ruled out for c.diff, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bacteremia.
Pt with persistence of mild leukocytosis with WBC count of 15 on day of discharge but in setting of downtrending bili we were reassured of improvement with coure of zosyn for acalculous cholecystitis.
# Renal failure: likely related to hepatorenal syndrome, possibly in combination with hypotension from GIB.
Pt had new temp line placed by IR [**8-27**] and it was tunneled on [**8-28**].
# Abdominal pain and distension: During ICU stay KUB showed gastric outlet obstruction but CT and EGD did not show any anatomic dysfunction.
Subsequent KUBs showed air in the small and large bowel.
Paracentesis in the ICU only yielded 500cc (no SBP).
He was started on HD on [**8-18**] for volume control.
Repeat RUQ ultrasound [**8-22**] showed diffuse gallbladder wall thickening with biliary sludge concerning for acalculous cholecystitis.
Abdominal pain was very transient and resolved.
# Embolic stroke: While in the ICU, patient had acute onset of left sided weakness and brain imaging showed an embolic stroke in the R MCA likely from a known DVT and patent foramen ovale.
Aspirin and coumadin were held due to GI bleed.
Patient worked with OT as left upper extremity began to develop contractures.
Pt also evaluted by PT and speech and swallow.
# Ventilatory associated pneumonia:  RLL pneumonia noted [**8-16**], and patient failed spontaneous breathing trial on ventilator.
Was noted to have severe esophagitis, a biopsy was taken with copious bleeding from the site noted following biopsy.
# AMS: Cirrhosis exacerbated by GI bleed.
Patient placed on rectal lactulose while remaining NPO, transitioned to oral lactulose hospital day 5 but having increased encephalopathy.
Continued on lactulose on floor with no ongoing asterixis.
AMS thought to be multifactorial in setting of no asterixis and sufficient BMs on latulose.
Thought likely due to combination of  hospital delirium, infection, CVA, and some degree of hepatic encephalopathy.
# Lower extremity DVT: Patient has history of bilateral lower extremity DVTs (started on warfarin on [**7-10**]).
Warfarin was held on admission in the setting of his GI bleed.
# Hypophosphatemia: Pt with frequently low phos levels requiring supplementation.
PTH checked on day of discharge and returned elevated after discharge at 91.
This is likely cause of low phos.
No elevations in calcium levels.
No intervention indicated.
Was sedated for intubation, therefore did not require CIWA scale for withdrawal.
# If T bili uptrends, especially in setting of worsening leukocytosis or fever, please call liver center (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2422**].
# Studies pending at time of discharge: PTH, peritoneal fluid acid fast culture from [**8-8**] # F/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in liver clinic and with transplant surgery re: permanent HD access.
He has recent h/o bilateral LE DVTs s/p IVC filter.
Neutra-Phos 2 PKT PO DAILY Duration: 5 Days   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY Diagnosis: # Severe gastritis and esophagitis # End stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis # Right sided embolic stroke # Ventilator associated pneumonia # Acalculous cholecystitis  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: # Alcohol cirrhosis # Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease # Gastrointestinal reflux disease # Hypertension # History of deep venous thrombosis   Discharge Condition: Verbal- occasional confused Left sided hemiparesis, unable to ambulate   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname **],  It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
You were admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed and worsening renal function.
You had a pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics.
You also had an infection in your gallbladder, which was treated with antibiotics as well.
You also had a large stroke affecting the left side of your body.
