not able to take PO contrast and no IV vontrast b/c arf CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: elevated cr  INDICATION: 86-year-old man with hypertension and new renal failure and abdominal pain.
Please evaluate for aortic pathology or evidence of infection.
No comparisons available.
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis with no IV or oral contrast administration.
No pulmonary nodule, parenchymal opacity, or pleural effusion is noted.
Dependent atelectatic changes are noted at both lung bases.
The aorta is diffusely ectatic and contains calcification.
The liver contains a small hypodense lesion within its dome measuring 6 mm which is too small to characterize.
The adrenal glands, stomach, duodenum, and loops of small bowel and large bowel appear normal.
Both kidneys contain multiple hypodense lesions which most likely represent simple cysts.
No hyronenephrosis is noted.
No free air or fluid is noted within the abdomen and pelvis.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal node is noted.
The descending thoraco-abdominal aorta is tortuous and ectatic throughout; however, there is a focal area of aneurysmal dilatation at the level of the infrarenal aorta measuring 29 x 28 mm.
There is apparent aneurysmal dilatation of the celiac artery at its origin which also shows some foci of calcification.
Diffuse calcification is noted throughout the course of abdominal aorta and the iliac arteries.
The prostate gland is massively enlarged and its markedly hypertrophied median lobe protrudes into the base of the bladder measuring 5.3 x 4.6 in a transverse dimension and 7.2 cm in craniocaudal dimension.
The part of the prostate gland that protrudes into the base of the bladder demonstrates multiple round hyperdense foci, suggesting hemorrhage; no blood is seen to layer dependently within the bladder.
No free air or fluid is noted within the pelvis.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal nodes are noted.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Diffusely calcific and tortuous abdominal aorta with infrarenal aortic aneurysm measuring approximately 2.8 x 2.9 cm, with no evidence of intramural hemorrhage or perianeurysmal leak.
In this setting of renal failure and numerous cysts, the differential diagnosis favors hemorrhagic (or superinfected) cysts, or less likely, primary renal malignancy.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Diffusely enlarged median lobe, prostate gland which protrudes into the base of the bladder and contains hemorrhagic foci.
Of note, the bladder appears smooth-walled with no free clot,and there is no hydronephrosis.
Diffuse panacinar emphysema.
8-mm hypodense lesion within the dome of the liver which cannot be further characterized.
COMMENT: Please note that son[**Name (NI) 867**] may be helpful for further evaluation of hyperdense renal cysts, prostate gland with hemorrhage and bladder PVR, and evaluation of the liver lesion.
=============================================================== Stress-MIBI:INTERPRETATION: This 86 year old man with a history of renal failure and CAD was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest pain.
