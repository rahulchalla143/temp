Admission Date:  [**2114-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-9-20**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Phenobarbital  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1945**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath.
History of Present Illness: This is a very nice [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with COPD on 2-4L of oxygen at baseline, presents with SOB.
The patient chronically feels SOB and fatigued, however, she notes a gradual worsening of her SOB in the last 3 months with increased difficulty going up small amounts of stairs.
She notes some small amount of cough with white/yellow sputum production over the last week.
No Hemoptysis, or chest pain.
Today, at 430pm, she acutely felt SOB and was unable to ambulate across the room at home without bracing herself.
She denies bleeding gums, epistaxis, h/o bleeding disorder  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T 97.1 P 97 BP 182/79 R 34 O2 sat 96% 15L NRB.
CXR showed bilaterally patchy opacitys which were interpreted as pulmonary edema.
EKG was without significant ischemic changes.
When the BNP returned at 100, they re-evaluated the pateint and discontinued Bipap and Nitro Gtt thinking that pulm edema was not the etiology.
On the floor, the patient is in no acute distress.

Probable underlying emphysema.
Mild ST segment depressions laterally are likely non-specific.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound ([**2114-9-13**]): 1.
No DVT in bilateral lower extremity.
---------------- CT chest without contrast ([**2114-9-14**]): Preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**]: severe emphysema (not fibrosis) with acute involvement of upper lobes = interstitial ?pulm edema (most likely) or atypical PNA (non pus-producing, ?mycoplasm) or ?pulm hem (unlikely without hemoptysis).
Moderate-to-severe emphysema, most predominant in the upper lungs bilaterally.
Ground-glass opacification in bilateral lungs may represent infectious process such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Initial attending impression was of no pulmonary embolism but review of images by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Radiology suggests segmental PE in left lower lobe arteries.
Small left sided pleural effusion is noted.
------------------- ECHO ([**2114-9-16**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Previous mild generalized pulmonary edema has cleared.
Residual heterogeneous opacification in the right upper lobe and in the suprahilar left upper lobe by virtue of its persistence is less likely to be pulmonary edema, more likely hemorrhage or infection.
Tiny left pleural effusion is comparable to the appearance on recent chest CT scans.
--------------------  Bilateral Lower extremity dopplers [**2114-9-18**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
=================================  Labs at discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is a very nice [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presents with worsening shortness of breath and new thrombocytopenia.
# Thrombocytopenia: In general causes are broken down into decreased production or increased destruction of platelets.
Decreased production is typically associated with a decrease in multiple cell lines which is not the case here.
The differential for increased destruction includes ITP, DIC, TTP, and heparin induced.
Per Heme onc the periperal smear was without platelet clumping or schitzocytes and she has not had known exposure to heparin.
Patient has been started on vitamin D and calcium for bone health; in addition, she has been started on Inhaled pentamidine once every month for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
It is very important that she return to this clinic for monitoring of her ITP and further tapering of her prednisone.
# Shortness of breath: Many possible etiologies were originally considered including edema in the setting of underlying interstitual lung disease.
However the physical exam is without signs of volume overload and the BNP is normal.
The abrupt onset of SOB also suggested PE, and even though she was not tachycardic we did find a subsegmental PE on CHEST CT.
Patient was treated with prednisone, as above, in addition to levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia (course now completed) and standing bronchodilator nebulizers.
With these treatments, her symptoms improved.
However, her lasix was stopped prior to discharge given a slight rise in creatitine.
#PE : the Pt was found to have subsegmental PE on CHEST-CT.
Given the very low pretest probablity of clot as well as the many contraindications to anticoagulation (hemoptysis, recent ITP), the risks and benefits of anticoagulation versus close monitoring was discussed with the patient and her daughter.
It is important that she receive follow-up lower extremity dopplers to evaluate possible clot burden in 1 week ([**9-27**]) and anticoagulated if further clots are found.
# Hemoptysis: during her hosptial stay, she was noted to have mild occasional hemptysis (streaks and dime sized) dark maroon blood.
She remained hemodynamically stable with no signs of significant blood loss.
Chest CT revealed no evidence of malignancy.
# Gastroesophageal reflux disease: we continued her home omeprazole.

Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 31006**] of [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Thrombocytopenia          COPD    Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the [**Hospital3 **] medical center for increased shortness of breath and low platelets.
You were watched in the Intensive care Unit and you were treated with steroids to increase your platelets and treat your COPD exacerbation.
You remain on 4L of oxygen and have some increased difficulty when walking secondary to shortness of breath.
These issues are thought to be the result of old bleeding that occured while your platelets were low.
You were deemed stable for discharge to a rehabilitation facility for further help with your breathing and walking.
