[**2152-3-1**] Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 39527**] is a very pleasant man with a history of tobacco use, HTN, DM2 and high cholesterol who reports two episodes of substernal chest pain in the last 6 weeks.
He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26191**] where his EKG showed 1mm ST depressions in leads 1, AVL, and V4-6.
He was scheduled for a stress test which showed a partially reversible posterior apical and lateral defect and an EF of 55%.
Currently, he denies chest pain but does report claudication and SOB while walking.
He has been walking slower and is able to walk without symptoms as long as he doesn't overexert himself.
The claudication is described as a heaviness in both legs after walking [**1-17**] mile which is relieved by 1 minute of rest.
Physical Exam: Vitals- Afebrile, BP 130/60, HR 60's, R 20, SAT 95% on room air Gen- comfortable, NAD HEENT-PERRL, EOMI, OP wnl, MMM Neck-supple, no CB, no JVD Lungs-CTAB Heart-rrr, nl s1/s2, no M/R/G Abd-soft NT/ND, NABS, no HSM Groin- R fem pulse 2+ without hematoma or bruit Ext-no C/C/E, 2+ DP b/l Skin- WWP Neuro-AO3, CNs intact, appropriate, strength 5/5 and sensation roughly intact   Pertinent Results: [**2152-3-1**] Cardiac Cath: 80% distal LM, 70% LAD, 70% D1ostial, small D2 mid 90%, LCx with prox occ and collaterals to OM, RCA with prox occ and L cor collaterals.
[**2152-3-1**] Carotid Ultrasound: No evidence of stenosis in the extracranial carotid arteries bilaterally.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No masses or thrombi are  seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is  no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial  effusion.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial  appendage.
No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild  regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
No masses or thrombi are seen  in the left ventricle.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include anterior mid and apical hypokinesis.. LVEF is 40-45%.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descendingthoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending  thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is  no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild AI, trace MR as  reported pre CPB.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had 70% proximal stenosis with 70% ostial D1 and 90% mid D2 stenoses.
The LCX had proximal occlusion with collaterals from the OM.
The RCA had proximal occlusion with extensive collaterals from left coronary system.
Left ventriculography demonstrated neither mitral regurgitation nor wall motion abnormalities.
The aortic root and ascending aorta were mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets appeared structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
There was no mitral valve prolapse.
Only trivial mitral regurgitation was seen.
The post bypass intraop TEE showed slightly improved LVEF with improvement of the anteroapical segment.
He weaned from inotropic support without difficulty.
His chest tubes were removed without complication.
On POD 3 his epicardial pacing wires were removed without complication, he continued to improve his ability to ambulate including climbing stairs without respiratory distress or chest pain.
On POD 4 Mr. [**Known lastname 39527**] was 6kg above his preop weight with good exercise tolerance, no SOB, or Chest pain.
His sternotomy and leg incision were clean, dry, and intact without evidence of infection.
