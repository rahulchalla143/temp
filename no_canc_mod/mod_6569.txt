Patient describe increasing dyspnea over the past couple of week and worsening day prior to admission.
Since yesterday, he had severe SOB even at rest and was urged by neighbor to come to the [**Name (NI) **].
He denies chest pain or dietary indiscretion.
He also complains of fatigue in the past few days.
Patient also complains of hemoptysis x 4-5 times yesterday and none today.
He also reports posttusive vomiting w/ blood x 6 times yesterday associated with abdominal discomfort.
RN note documented vomiting/coughing blood approx 20cc and he continues to have bloody sputum throughout ED course.CXR show enlarged heart size w/ ?
pericardial effusion, RLL and RML consolidation and he was started on vanco and ceftaz.
Patient refused NG lavage and rectal exam.Patient was given 1.2L NS.
At some point, patient started complaining of trouble breathing, He was started on BiPaP.Bedside echo was initially performed showing effusion on beside echo without tamponade physiology.
Formal echo was later performed which show LV adn RV severely dilated with severe global HK, LVEF<20%, 2+ MR, 2+ TR, PR, restrictive w/ inc LAP, mod PAH and no effusion.
Currently, patient denies chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, contipation or urinary complains.
He also complains of mild headahce.
Past Medical History: Congestive heart failure with LVEF 15%.
Coronary artery disease with severe 3VD, refused CABG years ago, currently without chest pain.
He walks with a cane, with no recent falls.
The patient has a history of cigar and pipe smoking in remote past, having quit in [**2097**].
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On admission to ICU: T98.5 P84-90 BP93-110/66-79 R14-27 100% on NRB Gen- frail appearing gentleman, sleepy, in mild resp distress HEENT- anicteric, PERRLA, mm dry, clear OP, neck supple, JVP 15cm, no cervical LAD CV- rrr, no r/m/g(hard to discern given noisy breath sounds) RESP- crackles on left, decreased breath sound on right, no paradoxical breathing, accessory muscle use [**Last Name (un) **]- soft, nontender, mildly distended but not tense EXT- 2+ pedal edema to knee, cool to touch, distal pulses faint but palpable.
These findings in the absence of frank pulmonary edema should raise suspicion of pericardial effusion.
The mediastinum is central, with mild aortic calcifications.
There is new right lower lobe consolidation and less prominent, but definitely present right middle lobe consolidation.
On the previous chest radiograph, right middle lobe opacity has been demonstrated, suggesting the chronic nature of this process.
There is no sizeable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Markedly enlarged heart size.
The possibility of pericardial effusion should be considered.
Right lower lobe and right middle lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with severe global systolic dysfunction.
[Intrinsic systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root and ascending aorta are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxia: Patient admitted to the ICU for management of hypoxia in the setting of multilobar pneumonia and CHF.
CXR showed right middle lobe and right lower lobe infiltrate.
Cardiology was consulted given a concern for pericardial effusion which by bedside ECHO appeared to be present but was not causing tamponade.
A subsequent formal ECHO in the ICU showed no evidence of pericardial effusion but an EF < 20% with 2+MR, 2+TR, and restrictive LV inflow pattern with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension and pulmonic regurgitation.
He remained afebrile and his wbc improved to normal.
# Hemoptysis: Patient reported hemoptysis x 4-5 times the day prior to admission.
Coags remarkable for a slightly elevated INR (1.4) for which he received po vitamin K.  He will follow-up with his primary care doctor for a chest CT following the resolution of his pneumonia to assess for pulmonary malignancy.
Patient was noted to have a low reticulocyte count and will need to follow-up with his primary care doctor for this.
# Hypothyroid: Abnormal TFTs in [**3-30**].
# CAD: Patient had a troponin leak (peak 0.31) in the setting of CHF with creatinine 1.5.
# Code- DNR/DNI .
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: multilobar pneumonia Secondary: CHF exacerbation, thrombocytopenia, anemia   Discharge Condition: good - 95% on room air, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you experience shortness of breath, swelling in your legs, difficulties breathing lying down, temperature > 101, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, or other concerning symptoms.
