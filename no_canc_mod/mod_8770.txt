Placement of right internal jugular line.
History of Present Illness: 49 year old female with h/o Pulm HTN DM lupus on flolan via hickman presenting for possible line infection.
A new Hickman line was placed 3 weeks ago after [**Last Name (un) **] line became infected and she is s/p 14d vanco course for Micococcus.
In the ED: Her initial vitals were 98.1 103 145/82 12 94RA, she was started on Vancomycin but developed itching and rash, benadryl given, -> continued vanco at slower rate -> got worse -> stopped.
Past Medical History: -Diabetes mellitus type 2 -pulmonary arterial hypertension on Flolan -atrial septal defect of the secundum type (versus a stretched PFO) -obstructive sleep apnea on home oxygen -anticardiolipin antibody -type 1 heparin induced thrombocytopenia -systemic lupus erythematosus with history of pleuritis, glomerulonephritis ([**2144**]) -obesity -restrictive pulmonary disease -migraines -history of sinusitis -fibromyalgia.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Physical Exam: On Admisison to Floor: VS: T 95.5 BP 82/38 HR 104 RR27 O2 5LNC Gen: WDWN middle aged male in mild distress HEENT: NCAT.
Sclera anicteric.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2155-5-22**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
ECHO Study Date of [**2155-5-23**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No vegetations seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Brief Hospital Course: 49 F PMH pulmonary HTN on flolan, SLE, APA syndrome, underwent recent Hickman change due to line infection who returned with likely line sepsis.
She was in the ICU for sepsis for a few days where she received several liters of fluids, pressors which were quickly weaned, high dose antibiotics and stress dose steroids.
CXR negative for infection.
No blood or catheter tip cultures grew out any organisms during this admission.
On the floor she remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile with no further signs of sepsis.
#) Pulmonary HTN: She had a right heart cath on [**5-27**] which revealed pulmonary hypertension with mean PA pressure of 47mmHG with PA systolic of 70.
She has follow up scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss further management of her Pulmonary HTN.
#) Tooth pain:  Pt with right questionable tooth infection prior to admission.
She had considerable pain and headaches off Amitriptyline.
Per Dental recs, there was no obvious source of infection/abscess and she was recommended for outpatient dental workup.
As she has had recurrent infections in the past few months, we consulted Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Rheum) re: tapering her home Prednisone which may be contributing to her susceptibility to infections.
of [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis  -Diabetes mellitus type 2 -pulmonary arterial hypertension -obstructive sleep apnea -systemic lupus erythematosus -migraines  Discharge Condition: Fair  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for sepsis secondary to a presumed Hickman line infection.
Seek medical attention immediately if you experience new symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain, fainting, arm/jaw pain or numbness, coughing, blood in sputum, worsening diarrhea or other concerning symptoms.
