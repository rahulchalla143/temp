Admission Date:  [**2119-9-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-9-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-12-14**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation (status post pacemaker), and cervical spondylosis who fell from standing two days prior to admission.
A head computed tomography at that time was reported as negative, but they did note a C2 cervical spine fracture, and the patient was transferred here emergently but in stable condition.
There had been no neurologic deficits (per report) on her arrival.
She was given vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma and transferred here in anticipation of a possible surgical intervention.
She had worsening oxygen saturation and increasing rales at the bases.
This was thought to be secondary to the fresh frozen plasma which was given to her at [**Hospital6 8283**].
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation; status post pacemaker.
Cervical spondylosis.
In general, she was lying on a board in a cervical collar, in no acute distress.
Her chest had no crepitus and was stable.
Her lung sounds had bilateral rales at the bases.
She had no extremity edema.
She was moving all four extremities with a nonfocal neurologic examination.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count?
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Radiologic examination included a computed tomography of the cervical spine which demonstrated fractures of the C1 ring and dens, severe disc degenerative changes in the lower cervical spine, and effusion of C4 and C5 vertebral bodies.
Radiologic films of the lumbar spine and thoracic spine were unremarkable for any fractures or dislocations.
Of note, with these computerized axial tomography scans, it was noted the patient had a lung radiograph consistent with pulmonary edema.
A head computed tomography done here demonstrated no intracranial hemorrhage.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient continued to remain neurologic intact with a nonfocal neurologic examination.
Status post fall with a cervical fracture and odontoid fracture with no neurologic defects.
Cervical spondylosis.
