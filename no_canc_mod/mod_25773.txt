Mr. [**Known lastname **] had no LOC, altered mental status or emesis at the time.
He complained of right anterior chest and shoulder pain.
He also had a change in his speech, with his daughter noting that it was "slurred".
In addition, he also had some abnormal movements of his arms and legs.
He had the most recent in [**8-/2161**] consisting of dizziness associated with pursing of his lips with deviation to the right.
Atrial fibrillation -- on coumadin with an INR goal of 2.5-3.
Diabetes 4.
Partial tear of the right gastrocnemius tendon dx'd two weeks ago.
[**Name (NI) **] denies tobacco use; occasionally drinks beer (though often non-alcoholic) 1/2-1 cup on occasion  Family History: No strokes, seizures, movement disorders or other neurological problems in the family.

There is active extravasation of the medial branches of the right internal mammary artery into a large presumed extrapleural anterior right hemithorax hematoma.
There is some element of tamponade of this hematoma and a portion of it does extend along the retrosternal space.
There is minimal at this point mass effect on the underlying heart.
No apparent aortic injury.
No obvious cardiac injury; however, the evaluation for such is limited on CT. 3.
Large layering hemothorax posteriorly in the right chest as well.
Small pleural effusion on the left.
As above, a non-displaced transverse distal sternal body fracture.
No evidence of acute solid organ injury in the abdomen or pelvis.
Further evaluation after emergent conditon is addressed should be pursued with referral to pancreas center and likely abdominal MRI (without contraindication).
Right hemothorax with a loculated anterior portion, partially visualized, with likely hemorrhagic stranding in the adjacent superior mediastinum.
Prominent soft tissue density within the anterior spinal canal from C1-C4.
This may represent disc degeneration and/or prominent epidural veins.
However, MRI of the cervical spine should be considered to exclude a small epidural hematoma.
No active extravasation of contrast within the visualized superior thorax or neck.
Small in caliber left V1 segment, likely atherosclerotic, of the left vertebral artery.
Moderate calcific arteriosclerosis of the carotid siphons and left V4 segment.
Chronic appearing left cerebellar hemishpere and small right parietal infarctions.
[**2161-10-15**] Embolization of [**Female First Name (un) 899**] : Selective right internal thoracic artery arteriography demonstrated areas of active extravasation successfully occluded with deployment of three microvascular coils.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
[**2161-10-16**] MRI Head : Right greater than left acute cortical infarcts, mostly in a watershed distribution.
Punctate smaller infarcts in the right cerebellar hemisphere and right insula do not conform to a watershed, and an underlying central embolic source should also be considered.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-10-9**], the detected pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is higher.
Stable appearance of watershed distribution infarcts in the right cerebral hemisphere involving frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.
Additional foci of acute infarction within the left vertex and right cerebellum are better demonstrated on MRI from one day prior.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Small vessel ischemic disease and age-related involution.
Paranasal sinus disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Trauma team on the Emergency Room and admitted to the Trauma ICU for further management of his hemothorax and for evaluation by the Stroke team in light of his new symptoms and CT findings.
He underwent serial neuro checks and displayed some periods of confusion, garbled speech and had mild left sided weakness.
His Coumadin had been reversed after the accident at [**Hospital1 **] and his strokes probably occurred in the setting of a normal INR therefore full anticoagulation was recommended due to his high risk for another stroke given his history.
He remained in atrial fibrillation with adequate rate control.
[**Name (NI) **] still had periods of confusion, possibly "sundowning" but they gradually eased.
He did well with Physical Therapy as far as gait training, balance and functional mobility are concerned.
Of note his admission Abd Ct scan showed some changes in the prostate possibly related to cancer.
Acute left cerebral infarct 2.
Right cerebellar infarct 3.
Right internal mammary bleeding 4.
Acute blood loss anemia   [**Date Range **] Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
[**Date Range **] Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital after your car accident and had multiple problems including stroke and bleeding into your chest from a small artery under the breast bone.
* If you develop any new symptoms that concern you call your doctor or return to the Emergency room.
* Restart your diabetic medications.
