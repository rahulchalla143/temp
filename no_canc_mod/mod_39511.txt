Patient received the dual-chamber [**Company 1543**] Sigma, serial number  PJD [**Numeric Identifier 91991**], placed initially in [**2146-10-17**], insertion of a  new [**Company 1543**] atrial lead because of fractured wire was done on [**2153-1-10**].
However, patient noted increased drainage from the wound site prior to the scheduled date and presented to OSH on [**2156-1-15**] for evaluation.
At that time he had no fevers/chills, no abdominal pain, no nausea and vomiting, and no other pain.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for lead removal.
He reports diffuse pain symptoms but staff that know him and report that his expression of "pain" is in fact an obsessive/compulsive discomfort with the sticky leads on his body.
ROS: difficult to assess, but staff reports he has not had pain, shortness of breath, or fever.

There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Visualization of the pacemaker leads throughout their course is incomplete, but no large pacer vegetations are seen.
Mild functional tricuspid regurgitation.
A probable thrombus is seen in the wall of the right atrium.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.

Radiology Report PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2156-1-28**] 9:47 AM  IMPRESSION: Focally dilated loops of small bowel and colon within the mid abdomen with otherwise gasless abdomen raises concern for obstruction.
No small-bowel obstruction.
Abnormal location of the small bowel suggestive of an internal hernia; however, this is uncomplicated.
There is no evidence of strangulation or obstruction and is probably congenital in origin.
Small fat-containing umbilical hernia.

The leads were extracted and though patient remains bradycardic, he is asymptomatic and has not experienced any episodes of light-headedness or fainting.
He is afebrile and on abx and shows no signs of systemic disease.
INFECTED PACEMAKER LEADS:  Patient has a long-standing implanted pacemaker because he previously had experienced syncopal episodes related to sick-sinus syndrome.
He had begun to pick at an area where the pacer wires were close to the skin and developed a complicated infection with exposed pace wires.
There was granulation tissue over the site of patient's previous intervention and a previous wound culture grew MSSA for which he had undergone a course of Keflex.
Because of inability to eliminate infection and continued exposure of the pacer wires, a scheduled explant of the pacemaker was planned.
Because patient had increased purulent drainage from the site, he presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he was started on vanc and cefazolin.
His pacemaker was explanted on [**1-22**], procedure complicated by hematoma at right groin site which self-resolved with some inital pressure and asymptomatic bradycardia to 30s-40s.
He remained afebrile and with no signs of systemic infection.
He is to receive a total of 6 weeks of IV daptomycin for treatment of potential endocarditis given the finding of vegetation vs. fibrous tissue on the tricuspid valve.
He was sent to the CCU for closer bradycardia monitoring overnight after the procedure, and HR remained in the 50s with no arrhythmic events.
On the medical floors, he remained with bradycardia to the 50's and sometimes 40's without symptoms.
He experienced fever to 104F, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea that all resolved in 24 hours time.
His last symptom was diarrhea on the morning of [**2156-1-29**] and has been asymptomayic since.
He was written for oral ativan prn agitation which he rarely required as he responded to redirection very well when having episodes of agitation.
Skin Care: Patient has chronic problems with skin dryness likely related to obsessive cleaning behaviors and picking at his skin.
You were admitted to the hospital because there was an infection around your pacemaker wires that extended to your heart.
This type of infection requires removal of the pacemaker and wires to allow healing.
