He has had nausea and decreased appetite and p.o.
His lower extremity edema has been worse, as well.
Patient denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, increased abdominal girth, emesis, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, bright red blood per rectum.
Child's class C cirrhosis secondary to alcohol hepatitis C, on the transplant list, with prior history of ascites and encephalopathy.
Hepatitis C diagnosed in [**2159**].
Multiple upper gastrointestinal bleeds secondary to varices status post Medical Intensive Care admission in [**12/2166**] for melena and bright red blood per rectum, status post banding of grade 2 non-bleeding varices, EGD with portal gastropathy.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure in [**5-/2166**] placed secondary to variceal bleeding with revision in [**12/2166**] after ultrasound showed stenosis.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
History of lumbar disc herniation.
ALLERGIES:  Patient reports no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for his mother with diabetes and his father with alcoholic cirrhosis.
General appearance:  Well developed, well nourished male, ill appearing, jaundiced, no acute distress.
Neck:  Supple; no masses or lymphadenopathy; prominent A and D waves; no jugular venous distention.
Lungs:  Chest wall with no evident gynecomastia; lung bases dull to percussion; bibasilar crackles, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally; no egophony.
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm; normal S1 and S2; harsh, loud III/VI early systolic murmur heard best at the lower left sternal border with radiation to the axilla consistent with mitral regurgitation versus tricuspid regurgitation; no rubs or gallops.
No hepatomegaly.
Extremities:  2+ pitting bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees; positive palmar erythema and teres nails.
Skin:  Jaundiced; palmar erythema; multiple spider telangiectasias over the chest wall.
Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Ultrasound of the abdomen showed no demonstrable remarkable ascites, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt patent.
Serial blood cultures and urine cultures at the time of this dictation failed to show any significant bacterial growth.
Cirrhosis with end-stage liver disease:  Patient is on the transplant list.
Although he has been slowly declining, he has had an acute decompensation in the last three to four days to one week prior to this admission.
This was concerning for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, other infection, bleeding, [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease, and/or blockage of TIPS.
There was no evidence of bleeding during this admission.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed due to assess patency of the TIPS and to assess for ascites.
Ultrasound demonstrated patency of the TIPS and no ascites.
We followed his renal function closely out of concern for hepatorenal syndrome.
Blood and urine cultures were sent to rule out systemic infection.
Initially he had no antibiotic coverage.
However, during hospital course on [**2167-2-12**] he developed a new onset of cough with clinically significant areas of rhonchi and crackles on his lung exam concerning for pneumonia.
Even so, the patient remained encephalopathic with moderate asterixis on exam.
This was likely from loss of albumin as an intravascular oncotic force.
After development of a respiratory infection concerning for pneumonia, diuretics were held out of concern that increased secretions and ........... losses will lead the patient to dehydration in the setting of diuretics use, as well.
Nadolol was continued as prophylaxis against variceal bleeding.
Questionable pneumonia versus bilateral effusions:  On admission there was some concern for a possible pneumonia.
Chest x-ray was evaluated which demonstrated no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
However, during this hospital course his lung exam deteriorated and he began to have a cough productive of brownish/tan sputum.
At this time chest x-ray was repeated with [**Location (un) 1131**] consistent with bilateral opacities concerning for infection versus pulmonary edema.
End-stage liver disease secondary to alcoholic- and hepatitis C-related cirrhosis with history of ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy.
History of upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to varices status post banding.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
History of lumbar disc herniation.
