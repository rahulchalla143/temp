Unable to control pain with large doses of Dilaudid, fentanyl, methadone and Ketamine, so was intubated and sedated for pain control.
Anaesthesia was consulted and with lidocaine bolus, Ketamine drip, ketorolac iv, methadone iv, and dexmedetomidine was able to extubate the patient and achieve evidence of physiologic control of pain (improved NR, BP).
Once he was more than 7 days off Plavix he was transitioned from dexmedetomidine to epidural with bupivacaine with improvement in pain control.
