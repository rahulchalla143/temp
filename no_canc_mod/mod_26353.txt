Admission Date:  [**2194-9-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-10-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-10-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2194-10-1**] - Three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting utilizing the left internal mammary to left anterior descending, vein graft to obtuse marginal and vein graft to posterior descending artery   History of Present Illness: This is a 75 year old female with recent complaints of chest pain.
Of note, patient has dementia and is a poor historian.
A myocardial perfusion scan back in mid [**Month (only) 359**] showed anteroseptal ischemia with an ejection fraction of 45% - no official report.
Angiography revealed a 70% left main lesion; 60% stenoses of the right coronary and obtuse marginal with a 70% PDA lesion.
Given her critical left main stenosis, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
Family History: No premature coronary artery disease  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 99.5, BP 186/57, P 69, RR 18, SAT 94% on RA General: Elderly female in no acute distress HEENT: PERRLA, oropharynx benign Neck: Supple, no JVD Heart: Regular rate, s1s2, systolic murmur noted to radiate to carotids Lungs: Clear bilaterally Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended.
No varicosities.
Transmitted carotid bruits vs murmurs.
No focal motor deficits noted.
Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
No evidence of pneumonia or overt CHF.
The opacity in the right lower lobe has improved in the interval, with minimal residual band-like atelectasis.
There is improved aeration of the left lung, with residual atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Extensive mediastinal and symmetric hilar lymphadenopathy as well as few scattered perilymphatic nodules.
This distribution of findings is in keeping with the submitted history of sarcoidosis.
Periportal and celiac lymphadenopathy is seen as well.
However, unilateral right supraclavicular and right internal mammary lymphadenopathy is atypical for sarcoidosis, and underlying malignancy such as lymphoma or breast carcinoma cannot be excluded.
Further assessment with mammography is recommended if clinically indicated.
Small pericardial effusion.
Coronary artery atherosclerosis  [**2194-9-30**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound Moderate plaque with bilateral 40-59% carotid stenosis.
Of note, on the right, the degree of stenosis will fall to the lower end of the range whereas on the left it will be closer to the higher end of the range.
[**2194-9-30**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the mid-anterior septal wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Borderline first degree A-V block.
Possible old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Non-specific repolarization changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2194-9-30**] sinus bradycardia has given way to normal sinus rhythm.
Routine chest x-ray was notable for mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy for which a chest CT scan was obtained.
This appearance was compatible with a submitted history of sarcoidosis.
There was however two mildly enlarged right supraclavicular and single right internal mammary lymph nodes, atypical for sarcoidosis.
Underlying malignancy such as lymphoma or breast carcinoma could not be excluded.
The ECHO showed only mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
There was mild mitral regurgitation.
The carotid ultrasound revealed moderate plaque with bilateral 40-59% carotid stenoses.
She otherwise remained pain free on medical therapy and was cleared for surgery.
An ACEI was eventually resumed for hypertension.
