There, he was found to have a mild left facial droop and dysarthria, and dense left hemiparesis, arm and leg, slightly decreased sensation to light touch on the left side, without hemineglect.
He complained of some numbness on the left side as well.
His intial CT scan revealed no acute process.
A cardiac echo was ordered which found no clot or source of embolus.
3 hours later in the ED, his left sided weakness worsened in the arm, now with little movement below the elbow, as well as possible worsening of left leg weakness.
However, on the morning of [**2158-1-22**], it was found that his left sided weakness had worsened once again around 10:30 am.
His weakness was worse in his arms and he complained of "heaviness" in his legs.
These symptoms improved somewhat upon administration of fluids, but nonetheless a decision was made to transfer him [**Hospital1 18**] for concern over this worsening exam and the possible need for intervention.
He has a history of a TIA in [**2157-3-14**], associated with left sided weakness (involving the arms and legs, but not face), that resolved within one hour.
A subsequent MRI imaging study revealed a right temporal lobe infarct.
It was recently discontinued in [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 359**] due to bleeding hemorrhoids.
His rectal bleeding persisted off coumadin despite suture ligation and banding rpocedure was done [**12-8**].
His rectal bleeding stopped approximately a week ago.
His Coumadin was also on hold in [**Month (only) 547**]/[**Month (only) 116**] due to hematuria due to radiation cystitis.

The heart is moderately enlarged and there is tortuosity of the aorta.

His symptoms remained stable -- he has Full EOMs, mild Left NLF flattening, mild weakness of several left-sided muscle groups (Left pronator drift, delt [**5-16**], tri 4+/5, [**Hospital1 **] full, WE 4+/5, FE [**5-16**], FF full, IP 4-/5, Quad 5-/5, Ham [**5-16**], [**Last Name (un) 938**] 5-/5).
An U/S of the kidneys/ureters/bladder was performed, as he has a uro/prostate history with h/o XRT and occasional blood clots in his Foley catheter.
We will leave in the Foley catheter, which is draining a normal-appearing urine currently (with occasional clots recently).
If cystic bleeding becomes more than an intermittent problem, the warfarin should be held until urgent Urologic evaluation can be conducted.

Discharge Instructions: You had a stroke on the Right side of your brain, which caused your Left-sided symptoms (moderate weakness).
Your atrial fibrillation (heart rhythm) put you at risk for a blood clot going from your heart to your brain and causing a stroke, and you were not taking medicine (warfarin/Coumadin) to prevent it becuase you had experienced a problem/procedure that put you at risk for bleeding on warfarin.
