Fetal heart tracings showed decelerations during this event but stabilization afterwards.
Mother initially presented on The baby was known to have intrauterine growth restriction.
Past obstetric history revealed two miscarriages and one term infant in [**2137**].
The baby appeared slightly dysmorphic on admission with prominent frontal bossing and possibly rocker-bottom feet.
Anterior fontanelle soft and flat, large with sutures slightly open and large posterior fontanelle.
Respiratory equal with slightly forced breathsounds.
Abdomen is distended, full, no bowel sounds.
Small umbilical hernia.
She had peak pressures of MAP of [**9-15**] and Delta P of 22, required several bicarbonate boluses for metabolic and respiratory acidosis.
Her respiratory and general support escalated around [**4-19**] when she developed Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia with a positive trach aspirate.
The baby ultimately developed large bilateral pneumatoceles which are present on chest x-ray.
She has remarkably weaned her vent settings over the last several days from 28/7 and a rate of 40, overnight on [**5-23**] to 19 escalated to 100% oxygen and began a watch for necrotizing enterocolitis.
She has had numerous echocardiograms, the first one being on [**3-29**] which showed a probable patent ductus arteriosus with supersystemic right ventricular pressure.
She received another echocardiogram on day of life #3 which showed a large patent ductus arteriosus with left to right flow and right ventricular hypertrophy.
She had a follow up echocardiogram on [**4-3**] that showed no patent ductus arteriosus with right ventricular pressure greater than half the systemic and again on [**4-17**], which showed no patent ductus arteriosus, no evidence of vegetation and no ventriculoseptal defect.
She had a radial artery line inserted and a double lumen umbilical vein catheter through which she received maintenance intravenous fluids and parenteral nutrition.
When she became sick with Staphylococcus aureus she was once again made NPO and enteral feedings were reintroduced on day of life #42.
She had frequent stops and starts but ultimately achieved full enteral feedings of breastmilk or PE 22.
Feedings again were held on [**5-23**] into [**5-24**] when her belly became distended and on [**5-24**] she passed a bloody mucousy stool.
Her abdominal girth as increased over the last several days from 24 cm to 27 cm.
Gastrointestinal - The baby initially demonstrated physiologic jaundice and received phototherapy and has demonstrated a high direct bilirubin for which she has been treated with Phenobarbital and Actigall which was started nearly 2 days ago .
Infectious disease - The baby's original blood culture and complete blood count on admission had a white count of 2.2 with 26 polys, 0 bands, 63 lymphocytes and platelet count of 137,000 and hematocrit of 39.
Her neutropenia was thought to be related to maternal pregnancy-induced hypertension and bone suppression.
Again on [**4-17**] to [**4-18**] she had a sepsis evaluation because of instability and also right upper lobe collapse on chest x-ray.
On [**4-19**], her trach aspirate was positive for Staphylococcus aureus.
After consulting with Infectious Disease and General Surgery her current regime includes Meropenem 30 mg/kg q.
Other positive results - [**5-16**], Urine culture positive for Escherichia coli which was resistant to Ampicillin, Piperacillin and Trimethoprim.
Cerebrospinal fluid fungal culture negative.
[**5-18**], Blood culture negative for fungus and bacteria.
[**5-15**], she had an abdominal ultrasound done to rule out abscess.
No abscess was seen.
She was noted to have nephrocalcinosis and a small sludge gallbladder.
Serial KUBs are included with this dictation and are concerning for dilated bowel loops, possible pneumatosis and we have been watching closely for free air.
While she is at [**Hospital1 **], if it's possible for her to have immunology consultation due to the fact that she had multiple bout of infections with this time with multiple bacteria.
Continue NPO with close observation for necrotizing enterocolitis.
State newborn screens have been serially done, initially there were some repeats done because of presumed prematurity and the last one was in range.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for daycare during respiratory syncytial virus season, with a smoker in the household or with preschool siblings; or C. With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
