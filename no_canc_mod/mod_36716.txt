Patient discharged on Dicloxicillin on [**2184-6-24**]  Patient returned to our ED on [**2184-6-25**] with change in mental status.
CXR was negative for any focal infiltrate.
She was given Solumedrol 125 iv x 1 for presumed COPD exacerbation.
Patient remained asleep for 4 hours without internvention and sent to the floor.
On the floor patinet was somnolent and ABG was 7.31/65/135 and patinet was transferred to the MICU for CPAP for presumed hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Past Medical History: HTN Hyperlipidemia Dm2 Afib on Coumadin Gout Sleep Apnea  Social History: denies smoking, etoh use  Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: Vitals - T:95.5  BP:110/60  HR:90  RR:18  02 sat: 88RA GENERAL: somnolent SKIN: bruise on L flank HEENT: large neck, AT/NC, EOMI, PERRLA, anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, patent nares, MMM, supple neck, no LAD, no JVD CARDIAC: RRR, S1/S2, no mrg LUNG: CTAB ABDOMEN: obese, +BS, nontender in all quadrants, no rebound/guarding, no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly M/S: lower extremity venous stasis changes, 2+ edema bilaterally PULSES: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally NEURO: unable to assess  Pertinent Results: Imaging: CXR: IMPRESSION:  Limited examination.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
No pulmonary abnormality.
CT Head FINDINGS:  There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarct.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Osseous structures demonstrate mild upper hyperostosis of the walls of the right maxillary sinus.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
No hemorrhage or mass effect.
CT CHEST CTA CHEST:  There are coronary artery calcifications and calcifications of the mitral and aortic annuli.
Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for enlargement.
While the examination is technically limited, there are no main or segmental pulmonary artery emboli.
There are small bilateral  pleural effusions and mild diffuse ground-glass opacity as well as mild cardiomegaly, suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
Moderate cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions and ground-glass opacities suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 77F with known COPD on home O2 with possible COPD exacerbation and resultant hypercarbin respiratory failure  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Cause is unclear, though may have had some element of CHF.
Patient was found to have c02 in the mid 60s and was somnolent and thus was taken to the MICU for non-invasive ventilation.
Cause was also likely secondary to obesity hypoventilation given patient's habitus.
Should increase CPAP as tolerated and patient if possible should have a repeat sleep study.
Hypotension: Found to have SBPs in the 80s, however always able to mentate and had adequate urine output.
Hypotension was likely a combination of difficulty in measuring, given habitus, hypovolemia given diarrhea and high doses of diltiazem (thought to be home doses, but possible patient was non-adherant).
Symptoms improved at time of diagnosis  Cellulitis - Patient recently discharged from [**Hospital1 2025**] s/p treatment for cellulitis on dicloxacillin, on presentation was treated wtih vancomycin.
Atrial fibrillation: had episodes of tachycardia and was started on diltiazem at 1/2 home dose, was hypotensive (though as above, difficult to get accurate BP) but also intermittently tachycardic.
Coagulopathy: patient with increased INR during admission.
This is likely secondary to coumadin dosing at slightly higher (5 mg versus 2.5 in some notes) as well as poor intake and diarrhea.
Though it is possible that the patient has developed another cause for hypocoagulibility, it seems less likely in the setting of previously normal coags.
