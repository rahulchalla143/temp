She denies any bleeding source, although states that during the bowel prep, she irritated her external hemorrhoids with diarrhea (approx 3 episodes/ day for 5 days) and did notice blood in the bowel, on the toilet paper during the prep.
On Friday [**2-22**], she noticed some lightheadiness and dyspnea.
On Sunday, [**2-24**], she developed some chest burning while walking that lasted [**11-10**]' and went away with sitting down.
2 large bore IVs.
She is not actively bleeding and is in no acute distress.
Denies any cough or dyspnea, but does endorse a history of "pleurisy" in her right lower lobe followd by an outside pulmonolgist.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain (+ initially with prednisone).
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: rheumatoid arthritis for many years, recently complicated by episcleritis monoclonal gammopathy pleural fibrosis: [**7-7**] PFT: Data revealed a moderate - combined obstructive and restrictive ventilatory defect with a reduced DLCO.
COPD obliterative bronchiolitis anemia acne GERD obesity  Social History: Married, works as a IT consultant for helath care system team.
- Tobacco: None - Alcohol: None - Illicits: None   Family History: Mother: CAD, [**Name (NI) **]: unknown cardiomyopathy, died at 54, Sister: breast cancer, Brother: healthy   Physical Exam: Admission: Vitals: 97.1, 103, 98/67, 100% 2L NC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi, trace crackles at bases, R>L CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, Obese, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema (trace puffiness on hands) Rectal: external hemorrhoids, no active bleeding, negative Guiac.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 F with RA, chronic anemia (baseline Hct 27-30) presented to the ED with a Hct of 17 found on routine labs.
ICU Course: # Anemia - Microcytic with normal iron studies.
Patient had had a thorough GI workup including endoscopy and colonoscopy [**12-7**] for evaluation of anemia.
GI was consulted and patient underwent bowel prep and upper and lower endoscopy which demonstrated gastritis but no significant bleeding source.
# NSTEMI: >1mm ST depression in lateral leads.
She had positive Troponin with chest pain on [**2132-2-24**].
It was thought to be likely [**2-28**] demand ischemia due to combination of tachycardia and anemia.
The ICU team documented that there was no concern for active ischemia as EKG ST depression resolved with 3 units of blood however, her cardiologist called it an NSTEMI.
An echo done [**2132-2-27**] demonstrated an EF of 25-30% with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Patient was evaluated by Atrius cardiology and recommended follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6512**] and he will decide whether to pursue a nuclear stress test.
She will also discuss getting a stress test as her ECHO showed a LV systolic dysfunction concerning for an ischemic etiology.
Her tachycardia resolved after transfusions and at discharge was in the 90s.
# Infiltrate on CXR with increased WBC.
She did not have a cough or sputum production.
She has a history of "pleurisy" in right lower lobe.
She receives outpatient infusions of methotrexate and actemra.
# Episcleritis - the patient continued on her regiment of eye dropps.
# COPD - Pt was on symbicort as outpatient.
# Tachycardia: The patient has a history of tachycardia and was on metoprolol.
IN the acute setting, her tachycardia was thought to be secondary to anemia, hypovolemia.
# Hypertension: Not active - Lisinopril was held due to concern for bleeding and SBPs in the 100s.
She would recover her saturations promptly without any intervention but likely needs to follow up with an outpatient sleep study with consideration of CPAP.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Anemia GI bleed NSTEMI   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
