Per report for the patient's nursing facility, the patient was going to see her PCP to evaluate her tracheostomy (unclear indication and duration for tracheostomy) and also had a complaint of SOB and EMS was called to assist in transfer to this appointment.
Following initial contact with EMS the patient was noted to be unresponsive with agonal breathing and oral secreation and was subsequently noted to be pulseless at 11:30AM.
After second dose she reportedly had ventricular fibrillation and was shocked at 150J.
Imaging was notable for CT head suggestive of anoxic brain injury without evidence of acute bleed or stroke, chest CTA showed bibasilar consolidation, apical contusions and no evidence of PE and CT abdomen and pelvis without evidence of acute pathology.

During that period of time, there was an extremely severe  encephalopathy but it was not isoelectric.
This EEG may reflect underlying severe brain pathology or still may be the effect of medication or the hypothermia protocol.
CXR [**2191-1-5**] IMPRESSION: Bilateral pulmonary opacities may be due to massive aspiration, although diffuse infection or pulmonary hemorrhage or contusion not excluded.
Pulmonary consolidations likely represent combination of aspiration and atelectasis.
More anterior ground-glass opacities raise concern for pulmonary contusion/hemorrhage.
No pulmonary embolism or other definite cause of PEA arrest.
Rib fractures of the right anterior sixth and seventh and left anterior fifth and sixth ribs, which are nondisplaced.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was a 70 woman with COPD, CAD, HLD and tracheostomy transfered from [**Hospital3 **] after PEA arrest requiring >60 minutes of CPR and defibrillation x 2 no admitted to the MICU who was placed on cooling protocol but did not regain corneal or gag reflexes.
# S/P PEA Arrest - Report of events is suggestive of a respiratory arrest that progressed to a protracted cardiac arrest with likely compromise of circulation.
Possible etiology of respirtory arrest increased increased mucous production from pneumonia or and aspiration episode.
CT chest was suggestive of significant aspiration.
On arrival to the ICU, patient had fixed and dilated pupils.
The neurology service was following and a clinical diagnosis of cortical brain death was made.
# HCAP - Patient complained of shortness of breath prior to PEA arrest and had consolidations on chest CT. HCAP may have contribulted to increased mucous producation and arrest episode.
She was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for empric coverage.
