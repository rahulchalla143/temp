Admission Date:  [**2104-8-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-8-31**]   Service:  NEUROMEDIC  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Weakness and confusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year old woman with no significant past medical history except for epistaxis who was admitted on [**2104-8-22**], after having been outdoors raking leaves and had the abrupt onset of "loss of feeling" in her arms.
She was brought to an outside hospital where she was disoriented and confused according to the EMT report and progressively more awake on the way to that outside hospital.
She had apparently complained of a headache prior to this the night prior with some weakness in the legs although this story is not entirely clear at this point.
She was noted to have a right sided hemiplegia with the head turned to the left as well as an aphasia.
CT of the head there showed a large left frontoparietal bleed with mass effect.
She was seen by the neurosurgery consult team who felt that a ventricular drain was not warranted and unlikely to be beneficial even though there was evidence of small interventricular bleeding and some falcine herniation seen on the repeat head CT here.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
No tobacco or alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of stroke or bleeding.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - There is no scleral icterus.
The lungs revealed coarse breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities show marked edema in the right arm and leg.
Her pupils are small approximately 2.0 millimeters and minimally reactive.
There is normal tone on the left side, however, there is increased tone on the right upper extremity and right lower extremity.
Sensory - She grimaces to pain on the left side and less so on the right side.
Her microbiology studies included urine culture which was positive for Streptococcus povus.
Sputum culture is positive for Oxacillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus that is coagulase positive.
Right hemiparesis with aphasia - The patient's examination is consistent with the left frontoparietal as well as temporal lobe impairment likely due to the edema from the hemorrhage.
She is spontaneously breathing and has a right sided hemiparesis and aphasia and does not appear to follow commands.
Staphylococcus pneumonia - This is likely ventilator associated but is pansensitive.
The blood cultures were felt to be a contaminant since surveillance cultures were negative and the patient continued to be afebrile on the antibiotics.
