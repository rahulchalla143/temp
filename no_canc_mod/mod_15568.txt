Admission Date:  [**2140-3-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2140-3-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2092-7-27**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 47-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia and tobacco abuse who presented to an outside hospital earlier this morning with a complaint of severe substernal chest pain described as a [**8-4**].
Initially patient attributed his pain to gastroesophageal reflux disease, but he became concerned when the pain started to radiate down his left arm with a burning sensation.
The pain failed to radiate to the jaw or back and there was no associated nausea or vomiting.
An electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed hyperacute peaked T waves in leads V2 through V5.
A STAT echocardiogram showed a mid internal wall with mildly hypokinetic and the apex with moderate akinesis.
In the Emergency Room, the patient's nausea and vomiting was initially thought to be secondary to infarct (ischemia), however, likely secondary to the 300 mcg of Fentanyl plus 6 mg of morphine received at the outside hospital.
Coronary artery disease risk factors include smoking - one pack per day for 25 years and hyperlipidemia with an LDL of 209.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 80.
General:  Well-developed, well-nourished male in no acute distress.
NO jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex.
Extremities:  No no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 47-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia and tobacco abuse who presented to an out hospital with chest pain/burning that radiated to his left shoulder.
Electrocardiogram showed anterior T wave changes and an electrocardiogram showed hypokinetic anterior wall with an akinetic apex.
He was started on pravastatin because of a history of muscle aches with Lipitor.
He initially was going to go to the catheterization laboratory in two days, on a Monday, however, he continually complained of pain and some ST segments were still elevated, therefore, he was sent to the catheterization laboratory on [**3-20**], a day early.
The catheterization revealed a right dominant system with single vessel coronary artery disease.
The left anterior descending artery had diffuse proximal 30-40% lesions and a distal 80% lesion at the second diagonal branch.
The left circumflex artery had mild luminal irregularities.
The right coronary artery was notable for a small to moderate size proximal aneurysm and mild plaguing in its mid portion.
There was a 70% lesion in the right posterior descending artery.
Minimal resting hemodynamic measurements revealed mild systemic hypotension to low normal normotension and [**Month (only) **] rhythm.
Left ventriculography revealed an estimated ejection fraction of 50% and no significant mitral regurgitation.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and a 0% residual stenosis.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He was instructed to take one to two weeks off from work with absolutely no heavy lifting and no smoking.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction, status post a stent to the mid left anterior descending.
Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.3 mg prn chest pain.
