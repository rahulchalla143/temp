She was found to have a RLE DVT and bilateral PE's with RLL infarct.
The patient did well initially, then on [**5-27**] she became acutely confused with expressive aphasia, was incontinent and stopped obeying commands.
MRI inconclusive due to artifact.
On the evening of [**5-27**], she  developed hypercarbic respiratory failure (pH 7.1 / pCO2 95), leading to intubation.
She was also briefly on Vanc/Zosyn out of concer for PNA, however, RLL CXR findings felt secondary to pulm infarct and sputum culture was non-revealing.
She was also treated for a UTI with most recent negative urine culture.

There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect or large vascular territorial infarction.
There is relative hypoattenuation of the periventricular white matter, denoting chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
No acute fracture is detected.
There is mild mucosal thickening within the ethmoid, sphenoid, and left maxillary sinuses (2:9).
CXR [**2158-5-29**] 5:31 PM Contour of the right diaphragmatic pleural surface suggests small effusion.
At the periphery of the right lower lung is a small region of consolidation which could be infection or infarction.
Aside from linear atelectasis at the left base left lung is clear.
No acute intracranial process, specifically no intracranial hemorrhage detected within the limitations of this study.
Evidence of chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
CXR [**2158-6-1**]: There is moderate cardiomegaly.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small, larger on the right side.
There is no pneumothorax.
Superimposed infection in the right lower lobe cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.

She was weaned off the ventilator on HD2 without complications.
The patient has a chronic respiratory acidosis which is likely from obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
The combination of these factors, as well another acute insult (pulmonary embolus) may have resulted in acute respiratory failure.
# PE/DVT, acute: At the OSH the patient was diagnosed with occlusive thrombus in 2 soleal deep calf veins and bilateral PE with RLL infarct.
Underlying etiology of hyper-coagulable state at this time is unclear, but she likely has an inherited hypercoagulable condition, given her family history.
She should also have age-appropriate cancer screenings (mammogram, colonoscopy).
# Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: Diagnosed clinically and serologically in [**3-/2158**], although she has not had an EMG to confirm the diagnosis.
Her primary MG signs are diplpoia and ptosis which at this moment she only demonstrates left eye ptosis and no fatigue on sustained up gaze.
# Nocturnal agitation and confusion suspected metabolic encephalopathy: overnight on [**5-31**] and [**6-1**], she became agitated and confused, claiming that her roommate was engaged in inappropriate behavior and verbally abusing staff.
She did not exhibit this behavior during the daytime, and could not recall details of the events at night.
# Latent TB: Patient has a history of +PPD and therefore was started on treatment in [**3-/2158**] prior to starting immunosuppressive meds for MG. - continued isoniazid 300 mg PO DAILY and pyridoxine 50 mg PO DAILY .
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine  #Hematuria: developedo n [**6-5**] PM, no gross clots being passed, painless.
