Admission Date:  [**2115-1-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2115-1-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2050-8-10**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE/[**Location (un) 259**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year-old female with a complex medical history significant for seizure disorder and cerebrovascular accident in the past, also with a history of deep venous thrombosis and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin who presented to an outside hospital two days prior to admission with left sided weakness, question of slurred speech.
Workup at the outside hospital was notable for a negative head CT on [**1-4**] and [**1-5**] with some improvement in her left sided weakness on [**1-5**], but appeared to have a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course over 36 hours.
Since the day of admission she was noted to have myoclonic type twitching with right nasal labial fold and right upper extremity.
The course at the outside hospital was notable for heparinization for atrial fibrillation and history of deep venous thrombosis as well as a temperature spike to 102.
At her baseline the patient is quite debilitated, bed bound and has not walked in one year, but is typically conversant and oriented.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end stage renal disease on hemodialysis three times per week, hypertension, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with an EF of greater then 50%, chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, history of right hip fracture, status post pontine cerebrovascular accident, MSR bacteremia, C-diff colitis, bipolar disorder with paranoia status post total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, history of deep venous thrombosis and history of seizures, currently on Lamictal.
Her oropharynx was with dry mucous membranes.
Her lungs demonstrated decreased breath sounds with poor effort and some bibasilar crackles.
Responds to pain without localizing.
General movements of bilateral arms.
Corneal reflexes positive.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 64 year-old left handed female with a history of seizures presented with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], change in mental status acutely, tonic eye deviation and twitch essentially appeared as an akinetic mute.
It was doubtful that such lesion exists to cause a kinetic mutism, but left weakness may have been post ictal [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis.
It was thought that the patient was most likely in status epilepticus, although an ischemic lesion could not be ruled out.
The phenobarbital load with the Ativan resulted in an immediate change in her mental status with more responsiveness and better control of motor activity.
An electroencephalogram was performed that demonstrated electrical activity in the frontal lobes that could have been consistent with epileptiform activity, but showed no acute seizure activity while on the phenobarbital.
An MRI/MRA of her brain to look for intracranial circulation defects and evidence of new ischemia was negative suggesting that the patient had not had a new acute infarct.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and found to have an elevated troponin I of 9.3 with a negative CKMB.
It was unclear whether this was secondary to cardiac ischemia, renal failure or congestive heart failure or a combination of above.
Echocardiography was performed on [**2115-1-8**] demonstrating no new wall motion abnormalities and an EF of greater then 55% and an increase in mitral regurgitation compared to prior echocardiogram.
Because of the normal CK and no electrocardiogram changes with a normal echocardiogram, it was decided that she is not having an acute ischemic event and that her mitral regurgitation be treating increasing after load reduction.
The patient was placed on heparin for atrial fibrillation on admission and on discharge she will be recoumadinized with a goal INR of 2.3 and covered with Lovenox until the goal INR is reached.
Renal:  The patient remained on hemodialysis during the hospital stay and there were no acute issues.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia or atelectasis.
Endocrine:  The patient has a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with somewhat labile blood sugar by finger stick ranging from a low of 47 to a high of 500.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient had swallowing evaluation to ensure that the seizure activity had not left her with a diminished ability to swallow or increased risk for aspiration pneumonia.
It was decided that she would need to be maintained on honey thick liquids and a soft pureed diet as she demonstrated some risk for aspiration with thin liquids.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Seizure disorder with a history of cerebrovascular accident, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
