Admission Date:  [**2143-8-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-9-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-10-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14385**] Chief Complaint: 49F h/o probable alcoholic liver disease presents c/o abdominal distention, diarrhea/abdominal cramps, and jaundice.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: For the past several weeks the pt has experienced diarrhea, a gassy/bloated sensation, and abdominal distention.
The distention has increased progressively over the past weeks.
She also now notes that the proximal portion of her lower extremities are also swollen and there are increased visible spider veins.
She now eats very little because eating makes the diarrhea and symptoms worse.
Nothing has made her symptoms better.
During her detox programs she never experienced withdrawal symptoms, including no seizures or DTs.
At the end of [**2143-6-23**] she noticed that her liver felt hard.
The pt also experienced some nausea and itchy skin.
She denies melena or vomiting.
Pt reports no h/o blood transfusions or travel to places endemic w/ hepatitis virus.
No hepatitis vaccination.
No long-term of high-dose use of hepatotoxic drugs.
No recent trauma or abd/pelvic operations.
She denies changes of mental status.
She has had trouble sleeping, which she attributes to both her symptoms and anxiety, but she does not get tired during the day.
ROS (In addition to those above):  Pt notes occasional palpitations.
She has also had shallow, dry, and nonproductive cough for several weeks.
No history of bleeding or hypercoagulation problems.
Past Medical History: Probable alcoholic liver disease s/p appendectomy as a child.
She has had no abnormal mammograms or pap smears.
[**Name2 (NI) **] family history of liver disease or bleeding disease.
Nails without clubbing or cyanosis.
No suspicious nevi.
No rash, petechiae, or ecchymoses.
Sclerae slightly jaundiced.
Trachea midline.
Thyroid not enlarged and without nodules.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No wheezes, rales or ronchi.
Diffuse tenderness, most localized in the lower abdomen.
Flank dullness, shifting dullness, and fluid wave are present.
No rebound tenderness.
No CVA tenderness.
No LE edema.
Red spider-like vascular markings on her upper LE.
No evidence of swelling or deformity.
1) Liver disease: Alcoholic liver disease was the presumptive diagnosis due to history while awaiting other labs.
The possibility of an autoimmune etiology contributing to her liver disease was initially unclear.
During this hospitalization [**Doctor First Name **] was 1:1200 with IgG >150% of nml, however, liver biopsy showed no evidence of autoimmune hepatitis.
Seroids not started at this time due to pt's pulmonary infection and unclear benefit in addition to [**Name (NI) 57563**].
A post-pyloric feeding tube was placed on HD 5 for nutritional support.
Transjugular bx on HD7 showed: 1) Moderate lobular predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate with numerous intracytoplasmic hyaline and mild fatty change; 2)Trichrome stain shows marked sinusoidal fibrosis with architectural distortion.
No definite cirrhosis seen.
Reticulin stain evaluated; 3) No features  of autoimmune hepatitis are seen; 4) No iron seen on special stain; Note: The findings are consistent with toxic metabolic injury.
However, due to increased ALT and AST on HD20, Prednisone 20mg was reinstituted.
Ascites: Very small volume ascites on HD1.
Diuretics later held due to hyponatremia.
The patient experienced increased distention over several days and she remained distended throughout hospitalization.
Encephalopathy: The patient had Grade I throughout most of the hospitalization (subtle asterixis, drowsiness, agitation, and mild confusion).
On HD 18 lactulose was discontinued due to increasing abdominal distention with tympanitic bowel and diarrhea with > 5 BM per day.
Patient developed increasing somnolence and confusion on HD 25.
Esophageal Varices: 3 cords of grade I-II varices in the lower [**11-24**] of esophagus.
No stigmata of bleeding.
Friability, erythema, and congestion in the stomach body and antrum compatible with moderate portal hypertensive gastropathy.
2) Renal Failure BUN and Cr always WNL on admission.
Decreased urine output starting on HD8, concerning for hepatorenal.
She responded well to IVF w/ increased urine output.
On HD21-22 her urine output started to decline again and she began to have significant volume overload.
In the MICU she continued to have minimal urine output.
Renal was consulted and felt urine sediment was consistent with pre-renal/hepatorenal, rather than ATN.
3) Hypoxemia On HD26 patient developed hypoxic respiratory distress with oxygen saturation that decreased to 86% off nasal cannula and increasing respiratory rate.
CXR showed pulmonary edema likely due to volume overload from renal failure.
ABG was within normal limits, however, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for more aggressive monitoring due to her respiratory status and decreased UOP with possible need for hemodialysis.
4) Pneumonia Presumed pneumonia on admission treated with levofloxacin and metronidazole.
Later in hospitalization, the patient was treated for a possible nosocomial pneumonia with 10 days of levofloxacin and zosyn.
CXR with infiltrates suggesting PNA.
Pt had high WBC throughout hospitalization.
5) Clostridium Difficile colitis Patient had three negative C diff toxins from [**Date range (1) 57564**].
Diarrhea seemed to be improving by HD20.
However, she was having large volume diarrhea prior to transfer to the MICU on HD26.
She was started on Metronidazole for emipiric C diff treatment and stool cultures were obtained which came back positive for C diff.
6) FEN Pt has had intermittent hyponatremia, most likely caused by increased ADH as a result of decreased effective intravascular volume, as well as body stressors (N/V, pain).
This was treated with holding the diuretics and fluid restriction.
Patient's hyponatremia continued to worsen with Na of 119.
A post pyloric feeding tube was placed on HD5 for aggressive tube feeds due to poor PO intake.
8) Code Status: On HD 26 patient was transferred to the intensive care unit due to respiratory distress and anuria.
A family meeting was arranged with her husband, brother, the liver attending, MICU attending and renal attending.
