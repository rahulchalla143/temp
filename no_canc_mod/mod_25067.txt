Pathology Report DIFFICULT CROSSMATCH AND/OR EVALUATION OF IRREGULAR ANTIBODIES Study Date of [**2167-11-6**] DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a diagnosis of anti-K antibody at outside hospital which was confirmed at [**Hospital1 18**].
A wallet card and a letter stating the above will be sent to the patient.
EGD [**2167-11-5**]: Small hiatal hernia No bleeding site noted Previous duodenal resection with end to side anastomosis of the distal bulb Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Abdominal Xray [**2167-11-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of obstruction.
If there is no prior imaging through this area, then a CT scan would be recommended for further assessment.
Focal bone lesion in the left proximal femur.
Abnormal ossification involving the anterior abdominal wall communicating with the costochondral junctions of the lower ribs and sternum is in keeping with heterotopic ossification after either surgery or trauma.
No evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.
Multiple matted small bowel loops abutting the lower anterior abdominal wall suggests adhesions.
The aorta is minimally unfolded and slightly calcified.
No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified.
Suture material at the duodenal bulb.
No active bleeding site or ulcer (s) seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 y/o M with multiple episodes of GI bleeding over past year, with duodenal ulcers and polyps identified, presenting with guaiac positive stools and significant hematocrit drop over past 72 hrs.
GI Bleed: Pt initially presented with melena and was found to have Hct of 18.
The GI team subsequently performed a small bowel capsule study that also did not reveal any site of intra-abdominal bleeding.
Pt did not complain of further episodes of melena during hospital admission and was monitored on telemetry without any significant events.
Fever: Upon transfer from ICU to floor, pt developed fevers peaking at 102.
At the onset of his fevers, he complained of abdominal pain, distention, and difficulties passing flatus.
Pt was started on IV cipro, flagyl, and vancomycin for possible intra-abdominal infection.
A CT abdomen revealed old changes from his prior surgery but no acute intra-abdominal process.
WBC decreased from 13 at time of fevers to 5 by time of discharge.
CT Findings: A CT abdomen was performed to evaluate for intra-abdominal process that could be causing pt's fevers and abdominal pain.
The CT was negative for acute processes but revealed several incidental findings that pt confirmed were due to his prior bowel surgery.
These included abnormal ossifications of the anterior abdominal wall and multiple matted small bowel loops consistent with adhesions.
He was also noted to have a proximal femoral lesion suspicious for fibrous dysplasia which per patient was due to a bone biopsy he had had in the past.
He also had an IVC filter with struts extending beyond the lumen of the inferior vena cava.
Iron Deficiency Anemia: Pt had hx of iron deficiency anemia and was taking daily ferrous sulfate supplements.
His ferrous sulfate was temporarily discontinued while he was in the hospital to better distinguish between melena and dark stools and because he complained of constipation.
He was discharged back on his home ferrous sulfate with the addition of a stool softener.
Hyperlipidemia: No acute issues.
Disp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Melena Fever  Secondary: Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with dark stools and found to have a very low blood count.
Your blood counts rose with the transfusion and you were transferred to the general medicine floor where you complained of abdominal pain and were found to have a fever.
An x-ray of the abdomen and a CT scan of the abdomen did not show any acute process.
You were started on IV antibiotics for your fever and abdominal pain and improved significantly.
