He has severe aortic stenosis, a preserved ejection fraction and was turned down for a redo sternotomy in [**Location (un) 35240**].
He has atrial fibrillation and is not on Coumadin because he has severe bruising, even on aspirin alone.
He has had significant bleeding complications after both knee surgery and his initial cardiac surgery and thus was felt to be a very poor candidate for redo sternotomy.
Mr [**Known lastname 88953**] reports increasing fatigue and shortness of breath.
He reports a constant chest discomfort with activity.
He denies any admissions, new events or problems, medications changes since last visit.
He continues to report chest pressure with ambulation of about 100 feet.

Evaluated to be prohibitively extreme risk surgical candidate.
Admitted for TAVI/Corevalve trial.
Active Issues: # Critical AS- Patient with history of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.
On HD 1 he underwent percutaneous placement of a 29 mm CoreValve percutaneous aortic valve.
Aortography demonstrated mild aortic regurgitation (1+), and trans-esophageal echocardiography showed mild (1+) paravalvular aortic regurgitation.
Echocardiogram performed prior to discharge indicated that corevalve prosthesis was in place and well sealed with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
# Rhythm- The patients pre-op EKG demonstrated a native RBBB, and given the risk of post procedure conduction abnormalities a temporary pacemaker was placed.
He did not develop complete heart block and so temporary pacemaker was removed on HD3/POD2.
Additionally he was noted to have bradycardia to the low 30s with some dizziness and nausea.
At time of discharge pt had ECG showing rate controlled afib and RBBB.
# Chronic Diastolic Dysfunction: Patient appeared euvolemic on admission.
# AF with pauses: Patient had occasional pauses lasting [**2-2**] secs noted on tele, always asymptomatic.
# CAD: Stable.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location 88961**] Health [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 269**] [**Location (un) 2624**] NY  Discharge Diagnosis: Severe Aortic Stenosis s/p percutaneous CoreValve placement Coronary artery disease Dyslipidemia Diabetes Mellitus type 2 Hypertension Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had severe aortic valve disease and had the valve replaced using a CoreValve.
Your chest pain has improved.
You have atrial fibrillation and some pauses while you are sleeping, so a pacemaker was placed.
Please let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] know if you have any bleeding trouble on the Dabigatron.
