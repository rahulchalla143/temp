Admission Date:  [**2110-8-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-9-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-6-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD  History of Present Illness: 60 year old female with COPD and psoriatic arthritis admitted [**8-27**] with hematemesis over one day.
She reported a 2 week productive cough with post-tussive emesis that was initially nonbloody.
The day of admission, pt experienced post-tussive emesis and noticed that vomit was brown.
By the afternoon of the day of admission, pt noted hematemesis which she attributed to a self-limited episode of epistaxis, but the blood increased in volume with two subsequent occurences of emesis, with clots in the third.
She's also had increasing dyspnea on exertion and some right sided abdominal pain.
This pain has been present for five days, constant, though with fluctuating intensity; she has no idea what makes the pain better or worse, specifically denying eating as a trigger.
Her stool was dark and guaiac positive, and an NGL lavage initially showed coffee grounds and clot but cleared with 100cc lavage.
She was given 1unit of pRBCs, 3units of FFP, and vitamin K and transferred to the MICU.
No intervention done.
Floor course (#1): As pt also complained of a severe cough and was noted to have a h/o + PPD, her sputum was sent for AFBx3, which were ultimately negative.
While on the floor, she began to develop malaise, fevers, and chest and back pain.
Pt also developed a rising fever curve, from 99's, then up to 102 and 104 with rigors and hypotension (SBP 90s, baseline in 130s), and tachycardia (110s-130s).
MICU course (#2): Urine and blood Cx eventually grew pansensitive E. coli.
She denies dysuria, noting that her urine has gotten more clear; she does have some urinary frequency.
No shakes or chills.
She is starting to have some of the achiness in her back and neck, which is chronic and has been relieved by oxycodone.
She has had periods of abstinence of up to "months"; she has never had seizures or withdrawn.

Healed ulcer was seen in the antrum 3.
Abnormal mucosa in the stomach .
Small ascites.
No discrete abscess collection, as clinically questioned.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Diffuse interlobular septal thickening, probably related to CHF, less likely infectious or inflammatory.
Consider direct visualization, if no recent colonic evaluation has been performed.
[**9-1**] echo: EF 60-65%, mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**] and aortic dilation .
CXR [**9-4**]: Stable appearance of prominent interstitial markings which represent emphysema and bronchiectasis.
Hepatitis B Surface Antigen NEGATIVE Hepatitis B Surface Antibody POSITIVE Hepatitis B Virus Core Antibody NEGATIVE Hepatitis A Virus Antibody NEGATIVE Pos/Neg Hepatitis B Core Antibody, IgM NEGATIVE Hepatitis A Virus IgM Antibody NEGATIVE HEPATITIS C SEROLOGY ***Hepatitis C Virus Antibody POSITIVE***   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 60f with pmhx of COPD and psoriatic arthritis admitted with cough and UGIB noted to have [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear on EGD with new dx of Hepatitis C.  1.
UGIB: Recent GIB [**2-6**] [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear seen on EGD; patient also had healed ulcer in the antrum.
No vomiting since admission to hospital.
Her INR was 1.6 at presentation and is currently 1.3; this may be related to underlying liver disease.
Urosepsis: Patient had episodes of fever and hypotension described above.
Repeat blood and urine have been negative thus far (most recent blood/urine drawn: [**9-4**] at ~9:30 for low grade temp).
Cough: Had a history of cough for > 2 weeks; she has cough at baseline, which may be related to her tobacco use.
Also question mold allergy given mold in her house and the fact that her cough has improved since coming to hospital.
RUQ pain/elevated LFTs: RUQ pain on admission, pain now resolved.
She does have some transaminities (with AST:ALT ratio >2:1), an elevated INR, low albumin (currently 3.1) and platelets (70s) and some ascites, all indicative of liver pathology.
Likely due to UGIB but may also have some degree of chronic anemia, possibly due to bone marrow effects of alcohol.
Likely due to chronic liver, given alcohol and hep C. Also has splenomegaly on CT; may represent sequestration.
Coagulopathy: The patient had an elevated INR on admission.
Again likely due to liver disease.
Psoriatic arthritis: Patient initially had pruritis of left upper arm c/w her usual psorias flare.
