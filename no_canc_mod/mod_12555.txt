The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by right upper lobe pneumothorax treated with chest tube placement and subsequent right lower lobe collapse, now status post pleurodesis.
The patient's other medical history is significant for chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Hepatitis C and prostate cancer.
The patient awoke on the morning of [**1-4**], with acute onset of shortness of breath, tachypnea, palpitations and worsening weakness.
He also reported right sided pleuritic chest pain and cough with reddish sputum.
The patient presented to outside hospital where he was hypoxic, hypotensive and in rapid atrial fibrillation.
In the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 188**], the patient was noted to be anemic and have an elevated INR to 4.8.
Chest x-ray revealed reticular nodule pattern on the left and a CT scan angiogram revealed left-sided pulmonary emboli.
On review of systems, the patient reported dyspnea, bilateral lower extremity edema, weakness and poor appetite.
He denied chest pain except for the pleuritic chest pain described above, fevers, chills or melena.
There was no nausea or vomiting.
Adeno lung cancer status post right upper lobe resection; status post right middle lobe wedge resection; status post pneumothorax and status post right sided collapse and subsequent pleurodesis.
Atrial fibrillation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.
In general, he is a cachectic male, conversive in mild respiratory distress.
Neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.
Left toes with arterial insufficiency changes.
Chest x-ray showed moderate cardiomegaly, right upper pneumothorax unchanged, and some fluid within the resection cavity.
CT angiogram showed multiple filling defects in the left main and smaller arteries.
It also demonstrated emphysema in the left upper and left lower lobe as well as reticular opacities in the right lower lobe consistent with infection of lymphangitic spread.
He had lower extremity non-invasive studies done on [**1-10**], which showed deep venous thrombosis in the popliteal vein and in the calf veins on the left.
The patient continued to have oxygen requirement of 40 to 50% by face mask.
Rapid atrial fibrillation:  This was initially caused by his Diltiazem drip plus/minus an Esmolol drip.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient was treated with a steroid taper as well as his Serevent, Flovent, Atrovent and Albuterol inhalers.
Pneumonia:  The patient was treated with Vancomycin for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum and Levofloxacin for Klebsiella in his sputum.
Management of his multiple medical problems as initiated in the Intensive Care Unit was continued.
The patient continued to have a stable but elevated oxygen requirement.
Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli status post IVC Filter placement.
