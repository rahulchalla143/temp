The patient was transferred from [**Hospital 1036**] Nursing Home to [**Hospital1 26200**] and to [**Hospital6 256**] for fever to 102.8 axillary with coarse rhonchi and a distended abdomen.
At [**Hospital1 26200**], he received Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and Flagyl for a presumed bacterial source of infection that was primarily located in the abdomen.
The patient had previously been on Ceftin for four days for a urinary tract infection which he has repeatedly.
The patient denies any other symptoms in terms of increased sputum production, chills, myalgias or headache.
He did have diarrhea on the day prior to presentation but no nausea or vomiting.
The patient has had complications from multiple sclerosis of paraplegia, and he is only able to shake both upper extremities.
He has had repeated pneumonia requiring constant oxygen with an FIO2 of approximately 50% and prophylactic Tobramycin nebulizers q12 hours.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  This was a middle-aged quadriplegic young man in no apparent distress.
His exam was significant for a tracheostomy with clear, faint tan secretions that were suctioned approximately every hour.
His chest had diffuse rhonchi throughout with no wheezes.
His abdomen was distended and tympanitic, but there was no tenderness, no rebound and no guarding nor organomegaly.
Extremities:  No lower extremity edema.
CT scan of the abdomen showed questionable colonic obstruction and small bowel obstruction with some thickening of the early jejunum and bilateral lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis.
The patient had a CT scan which initially showed thickening of the jejunum which was not read in the official report, however, concerning for surgery as well.
He was continued on the Ceftriaxone for another three days to complete a course of treatment for a urinary tract infection, and Flagyl was continued until Clostridium difficile toxin came back negative.
He did not have an impressive urinalysis for a bladder infection at our hospital, and urine cultures were negative on the day of discharge.
There was no acute change in his neurologic status.
