CXR [**5-29**]: Unchanged appearance of the chest without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Renal size asymmetry is stable, but raises the possibility of underlying renal artery stenosis and clinical correlation is suggested.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old man with CHF, CRF (baseline Cr 1.7), CAD and COPD who presents from ED after developing asymptomatic hypotension and acute on chronic renal failure after taking his blood pressure medications.
Chronic pain: Mr. [**Known lastname **] suffers from chronic pain in his left hip s/p hip replacement ([**2135**]) and pain in his left shoulder secondary to bursitis.
He had previously been treated at the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1193**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1194**] Center ([**2137**]) for left hip pain.
After four doses of MS Contin, he developed lethargy and hypotension and was referred to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department.
It was also felt that his blood pressure medications had been given all together and this compounded his drop in blood pressure.
Due to the potential for MS Contin misuse in addition to the above concerns, he was changed to percocet for pain control.
He will follow up with the [**Hospital1 **] pain center as an outpatient and will continue with Mind Body Program.
He was noted to be in non-oliguric acute renal failure.
As his creatinine responded to fluids, the renal team felt that the etiology of his renal failure was pre-renal.
Renal US showed asymmetric sized kidneys.
Hypotension:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with persistent hypotension despite boluses of NS in the ED.
After work-up in MICU, the differential was narrowed to include hypotension from dehydration vs. med related hypotension.
A renal US was done on admission to evaluate cause of ARF which showed that the patient had asymmetric sized kidneys and raised the possibility of renal artery stenosis in the setting of starting an ACE-I.
They recommended home therapy at BiPAP 16/13 with 100 mL of dead space and 4 liters of O2.
We recommend that the patient undergo outpatient evaluation by hematology for chronically low hematocrit.
CAD:  He did have one episode of epigastric abdominal discomfort while in hospital for which he had serial EKGs and serial enzymes, which did not show any evidence of an ongoing acute coronary syndrome.
His Is/Os and weights were closely monitored and he remained asymptomatic from this perspective.
Depression: He was maintained on Lexapro for depression.
