[**2188-4-29**]:ERCP with 10 Fr biliary stent [**2188-4-29**]: 8 Fr drain to R subhepatic fluid collection [**2188-4-30**]: Angiogram   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year old female with history of decompensated alcoholic and HCV cirrhosis, HRS, hyponatremia, SBP, ascites, grade 1 varices, recently admitted to the [**Hospital 18**] medical liver service for acute renal failure who presents today for a liver transplant.
The [**Last Name (un) **] was thought to be due to HRS and the Hyponatremia was hypervolemic hyponatremia due to fluid excess, likely related to her cirrhosis as well.
They were planning serial paracenteses every 1-2 weeks and she has been taking cipro empirically for SBP prophylaxis.
Currently she is complaining of a persistent abdominal pain (states same as last hospitalization).
The pain is around her umbilicus, sharp, [**10-13**] and worse with movement.
She has no other complaints at this time.

The patient was noted to start having tonic-clonic seizures, Neuro was consulted, she was started on Keppra and received an additional hemodialysis treatment.
On POD 14, due to these findings, an ERCP was performed showing mild diffuse dilation at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 10 mm.
The duct-to-duct anastomosis site appeared patent.
A balloon sweep was performed through the anastomotic site with minimal resistance.
An occlusion cholangiogram revealed extravasation of contrast most likely from the right hepatic system consistent with a high grade bile leak.
Of note, there was a 3mm stomach body ulcer noted.
TSH was checked and found to be elevated at 7.3 with T4 of 7.1.
An ultrasound/duplex of liver was done to assess for collection.
Findings were notable for high velocity in hepatic artery concerning for hepatic artery stenosis, large sub-hepatic fluid collection, large amount of abdominal and pelvic ascites adn small right pleural effusion.
Zosyn was started for infected bile collection.
Findings were notable for moderate stenosis just beyond anastomosis.
Generalized anasarca with intra-abdominal ascites and multiple collections identified, the largest of which is in the pelvis, as described above.
No evidence for intra-abdominal or pelvic bleed to explain the patient's recent drop in hematocrit.
Per report,  100 mL of blood-tinged fluid removed.
No further fluid could be aspirated despite the drain being in satisfactory position, which raises the possibility of a loculated collection.
100 mL of straw-colored fluid was aspirated through the existing right-sided 8French pigtail catheter, which was left in place.
Gram stain of fluid was no organisms or PMNs, culture was negative.
