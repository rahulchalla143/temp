# Altered mental status:  Likely multifactorial in origin, secondary to multiple causes of hypercarbic respiratory failure (OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, COPD exacerbation and possible PNA), worsened by excessive sedating medications, probable RML pneumonia, and UTI.
The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure was treated with BiPAP, steroids and antibiotics.
COPD exacerbation/PNA:  The patient reports a cough for many days prior to admission.
She reported that it is productive of yellow sputum.
The patient's COPD at baseline was likely exacerbated from this acute illness.
She had improvement of respiratory symptoms and oxygenation after using BiPAP overnight, started on steroids, and given levofloxacin for possible RML infiltrate, even though the PA/Lateral did not show definite infiltrate.
Therefore, pneumonia is less likely, but still a possibility and should be treated as such with a ten day course of levofloxacin 750mg QOD (last day [**2176-6-28**]).
If the patient develops worsening symptoms including fevers, increasing sputum production, then MRSA PNA should be considered, although very unlikely, given MRSA on [**2174**] sputum culture, and Vancomycin 1gm should be started empirically.
The patient should also continue chest PT, guaifenesin and benzonate for symptomatic relief.
CHF:  The patient was not in decompensated heart failure on admission.
Also the patient did not appear volume overloaded.
# Acute renal failure:  The patient had a mild increase in her creatinine on admission, up to 1.3 on admission.
Chronic pain/BL Knee pain:  Gabapentin, oxycontin and oxycodone were held on admission considering altered mental status.
# Access: Peripheral IV .
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
DuoNeb 0.5-2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 11729**] Home - [**Location (un) 686**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Delirium of multifactorial etiology, resolved Hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure community-acquired pneumonia Obstructive Sleep apnea  Secondary Diagnoses: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Diabetes mellitus type II Hypothyroidism Osteoarthritis   Discharge Condition: Alert, oriented to person, [**Hospital1 **], and conversant, responding to questions appropriately, neurologic exam grossly intact, breathing comfortably, O2Sat at baseline 92-93% on 2 litres nasal cannula.
You also received treatment for your sleep apnea and a pneumonia.
You were started on an antibiotic for the pneumonia and your symptoms improved.
Please contact your physician or return to the emergency room if you have worsening of confusion, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms.
