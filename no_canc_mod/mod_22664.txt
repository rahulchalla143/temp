Small amount of perihepatic ascites with no suitable pocket marked for paracentesis.
Gallbladder wall edema, likely secondary to third spacing of fluids.
[**4-13**] abd u/s: IMPRESSION: Left lower quadrant of abdomen marked for paracentesis to be performed by the clinical staff.
Sinus tachycardia.
Low lateral precordial lead QRS voltage.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
That is probably accurate because there is a fluid level in the stomach.
There is generalized intestinal distention.
In the left upper quadrant, several loops of bowel have haustral markings suggesting that despite the redundancy, this is colon.
There is no free subdiaphragmatic air.
There are low lung volumes.
Bibasilar atelectasis have improved on the right and have worsened on the left.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
[**2186-4-19**] Portable CXR for PICC placement: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-18**], there has been placement of a right subclavian PICC line that appears to extend to the cavoatrial junction or slightly further into the right atrium.
EGD [**4-16**]: Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions 3 cords of grade III varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
There were stigmata of recent bleeding and red Whale sign.
Unable to assess for gastric varices.
Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (ligation) Blood in the whole stomach Otherwise normal EGD to stomach antrum Recommendations: qid CARAFATE Octreotide drip x 3 days PPI drip start clears in am if no recurrent bleeding If recurrent bleeding may consider TIPS .
Biospy: Liver, needle core biopsy: Established cirrhosis with prominent sinusoidal fibrosis, confirmed by Trichrome stain (Stage 4).
Moderate macrovesicular steatosis with prominent associated intracytoplasmic hyalin ballooning degeneration, and lobular neutrophilic inflammation.
Mild portal/septal mixed inflammation.
Moderate canalicular cholestasis.
Iron stain shows no iron deposition.
Note: The findings are consistent with chronic, active toxic metabolic injury.
Brief Hospital Course: 41 y/o woman presents with what appears to be acute on chronic liver failure.
# Acute on chronic liver failure: On admission, with synthetic dysfunction (INR 2.2, albumin 1.9), ascites.
No hepatic encephalopathy.
She has history of significant ETOH use, may have had underlying liver disease uncovered by the another etiology.
No history of shock for ischemic hepatitis.
Pt is at the right demographics for autoimmune hepatitis and [**Doctor First Name **] positive as well as anti-smooth antibody with high IgG; Wilson's disease is also possible.
Patient had therapeutic paracentesis on [**4-14**], with improved abdominal distention/discomfort.
Peritoneal fluid was analyzed for cytology and results were not consistent with SBP.
Patient was given vitamin K for any malnutrition component of coagulopathy.
She underwent emergent endoscopy in the ICU and 3 cords of grade III varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
There were stigmata of recent bleeding and red Whale sign.
Clotted blood was seen in the whole stomach, such that it was not possible to assess for gastric varices.
Hct ultimately stabilized, although the patient continued to pass dark guaiac-positive stool presumed to be old blood.
Needs EGD within a week of discharge, to again look for possible esophageal varices and potentially re-band.
# Hyponatremia: Seems to be intravascular volume depletion (hypovolemic hyponatremia), with 3rd spacing in ascites and mild [**Last Name (un) **] edema; Na avid state based on low urine Na.
Renal was consulted d/t concern for SIADH versus hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Patient instructed regarding low sodium diet.
# Leukocytosis/fever: WBC elevation mostly likely from acute hepatitis.
Afebrile after admission while on the floor.
# Low fibrinogen, hypercoagulable, anemia, low platelets: concern for the laboratory values reflecting a massive GI bleed and subsequent resuscitation, versus DIC.
# Hematuria: Without evidence for infection, perhaps contamination from hemorroidhal bleeding or menses.
# ETOH use: No evidence of withdrawal now, last drink [**4-10**].
# Low back soreness: believed [**1-31**] ascites and time in bed; improved with lidocaine patch and ambulation.

Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 2203**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Alcoholic liver cirrhosis Acute alcoholic hepatitis Esophageal variceal bleed Hyponatremia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with liver disease = hepatitis; studies performed to determine the cause (including lab tests, imaging, and liver biopsy) found the liver disease to be due to alcoholic cirrhosis and alcoholic liver disease / hepatitis.
You were sent to the ICU, and needed blood transfusions, blood products transfusions, urgent tying off (banding) of the bleeding esophageal blood vessels.
Afterwards, your bleeding stopped and your blood levels stabilized.
You were also found to have a very low sodium level on admission; with salt tablets and hydration, this resolved.
Now that your sodium has normalized, you have to be cautious to avoid salty food and to avoid excess salt, because of your liver disease.
Salt restriction is an important component of your well-being.
Because of your new diagnosis of liver disease, you have a number of NEW medications to take that are all extremely important to protect against the complications of liver disease (such as bleeding).
You must NOT drink any alcohol because of your new diagnosis of liver disease.
