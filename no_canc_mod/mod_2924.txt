HEENT: right sided paralysis with pstosis Pupils: R 6 L [**3-18**] EOMs: Right lateral paralyses Neck: Supple.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Extensive, diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with ventricular enlargement may represent early communicating or, less likely, obstructive hydrocephalus.
with blood layering in bilateral lateral ventricular occipital horns.
4-mm saccular left carotico-ophthalmic aneurysm, directed superiorly, with relatively wide-neck.
No significant interval change in appearance of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with slight interval decrease in size of lateral ventricles.
No new regions of hemorrhage identified.
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage which appears stable.
Hemorrhage layering in bilateral occipital horns also stable.
No new areas of hemorrhage.
Slight prominence of the ventricles and temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], unchanged since prior examination may reflect mild degree of hydrocephalus.
Decreased vessel caliber involving both posterior cerebral arteries, bilateral A2 segments, and the dominant right A1 segment which may suggest mild underlying spasm.
Mild increase in the size of the left lateral ventricle, now measuring 1.5 cm in the transverse dimension compared to the prior of 1.3 cm on the most recent CT head.
It is unclear if the mild increase in the size of the left lateral ventricle is related to obstruction at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] by the blood products/catheter dysfunction.
Consider close followup CT study to evaluate interval change or progression.
Tiny punctate possible acute infarcts, one in the right cerebellar hemisphere, and another one in the left occipital region, given by their appearance on the DWI and the ADC sequences.
Areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the cerebral sulci and in the sylvian fissures and basal cisterns and occipital horns of both alteral ventricles, as described above, better evaluated on the prior CT study.
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage stable from previous exam.
In ambulance she was noted to have R ptosis and dilated pupil and c/o occipital HA.
She was emergently brought for a cerebral angiogram and found to have a ruptured L ICA aneurysm.
On [**6-26**] she was noted to have lethargy, word finding.
CTA/P shows no spasm or infarct was pan cultured for fevers with no growth from cultures.
She did show signs of clinical vasospasm although radiographic studies were negative.
Remained on Nimodipine for vasospasm prophylaxis, she did require multiple pressors to sustain SBP and Nimodipine was d/c'd overnight.
Her exam would wax and wane and all radiographic studys were negative for spasm and infarct.
On [**7-3**] she was found to have tremors in her RUE and face.
EEG was negative for seizure.
On [**7-5**] she received a VPS and MRI/A showed a very small punctate R cerebellar and bilat pca occipital lobe infarcts.
On [**7-7**] she was noted to have new L sided weakness in whcih studies were negative for cause although strength appears symmetrical at this time.
LENIs were also negative for DVT.
