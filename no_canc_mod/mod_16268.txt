She developed chills and subjective fevers yesterday, shortly afterwards she noted insidious onset of diffuse abdominal pain.
She developed diarrhea, small volume and mucousy discharge [**4-1**] times overnight accompanied by nausea but not vomiting.
No recent sick contacts.
The pain progressed over the daytime today- it is exacerbated by movement and relents somewhat when still.
She noted severe pain during the drive to the hospital when the car hit roadbumps.
She has had very poor appetite with decreased PO over the past day.
She has no history of SBP per her report.
With regard to her liver disease, she has has had diuretic-controlled ascites, and she is currently taking spironolactone 100 mg daily (along with potassium supplementation given history of low K.) Her last upper endoscopy [**2172-4-3**] noted two cords of grade [**11-23**] varices.
She has never had bleeding esophageal varices.
Her last abdominal U/S [**2173-4-21**] was negative for liver mass lesions.
Exam was significant for exquisite abdominal pain diffusely to palpation.
CT abd/pelvis showed ?peritonitis, ascites, cirrhosis, and a normal gallbladder.
She is in pain but feels better while laying still.
In discussion with pharmacy given the plans for dose escalation of Treprostinil and the need for frequent vital sign checks, she was transferred to the MICU for close monitoring.
On arrival to the MICU, she stated that abdominal pain continued and was improved if she remained still.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Past Medical History: -Primary Biliary Cirrhosis -Hepatopulmonary hypertension diagnosed on cardiac cath(unresponsive to sildenafil, recently started on remodulin)  -Varices: upper endoscopy in [**Month (only) 116**] which showed 2 cords of grade [**11-23**] varices in the esophagus as well as varices in the fundus.

Subtle enhancement of the peritoneal surfaces, raising concern for peritonitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
Cirrhosis, with recanalization of the umbilical vein and numerous varices with ascites consistent with portal hypertension.
Evidence of cirrhosis and small volume ascites.
Mild circumferential gallbladder wall thickening, likely secondary to third spacing.

# SBP: Exam initially showing rebound and significant tenderness, thought to be SBP given her history of cirrhosis and ascites.
There was no evidence of secondary peritonitis seen on CT abdomen.
Gall bladder stone is seen on CT, which could potentially explain RUQ pain but not the diffuse abdominal pain picture.
No ascites fluid pocket was seen on U/S, so she was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and albumin 1.5mg/kg.
Drug rash [**7-19**] with Ceftriaxone, so switched to therapeutic PO Cipro.
Pt slightly volume up from MICU stay, so initially diuresed with IV lasix, and transitioned to PO home lasix of 20 QD.
Abdominal pain improved with intermittent abdominal pain throughout the hospital stay, which was controlled with tramadol.
# Hickman with drainage, concern for pocket infection: Nurse reported drainage from Hickman starting [**7-19**].
No leukocytosis.
# Hypotension: BP 80/50s on [**8-15**] after remodulin infusion uptitrated (plan was for biweekly dose uptitration managed by pt to get to goal drop in pulm pressures in hopes for liver transplant and this plan confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Not much changed from prior baseline of 90-100s/50-60s, but BPs improved back to baseline by time of discharge.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 0.9 from 0.6, likely from volume depletion as she was also hyponatremic and mildly acidotic with HCO3 20.
# Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to chronic liver disease.
- Pt discharged with 2 additional days of doxy + amoxicillin for tunnel infection from R-sided hickman.
- Pt with rash after ceftriaxone, so allergies updated.

You were admitted with abdominal pain.
We were unable to remove fluid from your belly to test for infection, so we treated you for a presumed infection.
You started to drain pus from around your tunneled line, which was concerning for an infection in the tunnel.
You will complete a course of antibiotics for your soft tissue infection from the Hickman line on the right.
