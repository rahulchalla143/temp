EMS was called mainly due to increased secretions and hypoxia however his hypoxia had resolved when EMS had arrived, on a different O2 sat monitor he was in the 90s on room air rather than in the 60s as they were initially called for.
The patient is unable to converse but is able to answer yes or no questions.
He has not felt short of breath but does have some orthopnea.
He has no functional capacity at baseline.
He denies any pain anywhere, no chest pain, no abdominal pain.
Labile blood pressures despite 3.5 liters of fluid now but intermittently with SBPs in the 80s.
rec'd levo / vancomycin zosyn, 3.5 liters of fluid as above and decadron 10mg IV x 1.  afebrile.

R arm 4/5 weakness of grip, bicep, tricep, wrist flex / extend, deltoid [**3-15**].
No significant change in the right lung consolidation, bilateral pleural effusion, and perihilar vascular engorgement is demonstrated compared to the prior study.
There is persistent collapse of the right middle and lower lobes.
Right-sided pleural effusion is seen.
There is no pneumothorax.
The cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated due to opacities from collapsed lung.
Brief Hospital Course: 53M with COPD and history of chronic respiratory failure; s/p recent trach removal at rehab and here w/ increased secretions; now s/p replacement of trach and continued labile BP of unclear etiology.
Possible pneumonia hidden within white out.
Sputum culture grew Pseudomonas and Staph aureus ??????
unclear if this was colonizer or actual infection.
COPD exacerbation also on differential given considerable wheezing on admission.
As no clear indication of active pneumonia (afebrile, slightly elevated WBC count which may be due to steroid therapy, and + culture thought to be colonizers), was started on treatment with short course of ceftaz for bronchitis.
?s level of discomfort off of vent - Flovent started [**2141-10-24**] for severe COPD  #.
Thought initially to be related to adrenal insufficiency.
No evidence of autopeep, hypovolemia, sepsis, or autonomic insufficiency.
Has history of adrenal insufficiency, now on high dose steroids.
# Schizoaffective d/o vs. schizophrenia: Per psych patient did not have capacity to refuse medical care on admission.
# Seizures: Tonic-clonic seizures in past, thought to be related to previous CVA and 'toxic metabolic disturbances' upon previous admissions.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol [**Hospital1 **]: Four (4) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Chronic vent/trach/PEG for hypercarbic respiratory failure with acute exacerbation Severe COPD Hypotension Depression Diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: On pressure support; bed bound; hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: Patient was admitted on [**2141-10-21**] with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension.
- intermittent EKGs given risk of prolonged QT on risperdal + azithromycin.
- referral to endocrinology for further management of adrenal insufficiency.
