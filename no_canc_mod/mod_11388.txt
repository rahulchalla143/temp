He presented with two weeks of worsening bright red blood per rectum, fatigue and three episodes of syncope.
The patient reports that he has had chronic internal and external hemorrhoids since his teenage years and the rest of his immediate family members also suffer from them.
He has had rectal bleeding for years, and he believes anxiety, stress, caffeine and hot weather exacerbates the bleeding, as well as large bowel movements; however, in the past two weeks, he has experienced increased bright and dark red blood per rectum, approximately three times a day.
However, he denies any history of melena or dark, tarry stools and reports no hematemesis.
On [**2158-7-8**], the patient states that he felt warm, lightheaded, developed a headache, and subsequently had a syncopal episode with a fall down a flight of stairs.
He did not suffer any lasting acute trauma from this event.
Most recently, on [**2158-7-24**], his date of admission, he woke up in the a.m. with a headache, nausea, which resulted in a green-yellow vomitus and had a syncopal event.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was evaluated for his multiple syncopal episodes.
He also complained of rectal discomfort with bowel movements, crampy lower abdominal pain radiating to the rest of the abdomen, sometimes relieved with bowel movements.
The patient noted that he had had constipation a few days ago but had been experiencing diarrhea recently.
This patient appeared pale, but resting comfortably and in no acute distress.
Moreover, an EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at the rate of 122, with ST depressions noted in leads II, III, AVF, and V4 through V6.
Chronic headaches.
Status post trauma to the head in [**2158-4-4**]:  This occurred at work at [**University/College **] [**Location (un) **], when a speaker on stage hit his head.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
He is single with no children.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Pertinent for hemorrhoids, pancreatic and breast cancer.
No history of colon cancer.
History of thalassemia [**Doctor First Name **] in his mother.
General appearance:  Resting comfortably in bed in no acute distress.
No lesions noted in oropharynx.
No rhinorrhea noted.
No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops noted.
Mild mid-epigastric tenderness.
Back with no costovertebral angle tenderness bilaterally.
Extremities with no peripheral edema.
Dermatologic: No lesions appreciated.
Colonoscopy on [**2158-7-25**]: Normal colon; no sign of lower GI bleed.
Head CT scan with contrast on [**2158-7-26**], with no evidence of chronic subdural hematoma or intracranial mass effect.
There is a small mucous retention cyst or poly in the sphenoid sinus and a few opacified ethmoid air cells; otherwise normal.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient was admitted directly to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2158-7-24**], for an acute gastrointestinal bleed and symptomatic anemia requiring two units of packed red blood cells in the Emergency Department.
The patient continued to have bright red blood per rectum and the Gastrointestinal Consultation Service was notified.
The colonoscopy revealed a normal appearing colon with the stigmata of recent bleeding and his internal and external hemorrhoids.
Subsequently, the patient received a small bowel follow through which was unremarkable and revealed no source of bleeding in the small bowel.
Given these studies, the most likely bleeding source was thought to be his internal and external hemorrhoids.
The further results of his surgical decision making and hospital course will be dictated in a separate addendum to this report.
CHRONIC HEADACHES:  The patient reports more acute headaches status post trauma to this head in [**2158-4-4**].
They indicated that a head MRI would not be necessary as this appeared to be an acute on chronic headache with a component due to post-concussive syndrome.
There also seems to be an underlying anxiety and depression, which have exacerbated the headache.
SYNCOPE:  The multiple syncopal episodes were thought to be most likely secondary to hypovolemia and anemia.
Once the patient's hematocrit and volume status was under control, there were no other incidences of syncope.
ABDOMINAL PAIN:  The patient complained of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, with positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign; however, there were no fevers or leukocytosis noted.
His pain was controlled alternately with Tylenol 325 to 650 mg p.o.
