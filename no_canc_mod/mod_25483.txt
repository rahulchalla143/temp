His GCS at the scene was 3 and he had + LOC and incontinence.
He had a cervicle collar in place and pan scanned in the Emergency Room.

HEENT: Normocephalic, with significant right scalp abrasion, There is no CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Pronator drift also deferred for RUE pain.
Right-sided cervical spine fractures involving the transverse process at C3, C4, C6, and C7.
Linear lucency at the left C6-7 facet, which may represent a nondisplaced fracture.
Right mandibular body fracture.
Acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right inferior frontal and left temporal lobes.
Possible small acute subdural hematoma along the right inferior frontal lobe.
No significant mass effect.
Acute fractures involving the right zygomatic arch and right orbital roof.
Probable fracture of the right lamina papyracea with small amount of gas in the right orbit.
Consolidation in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe most compatible with aspiration.
Gastric distention with fluid level also noted.
Right posterior eleventh rib fracture.
Extensive deformity involving the clavicles and upper rib cage likely related to a prior episode of trauma.
Please refer to CT cervical spine for description of fractures at the lower cervical spine, which are better assessed on that study.
Metallic foreign body embedded aloing the anterior left mid-lung resembling a bullet.
Dense atherosclerotic calcification along the left coronary circulation, which clinical correlation is advised.
Small fat-containing periumbilical hernia.
Prostatic enlargement.
Right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding mass effect, stable since the most recent study on [**2148-10-15**].
Stable subarachnoid hemorrhage and right frontal subdural hematoma.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal biventricular regional and global systolic function.
No change in bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.
[**2148-10-19**] Head CT : Unchanged right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild perihemorrhagic edema without significant mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or herniation.
Unchanged multifocal bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 14738**] was admitted to the Trauma ICU for neuro checks and evaluation by plastic surgery and maxillofacial surgery for his multiple facial fractures.
His pain was relieved with Morphine and he was started on prophylactic Dilantin.
He was evaluated by the Neurosurgical service for his C spine fractures and they initially  recommended  a hard collar for 8 weeks but this was changed to a soft collar for comfort only as he had no ligamentous damage.
Following transfer to the Trauma floor he continued to make good progress from a neurologic standpoint.
He had serial Head CT's done to evaluate his right frontal bleed and although he had no change in his neurologic exam he did have a small increase in his right frontal bleed but no mass effect or shift.
He was seen by the Cardiology service while in the ICU as he had some tachycardia and ventricular ectopy in the setting of hypokalemia.
Following repletion of his potassium his ectopy resolved and a cardiac echo was done which revealed a normal EF and no wall motion abnormalities.
Recommendations were to increase his beta blocker as needed to decrease his heart rate.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2866**] from OMFS evaluated Mr. [**Known lastname 16184**] mandibular fracture and opted for conservative treatment for now and a liquid diet.
A wallet card and paperwork from the blood bank will be mailed to his home.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. right mandible fracture 2. right frontal bone fracture 3. right zygomatic arch fracture 4. tiny SAH 5.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 8 weeks (neurosurgery) You needs a non-contrast head CT and a non-contrast C-spine CT at that time so let the secretary know when you call.
