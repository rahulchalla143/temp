She was taken to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital where a head CT revealed 3 IPH's (2 right frontal and 1 left parietal/occipital) and a small SAH in the ambient cistern along with vasogenic edema.
She was given decadron and dilantin and had no complaints.
ROS was negative for headache/CP/SOB/Vision changes/noticed neurologic deficits/seizures.
She was also found to have a dislocated left elbow.
Language: Speech fluent - No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Limited by patient but appears to be intact to light touch  Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric bilaterally  Toes mute  Coordination: unable to be tested   Pertinent Results: [**2120-10-12**] 10:15PM URINE  BLOOD-SM NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-5.0 LEUK-NEG [**2120-10-12**] 04:45AM   GLUCOSE-113* UREA N-19 CREAT-1.1 SODIUM-138 POTASSIUM-4.5 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-17 [**2120-10-12**] 04:45AM   CK(CPK)-515* [**2120-10-12**] 04:45AM   cTropnT-<0.01 [**2120-10-12**] 04:45AM   CK-MB-8 [**2120-10-12**] 04:45AM   ASA-NEG ETHANOL-NEG ACETMNPHN-NEG bnzodzpn-NEG barbitrt-NEG tricyclic-NEG [**2120-10-12**] 04:45AM   WBC-5.9 RBC-3.30* HGB-11.8* HCT-34.5* MCV-105* MCH-35.7* MCHC-34.2 RDW-15.5 ---------  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70336**] IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of hemorrhage as described above.
No evidence of solid organ injury.
Prominence of the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts in this patient that is status post cholecystectomy with no obvious pancreatic head mass identified.
2.6 cm left adnexal, and 2.1 cm right adnexal cysts, abnormal in this postmenopausal patient.
---------- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70338**] IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Complete posterior dislocation at both the ulnar trochlear and radiocapitellar joints with a small associated coronoid process fracture.
Dorsal soft tissue swelling at the wrist.
No clear etiology.
No shoulder dislocation or fracture.
The previously noted dislocation has been reduced, however, there has been interval fracture through the radial neck.
Again noted is a small bony fragment likely representing fracture off the coronoid process.
-----------  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70341**] IMPRESSION:  No change in the intraparenchymal hemorrhages in the left frontal and right parietooccipital regions.
No new areas of subarachnoid blood.
The previously mentioned areas of subarachnoid blood have continued to evolve.
Upon review and radiologic studies the patient was found to have  R SAH basal cistern, R SAH/IPH occipital, L frontal SAH/IPH, L radial head fx.
Neurosurgery was consulted regarding SAH and IPH findings.
Repeat CT scans on [**10-12**] 7am and [**10-12**] 7pm showed no interval change and the patient was neurologically stable, VSS, afebrile.
Orthopedic surgery was also consulted who initially attempted to reduce the left radial fracture and dislocation.
Pt tolerated the procedure without complications.
Pt again maintained good neuro status and was afebrile VSS.
Finally the patient was transferred to trauma CC6 floor where she again remained afebrile VSS and began to work regularly with physical therapy multiple time/day and was out of bed to chair.
