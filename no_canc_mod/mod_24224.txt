Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 88113**] is a 44 y/o male transferred from JP VA for hypotension with evidence of AGMA, [**Last Name (un) **], and elevated BG suggestive of DKA.
# Hypotension: Believed to be most likely secondary to hypovolemia due to volume loss secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis.
He had an ECHO completed which did not reveal RV dilitation concerning for a PE and there was no evidence of endocarditis.
In the ED he had an extensive workup to rule out infection that might have been predisposing him to hypotension (although WBC was normal and he was afebrile), including a CT chest/abd/pelvis which did not reveal any nidus of infection.
# DKA: Had elevated BG, AG metabolic acidosis and ketonuria on admission.
He will follow up with his outpt endocrinologist in VT and was educated on warning signs of rising glucose and DKA and instructed to seek emergency care if he was unable to manage his glucose goal <200 at home.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely pre-renal azotemia secondary to hypovolemia.
# Type 1 DM: followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 57712**] at VA White River Junction in VT.
BB and ACE inhibitors were held given initial hypotension on pressor.
His home metoprolol and lisinopril were held secondary to hypotension during admission and upon discharge and can be started if needed as as outpatient.
We recommend a trial of lowering his simvastatin dose to 40mg due to risk of rhabdomyolysis on 80mg daily, if unsuccessful, atorvastatin should be considered.
