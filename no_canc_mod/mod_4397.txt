There is intraventricular extension, with a small amount of blood layering within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and presumably the left lateral ventricle which is effaced.
There is evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus with dilation of the right lateral ventricle and prominence of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] consistent with entrapment.
There is subfalcine herniation with approximately 1.5 cm of rightward midline shift.
There is moderate underlying periventricular hypoattenuation suggesting chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
CXR AP [**2137-12-4**]:  Large left intraparenchymal hemorrhage extending into the left basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain, and throughout the subcortical white matter with intraventricular extension, obstructive hydrocephalus, 1.5 cm of midline shift, and signs of impending uncal herniation.
Left retrocardiac density may reflect underlying atelectasis in the left lower lobe, though pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Atherosclerotic calcification noted along the thoracic aorta.
Left retrocardiac density, question atelectasis versus pneumonia.
The patient was pronounced dead at 12:45 pm on [**2137-12-6**], due to respiratory failure secondary associated with the intracranial hemorrhage.
