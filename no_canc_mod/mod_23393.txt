no herniation.
MRI head: Right cerebellar hemorrhage unchanged compared to recent CTs.
Little to no mass effect.
Multiple additional foci of prior parenchymal hemorrhage noted in the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, subcortical white matter and left cerebellum.
Overall, this pattern is most compatible with amyloid angiopathy.
ECHO: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT scan of the head was performed, which showed a 3.2 cm right cerebellar hemorrhage.
An MRI was subsequently performed to evaluate for possible etiologies of the bleed and this showed multiple additional foci of prior parenchymal hemorrhage in the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, subcortical white matter and left cerebellum.
These multiple microhemorrhages noted is most consistent with a diagnosis of amyloid angiopathy.
The hemorrhage secondary to the amyloid angiopathy was then likely exacerbated by the patient being coagulopathic secondary to the Coumadin the patient was on for a. fib (initial INR was 2.9).
The patient continued to note vertiginous symptoms and was started on Meclizine for symptomatic relief.
For continued elevated BP, patient was on Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Lisinopril 5 mg daily.
The patient continued to require IV doses Hydralazine despite the standing anti-HTN meds; however, one night after receiving a dose of IV Hydrlazine for a BP of 170s systolic, the patient developed an episode of epigastric pain and chest pain without radiation that was associated with lightheadedness.
Patient became hypotensive at this time with SBP into 80s.
An EKG was performed which showed ST changes concerning for ischemia.
The ST depression on EKG were transient and have since resolved.
In a separate event, patient developed a. fib episode with RVR; heart rate into 160s.
Determined to be pre-renal and was likely secondary to hypotension.
Another possibility for the elevated creatinine is the addition of Lisinopril for blood pressure control.
Heme: Hematocrit trended down after hypotensive episode with concurrent drop in Hemoglobin from 13.5 to 11.5.
Iron panel was ordered, there was no evidence of acute blood loss or iron deficiency anemia.
HTN: Patient initially required IV Hydralazine prn for BP control.
Patient initially started on lisinopril for BP control but given elevated Creatinine, this was swtiched to Amlodipine 5 mg daily, with possible need to increase to 10 mg daily in future if BP remains elevated.
Meclizine 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for vertigo.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain fever.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for c.   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: R cerebellar hemorrhage secondary to amyloid angiopathy atrial fibrillation Acute kidney injury Demand Ischemia HTN Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
A CT scan of your brain showed that there was a bleed in a part of your brain called the cerebellum, resulting in the above symptoms.
This bleed was due to something called amyloid angiopathy.
You were also started on a medication called Simvastatin for a high cholesterol.
While you were in the hospital, you had an episode of low blood pressure, which caused some EKG changes that have since returned to normal.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] also had an episode of a fast heart rate, so your Metoprolol was increased to 50 mg three times a day.
Also, on Friday [**2141-8-4**], would like you to have your kindey function checked with labwork (BUN, Creatinine) as the time you were hypotensive seemed to affect your kidneys, though function has improved with the IV fluids you received.
