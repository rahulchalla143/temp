History of Present Illness: This is a 75-year-old woman with dCHF (EF 65%) and ESRD on HD MWF p/w SOB beginning ~8 hrs prior to arrival to ED.
Patient reports increased fluid and salt intake over the holidays as well as bananas and tangerines, especially on day prior to admission.
Unfortunately, symptoms progressed throughout the day and she called EMS.
She reports orthopnea but also c/o DOE.
She also noted facial edema which she gets with CHF exacerbations but denies PND.
She also denies chest pain at rest or with exertion, palpitations, LE edema, fevers, chills, N/V, diaphoresis, change in chronic morning cough, change in weight.
Exam was notable for a woman in respiratory distress with tachypnea as well as bibasilar rales and elevated JVD.
CXR revealed increased vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions.
On arrival to the floor patient reports mild relief in symptoms.
She denies chest pain and states SOb mildly improved with oxygen.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Past Medical History: - Dyslipidemia - Hypertension - CAD s/p BMS to LCx in [**2140**] with improvement in lateral wall hypokinesis on TTE.

- Severe MR seen on cardiac cath in [**2140**] slightly better on TTE in [**5-/2143**] - End-stage renal disease of unclear etiology, [**2126**].
She does not have good venous conduits and is currently undergoing dialysis through a right subclavian access.
- Diabetes mellitus, Type 2 since [**2131**] currently diet controlled.

There is minimal interstitial edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 75-year-old woman with dCHF, ESRD on HD, and CAD admitted with acute diastolic CHF exacerbation, volume overload, and hyperkalemia after dietary non-compliance over the holidays.
# Shortness of breath: Patient presented with acute onset shortness of breath in the setting of dietary indiscretion over the holidays.
She was in mild distress on initial presentation, requiring 4L NC.
Physical exam, CXR and history were all consistent with volume overload and acute diastolic heart failure exacerbation.
Lack of leukocytosis, fever, cough, CP, or consolidation argued against another process such as PNA or PE.
# Hyperkalemia/ESRD on HD:  On initial presentation, patient met criteria for emergent HD given fluid overload and hyperkalemia.
Her ECG was without evidence of hyperkalemia.
# CAD: With fixed defect in RCA territory and BMS to LCx in [**2140**] with resultant improved cardiac function.
Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure and CHF exacerbation but this is non-specific.
No acute EKG changes and very low suspicion for ACS as cause of CHF exacerbation given admittance to dietary non-compliance over the holiday.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction via enzymes.
# Severe MR: Last TTE in [**Month (only) **] of this year (6 months ago) with slightly improved valvular function and decreased pulmonary pressures.
Currently c/b volume overload and hyperkalemia as above.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:  Questionable history.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Volume overload; Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart failure; Hyperkalemia Secondary Diagnosis: ESRD on HD, Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, O2 sats mid 90s on room air  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with elevated potassium and shortness of breath.
This was most likely related to your dietary intake of lots of fluids and high potassium foods on [**Holiday **] day.
You were treated with dialysis and your symptoms of shortness of breath as well as your potassium levels improved.
