No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Dilated common bile duct measuring 8 mm.
Pancreas not visualized due to overlying midline bowel gas.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite pulmonary vascular congestion.
Probable small effusions on the lateral view.
Some increased opacification at the left base medially is consistent with atelectatic change.

# Pancreatitis: Likely related to gallstones.
CBD diameter of 8 mm is concerning for obstruction.
ERCP and surgery were consulted in emergency department, and patient underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy/sphicteroplasty and removal of 8 stones and sludge.
He was started and continued on Unasyn for abdominal flora.
He was started on IVF for his pancreatitis and his pain was controlled with dilaudid prn.
His pain was controlled and he tolerated clear liquids well without nausea or emesis.
# Post pancreatitis ileus The patient had significant abdominal distention following his transfer out of the ICU without abdominal pain.
However, he appears mildly dyspneic.
On the day of discharge his serum HCO3 was elevated, likely reflecting increased CO2 retention in the setting of increased oxygen via nasal cannula the previous day in response to some subjective dyspnea in the absence of hypoxia.
# Guaiac positive stools, anemia: Patient's Hct slowly trended down from admission in the setting of aggressive volume repletion.
He was noted to have guaiac positive stools, but did not have any episodes of melena.
He will need outpatient work-up including colonoscopy when he has recovered from his acute illness.
# CHF: In the setting of pancreatitis, patient requires aggressive hydration and his volume status was monitored given pt's history of CHF.
He was clinically monitored for fluid overload and his home furosemide, lisinopril and coreg were initially held in setting of pancreatitis and recent episodes of hypotension.
A TTE was done on the floor which revealed a normal EF and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
His home medications were resumed once he was transitioned to PO intake and tolerating diet without pain or GI symptoms.
He had borderline low blood pressures, and so his Lisinopril is currently at 5mg, decreased from his home regimen of 10mg.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient was continued on home digoxin with good rate control, but his carvedilol was initially held in the setting of recent hypotension.
Patient will need outpatient evaluation of his guaiac positive stools; he reports that he has never had a colonoscopy.
