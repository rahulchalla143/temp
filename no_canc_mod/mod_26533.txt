Admission Date:  [**2163-6-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-6-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-5-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Heart catheterization   History of Present Illness: 76 yo WF with PMH of CAD s/p MI, ?CVA, HTN, tobacco abuse and CRI, who presents with chest pain.
The pt reports onset of chest pain on Monday night while watching TV.
She initially attributed this to her first prednisone which had been started that day for a gout flare.
The patient reported chest pain as sharp, [**9-27**] with radiation to both arms.
The chest pain was associated with bilious emesis x [**4-23**] at 9p.m as well as diaphoresis and SOB.
Her initial ECG was concerning for anterior lateral ischemia.
Her CE were significant for CK/MB which trended as follows: 70/na - 389/53 - 487/80 and Trop: 0.12 - 3.14 - 8.93.
She was given ASA 325mg x1, Plavix 300mg x1, morphine 2mg x1, Lopressor 5mg x1, and started on heparin gtt and nitro gtt with resolution of ECG changes.
She has been pain free since 8AM today.
The pt underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant CAD in LAD, LCx but chronically occluded appearing RCA.
An attempt was made to cross the RCA lesion with a guide wire, however she developed bradycardia with transient heart block.
She was given Atropine which resulted in tachycardia with possible Afib.
She was given protamine to reverse the hep gtt thinking this episode of hypotension may have been due to tamponade.
CAD s/p MI with neg stress test in '[**60**].
CHF 20% in '[**60**] with global hypokinesis.
HTN 5.
Hypercholesterolemia 6.
Family History: Mother: HTN and MI at age 74.
Physical Exam: VS: HR: 90, BP: 112/50, RR: 12, SaO2: 100% on NC at 2L GEN: obese elderly female in NAD but alternating between lethargic and interacting.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, op clear, dry mm NECK: supple, no JVP CV: RRR, distant S1, S2, systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur with "whistle" quality at apex.
Difficult to appreciate due to balloon pump.
CHEST: CTA bilaterally ABD: firm, no rebound, guardin', BS + bilaterally, no HSM EXT: wwp, 2+ LE biltarel, + tenderness over Left knee which is also warm GROIN: right groin oozing with sheath in place.
No hematoma, no bruits.
Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The LAD showed a 40% midsegment stenosis and appeared tortuous.
The RCA showed a proximal 100% stenosis with considerable left to right collaterals to the distal segment and RPDA from the LAD.
Resting hemodynamics after onset of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventriular response demonstrated severely elevated filling pressures including mean right atrial pressure of 27 mmHg and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 32 mmHg.
After restoration of sinus rhythm and balloon pump insertion, hemodynamics markedly improved with mean right atrial pressure of 7 mmHg, PCWP mean of 10 mmHg, and cardiac index of 3.2 L/min/m2.
Attempt to angioplasty proximally occluded RCA were complicated by bradycardia with heart block followed by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, with the hemodynamic changes described above.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76yo F with CAD s/p MI, CVA, DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and long h/o tobacco abuse who presented with acute onset chest pain.
CV: A. Coronary Artery Disease: The pt has known CAD which was confirmed with the finding of an RCA lesion on catheterization.
However it is unlikely that her episode of chest pain was an acute plaque rupture.
Given the appearance of the lesion, the complication which resulted from the attempt, and presence of collaterals, this is most likely a chronic occlusion.
Given the episode of decompensation in the cath lab and the chronic nature of her occlusion, it was decided that no further attempts at catheterization would be attempted, and the patient was medically optimized on ASA, Lisinopril, and Lipitor.
Pump: The pt has a history of CHF with previously low EF of 20% in '[**58**] with documentation of improvement to 50% in '[**61**].
A stat TTE performed in the cath lab during her episode of decompensation revealed a severely depressed LV function with an EF of [**10-7**]%, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed emergently.
In the presence of high MAP's in the 24 hours s/p catheterization, the IABP was discontinued without complications.
Given the documented acute change in her hemodynamics, this may suggest the presence of a stiff ventricle, possibly myocardial stunning from NSTEMI.
Her outpatient regimen of Digoxin was discontinued in the absence of heart failure at time of discharge.
C. Rhythm: The pt had an episode of bradycardia followed by tachycardia/afib which may be the result of vagal stimulation from attempts to intervene on RCA.
D. Valve: Some evidence of mitral valve leaflet thickening on TTE.
DM: The pt has admission glucose of 700 (gap of 11) but reported no known diagnosis of diabetes.
Her HgA1C of 7.6 confirmed a new diagnosis of Type II D.M.
With post-cath hydration of bicarb in D5W, her renal failure resolved and creatinine treanded towards her baseline.
Gout: The pt reported an acute flare of gout prior to this hospitalization and continued to have residual evidence of acute flare, particularly with tenderness and decreased mobility in her left knee.
Anemia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] hematocrit remained stable, hovering around 25, both pre and post cath.
No evidence of post-cath hematoma.
Although her hematocrit has been stable, in the setting of anemia and heart failure, she was electively transfused with one unit PRBC's.
She was discharged with home VNA services for monitoring of vital signs, assistance with her new medication regimen, and diabetic teaching.
Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) NSTEMI 2) Type 2 DM 3) Acute renal Failure 4) Gout   Discharge Condition: Good.
You have known coronary artery disease, in multiple vessels.
You should call 911 or go to the emergency room if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, or heart palpitations.
2) You have a new diagnosis of diabetes and have been started on a once daily oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**] called pioglitazone to help control your blood glucose levels.
3) You do not have any evidence of heart failure.
You can also discontinue taking Digoxin in the absence of heart failure.
7) Your diet should be a low-salt, cardiac, diabetic diet.
Do not skip meals as you are at risk for becoming hypoglycemic.
