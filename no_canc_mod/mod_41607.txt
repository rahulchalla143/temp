Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen, with reversal of flow in the right superior pulmonary vein.
The regurgitant jet is principally posteriorally directed through a large perforation of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, but additional regurgitation is seen through poor leaflet coaptation.

He presented to [**Hospital1 16549**] on [**2125-10-30**] complaining of lower back pain, left hip pain and a low grade temp.
Pain service was  consulted for his chronic lower back pain likely of multifactorial etiology: myofascial vs neuropathic vs infectious, however his chronic back pain is complicated by infectious processes on his aortic valve, high grade fevers, cerebral emboli hemorraghic and possibly septic.
As such there was concern that his severe lower back pain could be a result of a disseminated infection to vertebral body or epidural space.
MRI of the spine was done on [**11-3**], per Radiology showed: No evidence of spinal infection.
Small midline L5-S1 disc protrusion.
Per Radiology it showed: Multiple bilateral punctate infarctions, acute-to-subacute in chronicity,most compatible with embolic infarcts.Some of these infarcts are noted with  small intraparenchymal hemorrhage,Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the adjacent sulci and No evidence of developing hydrocephalus or significant edema.
MRA brain shows no vascular occlusion.
[**11-4**] Opthamology was consulted due to new blurry vision.
His visual acuity and anterior exam were found to be normal.
Neurology was contact[**Name (NI) **] for evaluation of caudus equinus.
Due to Mr.[**Known lastname 67977**] worsening pain and mental status waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], he was transferred to the CVICU to undergo a controlled intubation and intensive  monitoring prior to surgery.
It showed a dehiscence of the proximal suture line of the valve to the anulus with a contained pseudoaneurysm or abscess.
He also suffered from multiple embolization.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed, numerous times, with Mr.[**Known lastname 30380**] and his family, that he is presenting for a very high risk undertaking of reoperative root most likely with the homograft in the setting of fresh embolic strokes seen on CT scan and an inadequately treated fungal infection.
On [**2125-11-5**] Mr.[**Known lastname 30380**] was taken to the operating room and underwent Redo sternotomy and redo Bentall procedure and ascending aortic and hemi-arch replacement under deep hypothermic arrest with a 25 mm homograft and a 28 mm Gelweave tube graft.
Postoperative bleeding occurred and aggressive resuscitation with multiple blood products ensued.
At the completion of the rexploration, it was noted that Mr.[**Known lastname 67977**] left leg appeared mottled.
Due to the extensive surgery, CRRT was initiated for [**Last Name (un) **] and volume removal.
On [**11-6**] he was taken to the angiosuite with vascular and underwent a left femoral common artery thrombectomy and lateral and medial left lower leg fasciotomies.
Later that day it was noted that his right lower extremity was now cool and larger in appearance with associated elevated pressures.
On [**11-9**] Mr.[**Known lastname 30380**] returned to the operating room and Exploration of the mediastinum showed no active bleeding.
There was no collection of fluid anywhere.
Postoperatively he developed persistent heart block with nonfunctional epicardial pacing wires after his redo Bentall/aortic homograft procedure.
Despite his weaning off pressors with a stable heart rate in the 50s, his EKGs suggest an escape focus with alternating conduction down the anterior and posterior fascicles.
It was noted that he moved all extremities to verbal commands except for his left lower extremity.
Neurology reassesed.A repeat head Ct scan on [**11-13**] showed:Resolving right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage/ No new hemorrhage/  Stable appearance of right frontal embolic infarct.
Apparent new right cerebellar hemisphere infarct, likely also embolic.
His Cultures returned positive for C-Difficile.
A LUE U/S was done: Acute deep vein thrombosis seen in the left subclavian vein with non-occlusive thrombus seen surrounding the vascular line in the left internal jugular vein.
A Three-compartment fasciotomy of the right lower extremity was performed.
He continued to have leukocytosis and he was cultured regularly.
A repeat TEE was done which revealed: Interval development of cavitary space surrounding the bioprosthetic aortic root and aortic graft compared with post bypass images obtained intraoperatively.
Severe thickening of the aortic root was noted.
The following day he was taken back to the OR by vascular for a bilateral lower extremity debridement.
He was found to have VRE in his leg and was started on Linezolid.
He also complained of some vision loss in his R eye and was evaluated by opthamology and neurology.
On [**12-2**] he became acutely short of breath and was reintubated.
He became hypotensive and acidotic and was restarted on CVVH.
He continued to have an increased pressor requirement and remained acidotic.
