The pain was primarily loacalized to the right upper quadrant and epigastric region, and radiating to the back.
The patient denied any nausea or vomiting, and denied fevers or chills.
She was noted to have an elevated bilirubin at the OSH and with RUQ ultrasound demonstrating stones in the gallbaldder, a dilated common bile duct, and pericholecystic fluid.
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for likely cholecystitis/choledocolithiasis and for further care.

Dilated CBD to 1 cm with multiple stones within it, consistent with choledocolithiasis.
Mild intrahepatic biliary prominence.
Distended gallbladder with wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid and non-shadowing stones/sludge, concerning of cholecystitis.
There were some filling defects at the distal CBD suggesting stones and sludge.
Several small stones and one 1 cm stone were seen at the common bile duct.
Final cholangiogram did not reveal any filling defects.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the West-1 surgery service with suspected cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.
Given her extensive medical history/co-morbidities which included end stage renal disease in conjunction with congestive heart failure, she was admitted to the SICU for close monitoring of her fluid status and further management of her biliary disease.
She was immediately transfused 2 units of FFP and given 5 of Vitamin K+ in an attempt to normalize her elevated INR (9.5 on admission).
Her Coumadin was held, and she underwent a R. upper quadrant ultrasound which demonstrated findings consistent with both choledocolithiasis and cholecystitis.
However at that time her INR remained elevated at 5.6 and she required another 4 units of FFP while on dialysis, in addition to 10 of Vitamin K+ in order to normalize her to an INR of 1.6.
During the ERCP a pancreatic stent was required to facilitate access to the biliary system (removed at the end of the procedure), and a common bile duct stent was placed to allow drainage of the biliary obstruction caused by stones and sludge.
However, due to the patient's elevated INR, no sphincterotomy or stone removal was performed.
However, later in the afternoon her bilirubin levels were noted to be elevated (to 9.9 from 6.5 and the following morning this was further increased to 12.0 - leading to concern for obstruction of the biliary stent.
As the patient was noted to be clinically stable, afebrile with a normal WBC count, pain-free, and in all other respects with a non-septic clinical picture, it was recommended by gastroenterology that the patient's LFTs/serum bilirubin be trended and the patient be observed for another day on antibiotics.
As the patient's INR was normalized to 1.2, a sphincterotomy was safely performed, with removal of several biliary stones in addition to the common bile duct stent.
At the conclusion of the procedure, retrograde cholangiogram was negative for filling defects.
The patient again tolerated the procedure well, and without complications.
However, post-procedure her serum bilirubin levels remained elevated for several days, with a slow down-trend despite negative hemolysis work-up, and no complaint of further abdomina pain, nausea, or vomiting.
A R. upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained on hospital day 7 (post-procedure day 2 following second ERCP) to rule out liver abscess as a possible cause of persistently elevated bilirubin.
This was negative for abscess and the gallbladder was noted to be non-distended although the gallbladder wall remained thickened.
Hepatitis serologies were negative for infection.
The ERCP team was again consulted, and did not believe a repeat procedure to be warranted as they believed the elevated bilirubin levels to be secondary to accumulation from prior biliary obstruction and slow clearance due to the patient's severe renal dysfunction.
Additionally, beginning on hospital day 6 the patient had multiple bouts of diarrhea and stool samples returned positive for C. diff colitis.
The patient was stabilized on this regimen with a gradual down-trend in her serum bilirubin levels and a decrease in her diarrhea.
At the time of discharge she was tolerating PO, had been afebrile since initial admission, was ambulating independently with a cane, had no pain issues, and was otherwise stable.
Discharge Instructions: Please Call Dr [**Known lastname 9411**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, worsening diarrhea, increased abdominal pain, inability to tolerate food, fluids or medications, increased yellowing of your skin or eyes, worsening itch or other concerning symptoms.
