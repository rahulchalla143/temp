She was also found to have LE cellulitis, a UTI, [**Last Name (un) **] and an elevated BNP and troponin.
An echo was done for further evaluation of her hypoxia, which showed a dilated right ventricle and right ventricular volume overload.
Given her echo findings, elevated BNP/troponin the floor team was concerned that she may have a PE so she was empirically started on a heparin gtt as she was unable to get a CTA because of her [**Last Name (un) **] and radiology felt a V/Q scan would not be useful in the setting of her poor baseline CXR.
She initially was stable but with worsening renal function, when on the day of transfer she was found to be somnolent, confused and with an oxygen saturation of 87% on 4LNC.
ABG done at that time was 7.22/59/70, she was placed on her nighttime bipap for her respiratory distress.

Linear subsegmental and dependent atelectasis is seen in both lung bases.
There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
The thoracic aorta is unremarkable, except for scattered atherosclerotic calcification, without aneurysmal dilation.
Mild coronary arterial calcifications are seen.
Mild dilation of the main pulmonary artery measuring 4 cm, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Few mediastinal lymphnodes are seen, which do not meet CT criteria for significant adenopathy.
A 3.2 cm gallstone is seen within the gallbladder, without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Both kidneys are unremarkable, without hydronephrosis, stones or large renal masses.
No obstructing cause is noted.
Few sub- centimeter left renal lesions are seen, consistent with simple renal cysts.
The stomach, small and large bowel are normal, without evidence of bowel wall thickening or obstruction.
There is no intra-abdominal free fluid or air.
The abdominal aorta has scattered calcification, without aneurysmal dilation.
No significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is empty with a Foley catheter in place.
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No bone lesions suspicious for infection or malignancy are seen.
Chronic deformity of both femoral necks, is unchanged.
The femoral nail traversing the left femoral neck impinges on the acetabular articular surface.
No acute pulmonary pathology, especially no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
No obstructing cause is visualized and this may represent congenital megaureter, further evaluation with retrograde ureterogram is recommended for confirnation.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
===================== LENI [**2122-6-5**]: =====================  IMPRESSION: Non-diagnostic evaluation for DVT in either the left or right leg.
The degree of vascular congestion has worsened.
There is no definite new focal consolidation.
Small effusion are unchanged.
Low lung volumes.
Moderate right pleural effusion is increased in size priom prior exam.
No pneumothorax.
Pulmonary vascular congestion persists.
Moderate right pleural effusion, increased in size from [**2122-6-16**] exam.
Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion.
===================== Echocardiogram: =====================  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2114-12-19**], the right ventricle is now dilated with probably depressed free wall motion .
Labs Pending at time of discharge: 2 blood cultures and 1 Urine culture   Brief Hospital Course: Hypoxic and Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The etiology of her hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, including obesity-related hypoventiliation syndrome, pulmonary edema, and possible PE.
A heparin infusion was initiated for a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
Definitive imaging was unable to be obtained based on patient's body habitus and renal function precluding her from VQ scan or CT scan.
She required nasal intubation in the ICU due to poor oropharyngeal anatomy, begining on [**2122-6-6**], and was unable to be successfully extubated as she developed post extubation stridor.
Acute Tubular Necrosis: She had muddy brown casts in her urine on admission.
Etiology thought to be related to hypoxia with presentation.
This will likely be her new post-ATN creatinine.
Complicated Urinary Tract Infection: On admission her urine culture grew two speciations of E.Coli, both sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Cellulitis: She was treated for cellulitis of the right lower extremity with vancomycin for a total of 14 days.
She continued to have evidence of venous stasis changes in both lower extremities post antibiotic course.
Diabetes Mellitus II: She was treated with subQ insulin, which resulted in suboptimal glucose control.
Carpal tunnel: Gets intermittent numbness and tingling in her digits bilaterally per report.

Dextrose 50% 12.5 gm IV PRN hypoglycemia protocol   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypoxic Respiratory Failure Pulmonary Embolism .
Secondary: Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Obesity Hyperlipidemia Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 17315**],   You were admitted to the hospital because of respiratory distress.
As a result, you had a tracheostomy performed.
There was concern that your difficutly breathing was due to a blood clot in your lungs.
This will help your body dissolve any possible clots and prevent clots from recurring.
Additionally, you had a urinary tract infection in the hospital as well as lower leg cellulitis, both which were treated with antibiotics.
This is likely due to the low blood oxygen you experienced on initial presentation.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] had some medications changed.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3441**], will be graduating from her residency program.
