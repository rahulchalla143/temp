Three days prior to her admission to the outside hospital, the patient presented to her PCP's office for evaluation of ~20 pound weight loss that had occurred over the past 6-8 weeks.
The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection, and she was prescribed Ciprofloxacin.
The following day, the patient's husband noted that his wife seemed very nervous and agitated.
On presentation to the outside hospital, the patient was noted to have a low grade temperature (100.2).
The patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of narcotic withdrawal.
Given her persistent agitation and concern for narcotic withdrawal, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management.

underwent a lumbar puncture, the results of which were not suggestive of CNS infection as the cause of her encephalopathy.
became extremely nauseous and had episodes of emesis and diarrhea.
altered mental status was secondary to narcotics withdrawal.
It should be noted, however, that ciprofloxacin has been associated with acute psychosis, seizures, and acute delirium.
reported that she had been on large doses of oxycontin, valium and neurontin for pain in her right shoulder, back and legs prior to admission.
In the context of her heavy narcotics use, a chronic pain service consult was obtained while the pt.
be started on celecoxib for musculoskeletal pain but this was held over the concern of possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of iron deficiency anemia of yet uncertain etiology.
was found to have profound iron deficiency anemia on admission.
has known iron deficiency and has received supplementation in the past.
They had recommended performing both colonoscopy to examine for occult malignancy (especially in the face of recent unintentional weight loss and cachexia) and an EGD to evaluate the anatomy of her upper GI tract in light of her prior gastric bypass.
did not desire to undergo these procedures during this inpatient hospitalization, but agreed to follow-up for these studies on an outpatient basis.
There was, again, concern over occult malignancy which further prompted the desire to perform a colonoscopy.
stated that she has had a "negative" mammography within the last year.
The gastroenterology service also raised the possibility of celiac disease and tTG-IgA and endomysial antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge.
There is also the possibility that her weight loss is secondary to her profound depression with vegetative symptoms.
admitted to severe depression in the months prior to admission.
