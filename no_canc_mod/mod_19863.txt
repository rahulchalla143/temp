History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old woman, with scleroderma and an immobile esophagus, who has been followed for Barrett's changes in the distal esophagus.
Recently, she was noted to have high-grade dysplasia.
She underwent an attempt at ablative therapy; however, this was unsuccessful with repeat biopsy continuing to show high-grade dysplasia.
Physical Exam: General: 72 year-old thin well groomed female in no added distress HEENT: unremarkable Resp: clear to auscultation bilaterally Cardiac: regular rate & rhythm, normal S1, S2 no murmur/gallop or rub GI:  bowel sounds present, abdomen soft, non-tender/non-distended Extremities: warm, dry no edema Neuro: Awake, alert & oriented   Pertinent Results: [**2101-6-30**]: UGI IMPRESSION: 1.
Small amount of laryngeal penetration was noted in the barium swallow study.
No frank aspiration was identified.
The barium in the left mainstem bronchus is thus unlikely due to aspiration.
Partial small bowel obstruction with transition point in the proximal jejunum.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year-old female with Barrett's with dysplasia who was taken to the operating room on [**2101-6-21**] for a Transhiatal esophagectomy, pyloroplasty and feeding jejunostomy.
Pain service was consulted and her pain was well controlled on an epidural and prn pain medication.
On post-operative day 1 she was extubed and started on a beta-blocker for a brief episode of atrial fibrillation.
Post-operative x-rays showed left lower lobe collapse; the patient remained stable on 3 L of oxygen by nasal canula, with frequent chest PT and incentive spirometry.
On post-operative day 3, the patient was transferred to the floors; she also underwent ultrasound guided thoracentesis, with 700 cc of bloody fluid removed from the left pleural space.Another thoracentesis was performed on [**2101-7-1**] on the right side, and 650 cc of serosanguineous fluid was removed.
On post-operative day 6, the patient developed some righ hand pain; plastic surgery (hand), and rheumatology were consulted who recommended adequate pain control for symptoms consistent with pseudogout.
On the following day, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and received Mg, K, and an amiodarone drip was started; cardiology was consulted.
On a follow up barium swallow on post-operative day 10, it appeared as though the patient had developed a tracheo-esophageal fistula.
She was made NPO, in preparation for the operating room, where the neck wound was explored and opened.
It was determined intraoperatively that there was no anastamotic leak.
