Admission Date:  [**2129-8-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-11-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Known firstname 32912**] Chief Complaint: GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2129-8-16**]: EGD [**2129-8-17**]: Fistulogram [**2129-8-18**]: T-tube cholangiogram   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 65-year-old man s/p subtotal cholecystectomy with CBDE and transduodenal sphincteroplasty with T-tube placement on [**2129-7-21**] for chronic cholecystitis and an intraoperative finding of a large cholecystoduodenal fistula and an impacted distal bile duct stone.
He was discharged to rehab on [**2129-7-28**] and was readmitted with a subhepatic abscess, which was drained percutaneously by IR (Not bile, culture grew klebsiella and citrobacter).
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: duodenal ulcer, bleed 30 years ago requiring surgery listed below, hepatitis C, s/p interferon ?history cirrhosis, normal liver fxn, anxiety, depression  Past Surgical History: distal gastrectomy with Billroth II for bleeding duodenal ulcer 30 years ago, subtotal cholecystectomy with CBDE and transduodenal sphincteroplasty with T-tube placement on [**2129-7-21**]   Social History: Lives alone on [**Social Security Number 112276**]social security.
Family History: Patient reports his father died of pancreatic cancer.
Physical Exam: Upon Discharge: VSS, Afebrile GEN: Baseline anxious and confused, AAO x 3 CV: RRR RESP: CTAB Abd: T-tube in place draining bilious fluid, abscess drain in place draining scant amount of white/yellow opaque fluid, non-tender, well healing transverse incision c/d/i LE: WWP, no edema   Pertinent Results: Fistulogram [**2129-8-17**] 50 cc of Optiray contrast was slowly hand injected into the abscess drainage catheter under fluoroscopic guidance.
Further injection opacified two narrow tracts originating from the primary collection that were believed to be extraluminal.
Further injection of contrast showed communication between the main collection and the cystic duct which then lead to full opacification of the cystic duct and subsequent opacification of the common bile duct and the biliary tree.
IMPRESSION: Communication between the collection surrounding the catheter and the biliary tree via the cystic duct is c/w a cystic duct bile leak.
IMPRESSION:  A communication exists between the cavity where the abscess drain is located and the biliary system.
A cystic duct leak might be the culprit, however, communication with the duodenum and the cavity is not entirely excluded even though a fistula is not clearly seen.
Interval decrease in size of subhepatic fluid collection within which resides a drainage catheter.
As no contrast was given through the catheter for this study, and there is no reflux of oral contrast of the duodenal limb in this patient status post Billroth II, persistent fistulous connection between the collection and bile duct or duodenum cannot be assessed.
Unchanged appearance of multiple liver lesions some of which are hypodense, and some of which enhance, compatible with hemangiomata and possibly cysts, which are unchanged from priors.
Multiple renal hypodensities, also unchanged from priors, some of which were previously demonstrated to be cystic in nature.
Others are hyperdense by CT, and ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis to exclude solid lesions.
Unchanged appearance of Paget's disease.
Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were applied for hemostasis with success in the edges and center of the ulcer.
A communication between the collection surrounding the catheter and the biliary tree via the cystic duct is c/w a cystic duct bile leak was found.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Acetaminophen PRN pain 2.
Gastro-jejunal anastomosis ulcer 2.
Cystic duct bile leak  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the surgery service at [**Hospital1 18**] with diagnosis of GJ anastomosis ulcer and cystic duct leak.
*Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch,  fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation .
