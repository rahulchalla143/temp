Her ECG showed lateral ST depressions, CXR showed mild CHF, and labs showed hyponatremia (Na 130), acute renal failure (Cr 3.9, baseline 2.2), TropI 1.04, and Hct 25.
She had a 5 L/min O2 requirement upon transfer.
Nonetheless, she was treated with heparin gtt x 48 hours for possible acute coronary syndrome leading to decompensated heart failure.
TTE showed EF 45% with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis, mildly dilated RV with borderline normal free wall function, 1+ AI, 2+ MR, and moderate pulmonary HTN.
Nephrology was consulted for management of volume status in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure - they felt that hypoxemia did not correlate to volume status and recommended discontinuing diuresis.
She was started on vancomycin+ceftazidime for right lower lobe hospital-acquire pneumonia and UTI.
CXR showed progression of pulmonary edema.
Oxygenation requirement improved to 3 L/min NC without diuresis, and CXR [**6-17**] showed improvement in pulmonary edema.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lobe volume loss with right lower lobe infiltrate.
There is interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient is in mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema that appears to be unchanged since the prior study.
Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities are most likely consistent with areas of atelectasis.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis suggested.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Renal ultrasound [**2103-6-18**] There is cortical thinning involving the kidneys bilaterally.
No hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis is seen.
A Foley catheter is in place, which limits evaluation of the urinary bladder.
IMPRESSION: Renal cortical thinning bilaterally, consistent with chronic medical renal disease.
Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted.
No joint space abnormalities appreciated.
No tracking subcutaneous emphysema is seen.
No previous studies are available for comparison.
LOWER EXTREMITY ARTERIAL DUPLEX U/S [**2103-6-19**] Bilateral outflow arterial disease in the lower extremities.
Brief Hospital Course: # Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction - Given acute on chronic renal failure and rapid improvement in symptoms, cardiac catheterization was deferred and the patient was treated with optimal medical therapy.
# Acute on chronic diastolic (with mild systolic) left ventricular heart failure - CXR evidence of pulmonary edema consistent with acute diastolic heart failure.
TTE showed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral segments (LVEF 40-45%), mild aortic and moderate mitral regurgitation, borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
# Acute on chronic renal failure - Improved even with diuresis.
Renal ultrasound showed evidence of medical renal disease but no hydronephrosis.
# Hospital acquired pneumonia - Started empirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime.
# Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection - Urine culture grew cephalosporin-sensitive, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. Coli.
# Peripheral arterial disease, S/P left toe amputation - Evaluated by podiatry and wound care nurses who made recommendations regarding dressing changes.
The wound did not probe to bone on examination and there was no evidence of osteomyelitis on plain film (MRI was deferred given low clinical suspicion and renal insufficiency).
Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound showed bilateral outflow arterial disease in the lower extremities with disease located at the distal popliteal/tibial arteries on the right and likely located at the superficial femoral artery on the left.
Angiography and further definitive therapy was deferred in the setting of acute illness and impaired renal function, but it was strongly recommended that the patient follow up with her vascular surgeon and wound clinic as an outpatient.
# Diabetes mellitus type II - Glargine reduced to 12 units QAM in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
# Anemia of iron-deficiency and chronic kidney disease - Hematocrit remained stable obviating the need for transfusion.
# Hypertension - Well-controlled on carvedilol, amlodipine, Imdur, and hydralazine.
# Hyperlipidemia - Lipid panel was suboptimal, with a total cholesterol of 233 and calculated LDL 155.
# Generalized anxiety disorder - Reduced Klonopin to 0.5 mg qhs.
# Hypothyroidism - Continued levothyroxine.
