Must consider underlying mass with that type of MLS and effacement of structures (subfalcine herniation).
No hydrocephalus or acute hemorrhage noted.
Neuro: awake alert Oriented x3 at times.No obvious facial droop,  Speech clear but does preseverate, EOMI, follows commands, MAE's, no drift however, slight right weakness to grip.
Pateint status post left subdural hematoma evacuation under general anesthesia without intra-op complition on [**2147-10-2**].
POD1: alert, attentive, follows commands intermittently, opens eyes, moves all extremities L>R, remains intubated.Head CT shows evacuation of a large left subdural hematoma with near complete resolution of the midline shift.
POD2/3: Tmax 101.5-->CXR: Right lower lobe opacification reflecting likely developing pneumonia.
Sputum cx shows: RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary) showed ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.MODERATE GROWTH, and  GRAM NEGATIVE ROD which is Sensitive to Levaquin.
There is no significant short interval change in the mixed attenuation left convexity subdural hematoma.
Again seen in the left temporal lobe is a focal area of likely evolving infarct, possibly from compromise of the inferior branch of the left middle cerebral artery due to the large subdural hemorrhage or coexistent embolic process.
No new areas of hemorrhage are seen.
There is no change in the amount of local mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.Neurologically aawake, unable to follow commands, moving all extremities.
