Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital with multiple injuries sustained from your car accident.
You had serious internal injuries as well as broken bones, burns and abrasions.
*  Your injury caused right rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures and you have already had a bout of pneumonia during your hospitalization.
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
