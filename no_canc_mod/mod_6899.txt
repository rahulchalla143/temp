Admission Date:  [**2188-4-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-4-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-4-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Statins-Hmg-Coa Reductase Inhibitors  Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**] Chief Complaint: Bradycardia and seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 81yoM with h/o HTN, PR prolongation; otherwise no other significant cardiac history; also with R sided GBM s/p complete resection and XRT in [**7-7**], VPS for hydrocephalus and stroke (found per imaging in [**2-/2188**]) who is admitted to CCU for syncopal episode this morning, bradycardia, and with GTC seizure in the ambulance en route to hospital.
Most of the history is provided by the pt's wife due to the pt's minimal verbal interaction, and also per reports.
She doesn't know any further vitals or his finger stick.
Code stroke called for pt not moving his L side, normal strength on R. CT head done with prelim report showing: minimally increased MTT with decreased CBF globally of the right cerebral hemisphere and no intracranial hemorrhage.
Neuro was consulted in the ED and felt the L sided paralysis to be consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 555**] Paralysis and that the hypoperfusion seen on the CT scan was not consistent with a vasculature territory (vessels were all patent), and so therefore more consistent with a seizure activity.
His L sided "densely hemiplegic" deficits began to improve by the time the imaging was done in the ED, also more consistent with seizure.
He is admitted to the CCU for workup of his bradycardia; he was apparently supposed to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7965**] on Monday (in 2 days) for evaluation of this bradycardia that has been noted by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
He had some bradycardia and vomiting on arrival to the CCU, however by evaluation, his hr was in the 50's, bp stable in the 160-170's, satting and breathing OK, and he was not vomiting.
ROS is positive as above, also for ataxic gait, occasional "confusion" characterized as worsening short term memory, and weight loss from 185 to <150 now, all felt to be consistent by the family with his known GBM.
At his baseline, his family reports he functions "perfectly," is totally conversant, can walk, was a practicing attorney until last [**Month (only) 216**], some weakness on his L side at baseline.
His wife states he has never had problems with seizures, or with cardiac dysrhythmias (other than PR prolongation).
- Had small stroke noted on MRI brain per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30318**] in the field of his prior radiation therapy, with subclinical stroke.
- Residual L sided weakness and gait disorder - Chronic bradycardia with two syncopal episodes, most recent before this admission in [**1-/2188**] in [**State 108**], ?
Family History: No family history of sudden cardiac death  Physical Exam: 99.8  R 161/81  L 173/62  p50's  100% on RA Thin, elderly male in no distress but appears exhausted and dazed, which apparently is not his baseline.
No JVD noted, no hepatojugular reflux.
Radiation of AS type murmur heard in L neck, not in R (sounds more like AS murmur than carotid bruit) Lungs CTAB but poor air movement.
A slight AS type murmur is heard.
Has apparent L facial droop.
There is no evidence of significant enhancement to suggest recurrence or tumor activity.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic microvascular ischemic disease is visualized.
Mild increased mean transit time with decreased cerebral blood flow globally is noted in the right cerebral hemisphere, possibly consistent with mild ischemia or recent seizure activity.
Calcified plaques are visualized in the carotid siphons, more significant on the left with moderate stenosis.
Pulmonary nodule is identified in the left lung, correlation with CT of the chest is recommended for further characterization of this nodule.
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: Lungs are clear without consolidation or pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no hilar or mediastinal enlargement.
The aorta is mildly tortuous.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
[**2188-4-21**] CT Chest: Impression: The spiculated nodule in the left apex is concerning for a primary lung cancer and could be further assessed with a PET/CT.
Brief Hospital Course: 81M with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glioblastoma multiforme s/p resection and XRT in [**7-7**], VPS for hydrocephalus and stroke admitted to the CCU for syncopal event, bradycardia, and generalized tonic clonic siezure.
He was noted to have 2 further episodes of bradycardia, once in the setting of nausea and vomiting, and another in the setting of carotid palpation during physical exam, however his pulse recovered without intervention.
His symptoms were thought to be vasovagal.
The patient was evaluated by the electrophysiology service with the recommendation being conservative management given it was not felt that a PPM would not prolong his life or improve his symptoms in this setting.
There was also concern given that he requires serial MRIs to track his glioblastoma which would not be possible with a pacemaker.
His heart rate was monitored with pulses maintained in the fifties, normotensive, with no concerning symptoms (dizziness, syncope).
Decision that no atropine or pacer pads would be used.
Left sided weakness improved over the course of the hospitalization.
CT head/neck noted a lung nodule which was further characterized on CT Thorax.
Family is presently considering options regarding further treatment vs palliative care.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: bradycardia grand mal seizure  secondary: Gliobastoma Multiforme NPH with VPL   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted with low heart rate and seizure.
