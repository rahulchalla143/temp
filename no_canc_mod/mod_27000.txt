Admission Date:  [**2143-2-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-3-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-9-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Hypertensive urgency and hypercarbic respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Placement of arterial line Cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: HPI: 47yo tob+ M with hx of PE ([**2138**], previously on coumadin which was d/c'd one year ago) and HTN who has been non-copmliant with his medications for the last two month (change in PCP/loss of insurance) who presents to [**Hospital6 3105**] with non-radiating SSCP associated with SOB.
The wife reports the pt has been complaining of some cough with subjective fevers for one week prior to admission.
During this time, he has also complained of some intermittent bilateral lower leg pain.
He was brought in to the ED by his wife today due to rapid shallow breathing.
The pain was described as a tightness resulting in "hyperventilation" - SOB and cough.
The SSCP and SOB was worse with lying flat, exercise, or deep breath and was relieved by nothing.
The pt became acutely hypoxic resulting in intubation with 20mg Etomidate, 100mg Succinylcholine, 4mg Ativan, and Vecurronium.
Labs at OSH were significant for proteinuria, elevated BNP of 1295 (0-100 wnl), slightly elevated CE (CK-MB 7.6 (0.6-6.3 wnl)) and WBC: 19.4 (Band 1, Neutrophil 47, Lymph 20, Mono 7, Eos 4, Atypical Lymph 21).
In addition, it also demonstrated cardiomegaly with CHF, R pleural effusion and RLL consolidation with inc. opacity and air bronchograms.
Here, the pt was found to have elevated WBC count of 18, equivocal CE and was started on hep gtt.
On transfer to CCU - no chest pain, sob, + rib pain with deep breaths, no N/V.

Cardiovascular The patient was initially admitted to the MICU with evidence of mild CHF on CXR.
He had no events on telemetry and ruled out for a MI with flat cardiac enzymes x 3 with peak CK 230, peak MB 7, and troponin (0.06-> 0.09 -> 0.05).
Lipitor 80 QD was initially started, and then discontinued when he ruled out and his cholesterol profile returned with LDL .
An echocardiogram showed depressed LVEF 40% with regional severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall suggesting possible ischemic cause of heart failure.
It also showed global LVH, suggesting hypertensive cardiomyopathy (LVEDV 5.7 cm and septal wall thickness of 1.5 cm).
He diuresed with HCTZ 1L and was subsequently transferred to the CCU for workup of possible secondary causes of hypertension and hypertensive management.
In the CCU, he was placed on a labetalol drip for possible pheochromocytoma (to avoid unapposed beta-antagonism) and the nitro drip was weaned off.
The differential diagnosis of secondary causes of HTN includes pheochromocytoma, adrenal hyperplasia, hyperaldosteronism (Conn's), renal artery stenosis and aortic coarctation.
Urinary and plasma metanephrines were sent and were pending at the time of discharge.
Renal artery stenosis was thought to be unlikely given that he tolerated a high dose of captopril (100 mg TID) and had a Cr of 1.0.
In the cardiac cath lab, he was found to have pulmonary hypertension - systolic 55, diastolic 24, mean 33, and a high wedge pressure of 30, as well as clean coronary arteries and no evidence of renal artery stenosis.
It was thought that his hypertension was likely essential given his long personal history of hypertension and strong family history.
- consider outpatient CT to evaluate for adrenal tumor or hyperplasia - the PCP should call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 65432**] to get the results of your plasma metanephrines, urinary metanephrines.
- continue ASA 81 QD, labetalol 800 TID, lisinopril 40 QD, HCTZ 25 QD and Lasix 20 QD - consider switching from labetalol 800 TID to Toprol XL 200 QD and titrating up given patient's past history of medical noncompliance.
- PCP should consider outpatient [**Telephone/Fax (1) 28085**] for sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea given pulmonary hypertension and history of snoring.
Infectious Disease: On admission, the patient was found to have a RLL consolidation in the setting of subjective fevers, cough and an elevated WBC count indicating a community acquired pneumonia.
A repeat CXR on [**2-28**] showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Although the pt has a significant tob smoking history, there is no documented history of COPD to suggest CO2 retainer.
Acute exacerbation may have been due to CHF (BNP 1300 at OSH) and pneumonia - especially with the WBC count and CXR findings.
respiratory drive due to CNS disease, especially in the setting of SBP of 300s, or possible drug toxicities (though OSH urine tox screen neg except opiates).
Diuresed 3.8 L on this admission with no evidence of CHF on CXR [**2-28**].
Anemia - normocytic anemia that developed since admission, possibly [**1-31**] to dilution from IVF.
Denies black or bloody stools and guaiac negative.
As ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase reactant, and his iron/TIBC ratio was low, he was started on iron supplements - Iron 325 mg QD .

Please seek medical attention if you develop chest pain, blurry vision, a bad headache, shortness of breath, decreased urine output, or have any other concerning symptoms.
He can call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 65432**] (the phone number of the CCU) to ask about the results of your blood tests for alternative causes of high blood pressure, specifically plasma and urinary metanephrines.
You should also ask him about referring you for sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea.
