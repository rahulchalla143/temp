IMAGING: [**2146-9-17**] CT Abd/Pelvis: pancreatitis, pseudocysts, SMV thrombosis [**2146-9-17**] CTA Pancr Abd/Pelvis: confirmed SMV thrombosis on venous phase [**2146-9-27**] Upper GI no oral contrast is seen beyond the duodenal bulb .
[**2146-10-22**] CXR patchy consolidation of the RUL, bigger R pleural effusion [**2146-10-22**] CXR: large R pleural effusion, additional loculated pleural fluid [**2146-10-23**] CXR: large focal consolidation in the right lower lobe with loculated pleural effusion and multiple chest tubes on the right, no appreciable change since prior study.Small L pleural effusion [**2146-10-23**] CXR: Dense opacification of the right hemithorax with three chest tubes on the right.
The loculated right-sided pleural effusion appears to be somewhat less dense at the right periphery and there appears to be mildly improved opacification of the right lung.
Dense effusion at the right lung apex and at the right lung base.
Left lung is relatively clear [**2146-10-24**] CXR: Right loculated pleural effusion is associated with small amount of air component, difficult to assess in this single frontal semi-upright view.
[**2146-10-25**] CXR: Substantial right pleural effusion, particularly basal, persist despite presence of three right pleural tubes, one at the apex, one along the mediastinum and one coiled at the right base.
The extent of the lateral pleural opacities have minimally decreased, the extent of the more medial pleural opacities are without relevant change.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Unchanged blunting of the right costophrenic sinus suggesting a small pleural effusion.

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2146-10-24**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service [**2146-9-14**] for further evaluation of pancreatitis and a pseudocyst after undergoing a failed ERCP.
The ERCP demonstrated severe edema of the distal stomach and bulb causing narrowing with a spontaneous drainage of pruluent material from the bulb, most likely due to a large pseudocyst or fluid collection.
Admission Abdominal/pelvic CT demonstrated findings consistent with pancreatitis with note a pseudocyst.
The study also showed mild intrahepatic biliary dilation, inflammation of the duodenum and CBD, as well as raised suspicion for SMV thrombosis.
A CTA pancreas protocol was perfomed on [**2146-9-17**], which redemonstrated pancreatitis with numerous adjacent air and fluid filled pseudocysts, as well as a filling defect of the  upper portion of the SMV, consistent with SMV thrombosis.
There was no evidence of reactive pseudo-aneurysm formation.
On On [**2146-9-20**], the patient underwent open pancreatic necrosectomy and peripancreatic abscess drainage, open cholecystectomy with fluoroscopic intraoperative cholangiography, and placement of both a gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tubes, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, J-Tube and G-Tube to gravity, a JP drain in place, and a Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
On POD#1, he required multiple IV fluid boluses totalling 1.5 Liter as well as Metoprolol IV for tachycardia and low urine output with good response.
On [**2146-10-1**], however, the patient experienced tachycardia, dyspnea, and BRBPR.
Gastroenterology was consulted, recommending holding heparin, transfuse, continue PPI, and holding off on colonoscopy as inpatient unless bleeding re-occurs.
While in the SICU, the patient developed parotiditis, which resolved later on the floor with sucking on [**Doctor Last Name **] drops and [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name 84857**].
He experienced increased abdominal pain and distension, despite venting the G-Tube.
Abdominal/pelvic CT revealed an overall stable appearance of the abdomen and pelvis with persistent small fluid collection tracking lateral to the duodenum/posterior to the pancreatic head and small probable hepatic subcapsular fluid collection.
Given history of GIB on Heparin infusion, it was determined to start subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis only.
On [**2146-10-7**], the PTC was capped, but then later uncapped and G-Tube vented for abdominal pain, nausea and dyspnea.
The PICC was discontinued on [**2146-10-9**] and the tip sent for culture for a temperature spike.
On [**2146-10-17**], the patient underwent IR cholangiogram demonstrating a stricture of the distal common bile duct, but no signs of bile leak.
On [**2146-10-19**], he underwent PTC evaluation in IR, which demonstrated no evidence of ductal dilatation, again with long area of narrowing in the lower CBD likely related to mass effect from edema.
On [**2146-10-20**], the patient again experienced abdominal pain and nausea, as well as dyspnea and increased oxygen demand.
CXR revealed a marked increase in the extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion, with the effusion occupying about one-half of the right hemithorax.
Also, signs of fluid overload.
Chest CT demonstrated a large multiloculated right pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis and patchy ground-glass opacities.
On [**2146-10-21**], the patient initially underwent an unsuccessful thoracentesis attempt of the right side, followed by a successful right video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) decortication of loculated right pleural effusion (See Operative Notes for full details).
Self-resolved V-tach Approx.
[**2146-10-23**]: Restarted tubefeeds via J-tube, PCA for pain with good effect, CXR for this afternoon.
Tachycardia responsive to extra doses of metoprolol.
Pleural effusion growing GPR per initial report; Infectious Disease consulted.
[**2146-10-24**]: Pleural effusions growing GNR (correction from GPR stated previously), started on Ciprofloxacin.
He was voiding without assistance, and ambulating well with assistance due to legal blind status, and not weakness.
On [**2146-10-26**], the culture of the pleural tissue returned with pan-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii complex; Flagyl was added to Cipro for more comprehensive gram negative coverage.
On [**2146-10-27**], a CXR revealed a minimal decrease of the right pleural fluid with minimally improved transparency of the right-sided lung parenchyma.
No evidence of interval recurrence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No left pleural effusion.
The patient had experienced some mild, non-specific pruritus starting [**2146-10-26**], which developed into a rash and hand angioedema early overnight into [**2146-10-28**].
The patient was given Benadryl, Fexofenadine, and Singulair with symptomatic improvement.
He will continue on Fexofenadine and Singulair for one week to prevent recurrent delayed hypersensitivity reaction.
At the time of discharge on [**2146-10-28**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
He was ambulating with assistance due to visual impairment, voiding without assistance, moving his bowels, and pain was well controlled.
Infectious Disease has recommended that he continue on Ciprofloxacin for at least 3 weeks, preferably for 2 weeks AFTER all his drains have been removed.
