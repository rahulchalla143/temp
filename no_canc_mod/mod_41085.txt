Additionally, has diastolic failure and was diursed in a effort to improve her respiratory status.
#  COPD Flare: Patient is oxygen dependent (2-4L) at baseline, but was persistently hypoxic to the low 80's in the ED on increased oxygen support even after several neb treatments and she was admitted to the MICU on BIPAP.
Atypical or early PNA felt to be possible and she was treated with 5d of levofloxacin.
COPD treated with high dose steroids, tapered to 50mg on discharge, tiotroprium, albuterol nebs, monteleukast, spiriva and fluticasone inh [**Hospital1 **].

Likely slightly dry on admission.
Likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia.
#  Diabetes Type II: Patient on metformin and glipizide as an outpatient.
Normal BNP in the ED and no evidence of volume overload on exam or CXR.
TTE reordered due to concern that her respiratory issues may be paritally cardiac which showed no change (EF > 55%).
She is not on a BB as she has no systolic failure.
