Pt underwent LAR w/ ileocecectomy for perforated Crohn's disease w/ colonic-small bowel fistula on [**2160-8-16**].
The OR was c/b a bladder laceration that was repaired by urology.
Approximately 4 days prior to admission, the maceration was noted to be worse and the pt was made NPO and started on TPN to decrease soiling of the stoma site.
36 hours prior to this presentation, she become confused and lethargic.
This morning she spiked a fever to 100.8 and was found to have an SBP in the 80's, so she was sent to the ED.
Thiamine or placebo was administered as part of a study.
CT [**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis showed fat stranding around the ileostomy site, but no fluid collections.
Colorectal surgery felt the stoma was an unlikely source of the sepsis and identified the PICC line and urine as possible sources.
The pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for pressor support and treatment of sepsis of unknown source.

Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old female w/ hx of crohn's s/p LAR w/ end ileostomy for bowel perforation 2 months ago now transferred from rehabilitation w/ urosepsis and hypercarbic respiratory distress.
Sepsis was managed with antibiotics and a short duration of pressors.
At the time of discharge, she was hemodynamically stable, tolerating TPN and a full liquid diet, and had her ostomy output managed with a Malencot tube and bolstering dressings.
Likely secondary to UTI (pan sensitive e. coli in urine as well as pan-sensitive klebsiella) in the setting of bladder perforation from her surgery.
A cystogram was ordered to see if bladder was communicating with peritoneum; showed no continued [**Month/Year (2) 3564**] or extravasation.
A 14-day course of Cipro was completed on [**10-27**], without recurrence of symptoms or leukocytosis after antibiotics were stopped.
Had low MAP's and BP's while sleeping early in her hospital course, intermittently requiring pressors.
#Anemia:  She received 1 unit PRBC's upon admission for low hematocrit in the setting of sepsis.
She received an additional 2 units on [**10-25**] for a slow down-trend in her hematocrit, though she was otherwise asymptomatic.
# Nausea: Ongoing & intermittent, likely narcotics & medications; patient states that it has been worse since placement of mushroom catheter.
# Recent PE around [**2160-8-27**]: Less than 3 months ago, given heparin IV while in the ICU for anticoagulation.
Patient's hypercapneic respiratory failure resolved after her diuresis, but she continued to desat occasionally while sleeping, likely due to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea.
No recent issues, but continue to monitor.
# Tachycardia: Resolved.
Patient found to have a transient rate-related RBBB.
Metoprolol was held as patient also had low blood pressures with the plan being to intervene only if hemodynamic compromise was present.
Home dose of metoprolol re-started without issue.
Has significant tissue trauma and bruising on right upper thigh which has been monitored, with continued physical therapy and nutrition it is hoped that this will improve.
# Depression/agitation: Patient has had a long, protracted hospital course over the past 3 months including multiple complications and shows signs of difficult coping and occasional agitation, as well as baseline anxiety.
# Feeds: Initially unable to take good oral intake due to nausea, respiratory status, and profound ostomy output.
# DM 2: Patient received an insulin sliding scale.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis and breakdown of the skin around your ileostomy.
You had a cystogram during this admission which showed that your bladder laceration had healed and your foley catheter was removed.
Also contact us if you have any of the following: fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, vomiting, blood in your ostomy output, pain not controlled with pain medication, or any concerning symptoms.
You will need to continue a full liquid diet and taking the lactulose as ordered to keep your stool liquid and flowing through the drain in your ostomy.
Your ostomy output will be high as you are taking the lactulose and it is important that you are monitored for signs and symptoms of dehydration such as: hypotension, dizziness, dry mouth, or low urine output.
It is important that you keep moving and increasing your strength so that you will better tolerate the surgery needed to improve the condition of your stoma and GI system.
