No hydronephrosis or obstruction.
Plans to continue to follow her renal function likely secondary to overdiuresis and dehydration with some diarrhea.
Patient is also noted to have increasing amounts of diarrhea over the weekend.
Chronic cough/anterior mediastinal mass:  Patient had a CT of her chest done to better evaluate as she had one episode of hemoptysis, and with her chronic cough since [**Month (only) 768**].
Patient's CT of the chest showed diffuse hazy ground-glass opacity effecting the right lung to a greater extent in the left consistent with pulmonary edema or atypical infectious process or pulmonary hemorrhage.
Also evidence of prior granulomatous disease and a lobulated mass in the anterior mediastinum, which likely represents a thymoma and a small hiatal hernia.
They felt they needed tissue samples to further diagnose, but that this was less consistent with a lymphoma picture.
Patient was seen by the CT Surgery service for possible biopsy or excision.
Decreased ejection fraction:  Patient with an EF of 30-35% and posterolateral akinesis.
These were held in light of her acute renal failure and overdiuresis.
