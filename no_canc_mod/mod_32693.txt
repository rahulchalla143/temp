Admission Date:  [**2117-8-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-8-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-6-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2117-8-5**] Flexible bronchoscopy with narrow-band imaging and therapeutic aspiration.
[**2117-8-6**] Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration.
At that time, he underwent bronchoscopy, and received bronchial artery embolization after a CT exam showed an increased density and bronchiectasis.
Following this procedure and discharge, he continue to have a single episode of hemoptysis (teaspoon full).
Upper endoscopy showed a gastric ulcer in the fundus, 80% healed.
During this hospitalization, he developed massive hemoptysis on [**8-3**], which was bright red blood with tissue, about 600 cc.
He was unresponsive and was intubated.
Bronchoscopy was performed and showed no clots in the bronchus.
Repeated upper endoscopy showed no change in the gastric ulcer.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up on [**8-4**]   Past Medical History: Hypertension Dyslipidemia PVD, s/p fem-fem bypass Essential tremor Bladder Ca, s/p radical prostatetectomy and cystectomy w/ileal loop conduit [**2115**] Gastric ulcer w/negative biopsy and negative h.pylori AAA repair [**2105**] Bronchiectasis TIA w/left sided weakness Bilateral internal carotid stenosis Pulmonary AVM with coil embolization [**2105**] Hemoptysis   Social History: Ex-smoker, stopped in [**2102**]   Family History: No history of AVM   Physical Exam: VS: Tm98.4  Tc97.4  HR62  BP124/60  RR20  94%RA Gen: No acute distress, AAO Card: RRR Lungs: CTA B/L Abd: +BS    Pertinent Results: [**2117-8-4**] 11:54PM BLOOD WBC-8.8 RBC-3.36* Hgb-10.1* Hct-29.8* MCV-89 MCH-30.0 MCHC-33.7 RDW-15.6* Plt Ct-278 [**2117-8-7**] 03:23AM BLOOD WBC-5.5 RBC-3.10* Hgb-9.5* Hct-27.2* MCV-88 MCH-30.6 MCHC-34.8 RDW-15.0 Plt Ct-238 [**2117-8-8**] 07:00AM BLOOD WBC-6.0 RBC-3.36* Hgb-10.5* Hct-29.1* MCV-86 MCH-31.3 MCHC-36.3* RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-292 [**2117-8-4**] 11:54PM BLOOD PT-13.2 PTT-23.8 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2117-8-4**] 11:54PM BLOOD Plt Ct-278 [**2117-8-8**] 07:00AM BLOOD Plt Ct-292 [**2117-8-4**] 11:54PM BLOOD Glucose-101 UreaN-18 Creat-1.1 Na-145 K-3.8 Cl-110* HCO3-27 AnGap-12 [**2117-8-7**] 03:23AM BLOOD Glucose-108* UreaN-12 Creat-1.0 Na-140 K-4.0 Cl-105 HCO3-32 AnGap-7* [**2117-8-8**] 07:00AM BLOOD Glucose-106* UreaN-18 Creat-0.9 Na-140 K-3.8 Cl-103 HCO3-29 AnGap-12 [**2117-8-4**] 11:54PM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.0 Mg-1.8 [**2117-8-7**] 03:23AM BLOOD Calcium-8.8 Phos-4.4 Mg-2.0 [**2117-8-8**] 07:00AM BLOOD Calcium-9.2 Phos-3.1 Mg-1.9  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted on [**2117-8-4**] by the thoracic surgery service to the SICU for treatment and evaluation of massive hemoptysis.
ENT evaluated the patient for bleeding sources: Fiberoptic exam revealed no source of blood from the nose, nasopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx or larynx; there were no supraglottic lesions.
CTA on [**8-5**] showed a Left superior segment coiled AVM with an adjacent ground glass opacity.
It was thought that this finding could represent intraparenchymal hemorrhage or it could represent aspiration, given the dependent consolidation seen in both lower lobes and the secretion seen in the right main bronchus.
While a suboptimal study due to bowel gas, arterial flow and normal waveforms was noted is seen in the right and left distal most external iliac arteries and common femoral arteries bilaterally consistent with a prior femoral-femoral bypass.
There was evidence of possible pulmonary AVMs in the left main-stem medial segment; however, this was compounded somewhat by the traumatic appearance of the airways.
On [**8-6**], a repeat flexible bronchoscopy was performed to isolate a source of bleeding.There was a small clot on the right main stem, however, there were no clots or active bleeding in the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, right lower lobe.
The left main stem again had a questionable area of erythema, possible arteriovenous malformation in the medial aspect of the left main stem.
There was an old blood clot emanating from left lower lobe, which was therapeutically aspirated.
The posterior and lateral segment of the left lower lobe were both washed and there was no active oozing.
The final impression was that the Left lower lobe anteromedial segment is likely source of hemoptysis.
Aortogram demonstrating no visualized bronchial artery branches.
Selective angiograms of intercostal arteries demonstrating no irregularity.
Subclavian arteriogram demonstrating no abnormality of the left internal mammary artery.
No intervention was performed.
The patient had several more episodes of hemoptysis on [**8-8**] - 2 tsp of bright red blood without clots - which resolved without intervention.
On the evening of [**2034-8-7**], the patient had no episodes of hemopysis.
