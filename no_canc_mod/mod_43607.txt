No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
Specifically, there were no esophagela varices.
-Retained fluids in stomach -Erythema, congestion and erosion in the antrum, stomach body and fundus compatible with erosive gastritis -Varices at the fundus -Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
IMPRESSION: Very limited assessment of the splenic artery and pancreas secondary to overlying bowel gas.
FINDINGS: There is minor bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is an eccentric thrombus which begins in the uppermost part of the superior mesenteric vein and extends through the length of the main portal vein.
There are large gastric varices along the posterior wall of the fundus and cardia that connect with both the left renal and splenic veins.
There is edema in the gallbladder wall, which is a nonspecific appearance.
The native kidneys are atrophic with multiple bilateral cysts.
A renal graft in the right lower quadrant is partly visualized but not fully assessed here.
There is no ascites or lymphadenopathy.
No osseous abnormality is demonstrated.
Chronic-appearing nonocclusive thrombosis beginning in the upper superior mesenteric vein, extending through the entire main portal vein, occluding the left portal vein, and partly involving the proximal right portal vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 64M with ESRD s/p LRKT in [**2196**] and colon CA s/p hemicolectomy now with upper GI bleeding given HCT drop from [**Month (only) 359**] of 39 to 30 on admission.
# GI bleeding: Patient presented with several days of black sticky stool.
Hct on admission was ~30 suggesting a subacute bleed since [**Month (only) **].
Patient was treated with IV Protonix, octreotide and ceftriaxone for possible SBP prophylaxis.
GI was consulted and EGD was performed showing a large gastric varix.
He also had erosive gastritis on EGD and a nl [**4-17**] colonoscopy.
The source of varix remained unclear, possibly due to portal thrombus vs. cholangitis, but patient had no hx consistent w/ cholangitis.
Given high risk of re-bleeding varices were injected [**12-31**].
# Gastric varix and portal vein thrombosis.
Varix injected as above without complications.
Patient did not have history of cirrhosis and cause of liver cirrhosis if present was unclear.
had hx of EtOH abuse, Stage 1 fibrosis on Bx of poor quality in [**2195**].
Portable u/s showed patient PV and hepatic veins, but MRV revealed a chronic-appearing nonocclusive thrombosis beginning in the upper superior mesenteric vein, extending through the entire main portal vein, occluding the left portal vein, and partly involving the proximal right portal vein.
This may have lead to increased PV and splenic vein pressures.
There were no ascites on U/S.
# ESRD s/p Renal Transplant: graft function has been stable with Cr 1.7-2.2 for past several months.
Patient was continued on Bactrim for prophylaxis.
# DM: s/p renal transplant.
Carvedilol, Hydrochlorothiazide and norvasc were held given normal blood pressures on nadolol and concern for hypotension in setting of GIB.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: gastric variceal bleed          portal vein thrombosis  Secondary: s/p renal transplant   Discharge Condition: stable hematocrit, stable vital signs   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with black stools and found to have a gastric varix.
To help determine that, you also received a liver biopsy to assess for liver damage and cirrhosis.
-Please take nadolol daily -Please take protonix 40 mg twice daily -Please do not take NSAIDS -Please take carafate 1 gram QID -Please take ciprofloxacin for three more days to prevent infection after bleed -Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] [**Name (STitle) **] will have re injection of the gastric varix and assessment of further intervention.
