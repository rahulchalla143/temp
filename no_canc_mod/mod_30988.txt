Admission Date:  [**2146-10-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2146-10-24**]   Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 139**] Firm  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old African-American female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and severe dementia who presents with a upper respiratory infection initially to the [**Hospital6 733**] Clinic on [**10-13**] and given azithromycin times five days.
On Saturday ([**10-15**]) in the evening, the patient was noted to have a large hard stool with dark blood.
On Sunday morning, she had no blood in her diaper when changed but by the evening (at 6 p.m.) she had a large blood clot and dark blood saturating her diaper.
The patient had no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or hematemesis.
A tagged red blood cell scan showed an active hepatic flexure bleed.
The patient went to angiogram for a possible embolization and was found to have a total superior mesenteric artery and internal mammary artery occlusion with no possible embolization intervention.
She continued to ooze some blood from her rectal tube.
The patient's two daughters have expressed the desire for no surgery or heroic measures.
Generally, the patient was in no acute distress.
There was no jugular venous distention.
There was [**2-17**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
Neurologically, she had increased tone in her left upper extremity and left lower extremity.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A tagged red cell scan on [**10-17**] showed an active hepatic flexure bleed.
Angiography revealed total occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery and internal mammary artery with celiac collateral feeding superior mesenteric artery territory.
No possible embolization.
A colonoscopy on [**2144-4-6**] showed multiple diverticula in the entire colon, three polyps in the ascending colon (status post polypectomy), and no active bleeding.
A chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and increased interstitial markings.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  Gastrointestinal bleed localized to the hepatic flexure with a tagged red blood cell scan.
She had total superior mesenteric artery and internal mammary artery occlusion, and no embolization was possible by angiography.
The family declined any surgery or other heroic measures, and she continued to have bleeding after transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit, requiring four to six transfusions per day.
After having a family discussion with both of her daughters and the attending, her daughters understood that she would likely continue to bleed at home but there may be no other noninvasive interventions possible in the hospital.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient with a troponin leak.
There were no electrocardiogram changes.
Initially, her hematocrit was kept around 30%, but the patient remained transfusion dependent.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  Congestive heart failure was well compensated with an ejection fraction of about 45%.
The patient was gently hydrated during her hospital stay and treated with packed red blood cells without any evidence of fluid overload.
HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient's blood pressure medications were held in the setting of an active bleed.
