Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns with extension into the fourth ventricle.
5-mm right-sided saccular aneurysm of the distal basilar artery, proximal to the superior cerebellar artery origin, which appears to be associated with the origin of a brainstem perforator artery.
Cerebral Angiogram [**2183-4-15**] [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 16462**] underwent cerebral angiography and coil embolization  of a right basilar trunk aneurysm, which was facilitated by the use of a stent.
The procedure was uneventful and there were no complications during the procedure.
Lungs are essentially clear aside from mild left basal atelectasis.
Mild cardiomegaly stable.
Mediastinal veins mildly dilated but unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
CT head [**2183-4-16**] Status post basilar stenting and aneurysm coiling with no complication visualized.
There is minimal atelectasis at both lung bases but no evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No pulmonary edema.
No larger pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Subtle subarachnoid hemorrhage seen on the CT of the head.
CT perfusion demonstrates no evidence of abnormalities to indicate ischemia or infarction.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates stent-assisted coiling of the basilar artery aneurysm without evidence of significant vasospasm.
She developed SIADH on [**4-19**] and was started on Florinef and salt tabs, and also a prednisone taper for her headaches.
TCDs on [**4-18**] showed above normal velocities in the right middle cerebral artery, right anterior cerebral artery, and basilar artery, but none of the vessels had evidence of vasospasm.
