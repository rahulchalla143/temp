ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head and neck normocephalic, atraumatic.
The face is symmetric except for a hint of right facial droop on primary position.
No ankle jerk appreciated.
MR IMAGING:  Increased diffusion weighted signal on the left parietal occipital region with a left ICA and an MCA with severely diminished flow.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] was admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit for an acute stroke management.
Given the mismatch in the perfusion and diffusion imaging sequences we f elt that Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] likely has ischemic and stunned neuronal tissue that may be salvaged if a perfusion can be maintained with hig h pressures.
Cardiac echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction greater then 55% without significant wall motion abnormalities.
Carotid duplex revealed significant plaque in the cervical left ICA and minimal disease in the right carotids.
This is concerning for high grade distal stenosis or occlusion of the ICA on the left.
Therefore further studies with an angiogram was done and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] performed this procedure, which revealed a proximal left MCA occlusion.
There are no posterior communicating arteries.
In summary, there was a 85% stenotic lesion at the proximal left ICA and a 50% stenotic lesion in t he petrous ICA on the left with a complete occlusion of the MCA on the left.
Given the significant extracranial vascular disease the stroke attending recommended that Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] be started on aspirin and Plavix for prevention of further ischemic events.
While in the Intensive Care Unit Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] was found to have a urinary tract infection with cultures growing enterococcus species and staph coag negative species.
Sputum cultures also revealed staph aureus, which was felt to be colonization and therefore Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] was not started on antibiotics.
We will continue to monitor the hematocrit given his recent history of coffee ground emesis in the Emergency Room on admission.
He is currently not alert enough to take po, however, we anticipate that with treatment of his acute infectious process that he will likely be able to take po fluids and medications.
Finally, regarding long term management of his cerebrovascular disease we would favor initiating a statin drug.
Left hemispheric infarction, evidence of left MCA occlusion and severely stenotic left ICA.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Urinary tract infection.
