Admission Date:  [**2101-9-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-10-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-2-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine / seafood / Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Tegaderm  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2006**] Chief Complaint: Bloody diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: exploratory laparoscopy intubation hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: (Initial presentation to hospital per Transplant [**Doctor First Name **]): 47F with ESRD on HD s/p right arm AV Graft on [**2101-8-31**] now presenting with a one day history of profuse diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and crampy abdominal pain.
Patient reports feeling well until yesterday when she started having large volume diarrhea which was watery and bloody in consistency.
She states she has also had several episodes of nausea and vomiting.
This has also been associated with lower abdominal pain.
Pain is crampy and intermittent in nature.
She also notes increasing erythema and pain in her lower right arm which has been progressing over the last 2-3 days.
Upon transfer to medicine service: 47 yo F w/ h/o End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Hypertension (HTN), Schizophrenia, Hypothyroid dz p/w abdominal pain, watery/bloody diarrhea [**9-15**] from rehab, CT scan w/ evidence of colitis and portal venous air and wbc 20s on labs.
Pt admitted to surgical survice, and taken to OR [**9-16**] for exploratory lap, notable for colitis but no ischemic bowel.
After restarting these medications patient had a witnessed seizure and was intubated for airway protection.
EEG showed moderate diffuse encephalopathy still with focal features and occasional interictal epileptiform activity.
Chest CT showed opacification of LL atalectasis vs consolidation (intubation c/b right main stem intubation), and abx switched to vanc/cefepime for Hospital-acquired pneumonia treatment.
At this time, patient denies all pains or shortness of breath.
Past Medical History: PMH: Diabetes since age 12, ESRD on HD, hypertension, hypothyroidism, GERD, COPD/Asthma, h/o pancreatitis from hypertriglyceridemia PSH: appendectomy, multiple dialysis access procedures including right upper arm basilic transposition, left forearm fistulas as well as right forearm fistulas   Social History: SH: Lives in [**Hospital 21317**] nursing home in [**Location 21318**].
Family History: H/o diabetes mellitus and heart disease in the family.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM (per transplant surgery): VS: 98 90 153/65 18 100RA PE:  Gen - A&Ox3      CV - RRR      Pulm - CTAB      Abd - Soft, tenderness to deep palpation in bilateral lower abdomen, no rebound/guarding      Ext - Edema .
EXAM on transfer from SICU: Vitals: T: 97.7 P: 84 BP: 101/52 RR: 16 O2 99%RA General: awake, answers questions slowly but appropriately HEENT: EEG electrodes in place, MMM Pulmonary: Difficult to assess as patient has minimally cooperative with moving forward, rhonchorous anteriorly, no wheezes noted, decreased breath sound on L midaxillary line.
Cardiac: RRR, S1S2, 2/6 systolic murmur Abdomen: abd soft and nontender Extremities: warm, well perfused Neuro: Left pupil irregular, both pupils large and sluggishly reactive (4mm->3mm).
Neuro: A&Ox3, moving all extremeties, gait is normal Psych: Mood cotinues to be depressed although improved now that she's off the 1:1.
Mild J point and ST segment elevation in the inferior leads.
P-R interval prolongation.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2101-9-19**]: Sinus rhythm.
Intra-atrial conduction delay.
Cannot exclude inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
[**2101-9-25**]: Sinus rhythm.
Poor R wave progression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2101-9-19**] there is loss of precordial R wave which could be due to lead placement.
CXR [**2101-9-15**]: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
Circumferential wall thickening involving a long segment of colon spanning from the hepatic flexure to the proximal descending colon with mild surrounding fat stranding thought most likely to be infectious/inflammatory in etiology given the long distribution involved rather than ischemic.
Etiology is uncertain, but unlikely to be from ischemic bowel given the lack of pneumatosis or main portal or superior mesenteric venous air, as well as the fact that the colonic abnormalities span two vascular territories.
Trace left pleural effusion versus small amount of atelectasis.
CT head [**2101-9-18**]: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
A few hypodense foci in the right frontal lobe are indetemriante.
Intubation of the right mainstem bronchus with near complete atelectasis of the left lung.
Mild colon dilatation ( mainly the transverse and the ascending colon )No signs of thickening of the colon or intra-abdominal abscesses are identified.
Still, non contrast CT is not sensitive for detection of acute bowel ischemia and this cannot be excluded.
Small portal venous gas is seen that has not enlarged in comparison to previous examination.
Small amount of free air is entrapped between the liver capsule and the diaphragm representing residual air post laparoscopy .
EEG [**2101-9-20**]: This continuous recording revealed a moderately severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy initially with some focal features in the right central area admixed with multifocal interictal epileptiform activity and short duration bursts of semi-rhythmic epileptiform activity, the latter in the right frontal central region.
As the tracing evovled temporally, the background seemed to gradually improve such that, at the end of the record, it was still compatible with a moderate diffuse encephalopathy still with focal features and occasional interictal epileptiform activity.
Limited evaluation for a seizure focus secondary to lack of IV contrast.
No seizure focus identified.
No cortical abnormality in right frontal lobe, suggesting that the suspected finding on the previous CT was secondary to volume averaging artifact.
Mild chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
EEG [**2101-9-21**]: This EEG continues to give evidence for a moderately severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy with background slowing into the theta bandwidth with considerable admixed delta activity and some increased laterality to the slowing over the right central temporal region, the latter suggesting there may be a structural component in addition to the encephalopathic changes.
There continue to be multifocal interictal epileptiform transients but no sustained seizure discharges.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
EEG [**2101-9-22**]: This EEG gives evidence for what appears to be a moderate to moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy.
There are occasions where it appears to have some focal features in the right central area.
Superimposed are multifocal independent-appearing interictal discharges but there were no sustained discharges or events suggestive of electrographic seizure activity.
CXR [**2101-9-23**]: In comparison with the study of [**9-21**], there is no evidence of acute pneumonia at this time.
No vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
No obvious evidence of either stenosis or clot.

Now s/p extended hospital stay as described below:  BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE (SEE BELOW FOR PROBLEM BASED REVIEW) Ms. [**Known lastname 63242**] was initially sent to the ED from her nursing facility (Radius) with diffuse watery/bloody diarrhea.
CT scan performed on day of admission showed evidence of colitis and portal venous air.
Given concern for ischemic bowel, taken to surgery where an exploratory laparoscopy was performed.
No intervention during the surgery.
Following the administration of these medications the patient suffered a witnessed seizure ([**2101-9-19**]) and was intubated for airway protection.
CT head and MRI without focal findings.
EEG with moderate to severe encephalopathy and interictal/epileptiform spikes, but no seizure activities.
Post-extubation she was noted to have a flat affect and AMS.
At this time began to have command auditory hallucinations and SI.
Did have cellulitis around femoral cath site, treated with vanc.
Noted to have sinus tachycardia of unknwon etiology.
Patient declined a CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism, though the index of suspicion was quite low given that the patient had no shortness of breath, hypoxia and had been on propylactic heparin.
Underwent ex-lap due to concern regarding ischemic bowel although no ischemia was found and no intervention was made.
Over the remainder of her hospital stay, the patient had intermittent bouts of watery diarrhea although remained afebrile and without elevated WBC.
Unknwon etiology of initial bloody diarrhea although appears to have resolved at this time.
# Schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder: The patient carries a diagnosis of schizophrenia and  has been on clozaril for 20 years (100mg AM and 400mg PM).
Her clozril was stopped on admission given possible sedative affect.
# ESRD on HD: The patient underwent a right arm graft procedure in 7/[**2101**].
there was some question regarding cellulitis around the site of the femoral line and the patient received a 7 day course of vancomycin.
On [**10-7**], the patient was noted to have right arm swelling and an overlying rash although HD was tolerated and there was a palpable thrill.
The rash has since begun to resolve with low dose steroid cream.
Her arm swelling has continued to improve and dialysis is being tolerated through the graft without difficulty.
# Sinus Tachycardia: On the medicine floor, the patient has been persistently tachycardic.
Possibilities include pain from arm, discomfort from vulvar lesion (see below) or dehydration from diarrhea.
No CP or palp.
Unlikely PE as no hypoxia and patient w/o significnat risk factors.
Right arm swelling - On [**10-7**], the patient was noted to have right arm swelling and an overlying rash although HD was tolerated and there was a palpable thrill.
The rash has since begun to resolve with low dose steroid cream.
Her arm swelling has continued to improve and dialysis is being tolerated through the graft without difficulty.
Hyponatremia - Likely [**3-9**] psychogenic polydipsia.
Vulvar lesion: The patient has a chronic vulvar abscess that has been "cored" by OB/Gyn in the past.
OB/Gyn was consulted who diagnosed a labial abscess and recommended cosnervative management with [**Last Name (un) **] baths and an ultrasound to assess abscess size.
The following day the abscess began draining spontaneously and OB/Gyn recommended no further intervention.
Patient instructed to make OB/Gyn appointment as an outpatient for further evaluation of this abscess.
# IDDM: Difficult to control DM in house.
# Hospital-acquired Pneumonia: While in the SICU, the patient had right mainstem bronchus intubation with collapse of left lung.
After she was transferred to the medicine floor, repeat CXR was done without evidence of any pneumonia, so cefepime/vancomycin were stopped.
No active issues.
# GERD: Omeprazole changed to ranitidine.

You were admitted to the hospital with bloody diarrhea and required surgery to ensure you had good blood flow to your bowel.
When your clozaril and lamictal were restarted after the surgery, you had seizures and had to be intubated for airway protection.
You were extubated and your psychiatric medications were restarted at very low dose without further seizures or other problems.
You had cellulitis of your L femoral hemodialysis catheter site and were treated with vancomycin.
There was also some rash/redness on your R arm graft site which resolved with low dose topical steroids.
5) Please CONTINUE the clobetasol cream for your arm rash until it completely resolves.
7) You may CONTINUE Percocet every 6 hours as needed for your arm pain 8) You may CONTINUE Loperamide twice daily as needed for diarrhea  Followup Instructions: Primary Care Visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 2:15pm on Friday, [**10-21**].
You may call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 22754**] to make an OB/Gyn appointment for further evaluation and management of your labial abscess.
