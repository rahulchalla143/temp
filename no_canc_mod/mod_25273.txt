Her father died from cardiac disease at a relatively young age (not specified).
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with no JVD.
No thrills, lifts.
No ICD pocket tenderness.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, mild kyphosis.
Crackles to mid lungs bilaterally, R>L.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominal bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
The gradient across the mitral valve is increased (mean = 17 mmHg).
Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**6-11**]/201, the tricupsid valve vegetation is not clearly seen (may be because of poor image quality rather than resolution).
The degree of pulmonary hypertension and RV dilation has decreased.
EKG: The rhythm appears to be intermittent atrial paced and sinus but low amplitude wave forms make assessment difficult.
Left bundle-branch block with left axis deviation.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 72 year old female with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2157**], DM2, SSS s/p PM/ICD placement in [**2163-6-11**] and dilated cardiomyopathy who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**6-3**] with fever and lethargy, found to have vegetations on AICD leads, Mitral valve and Tricuspid valvee and Enterococcal sepsis, was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] [**6-5**] where ICD leads were extracted and IV antibiotics were initiated for endocarditis.
enterococcal endocarditis with ICD lead + MV + TV vegetations:  Patient presented to OSH with fevers to 102 and lethargy,Blood cultures revealed entercocci in [**9-17**] bottles as well as in her urine culture.
TTE showed vegetations involving the AICD leads, likely [**3-14**] enterococci urosepsis.
Patient was afebrile throughout her [**Hospital1 18**] course accept for a single spike of fever on [**6-16**] to 100.7.
CXR was without focal infiltrate.
Most recent TTE on [**6-18**] showed mild-mod MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**] mitral valve vegetation, vegetation was no longer seen on the tricuspid valve but this may be because of poor image quality rather than resolution.
There was moderate TR and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and RV dilatation which were improved from [**6-11**] study.
Follow-up Plan: -- Monitor fever curve and WBC -- Close follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the [**Hospital1 18**] Infectious Disease outpatient clinic with weekly CBC w/ diff, chem 7 (most important BUN,Cr) and LFT's.
# Congestive Heart Failure.
Due to initial episodes of hypotension diuretic regimen held.
On [**6-11**] patient noted to be dyspneic and tachypneic.
CXR consistent with pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
Patient was at that point 4 L positive since admission.
Severe PA systolic hypertension.
ACEi and diurises are currently held in the setting of renal failure.
Digoxin was decreased to three times a week because of renal function.
RHYTHM: The patient has a history of sick sinus syndrome, prompting the original placement EP study in [**2163**] which showed inducible polymorphic VT.  AICD was placed for primary prevention in the setting of depressed LV function (EF = 25-30%).
Recent ICD interrogation did not show life threatening arythmia in the prior year.
Telemetry during her hospital course showed multiple VPB's and runs of accelerated idioventricular rythm but no life threatening arrythmias.
Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency - baseline creatinin 1.2, trended up to peak of 2.4 in the setting of agressive duresis for heart failure and pulmonary edema.
Cr:BUN ratio changes were consistent with pre-renal etiology evolving to ATN.
There was no periheral eosinophilia.
OUTPATIENT FOLLOW_UP ISSUES: -- Close monitoring of renal function.
No evidence of liver injury or failure at the OSH.
Given her improving clinical condition, this was unlikely to be DIC or acute liver failure.
Normocytic anemia: Hct was stable, without signs of active bleeding.
She was given 2 units of pRBCs prior to the procedure, with an unimpressive Hct bump.
She was otherwise asymptomatic, ruled out for MI at OSH, and was without EKG changes compared to prior.
7. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
14. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
