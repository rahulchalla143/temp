Per [**Hospital1 **], patient had episode of LUQ abd pain not relieved by morphine on night of admission.
His course was complicated by peritoneal infection with VRE requiring broad spectrum antibiotics.

PE: Vitals: T 97.7, BP 110/68, HR 103, RR 24, 100% GEN: awake, alert, with eyes closed, trachestomy in place HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, anicteric sclera, MMM, oropharyngeal thrush noted NECK: supple, no LAD PULM: Poor inspiratory effort, though coarse rhonci/crackels bilat anterior/let with decr BS at bases CV: distant heart sounds, no appreciable m/r/g, mild left chest wall tenderness to palpation Abd: moderate abd distention with surgical scar noted.
Mild LUQ tenderness, no obvious guarding/rebound + BS EXT: Warm, [**2-20**]+ pitting edema throughout extending to sacral area with grade 1 decub ulcer on left lateral leg BACK: Stage 4 decub ulcer noted over sacrum with packing and surround skin breakdown, 3x5cm SKIN: As per above NEURO: CN grossly intact, moving all extremities.
Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes.
No focal abscess identified.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
Right renal cyst.
Approximately 1-cm non-enhancing lesion within the right main stem bronchus likely represents a foreign body or mucous plug, although neoplastic process cannot be completely ruled out.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Moderate-sized pericardial effusion is noted.
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-5-28**], moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis is now evident.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, right much greater than left.
No significant interval change.

Sputum culture from [**8-18**] is positive for pseudomonas sensitive to gentamycin and tobramycin.
Patient has had mucous plugging with airway collapse over weekend.
Was seen by IP to evaluate for possible pulmonary stents.
They did not feel that he was a great candidate for stenting, but will consider this as an outpatient after his other respiratory issues were optimized.
There is no emergent need for pulmonary stents.
Left sided chest pain/LUQ abdominal CT.  LFTs were found to be normal normal and CT A/P shows no etiology of abdominal pain.
EKG is unchanged, though troponins are mildly elevated.
Echo showed new moderate to severe AS with borderline RV contractile function.
Patient also has bilateral pleural effusions, which may be contributing to the chest pain.
No clear etiology of the pain was found.
Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], anasarca, deconditioning, pleural effusions, and bronchomalacia are all likely contributing to respiratory failure.
Urine culture at [**Hospital1 **] on [**8-13**] showed pseudomonas sensitive to cipro.
