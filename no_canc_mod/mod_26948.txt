Admission Date:  [**2200-11-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-11-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2142-8-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**] Chief Complaint: Upper GI bleed.
History of Present Illness: A 58 yo female with MMP including recently diagnosed AV endocarditis and recent left parietal infarct ([**10-20**]), HTN, CAD s/p CABG, DM2, GIB on anticoagulation,recent sepsis who is transferred from OSH with new CNS lesions.
Ms [**Known lastname 21822**] has had 2 recent admissions to OSH; first on [**10-20**] for parietal infarct.
Stroke w/u only revealed aortic plaque so she was started on coumadin and eventually discharged.
She had another admission on [**2116-10-29**] for chest pain and was found to have [**12-18**]+ bld cx for strep viridans and an eccho which revealed AV endocarditis.
She was note to have altered mental status at that time but no CNS imaging was pursued.
She got CT wet read "1.7 cm high density focus in left cerebral whiet matter vs. cortex.
Could be primary hemorrhage or hemorrghaic tumor."
She was seen by neurology and neurosurgery; on examination she was encephalopathic with evidence of right hemiparesis/ prior stroke.
at 10 am, found to have large maroon/black stool.
NG lavage showed bright red blood.
Coronary artery disease s/p CABG 2.
Hypertension 4.
Diabetes mellitus 5.
Chronic non healing right heel ulcer 6.
Chronic LE edema 7.
Hypothyroidism 8.
History of gastrointestinal bleeding on anticoagulation 9.
History of recent ARF requiring temporary dialysis 10.
This was complicated by prolonged intubation with trach and eventual decannulation.
Wide neck girth.
Left heal ulcer small with granulation.

Seems to be in and out of afib on tele  MRI head ([**2200-11-14**]): Signal abnormalities in left frontal and parietal lobes on the left, with anatomic distribution and imaging characteristics consistent with subacute infarctions of embolic etiology.
RUE Ultrasound: ([**2200-11-14**]): No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity  TTE ([**2200-11-15**]): The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2) Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Multiple splenic infarctions.
8-mm hypodensity in the right kidney, which is too small to characterize.
Status post subtotal colectomy with a diastasis in the anterior pelvic wall containing small bowel loops.
While some of the distal small bowel loops are distended with air/fluid levels, oral contrast reaches the rectum without evidence of bowel obstruction.
No free fluid and no drainable fluid collection in the abdomen or pelvis.
CXR ([**2200-11-16**]): Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation with interval worsening at the right base.
Diffuse osteopenia limiting fine the bony detail to diagnose nondispaced fractures and osteomyelitis changes.
No definite evidence of lytic or sclerotic changes underlying areas of soft tissue defects within the heels bilaterally.
A tiny cortical defect seen along the base of the fifth metatarsal on the left.
Recommend correlating clinically to determine if there is point tenderness or an ulcer underlying this lesion.
Endocarditis: Ms [**Known lastname 21822**] has AV endocarditis (strep viridans) with resultant CNS and splenic embolism.
Surveillance blood cultures were negative for strep viridans; however she was found to have ecoli bacteremia which was sensitive to meropenem.
Repeat echocardiogram at [**Hospital1 18**] did not show evidence of endocartidis.
Cerebral emboli: These likely represented septic emboli in the setting of endocarditis.
Ms [**Known lastname 21822**] is expected to have a persistant R hemiparisis but may regain some other functions.
This is suspected to be from translocation through esophagus or gut.
Upper GIB: Ms [**Known lastname 21822**] had a massive upper GIB on admission; she was intubated for airway protection and urgently scoped which showed multiple severe ulcers.
The decision for future anticoagulation in the setting of atrial fibrillation was to be made in the future in consultation with the patient's PCP.
Chronic pain: The patient's pain was felt to be secondary to her diabetic neurpathy.
The pain states that she had previously been on gabapentin, but that she did not tolerate this medication.
7. b/l heal ulcers: Patient presented with a history of chronic non-healing ulcers.
X-rays with no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Podiatry did not feel there was any need for debridement.
Plan was for repeat TFTs in [**3-20**] weeks to determine the need for increased dosing.
Diabetes mellitus: The patient presented with type II diabetes, on insulin.
Part of her hyperglycemia was felt to be secondary to steroids.
Her regimen at the time of discharge included: --Lantus 15units QHS --Regular 5units with meals --Humalog slidind scale  As above, her also has a diabetic neuropathy treated with fentanyl patch.
The ASA was held in the setting of her GI bleed.
Atrial fibrillation: During the admission, the patient was intermittantly in atrial fibrillation; at times were rate would increase to the 120s so, once her blood pressure stabilized, she was rate controlled with a beta-[**First Name3 (LF) 7005**].
On [**11-25**] she was switched to a CCB given possibility that her hyperkalemia was BB induced.
Right upper extremity edema: The patient had persistent RUE edema.
An ultrasound was performed on [**11-14**] and did not show any evidence of DVT.
The edema remained at the time of discharge.
It may have been secondary to septic emboli, but it may also have been associated with her untreated hypothyroidism.
Anxiety: The patient complained of intermittant anxiety during her hospitalization.
Low dose lorazepam was used with good effect and no apparent paradoxical agitation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Cerebral emboli 7.
Coronary artery disease 9.
Hypothyroidism 10.
Diabetes mellitus 11.
Bilateral heal ulcers 12.
Right upper extremity edema 13.
