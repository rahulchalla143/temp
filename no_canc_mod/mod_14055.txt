The patient had initially been admitted to Neurosurgery status post fall with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural bleed.
At the time of initial presentation the patient was on supplemental oxygen, had a neck brace, and was being closely monitored.
INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE ISSUES:  The patient did not receive any intervention for intracranial hemorrhage throughout her hospital stay.
She had a follow-up head computed tomography which showed a resolving subarachnoid hemorrhage, one resolving subdural hemorrhage, with some persistent subdural hemorrhage that had not grown in size.
Neurosurgery had been following the patient and felt that the patient's intracranial hemorrhage was stable, and no further intervention was needed.
Physical Therapy, and Occupational Therapy, and Speech Therapy were consulted to work with the patient.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had an aspiration pneumonia which complicated her course in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit.
She slowly decreased her oxygen requirement and began to have oxygen saturations on room air.
A follow-up chest x-ray was ordered which showed a stable left pleural effusion, a decreased right pleural effusion, and overall improved examination.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also complicated by a central line infection.
She had one temperature spike on [**10-20**], at which time her central line was discontinued, and follow-up cultures were performed.
A follow-up culture of the line tip as well as [**3-1**] blood cultures showed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus which was sensitive to vancomycin.
She remained afebrile throughout the rest of her hospital course.
The patient also had a continued elevated white blood cell count.
A search was done to look for additional infectious causes, and stool cultures were sent to look for Clostridium difficile (which was negative), and follow-up blood cultures were also negative.
Abdominal laboratories were drawn showed no evidence of intra-abdominal process or infection.
The cause of the patient's white blood cell count was unknown, but was thought to in part be related to central nervous system effect from her intracranial hemorrhage.
At times she was found to be increasingly irregular but not found to be in atrial fibrillation.
The patient had also been given fluid boluses with a modest decrease in her heart rate.
After discussion with Cardiology, it was felt that the patient likely had multifocal atrial tachycardia and that it did not appear that she had atrial fibrillation at that time.
The patient did have some short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia but maintained stable vital signs.
After her neck brace had been removed, and the patient began to improve with her mental status, a Speech and Swallow evaluation showed that the patient was safe to have soft diet without risk of aspiration pneumonia.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient had a low hematocrit throughout her hospital course; ranging from 28 to 30.
An anemia workup was done, and it was felt that the patient had anemia of chronic disease.
There was no evidence of blood loss.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout her hospital course, and no blood transfusions were needed.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia.
as needed (for shortness of breath or wheezing).
The patient was also instructed to follow up as an outpatient with Neurosurgery for an outpatient evaluation of resolving subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural bleed in 2 weeks with a repeat Head CT 3.
The patient was instructed that if she had any further episodes of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, hypotensive episodes, or other concerning symptoms that she should immediately contact her primary care physician and return to the Emergency Department.
