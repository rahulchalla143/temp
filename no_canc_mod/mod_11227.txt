Admission Date:  [**2163-4-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2163-4-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2105-2-7**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 58-year-old woman with a history of severe asthma requiring many past hospitalizations.
No Intensive Care Unit stays and has never been intubated who presents with worsening shortness of breath over the past several hours, not relieved by inhalers.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 38086**] was in her usual state of health until three days prior to admission when she began to have fevers, nonproductive cough, worsening shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion.
On the day of admission, these symptoms became worse, and they were not relieved by her rescue albuterol inhaler.
A chest x-ray showed hyperinflated lungs with no infiltrate.
Urinalysis showed a pH of 5, trace ketones, and a glucose of greater than 1000.
An abdominal CT was performed which was negative for ischemia or abnormalities.
She then had an episode of chest pain which occurred on the way to the CT scan which she regarded as anxiety.
A 12-lead electrocardiogram at that time was negative for ischemia.
ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
No recent travel.
No change of residence.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was positive for diabetes.
Mother recently died of chronic renal failure related to her diabetes.
In general, a mildly obese African-American woman in mild respiratory discomfort.
No thyromegaly.
Chest revealed bilateral symmetric excursions, expiratory and inspiratory wheezes throughout.
No costovertebral angle tenderness.
No third heart sound or fourth heart sound.
Extremities revealed no ankle edema, no calf tenderness or swelling, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed complete blood count with white blood cell count of 12.8, hematocrit of 12.1, platelets of 381.
ASSESSMENT:  A 58-year-old woman with severe asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus (on metformin) presenting with an asthma exacerbation.
The patient seems to have had about one week of worsening upper respiratory tract infection symptoms; probably a viral upper respiratory infection preceding this admission, which most likely led to the exacerbation.
A transient episode of lactic acidosis of unknown etiology, now resolving; possibly due to side effect of metformin.
DIABETES:  The patient reported having high blood sugars in the 400 range for about two weeks before admission.
The patient will be leaving on an adjusted control regimen due to metformin being discontinued secondary to an episode of lactic acidosis.
A KUB on the fifth day of admission showed no free air, no signs of perforation, and no signs of obstruction with retained contrast throughout the bowel.
On the night prior to discharge, she had a large bowel movement overnight with subsequent relief of her symptoms of bloating.
The patient is much more comfortable now after having a large bowel movement.
Current episode of constipation was probably due to a combination of inactivity, poor p.o.
fluid intake, and low fiber diet.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14323**] was in agreement with the treatment plan, and she will follow Ms. [**Known lastname 38086**] over the next couple of week; every two to three days by phone to follow blood sugar levels and NPH dosing while Ms. [**Known lastname 38086**] is being tapered from her prednisone for an asthma exacerbation.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acute asthma exacerbation.
The patient was interested in following with diabetes care specialist.
