Briefly, this is a 47 year old white female with alcoholic cirrhosis with Grade II varices who has had a prolonged hospital course complicated by repeat Medical Intensive Care Unit stays for hematemesis with hemodynamic instability.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**3-3**] for hematemesis with Grade II-III varices requiring [**Last Name (un) 9081**] placement after failed injection.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**3-13**] for hematemesis with Grade II varices with bands times two were placed.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**3-19**] for hematemesis due to laceration near banding.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**4-16**] for hematemesis with Grade II varices, bands times three placed.
Negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy [**4-18**] for hematemesis with stable hematocrit.
The patient was most recently called to floor on [**2122-4-22**], however, on morning of [**2122-4-24**], the patient complained of increased nausea with a drop in hematocrit from the 30s to 27, about 200 cc.
of hematemesis and a systolic blood pressure drop to the 70s.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed blood in the lower [**11-28**] of her esophagus and at the gastroesophageal junction, cardia and fundus.
Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a clot in the cardia and fundus with no active bleed.
Mild nausea, left PICC clear.
Lungs with coarse breath sounds bilaterally with poor inspiratory effort.
Abdomen distended, diffuse mild discomfort.
She tolerated the procedure well and remained hemodynamically stable with no further hematemesis.
Her melena persisted for several days with mild decrease in hematocrit when Octreotide was discontinued, however, at the time of discharge, she had regular brown bowel movements intermittently guaiac positive but with stable hematocrit.
END STAGE LIVER FAILURE:  The patient was continued on her Lactulose, Ursodiol for symptomatic relief and with Flagyl added to help relieve encephalopathy.
She required approximately [**Hospital1 **]-weekly large volume therapeutic paracenteses and these were done by ultrasound guidance, given her history of peritoneal bleed.
She actually completed a 20 day course of antibiotic given her high risk for infection with numerous procedures and repeat episodes of hematemesis.
She had no further positive peritoneal fluid cultures.
DECREASED RENAL FUNCTION:  At the time of transfer to the Unit, the patient with increased creatinine felt to be pre-renal in nature.
However, during the course of her stay, her urine output decreased considerably.
Her creatinine did not increase however, it was felt that this was due to her low body protein state.
She received Atarax and Sarna lotion for symptomatic relief.
RESPIRATORY:  On admission to Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was intubated for airway protection, given active hematemesis and need for repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopies.
She required only minimal ventilatory support and was extubated successfully without complication.
GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS:  On [**5-6**], the patient had blood cultures sent to evaluate persistent leukocytosis.
She grew two out of four bottles with Gram positive cocci in pairs, clusters.
On [**2122-5-6**], she had a positive urinalysis with 10 to 100,000 Gram positive bacteria to be isolated.
Plan is for rehabilitation planning with eventual Hospice care.
