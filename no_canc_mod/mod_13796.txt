Left occipital hemorrhage and right occipital and right cerebellar infarction.
New hypodensity within the right occipital lobe, which has progressed compared to the prior study of [**2171-12-25**], likely representing evolving infarction in the territory of the right PCA.
Stable appearance of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left occipital lobe, extending into the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
No interval increase in edema or mass effect, and no new areas of hemorrhage identified.
Once again, there is diffuse increased opacity of the right hemithorax, related to a layering right effusion.
While the interstitial markings are prominent, there is no overt failure.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CT chest [**2172-1-2**]: 1) Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusion, associated with atelectasis.
3) Two noncalcified pulmonary nodules measuring 3 mm in diameter in the right upper lobe.
Please follow in one year if this patient has no history of malignancy, and please follow in three months if this patient has history of malignancy.
4) Large hiatal hernia associated with 2-cm paraesophageal lymph node.
5) Marked degenerative changes with compression fracture of the thoracic spine.
Left occipital bleed with intraventricular extension and right occipital infarction.
84 yo woman with history of hypertension who was transferred from the OSH with left occipital bleed.
Head CT day after admission showed a roughly 20cc bleed in the left occipital lobe, cortical, round appearing, with some interventricular extension, no hydrocephalus.
The patient was very hypertensive on admission.
HCTZ was later stopped because of hyponatremia.
Non-contrast head CT was obtained which now showed new infarction in the right occipital lobe.
MRI/MRA were done and were unrevealing for potential cause of the patient's bilateral occipital events.
The etiology of her bleed felt most likely to be a hemorrhagic transformation of an occipital infarct, although extension of hemorrhage into the ventricle is difficult to explain in this setting.
Other possibilities for occipital hemorrhage in this patient are amyloid angiopathy and less likely HTN.
MRI/MRA were negative for mass or aneurysm.
The patient has atrial fibrillation (was not on anticoagulation) which is a potential source of thromboembolism to the brain.
Transthoracic echo was also checked and did not show thrombi or vegetations.
She followed simple commands but her mental status was not improved enough for safe self feeding.
Confusion, likely secondary to the occipital lobe bleed vs. UTI.
Seizure activity may have been due to the cortical bleed, or may have been secondary to hypokalemia (K 2.9).
She remained afebrile throughout her hospitalization.
She was started on Levaquin on [**12-24**] for UTI diagnosed at the outside hospital.
Chest X-ray on [**2171-12-29**] showed new retrocardiac opacity suggestive of atelectasis or new infiltrate or effusion.
Flagyl was added on [**2171-12-29**] given rising WBC to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia.
The patient did not have sputum to send for culture.
Bilateral effusions were noted on CXR and chest CT.
The patient had no diarrhea and her abdominal exam was benign.
CRP and ESR were checked because of concern for persistent leukocytosis and came back at 110 and 18.7, respectively.
However, given recent cerebral infarct, hemorrhage, G/J tube placement and recent infection.
There was no localizing source of bleeding and decrease in HCT was attributed to dilutional effect.
Iron studies (pre-transfusion) were checked and reveled low normal serum iron, elevated ferritin and slightly low TIBC.
The above picture is most c/w anemia of chronic disease but would recommend rechecking when the patient is over acute illness.
The patient needs to have complete work up for amenia as an outpatient.
On [**1-2**] the patient had a hypertensive episode with SBP in 250's while she was in interventional radiology for PEG tube placement due to missed doses of po meds.
Renal insufficiency.
FE NA calculated to be 0.1% which is consistent with prerenal failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
She was not anticoagulated initially given acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Head CT on [**2172-1-2**] showed no new hemorrhage or progression of existing hemorrhage.
This felt to be likely secondary to HCTZ as work up was c/w renal wasting.
Pulmonary nodules.
Chest CT was done for evaluation of the nodule that was seen on chest X-ray.
This was not confirmed on chest CT and felt to be an artery or artifact.
Final chest CT results showed two 3 mm RUL nodules, paraesophageal lymph node, pulmonary effusions, and vertebral compression fracture.
Pulmonary nodules seen on chest CT will need to be followed up with repeat chest CT to evaluate for interval changes.
Volume overload.
The patient developed anasarca and total body volume overload likely secondary to retention due to poor nutritional status, diastolic dysfunction, and possible as an adverse reaction to medications causing water retention.
She will need daily weights and frequent reassessment of her volume status.
PEG tube was placed on [**1-3**] for nutrition because the patient's mental status and cooperation remained poor to allow for independent feeding.

Urinary tract infection 9.
Bilateral pleural effusions 10.Urethral nodule   Discharge Condition: Patient is cortically blind.
She did not pass swallowing evaluation dut to poor cooperation/mental status.
Call your doctor or return to the ED if you develop sudden weakness of an arm or leg, difficulty speaking or understanding, slurring of your speech or difficulty swallowing.
