Admission Date:  [**2148-12-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-12-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-8-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status and unsteady gait  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Puncture at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]   History of Present Illness: 49LHM with no significant past medical history who presnets as a transfer from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Last Name (un) 5869**] after initial viral prodrome and latterly progressive gait instability, intermittent sensory symptoms, drowsiness and expressive aphasia with now resolved dysarthria in addition to confusion, found to have a significantly elevated CSF protein on LP and MRI showed multifocal white matter lesions concerning for ADEM vs other neuro-inflammatory process.
Per [**Hospital1 78544**] [**Location (un) 620**] notes: The patient initially presented to a PCP's office on [**11-25**] with a 2 week history of several symptoms suggestive of viral infection with nausea and occasional vertigo.
He was in [**State **] with his girlfriend over the long weekend of [**Holiday 1451**] after which he had noted these symptoms.
He also woke one night with severe L arm pain and numbness, the arm pain had substantially imprived at the time of assessment although was still minimally uncomfortable at that point.
Also  had some numbness in the R leg which had mostly improved.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] following day he was assessed on [**11-26**] by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 838**] at whhich point he also reported symptoms of numbness and paraesthesias that were bilateral involving both areas of trunk and extremities.
He was also found to have cervical lymphadenopathy.
He did not have a documented a fever but he has had episodes of profuse sweats and chills.
At roughly around this time, he had apparently also noted left arm and right leg paresthesias.
By [**12-3**] he denied myalgias but his malaise continued and he further reported increasing sinus congestion in the sinuses in addition to increased mucus.
He was examined and found to have inflammation in the posterior pharynx and erythema of the tympanic membranes and was given a course of azithromycin and fexofenadine for possible pharyngitis with ear infection.
On [**12-5**] he continued to have feeling of decreased energy and fatigue, saw another doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 37044**] and this was again put down to a viral syndrome.
St this point, he also endorsed increased urinary frequency with low volume, some hesitancy since [**11-25**] and nocturia several times nightly.
He was felt to have "neuroasthenia" and sent home.
Per report of his relatives:  Patient has not recently been to a forest or recall being biten by a tick or having a charcaterisatic Lyme rash.
He then had the viral syndrome as above with fatigue and feeling generally unwell and nasal congestion with rhinorrhea.
They then noted that for the 2 weeks prior to admission that he had been progresively unsteady on his feet feeling him clumsy and felt that his movements in general were slower and latterly had difficulty getting up from a chair or the sofa, requiring several attempts.
He also had progressive fatigue and was listless.
Worryingly, his parents also noted worsening of his speech with word-finding diffficulties and having difficulty keeping himself on track with a conversation.
They also felt that his speech was slow and that he latterly was confused and not able to answer questions in a straightforward manner.
At this time he has been living with his parents and noted increasing difficulty ambulating, losing his balance frequently.
Increasing confusion was also reported by family.
Due to his worsening symptoms in addition to assessment by several doctors (one of which apparently said he had encephalitis?)
He was repetitive in his speech and appeared to have trouble finding words.
On examination at [**Location (un) 620**], he was felt to have an expressive aphasia and noted a right extensor plantar and right side horizontal nystagmus.
There is no documenattion of CSF opening pressure but the results were 5 WBC (lymphhocyte predominant), glucose 59, total protein significantly elevated at 231.6.
He was started on acyclovir and Ceftriaxone and he was initially assessed as most likely having either herpes encephalitis, neurosyphilis, vernix encephalopathy, or demyelinating disease.
By report, he did not have concerning respiratory, cardiac issues and had mild drowsiness.
Follow up MRI showed multi-focal white matter hyperintensities and pachymeningeal enhancement (done post-LP).
Currently, teh patient denies any word-finding diffficulties although this is verily apparent as history taking was taxing indeed and resulted in circling conversations around points for which he was not able to succinctly describe.
On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denies left arm pain but on examination this was somwhat limited by this.
Past Medical History: Left arm pain seen 3 weeks prior which has now mostly resolve Recurrent left ankle cellulitsi per patient Congentital dysplasia of the left hip s/p operaion at [**Hospital3 18242**] in infancy Previous broken bones but no other operations   Social History: He is divorced and lives alone - he has a girlfrined with children from his former marriage.
Patient alos works as a scientist recruiter for a pharmaceurtical company.
There is no history of recent travel outside the Northeast in the past 6 months save [**State **] where his girlfriend works.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx but pharynx mildly erythematous Ears - minimal cerumen with intact tympanic membranes without erytehma and clear cone of light bilaterally Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Very difficult to relay history with very circular conversations and clear difficulty to express himself with slow speecah dn slow to respond at times.
He was also had reduced attention making mistakes at [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] backwards and significant latency with the task 30-45s.
was however able to name both high and low frequency objects without diffficulty.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Present pout reflex - no grasp and ?
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema or isc pallor although was limited by signficant nystagmus.
III, IV, VI: Generally unimpaired saccades with bilateral coarse endgaze nysamgus biletarlly and less so vertical nystagmus and much less downgaze nystagmus.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
-Coordination: Mild LUE and LLE dysmetria with mild overshoot on the left with mirroring task and reduced RAMs.
No significant proximal weakness on getting up.
No pulmonary edema, no lung nodules or masses.
No pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Normal appearance of craniocervical junction, cervical and thoracic cord as well as the conus medullaris, specifically without evidence of demyelination or abnormal contrast enhancement.
Mild degenerative changes of the cervical and thoracic spine as detailed above.
Widespread pattern of scattered slow diffusion distributed over the supra-and infratentorial white and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter with predominance of the corpus callosum.
Given the pattern of lesions and their distribution, the findings most likely represent ischemic foci in the setting of vasculitis.
Neurophysiology: EEG	Study Date of [**2148-12-13**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG in the apparently awake state due to the presence of a slow background that was reactive to attempts at arousal.
The presence of generalized bursts of slowing is consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.
The bursts of bifrontally predominant slowing can also be associated with an encephalopathic state, or may be seen in patients with increased intracranial pressure and/or dysfunction of midline or deeper structures.
No evidence of ongoing or potential epileptogenesis was seen at the time of this recording.
Note is also made of a borderline slow cardiac rhythm.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo M without sig PMH presented with presumed viral infection complicated by ataxia and encephalopathy with progressive speech problems and confusion and decreased alertness with white matter hyperintensities in cerebellum, brainstem and also in corpus callosum on MRI.
LP showed 5 WBC and Pr markedly elevated at 203.
On examination very poor memory and attention confused with a frontal affect, dysmetric, unsteady on feet with right sided hearing loss.
Opthalmology noted branch retinal artery occlusion in the right eye and given this and the presence of further DWI bright lesions on repeat MRI, the diagnosis was Susac's syndrome.
# Neurology: Patient presented to medical attention initially with presumed viral infection with transient paraesthesiae and numbness which latterly resolved and then progressed with a 2 week history of worsening speech characterised by word-finding difficulties and poor attention and memory in addition to worsening gait.
At initial assessment at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], patient had an LP which showed 5 WBC (lymphhocyte predominant), glucose 59, total protein significantly elevated at 231.6.
He was started on acyclovir and Ceftriaxone and he was initially assessed as most likely having an infectious process and due to drowsiness he was transferred to the ICU there.
After MRI-head showed scattered white matter hyperintensities in cerebellum, brainstem and also in corpus callosum (one of which was DWI bright with a correlation on ADC) he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU out of concern for ADEM.
On arrival, he was found to have marked inattention, was confused and poorly able to communicate due to significant expressive problems and severe memory deficits.
He was also found to have left-sided subtle dysmetria and right-sided hearing loss in addition to likely frontal dysinhibition (he seemed to be unconcerned when he was spontaneously incontinent after attempting to use the urinal).
MRI of the C and T spine showed no demyelinating lesions and given the DWI findings suggestive of a possible vasculopathy/vasculitis in the presence of hearing loss, ophthalmology review was sought to rule out Susac's syndrome.
Opthalmology examined the patient and found a branch retinal artery occlusion in the right eye and after repeat MRI showed new DWI bright lesions this met the criteria for Susac's syndrome a rare condition otherwise known as Retinocochleocerebral Vasculopathy.
EEG showed encephalopathy and no seizures.
Rheumatology was consulted who agreed with a likely diagnosis of Susac's syndrome.
He remained afebrile througout this entire admission.
# OPTHO: Pt was noted on optho exam to have a branch retinal artery occlusion.
# Platelets: downtrending since admission, 139 on discharge.
# CVS: while here, pt was monitored on telemetry but no arrythmias were noted.
1.Susac's syndrome: - f/u appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/[**Doctor Last Name **] at which point prednisone dose can be adjusted - continue blood glucose control, ulcer ppx while on steroids - continue with PT/Ot and cognitive rehabilitation  2. coagulation - please note that while on heparin sc, he had uptrending elevated PTT (59) which decreased to normal after stopping this medication.
- he was also noted to have downtrending platelets which should be trended for now  Medications on Admission: Medications: (home meds) AZITHROMYCIN - 250 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day take 2 today MECLIZINE [ANTIVERT] - 25 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth at bedtime .
