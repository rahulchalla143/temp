Admission Date:  [**2111-4-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-4-20**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Codeine / Diltiazem Hcl / Nsaids / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Methyldopa / Propoxyphene  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: patient arrived intubated w/ a suspected R parietal hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: extubation, arterial line placement and removal  History of Present Illness: (per notes, [**Hospital1 18**] ED reports, [**Hospital3 6265**] records, and [**Location (un) 582**] Staff): Ms. [**Known lastname 86119**] is an 88 [**Hospital **] nursing home resident of unknown handedness with a past medical history including HTN, a fib for which she is on coumadin, prior stroke, DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement, and HD-dependent ESRD who initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with language difficulties and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after she was thought to have evidence of traumatic parietal intracranial hemorrhage.
There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness.
Although her speech was grammatical English, it was characterized as "disorganized" and the patient was noted to refer to herself in the third person.
She was reported to be moving all four limbs, but was thought to have decreased coordination.
It is unclear if she suffered further changes in mental status.
At [**Hospital1 46**], a non-contrast CT of the head was thought to show evidence of hemorrhage.
She was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care with a presumed diagnosis of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.
Of note, no acute hemorrhage was detected upon repeat imaging performed at the [**Hospital1 18**].
NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW OF SYSTEMS - unable to obtain  GENERAL REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: - unable to obtain   Past Medical History: - CAD s/p MI - HTN - A fib, on coumadin - prior stroke (presumaby in right parietal +/- left occipital based on imaging) - HD-ESRD, receives dialysis M, W, F, right chest access - DVT/PE, s/p IVC filter placement - PMR - anxiety - vertigo - upper GIB - bilateral TKR - OA - probable right eye procedure  Social History: lives at nursing home was recently hospitalized multiple times and required initiation of HD.
HEENT: Normocepahlic, atruamatic, no scleral icterus noted.
Skin: no rashes or concerning lesions noted.
Mental Status: * Degree of Alertness: does not arouse to voice, gentle tactile, or noxious stimulation  Cranial Nerves: * I: Olfaction not evaluated.
Motor: * Bulk: No evidence of atrophy.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Encephalomalacia and cortical laminar necrosis in the right parietal lobe consistent with old infarct.
Hypodensity in the left occipital lobe may represent subacute or chronic infarct.
If there is concern for acute ischemia, MRI is recommended for further evaluation, if there is no contra-indication.
Bilateral ethmoid mucosal thickening.
No acute fracture or malalignment.
Severe multilevel degenerative change with multilevel neural foraminal narrowing as above.
If there is continued concern for cord, ligamentous or nerve injury, MR C spine can be considered if there is no contra-indication.
No acute intrathoracic, abdominal or pelvic injury.
Peribronchial thickening in the right lower lobe suggestive of bronchitis.
Multiple 3-5 mm pulmonary nodules.
Aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal descending aorta up to 4.5 cm, incompletely evaluated on this study.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Persistent opacification at the left base with some degree of mediastinal shift is again consistent with volume loss and possible effusion.
The right hemidiaphragm now is not seen, suggesting atelectasis and effusion on this side as well.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 86119**] is an 88 year-old W from NH handedness with a past medical history including HTN, a fib for which she is on coumadin, prior stroke(s), DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement, and HD-dependent ESRD who initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with ?
language difficulties and mild confusion, and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after she was thought to have evidence of traumatic parietal intracranial hemorrhage.
Studies in the ED revealed urinary tract infection (which could potentially account for the patient's presenting syndrome) as well as a CT showing chronic to subacute strokes w/ suspected hemorrhage being consistent w/ a calcification.
Examination remained severely encephalopathic with a poor motor examination (withdrawal to noxious that was sluggish) due to having had received over 7mg of Ativan, etomidate, succinyl choline and vecuronium.
At this time she was alert, awake, however remarkably encephalopathic (inattentive, unable to conduct a congruent conversation) however with intact spontaneous language, albeit w/ markedly hoarse voice.
Patient was maintained on home dose of BB converted to IR dosing, however developed Afib w/ RVR and subsequent hypotension to mid 70s SBP while intubated.
Bedside echo revealed poor filling.
Patient initially failed extubation attempt due to low lung volumes on CPAP in setting of persistent paralytics.
There was evidence of b/l pleural effusions on CXR attributed to vol.
CT chest showed multiple pulmonary nodules (see Pertinent results) that will require imaging follow up on [**4-18**] months with CT.  .
Stage IV renal failure on HD, over the past few months per family.
No cause identified, however, likely due to longstanding HTN.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB, wheezing.
Prednisone 10 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO once a day: Please start after treatment of UTI is complete.

1) Urine culture was positive for vancomyicn resistant enterococcus.
