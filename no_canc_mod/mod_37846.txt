MD: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]; [**University/College 96450**]   The patient is an 84 year-old man with a PMH significant for ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 25%, CAD, DVT/A Fib on coumadin, bladder cancer s/p transurethral resection requiring straight cath who presents to the ED following episode of lightheadness.
During this time patient became lightheaded/presyncopal and consequently presented to the ED.
Denies recent hematuria (other than todays episode) or blood in the stool.
Has baseline orthopnea and PND - but no recent increase.
Patient had one transient episode of shortness of breath last week but resolved without intervention.

Patient's blood pressure improved to 100-110 with 3 L NS but prior to ICU transfer became hypotensive (SBP 80s) requiring central line placement and started on Levophed.

There is a small amount of free air in the bladder and a Foley catheter in situ.
There is prominent trabeculation at the right lateral wall of the bladder with bladder diverticula seen postero-laterally on the right.
There is mild residual thickening of the bladder wall seen at the left side posteriorly, near but not at the left ureteral orifice.
No bladder leak is seen.
There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis most seen in the right iliac fossa.
There is extensive vascular calcification noted.
No pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.
BONY STRUCTURES: There is moderate-to-severe degenerative changes noted in both hips.
No destructive lytic or sclerotic bony lesions are seen.
No bladder leak.
Multiple small bladder diverticula seen.
Mild thickening of the bladder wall, seen in the left posterior location.
CXR [**12-7**]-FINDINGS: Again seen, is a left-sided cardiac pacer/defibrillator with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
EKG clips and wires overly the chest and somewhat limit evaluation.
There is subtle opacity in the left lower lung which appears stable from prior and likely represents chronic scarring.
However, there is a new ill-defined opacity in the lateral aspect of the right mid-lung which could represent pneumonia versus mass.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: New opacity in the right mid-lung may represent infection or mass - dedicated PA and lateral views or a chest CT recommended - discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 49784**] at 19:53 on [**2168-12-7**].
There is overall slight interval increase in the right upper lobe diffuse opacity that might represent minimal gradual progression of infection, but there is no evidence of worsening of moderate interstitial engorgement since the prior study.
Chronic changes in the lung bases can be partially addressed on this non-dedicated study.
Left basal atelectasis and small amount of left pleural effusion are redemonstrated.
If patient is short of breath, it might be attributed actually to diffuse interstitial lung disease and correlation with dedicated chest CT may be considered.
IMPRESSION: Chronic lung changes, no failure.
There has been no significant change since the prior chest x-rays.
No gross failure is present.
The irregularities suggest the atrial rhythm is atrial fibrillation.
On the prior tracing there was atrial pacing.
Compared to tracing #1 no diagnostic change.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: Pt is an 84 y.o male with h.o ischemic CMP EF 25%, CAD, DVT/afib on coumadin as outpt, bladder cancer s/p transurethral resection requiring straight cath who presented with hematuria and was initially admitted to ICU with urosepsis requiring pressors.
While in the ICU, pt developed new thrombocytopenia.
#Urinary tract infection (s/p shock and urosepsis)-Pt's urine culture grew pan-sensitve E.coli and Klebsiella.
CT pelvis ruled out bladder perforation or abscess formation.
Urology follow-up for h.o bladder cancer arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**].
Likely related to sepsis +/- antibiotic use.
Pt did not display signs of bleeding.
NO signs of active bleeding were present after initial hematuria.
Likely related to recent hematuria, infection and hemodilution.
s/p aggressive volume resuscitation due to sepsis in the ICU.
For increased SOB/hypoxia would consider 40mg IV lasix x1.
Suspect that this was due to acute systolic heart failure.
In addition, pt with CXR findings suggestive of basilar scaring and possible interstitial lung disease.
Pt should continue to follow up and can consider imaging with CT scan or pulmonary eval in the outpatient setting.
#CAD-no active chest pain.
1 episode of SOB [**12-11**].
BB and ACEi had been initially held given hypotension but restarted BB (carvedilol 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] and ACEI lisinopril 2.5mg) on [**12-15**] with good effect.
#b/l medial toe erythema-symmetric on toes, appears to be from pressure or sleep position rather than an acute gouty flare.
Area of pain is localized to these specific areas and not the joints or the joints of the great toe.If signs of gout were to develop or occur, could consider renally dosed colchicine x1 and/or prednisone.
#bladder cancer s/p transurethral resection-followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**].
#incidential radiographic findings-CXR found subtle opacity in left lower lung that appears stable and likely represents scarring.
Repeat CXR shows lung base chronic findings that could be suggestive of interstitial lung disease.
Pt did not have fever or other clincal signs of PNA.
Chest CT could be performed in the outpatient setting for further evaluation.
