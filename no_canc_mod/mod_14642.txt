2) Stranding about the pancreatic head and probable small fluid collection about the pancreatic head and duodenum consistent with the patient's diagnosis of pancreatitis.
Slight decrease in intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
4) Bilateral renal cysts and additional hypodense lesions within the kidneys, too small to accurately characterize, but likely representing cysts.
