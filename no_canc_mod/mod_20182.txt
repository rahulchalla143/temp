"[**Doctor Last Name **]") is an 86 M with a history of CVA with chronic right-sided weakness, seizure disorder subsequent to CVA, hypertension now off meds, CHF with unknown current LVEF (last 75% in [**2117**]), recent ED visit for urinary retention secondary to urethral stricture who presents for a planned admission for re-evaluation of the airways following Y-stent removal at his last hospitalization on [**2122-3-21**].
During his last hospital admission, he was found to have a post-obstructive pneumonia presumed secondary to partial tracheal stent occlusion noted on bronchoscopy.
Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab paperwork, recent active issues include fevers, thrombocytopenia, edema, diarrhea, and variable mental status.
He has expressive aphasia since his stroke and at his best can speak only a few words at a time; recently he has had significant secretions when the vent is capped so he has not been speaking, but can nod yes/no to questions and communicate with facial expressions.
His aide who is with him and was with him at rehab confirms that he has had recent watery diarrhea, which has been improving since Monday.
He denies any pain including abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: 1) Tracheomalacia, status post stent x 2 with failure secondary  to stent migration.
2) Status post stroke in [**2109**] with TIA; right upper extremity weakness resulting.
4) Seizure disorder.
No recent alcohol.
Prior to this admission, he would occasionally take some puree by mouth for pleasure but TF provide nutrition.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: ADMISSION VS: Temp: 97.7 BP: 128/70 HR:70 RR:21 O2sat 100% on FiO2 0.3 GEN: Appears comfortable, NAD, following commands, nodding head yes/no HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions though difficult to visualize back of mouth as patient cannot open fully Neck: Supple, no JVD RESP: Diminished BS at left base, referred ventillation noises, no wheeze or rales CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: Mildly distended, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: Non-pitting edema of feet and right hand (per aide, unchanged since arriving at rehab).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%).
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-10-29**], the multivalvular regurgitation is now seen and there now appears to be lack of atrial systolic function.
In the absence of a history of systemic hypertension, these raise the suggestion of an infiltrative process such as amyloid cardiomyopathy.
Proctitis, without evidence of megacolon.
Multi-segmental collapse of the bilateral lower lobes, with foci of ground glass opacity in the aerated lung, consistent with aspiration or infection.
There are associated moderate-sized simple pleural effusions.
Nonspecific renal hypodensities might represent cysts though ultrasound evaluation is suggested for further characterization when clinically appropriate.
Bronch [**4-27**] Severe granulation tissue formation at distal end of left limb of the Y-stent.
Thick putrulent secretions sent for microbilogy.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2122-4-30**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.

No psudomembranes seen, no mass lesion seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 M with history of tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheostomy and stent placement on ventillator overnight at baseline with recent admission for post-obstructive left-sided pneumonia followed by removal of stent who presented for planned rigid bronchoscopy.
His hospital course was prolonged by sepsis secondary to pseudomonas pneumonia, illeus and protitis.
Tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent removal [**2-/2122**]: Since his prior admission for post-obstructive pneumonia during which his Y-stent was removed (see operative report note above), he has been chronically ventillated in rehab.
Patient initially did well on trach mask, but then developed copious secretions concerning for a VAP.
He progressively worsened (see shock below) and ultimately Y-stent was removed in OR by IP on [**2122-4-27**] without intraoperative complication.
Septic Shock/ventilator associated pneumonia - While in the ICU for monitoring after his Y-stent placement, Mr. [**Known lastname 34384**] developed worsening pulmonary secretions and chest x-ray was concerning for pneumonia/VAP.
He developed worsening hypotension with transient requirement of pressors.
Repeat sputum culture grew Pseudomonas, Klebsiella and stenotrophomonos.
In the presence of dilated bowel loops on KUB and grimmacing to abdominal palpation; surgery was consulted for concern of obstruction vs. other acute process.
CT abdomen and pelvis showed no obstruction, concern for proctitis.
He had a flexible sigmoidoscopy which showed resolving proctitis, perhaps secondary to ischemia.
There was no active bleed and no psuedomembranes.
Symptoms were most likely [**2-25**] proctitis and associated ileus.
History of C. Diff - Recent diarrhea at reheab, C. difficile culture negative per report in rehab paperwork, remaining bacterial stool studies cancelled.
Hypervolemia - Mr. [**Known lastname 34384**] is ~10L positive for his hospital admission, diuresing as tolerated with IV Lasix.

After the procedure you developed a pneumonia as well a low blood pressure.
You also developed a lower GI bleed (blood per rectum).
Surgery and Gastroenterology evaluated you and CT scan of your abdomen showed Proctitis (inflammation of the very distal bowel).
You were treated empirically for C. Diff infection.
You improved without intervention.
