Admission Date:  [**2111-1-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2111-2-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2034-6-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 41752**] is a 77 year old male with a history of severe aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who originally presented to [**Hospital1 69**] with a several month history of progressive dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and increased lower extremity edema.
There was minimal improvement in aortic gradient and aortic valve area, and no change in cardiac index.
While on the Cardiac Care Unit Service, his platelets began to fall, and he was found to be heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody positive.
It was felt that he could be re-tested in 60 days for possible resolution of his antibody, and at that time, may be a candidate for surgery.
While awaiting surgery, and after discovery of the heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody, Mr. [**Known lastname 41752**] continued to deteriorate on the floor with an inability to diurese very well due to renal insufficiency and hypertension.
A line originally could not be placed due to coagulopathy, and while awaiting his coags to return to baseline, Mr. [**Known lastname 41752**] expressed wishes for no more procedures or interventions.
He had an improvement in urine output at this point, and maintenance of heart rate and blood pressure, however, no symptomatic improvement.
On the morning of [**2111-2-20**], at approximately 10:15 a.m., he became bradycardic with respiratory distress and hypotension.
