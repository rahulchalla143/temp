Developed sudden onset of SSCP and mild SOB while ambulating to bathroom this morning.
In the cath lab the patient was found to have an acute occlusion of SVG to OM.
HTN 2.
CAD s/p stenting (see below) 3.
DM 4. s/p hip and [**Last Name (un) **] fracture secondary to fall, recently d/c'ed from Rehab 5. former smoker  [**9-17**]: LAD 50%, LCx 40%, mid RCA 99% - stented [**2165-6-25**]:  Totally occluded OM1, but otherwise no flow limiting stenoses.
[**2165-7-11**]: Successful placement of overlapping Minivision bare metal stents in the OM1  Social History: Patient is a housewife.
Family History: Mother died of an MI at 86.
Father died of an accident Sister has history of premature CAD  Physical Exam: Vit:  BP 105/56    HR 104   PO2 100% on RA Gen: pale, uncomfortable Neck: no JVD CV: regular, nl S1, S2, no rub, no murmur Pulm: clear bilaterally Abd: benign Ext: 2+ pulses B Skin: Groin site clean, sheath in place  Pertinent Results: <B>Admit Labs:</B> 135 / 102 / 8 ------------< 121 4.5 / 20 / 0.3 .
ST segment elevations in leads V4-V6 with small Q waves - consider acute myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2165-7-2**] ST segment elevations are present.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system and acute occlusion of the SVG to OM.
The LAD had diffuse luminal irregularities - the previously placed stent was widely patent.
The RCA had a 50% stenosis between the previously placed stents.
The SVG to OM was a very large vein graft and was totally occluded with fresh thrombus.
Hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated filling pressures, cardiac output/index was preserved.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferolateral akinesis with inferior and basal and mid inferoseptal hypokinesis.
No aortic regurgitation seen.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
6.There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Would add back captopril as an outpatient if pressure tolerates.
# Pump - ECHO showed EF of 55% and physiologic MR with no change in wall motion abnormalities from previous ECHO.
# Rhythm - No issues during this admission.
Patient continued to be in sinus tachycardia throughout admission without symptoms.
# Post CABG - Patient was 2 weeks post op mitral valve repair with 1 vessel CABG with SVG.
# Dispo - PT consult: therapy 1-3x/week for 1 week, patient safe to return home with home PT and VNA care.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: All Care VNA of Greater [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Inferolateral myocardial infarction   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: If you have any recurrent chest pain, chest pressure, shortness You had a stent placed in one of the blood vessels in your heart and you must continue taking apirin and plavix until your doctor tells you to stop.
