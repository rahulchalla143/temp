Admission Date:  [**2131-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-7-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-7-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: Ankle Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2131-6-25**] Intubation by MICU team [**2131-6-26**] Self-extubation  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 49 year old man with past medical history of Type 2 diabetes (complicated by nephropathy and neuropathy) and peripheral vascular disease status post right superficial femoral artery stent with dry gangrene of the right 5th metatarsal and subsequent amputation 2 months ago, who presented on [**2131-6-23**] with nontraumatic acute pain of the right ankle and fevers.
When he was in the ED he had fevers to 103, and was admitted given concern for septic arthritis.
At the metatarsal site, he had noticed intermittent increased drainage of the wound with mild odor.
Lower extremity ultrasound was negative for deep venous thrombosis.
Orthopedics was consulted who recommended IV vancomycin/ceftazadime for empiric coverage of probable cellulitis given hyperpigmentation of right lower extremity.
On [**2131-6-24**], the patient awoke from a nap with chest discomfort, acute tachycardia, and new onset acute hypoxia.
Pulmonary exam was not significant for wheezes or crackles.
EKG showed new sinus tachycardia to 127, with lateral ST depressions in V5/6 but otherwise no other evidence of acute ischemic changes.
Chest X ray was not concerning for new pulmonary effusions, pneumothorax, or pneumonia.
Past Medical History: Type 2 diabetes complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy Chronic Kidney disease Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Peripheral Vascular disease Tobacco abuse History of tibial fracture Right superficial femoral artery stent and angioplasty [**1-/2131**]  Social History: He is not currently working.
Granulation tissue and mild purulence present at site.
Tenderness to palpation up to mid calf.
DISCHARGE EXAM 98.3 136/68 71 18 100 RA GENERAL - Well-appearing man in NAD, comfortable, appropriate LUNGS - No adventitious sounds HEART - Nl S1-S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN - Nontender, nondistended, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding EXTREMITIES - R ankle swollen compared to left, hyperpigmented compared to Left.
Prior amputation site on R 5th toe w/o any drainage.
Lyme serology negative Urine culture [**6-23**] negative Wound swab from R amputated toe [**6-30**]: no growth, no microorganisms on gram stain  IMAGING: TTE [**2131-6-25**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No valvular pathology identified.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-5-10**], global left ventricular sysotlic function is now slightly reduced with preserved systolic function.
No lower cervical adenopathy.
Limited, non-contrast evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals no gross abnormality.
Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates normal overall parenchymal pattern with focal areas of scattered ground-glass opacity in the bilateral upper and lower lobes, most prominent in the left upper lobe.
Confluent opacification in the bilateral lower lobes in a dependent distribution with small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
In the right lower lobe subpleural space, there is a 7-mm calcification which along with mediastinal lymph node calcifications suggests granulomatous disease.
No acute osseous abnormality.
Scattered ground-glass opacities with consolidations in the bilateral lower lobes.
Stigmata of old granulomatous disease.
[**2131-6-28**] MRI MR OF THE LEFT ANKLE WITHOUT THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF CONTRAST FINDINGS: Diffuse prominent subcutaneous edema is present throughout the distal left lower extremity and imaged portions of the left foot.
Prominent edema is also present within [**Last Name (un) 22044**] fat pad.
Edema is also present with the sinus tarsi.
No evidence however for edema extending along fascial planes within the foot and distal left lower extremity.
No subcutaneous or intramuscular abscess.
No evidence for discrete fracture nor significant bone marrow edema.
No evidence for osteomyelitis.
Prominent subcutaneous edema of the distal left lower extremity and foot.
Although nonspecific, this finding can be due to cellulitis.
Edema also present in the plantar musculature and could reflect an element of myositis.
No MR evidence for osteomyelitis or fasciitis.
No focal fluid collection to suggest abscess.
Trace left ankle effusion.
Mild tenosynovitis of otherwise intact anterior tibialis, posterior tibialis, and peroneus longus and brevis tendons.
FINDINGS: There are expected post-surgical changes from prior amputation of the fifth toe and mid-to-distal fifth metatarsal bone.
There is mild soft tissue edema and enhancement surrounding the amputated fifth toe, as well as subcutaneous edema (mild) surrounding the entire forefoot.
However, there are no obvious fluid collections to suggest abscess.
The visualized residual fifth metatarsal bone as well as the rest of the visualized bones demonstrates no gross abnormal bone marrow edema and no cortical destruction to suggest osteomyelitis.
There are diffuse abnormal T2 signal involving the intrinsic muscles of the foot.
Evaluation of the extensor and flexor tendons as well as limited evaluation of the intrinsic ligaments of the foot demonstrates no acute abnormality.
Limited evaluation of the mid foot also demonstrates no acute pathology.
Post-surgical changes involving previously amputated fifth metatarsal and toe, without evidence of osteomyelitis.
Assessment for abscess limited by absence of IV contrast, but no obviuos soft tissue abscess identified.
Diffuse subcutaneous soft tissue edema (mild), likely due to cellulitis.
Diffuse intrinsic muscle edema, nonspecific in appearance.
The differential diagnosis includes changes secondary to neurogenic disease from underlying diabetes and myositis.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 y/o man with DMII who initially presented with ankle pain consistent with cellulitis, with hospital course complicated by sepsis, acute hypoxia requiring intubation in the medical ICU, progression of chronic kidney disease, and troponinemia.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Right lower extremity pain due to leg cellulitis.
Although initial concern was for septic arthritis, tap by orthopedics only showed a few drops of bloody fluid that was not sent for lab evaluation.
He had minimal improvement in symptoms, so decision was made to obtain right ankle MRI to look for deep wound infection on [**2131-6-28**] that was negative for osteomyelitis, although did show edema that could be evidence of cellulitis.
Reportedly in the MICU he was still spiking fevers to 103 at night before being transferred to the Medicine floor on [**2131-6-29**].
Another MRI was obtained on [**2131-7-2**] that included all portions of the right foot, as parts of the foot, notably the amputated 5th metatarsal, were not obtained on the prior MRI, which was again negative for osteomyelitis.
Rheumatology was also consulted who did not believe that his right lower extremity pain was due to a rheumatological issue.
Mr. [**Known lastname 33020**] pain improved by time of discharge and all antibiotics were discontinued on [**2131-7-3**].
He remained afebrile after discontinuation.
Blood cultures 8/4, [**6-24**], [**6-26**], and [**6-29**] and urine culture [**6-23**] showed no growth.
He was tachypneic and tachycardic, and decision was made to intubate and provide mechanical ventilation.
His presumed cause is likely flash pulmonary edema (secondary to sepsis) as he responded well to diuresis with IV lasix.
# CKD Stage 3: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has underlying chronic kidney disease that has been acutely worsening over the past few months.
Renal team was consulted, and felt that his declining kidney function was simply a natural progression of his chronic kidney disease.
Of note Mr. [**Known lastname **] also had a low hematocrit throughout much of admission (~29).
His labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, with no evidence of hemolysis.
# Elevated Troponin (Not NSTEMI): While in the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 33020**] cardiac enzymes revealed a mildly elevated Tn-T in the setting of CKD, but his CM-MB was normal.
Cardiology was consulted, and believed this was consistent with some "demand" ischemia in the setting of the patient's acute illness.
A TTE was performed that demonstrated normal LV function without any regional wall motion abnormalities.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Type 2 Diabetes controlled with complications: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on insulin sliding scale while in house, and did not have any complications.
# Superior femoral artery stent/Peripheral vascular disease: Vascular surgery was consulted for possibility of vascular optimization for healing purposes as well as a question of an infected right superior femoral artery stent.
They did ankle brachial index measurements and an ultrasound of his right superior femoral artery stent which showed satisfactory bloodflow.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Follow up final read of ultrasound of right superior femoral artery graft from [**2131-7-2**] and final read of ankle brachial index studies from [**2131-7-2**].
These were reviewed with primary team in conjunction with vascular surgery, but the final report has not been updated yet.
- Due to progression of chronic kidney disease, dialysis or transplant may need to be pursued within the next year.
