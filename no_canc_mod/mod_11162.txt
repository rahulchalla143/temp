HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 66 year old female with a past medical history for diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease status post left below the knee amputation and right above the knee amputation in [**2173**], chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, status status post stent, and gout.
The patient presented to [**Hospital6 **] with chest pain and shortness of breath.
States that commonly has angina but yesterday had chest pain radiating to her neck and worsening anginal symptoms with low exertion.
The patient's EKG showed ST changes with ST depression in I and AVL, a CK at the outside hospital of 1000, MB of 89 with troponin of 24.8.
The patient had left main coronary artery mild disease, left anterior descending diffuse disease, totally occluded left circumflex, non-dominant with diffuse disease, right coronary artery dominant with mid-segment total occlusion.
The catheterization was greatly unchanged from a cardiac catheterization in [**2190**] which showed left main disease with focal area of 80% in left anterior descending, left circumflex 80% occluded, right coronary artery with diffuse disease.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No history of cerebrovascular accident, no amaurosis fugax, no claudication in the arms.
History of syncope several years ago but could not recall events surrounding this.
The patient is having worsening of general symptoms.
The patient used to be able to transfer from bed to wheelchair and would get chest pain after approximately ten feet.
Now patient was getting chest pain strictly on transfer from bed to wheelchair.
ALLERGIES:   The patient has allergy to ACE inhibitor; she is intolerant with an increased creatinine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient was afebrile on admission.
No jugular venous distention, no bruits.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2, with II/VI holosystolic murmur at apex.
Abdomen with positive bowel sounds, nontender, no ecchymosis.
EKG on [**3-4**], showed sinus tachycardia, PR interval of 154 with QRS interval of 110 milliseconds, ST depressions in I and AVL, V5 through V6.
Q's in II and F.  On [**3-4**], status post catheterization, sinus rhythm at 92 beats per minute, LAD, PR interval 166, QRS interval 106, ST depression in I, AVL and V5 through V6 with 1 millimeter Q's in III and F.  No real change from previous pre-catheterization EKG.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  66 year old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus with vascular complications including coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency and renal artery stenosis, status post catheterization with extensive coronary artery disease.
Pump:  No signs of decompensation.
Use Hydralazine with Nitroglycerin for symptomatic relief.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  Hold on Lasix for now.
Prerenal component.
Possible causes, chronic gastrointestinal loss or chronic renal insufficiency, guaiac stools.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  Continue with diabetic diet.
Cardiovascular:  The patient with congestive heart failure exacerbation status post myocardial infarction with no intervention.
The patient was seen by Cardiothoracic Surgery and not deemed to be a surgical candidate.
The patient had complication status post cardiac catheterization which turned out to be an extra-peritoneal bleed with a pseudo-aneurysm.
The patient's Plavix, heparin were both held in light of the retroperitoneal bleed and have not been restarted.
The patient's hematocrit has successfully stabilized status post thrombin injection of the pseudo-aneurysm.
While in Coronary Care Unit the patient also developed severe abdominal pain.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in [**3-8**], made no mention of gallbladder issues but did mention that gallbladder was distended with sludge but no edema or pericholecystic fluid around the gallbladder.
Since that time, the patient did subsequently develop severe abdominal pain and was sent for an abdominal ultrasound which showed a grossly distended gallbladder with stones, edematous gallbladder wall and some pericholecystic free fluid with no biliary dilatation.
of bile fluid was removed and drained and the gallbladder was left in place to gravity bag.
Subsequent cultures showed Klebsiella sensitive to Levofloxacin.
The patient has been afebrile with no real issues with her white blood cell count which is now slightly elevated.
The patient did have blood cultures drawn for a temperature spike which, on [**2196-3-8**], was shown to have Staphylococcus coagulase negative in one bottle; subsequently no growth to date on other cultures.
24 hours due to her renal clearance.
The patient's echocardiogram on [**3-6**], showed overall left ventricular systolic function severely depressed, global hypokinesis to akinesis in the inferior posterior wall, right ventricular systolic function was good, two plus mitral regurgitation.
No definite pericardial effusion.
DISPOSITION:   The patient will be discharged to a Rehabilitation Center for further intravenous antibiotics and rehabilitation status post non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient's plan will be to return to home, not yet with Hospice Care but with continued plan that she will be titrated up on her medicines for blood pressure and heart rate control as well as anginal control, and that she will at some point require Hospice Care for her failing condition that is not amenable to surgery.
Coronary artery disease status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and status post cardiac catheterization with no intervention.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
