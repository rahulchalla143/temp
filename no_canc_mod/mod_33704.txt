Admission Date:  [**2183-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-3-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-10-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension.
M well known to the MICU [**Location (un) **] team with h/o afib on coumadin, dementia, DM, CHF, recent right hemiarthroplasty of the hip who presented to and OSH after being found unresponsive and hypotensive in the setting of oxycodone at NH.
Before admission, pt was being treated for C. diff, with positive assay noted at NH 2 weeks PTA (had a course of PO flagyl but still had diarrhea so was changed to PO vanc).
At OSH CT ABD showed pan colitis.
Pt was hypotensive in the ED so went to the MICU.
On the floor, he has had a worsening polyarticular gout flare.
On the afternoon after transfer, he triggered for low urine output.
This was felt to be due to hypovolemia and he was given 1L of 1/2NS because of concern for hypernatremia.
By 10pm he had made ~500cc urine since midnight.
At that time he was afebrile and it was felt that hypotension was still most likely due to hypovolemia.
Continue to have very poor urine output.
On repeat exam patient was felt to have mild guarding although he denied pain, he did not have rebound tenderness.
Given possibility of urosepsis with resistant organism, Cipro was broadened to Zosyn.
He does complain of joint pain and stiffness in his arms especially.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2183-3-15**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
There is interval improvement in perihilar interstitial prominence and bibasilar opacities suggesting resolution of mild pulmonary edema.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2183-3-10**] FINDINGS: Please note, the detection of free air on a supine abdominal radiograph is limited.
No gross abdominal free air is noted.
There are several mildly distended air-filled loops of small bowel in the left and mid abdomen.
There are mild-to-moderate degenerative changes involving the lumbar-sacral spine.
Irregular rhythm, probably atrial fibrillation although baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
Ventricular premature beats.
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition is non-specific but cannot exclude prior septal myocardial infarction.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
There are bilateral lower lobe opacities, new since the previous exam.
No definite pleural effusions are seen.
IMPRESSION: New bilateral lower lobe consolidations, which may represent atelectasis or aspiration.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2183-3-15**] FINDINGS: Single portable supine abdominal view obtained and compared to the prior study from [**2183-3-10**].
One mildly dilated colonic segment is observed.
A small amount of air is seen in the rectum.
Incidental note is made of a bipolar prosthesis in the right.
Air is seen in numerous non-dilated loops of small bowel.
There is no evidence of colonic dilatation.
There is no supine radiographic evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
No evidence of megacolon.
No evidence of active inflammatory process in the abdomen.
Sigmoid wall thickening likely secondary to chronic diverticulosis.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent passive atelectasis as well as airspace opacities noted at the lung bases as detailed above.
Question of thrombus within the superior vena cava.
No evidence of megacolon.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2183-3-20**] IMPRESSION: Subtle increase in right upper lobe opacity.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-3-23**] IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
In the interval, an extensive right-sided pleural effusion has newly occurred.
As a consequence, subtle right-sided suprabasal areas of atelectasis are seen.
In the right upper lobe, there is a subtle area of peribronchial opacities with sparse air bronchograms.
Unchanged effusion related blunting of the left costophrenic sinus.
Subtle areas of atelectasis are seen in the left basal lung.
Brief Hospital Course: SEPSIS On the morning of [**2183-3-23**], the patient was noted to be increasingly altered mental status.
CT head showed no acute intracranial process.
Repeat ABG continued to show severe acidosis, and he acutely became bradycardic and hypotensive.
C. DIFF COLITIS / ASSOCIATED DIARRHEA The patient was admitted with hypotension, and on exam appeared warm consistent with a distributive shock picture.
Echocardiogram showed preservation of ejection fraction with mild pulmonary hypertension noted.
He was treated for severe c.diff with IV Flagyl and PO vanco.
His referring hospital telephoned with a positive C.diff assay shortly after arrival.
He was fluid resuscitated aggressively, but maintained low urine output.
However, later during his course, he became hypotensive and pressors were initiated.
FAILURE TO THRIVE Despite being treated adequately for severe c.diff to best of ability, the patient's mental status continued to decline.
OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE The patient was oliguric during most of admission, and this was at first thought likely a combination of poor retention of intravascular volume given marked hypoalbuminemia with albumin of 1.6g/dL.
He was given IVF boluses as well as albumin challenge but only became severely anasarcic.
Later, it was thought that his oliguria was appropriate for his nutritional status.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION The patient had positive U/A and was treated with Cipro initially, and then expanded to Zosyn when he again became hypotensive.
GOUT FLARE The patient's anti-gout meds were held when he was initially strictly NPO for severe C.diff; unfortunately he developed a gouty flare.
His baseline advanced dementia was exacerbated by acute delirium of illness.
He had no focal neurologic findings on exam to suggest ischemic or intracranial process.
He had several metabolic derangements with diarrhea that were treated, including hyponatremia.
Sepsis 2.
C. difficile Colitis 3.
Oliguric Renal Failure 4.
Urinary Tract Infection 5.
