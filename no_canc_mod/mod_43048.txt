Admission Date:  [**2178-2-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-3-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-1-2**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes presenting to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of shortness of breath.
Per EMS report the patient had labored breathing at a rate of 60.
She denies chest pain.
The patient then became tachycardic with blood pressure variable and peripheral O2 sat labile from 69 to 75%.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates with air bronchograms.
CT chest was negative for pulmonary emboli and positive for pulmonary edema.
Bedside cardiac echocardiogram revealed overall preserved systolic function, mild mitral regurgitation, no additional valve impairment.
Oxygen saturations rose to 95 to 100% on FIO2 after significant amount of time with no further intervention.
On speaking to the family she had been complaining of wheezing and shortness of breath and lower extremity leg discoloration.
No mention of chest pain.
No fevers or chills.
Diabetes type 2.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive for tobacco.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
She was felt to have a pneumonia complicated by adult respiratory distress syndrome, which is what to felt has limited initial oxygenation early in the hospitalization.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome improved over the course of hospitalization as expected.
There was also felt to be a component of pulmonary edema and diuresis was initiated toward the end of hospitalization.
Neurological:  The patient had been hypoxic as found by the EMS and then suffered a PEA arrest followed by prolonged hypoxia secondary to adult respiratory distress syndrome in light of intubation.
Further she suffered seizure activity post recovery from PEA arrest, felt to be indicative of significant hypoxic brain injury.
She did have a recurrence of some minor seizure activity late in the hospitalization, which was treated with a temporary Ativan drip until phenytoin levels were returned to a therapeutic range.
Neurology consult service from the very beginning felt that the likely extent of her brain injury was severe and that meaningful recovery was very unlikely.
Off sedation the patient displayed only brain stem activity with spontaneous blink, slow ocular response, slow light reflex, positive gag and positive withdraw to pain for all four limbs.
It was this poor neurologic prognosis, which eventually led the family to decide on the patient being changed to CMO.
Cardiovascular:  Patient after recovering from her PEA arrest was hypertensive and tachycardic.
with good control of both tachycardia and hypertension.
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Infectious disease:  The patient remained afebrile throughout hospitalization.
She had some elevation in liver enzymes, which was felt to be secondary to hypotension and shock liver in the setting of PEA.
There were no acute gastrointestinal issues during the hospitalization.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome.
PEA arrest.
Hypoxic severe brain injury.
