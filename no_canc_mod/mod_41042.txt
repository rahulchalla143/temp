+ emesis yesterday.
The neck of this aneurysm meausures 2-mm.
The bilateral internal carotid arteries as well as the middle and posterior cerebral arteries are of normal course and caliber.
No evidence of other aneurysm, dissection or stenosis.
Interval development of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage extending along the pericallosal region posteriorly as well as intraventricular into the lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle.
There is mass effect over the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and a 7-mm midline shift to the left.
Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Stable right frontal and posterior pericallosal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with worsening associated edema and intraventricular extension with blood products more evident in the lateral and fourth ventricles as well as into the subarachnoid space.
Obliteration of supracellar cisterns concerning for herniation.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Persistent large amount of intraventricular hemorrhage, without evidence of developing hydrocephalus.
Persistent large amount of intraparenchymal hemorrhage along the right frontal lobe and also the pericallosal region.
Slightly decreased leftward shift.
Persistent mild effacement of the suprasellar cisterns, again raising concern of possible herniation.
Head CT [**2154-3-13**]: IMPRESSION: Study, quite limited by poor vascular opacification, with: 1.
No specific evidence of vasospasm.
Stable right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
Minimal decrease (from 5 mm to 4 mm) in the leftward shift of the midline structures.
Pulmonary edema has resolved.
There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
There is mild vascular congestion.
No features to suggest thrombosis within the deep venous structures of both lower extremities.
Note is made, however, of non-occlusive thrombus within the right great saphenous vein which is classified as a superficial vein.
Expected evolution of the right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage.
Redistribution of blood within the intraventricular and subarachnoid space.
Stable mass effect with sulci effacement and approximately 4 mm of leftward shift of the midline structures.
No significant change in extent of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Mild decrease in mass effect with leftward shift of the normal midline structures.
Stable opacification of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.

CTA at OSH showed SAH and L ACA aneurysm.
SBP was liberalized and cardiac enzymes and ECHO were ordered to evaluate for sympathetic surge.
Because of the difficulty of obtaining access in angio, Vascular was involved and removed the sheaths on [**3-11**].
Post-op he remained stable without changes.
Post-op head CT was stable with no hemorrhage and cath tip placement in the L lateral ventricle.
