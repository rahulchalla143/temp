She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where CXR and KUB showed massive gastric dilatation and small bowel dilatation with stool/contrast in the rectum.
She went into respiratory failure and was intubated prior to transfer.

Increased number and confluence of cavitary lesions noted in the left lower lobe consolidation.
Other previously reported diffuse cavitary lesions and ground-glass opacities appear relatively stable.
These findings are consistent with necrotizing pneumonia or septic emboli with superimposed necrotizing lobar pneumonia; fungal infection such as invasive aspergillosis is also considered.
Interval resolution of pleural effusion.
Stable ileocolic anastomosis without evidence of anastomotic leak or bowel obstruction.
Minimal residual debris at site of prior pigtail drain without evidence of reaccumulated or new focal abscess.
Pancreatic calcifications consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
This showed no acute intracranial pathology.
CV: She had an intermittent pressor requirement.
There was question of valve vegetation, but no TEE was performed.
PU: CT Chest on admission showed left lower lobe consolidation and peribronchial ground glass opacities bilaterally, thought to be due to infection with possible aspiration.
She remained ventilator dependent during the stay.
On HD3, she self-extubated and soon became tachypnic and hypoxic so was re-intubated.
Repeated attempts to wean pressure support were limited by tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia.
She underwent multiple bronchoscopies to remove secretions and mucous plugs.
Repeat Chest CT on [**5-8**] showed interval worsening of the large left lower lobe consolidation and interval increase of innumerable small cavitary lesions compatible with diffuse dissemination of infection.
Repeat chest CT on [**5-21**] was consistent with worsening necrotizing pneumonia.
GI: She arrived with an NGT in place given her sedation and risk for aspiration.
Repeat CT abd/pelv on [**5-8**] showed the anastamosis to be intact, no evidence of bowel obstruction and near-complete resolution of abdominal ascites and resolution of deep pelvic collection.
Renal ultrasound on [**5-18**] showed no evidence of fungal infection.
HEM: She exhibited an initial rise then persistently elevated WBC.
ID: In summary of her infectious course, she had a pelvic abscess growing C. perfringens and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] that was treated.
She then developed findings concerning for cavitary pneumonia with mucocutaneous candidiasis in bladder, esophagus and lungs.
Possible fungal reservoir include heart valves, which would require amphoteracin treatment.

There were no positive blood cultures.
Her necrotizing pneumonia continued to worsen and it was decided that recovery for her was unlikely.
