Admission Date:  [**2140-12-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2140-12-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-6-2**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old Creole-speaking female with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, status post myocardial infarction in [**2139-4-6**], who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on the morning of admission with chest pain.
Catheterization was done on [**2140-12-7**], and showed an ejection fraction of 45%, left main coronary artery was normal, left anterior descending artery was totally occluded at the ostium, left circumflex artery had a mid 90% tubular lesion, ramus intermedius had an 80% proximal lesion, her right coronary artery showed mild disease, right posterior descending artery was with mild proximal disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No signs of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
No hematochezia.
No symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack.
No history of vein stripping.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  She was a pleasant female in no apparent distress.
No jugular venous distention.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Pulses: 2+ bilaterally in the carotids, 2+ bilaterally in the radial artery, by Doppler in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass times of 61 min and a cross-clamp time of 51 min.
On the postoperative night, Propofol and anesthesia were reversed, and she was weaned and extubated without difficulty.
On the evening of postoperative day #2, she complained of chest pain and was noted to have electrocardiogram changes in leads V1-V4, namely ST elevations.
The results of that cardiac catheterization showed that she did have patent grafts with elevated filling pressures and a low cardiac output.
However, as the day went on, she was noted to be more confused with decreased responsiveness.
This was performed, and she was noted to have a cerebrovascular accident.
It did show multiple small infarcts throughout her basal ganglia and parietal lobes with low flow within the cavernous ICA.
At that point, she was previously noted have left facial weakness and arm weakness which was all evidence of a periprocedural embolic stroke.
At that point, carotid ultrasounds were recommended to rule out any further carotid stenosis, and Plavix was recommended, in addition to Aspirin for antiplatelet therapy.
She is therefore encouraged to work with Physical Therapy, and her narcotics and any other sedating medications were discontinued because there was thought to be some component of encephalopathy that was causing her lethargy.
She did work with Physical Therapy intermittently, although not on a regular basis due to her lethargy.
Extremities:  No edema.
Status post perioperative cerebrovascular accident.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
