Her hemodialysis was continued for end stage renal disease, continuing sessions of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday hemodialysis sessions.
In terms of her hypoglycemia in consultation with the underconservative, the decision was of an insulinoma, therefore after her dialysis session on [**8-17**], the patient was put on an overnight fast with the only p.o.
Initial arterial stick was drawn, being divided to be sent off for a serum glucose with additional tubes sent off in the Tiger top tube for analysis for termination of total insulin, pro-insulin, C-peptide and Beta hydroxy butyrate levels.
The initial plan was for [**Month (only) **] to be drawn at 10, 20 and 30 minutes after the administration of Glucagon, however, given her terribly poor access, the actual timepoints obtained were at 15 minutes after the administration of Glucagon and then at 45 minutes after the administration of Glucagon.
The patient's course was also notable for thrombocytopenia during her time in the Intensive Care Unit, of note when the patient was not intubated, she had a HITT antibody which was sent out and report indicated as negative.

In terms of her gastroesophageal reflux disease, she was continued on Protonix 40 p.o.
Nutrashakes with snacks in between as per nutritional recommendations for episodes of hypoglycemia.
