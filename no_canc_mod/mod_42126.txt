Admission Date:  [**2138-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-4-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Allergies/ADRs on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: transfer from [**Hospital3 635**] hospital  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intra-aortic balloon pump removal endotracheal tube extubation   History of Present Illness: 68-year-old male with history of HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**6-3**] with substernal chest pain and shortness of breath.
EKG showed 2-5mm ST elevations in inferior leads (II, III avF), 3mm depression in aVL, 5mm ST depression in V2, V3 and 1-3m depression in V4-V6.
He was taken to CCath which showed 100% proximal LAD stenosis, 95% diffuse ostial ramus stenosis, 90% proximal circumflex stenosis, 100% ostial marginal 1 and 2 stenosis and 100% thrombus of RCA.
He developed hypotension and hypoxemia after the RCA stent was placed.
His hypotension was managed with high-dose dopamine.
In the interim, he developed pulseless ventricular tachycardia which requred CPR with spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm.
His pressors were changed from dopamine to levophed and neosynephrine.
No beta blocker secondary to hemodynamic status.
Echocardiogram was performed which revealed mildy dilated left ventricle, severe global hypokinesis, with EF of 20% with trace MR.
Moderate right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
He had several episodes of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and accelerated idioventricular rhythm with some hemodynamic instability.
He was noted to have some oral bleeding and blood in his NG tube so protonix drip was started.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and extensive apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ECHO ([**2138-6-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and extensive severe apical hypokinesis/akinesis with focal apical dyskinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility (the inferior wall of the right ventricle is akinetic).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ECHO ([**2138-6-7**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls, severe apical akinesis, and focal apical dyskinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Borderline enlarged LV size and wall thickness, with severe regional LV systlolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
No mechanical complications of myocardial infarction.
ECHO ([**2138-6-11**]) IMPRESSION: Regional wall motion abnormalities as described above.
There is mild to moderate, posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation likely due to leaflet tethering from the near-aneurysmal inferolateral segments.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-6-5**], the left ventricular cavity size has increased (suggestive of inferolateral aneurysm development), there is now mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Estimating pulmonary pressures is possible and the pressures are elevated.
The right ventricle is marginally better with only mild residual basal free wall hypokinesis.
There continues to be minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pneumonia or larger areas of atelectasis.

Significant CAD lesions in LAD, RCA and circumflex.
# CORONARIES:  Per OSH report, 100% generic proximal LAD stenosis and 90% calcified proximal LAD stenosis, a 95% diffuse ostial ramus stenosis, 90% tubular proximal circumflex stenosis, 100% generic ostial marginal 1 stenosis, 100% generic mid and marginal 2 stenosis, 100% thrombus lesion of the mid RCA, 70% diffuse lesion of the mid RCA, and a 50% discrete mid right PDA lesion.
There was collateral flow from the ramus to the marginal 1, the conus to the RV branch, and the conus to the LAD.
CK: 8973  MB: >500  Trop-T: 13.88 on admission (also dramatically elevated at OSH).
?s balloon pump removed [**6-6**], did well without any LV support.
Anticoagulated with heparin and bridged to coumadin (INR goal [**2-21**]) for LV thrombus prevention.
TTE on [**6-11**] showed mild to moderate MR due to leaflet tethering, thus lisinopril was increased from 5mg to 10mg daily to reduce afterload.
Had difficulty with weaning vent settings and several times, decreasing PEEP resulted in flash pulmonary edema.
He was briefly hypoxic because of a likely aspiration pneumonitis but this resolved and at discharge he was satting well on room air.
Did not send C.diff as no diarrhea.
No clear focal consolidation on initial CXR (although marked pulm edema).
Repeat CXR showed focal RLL consolidation but this was felt to likely be post-extubation aspiration pneumonitis as his fever curve and WBC trended down.
He completed 8 day course of abx with no recurrence of fevers or WBC count after course.
Patient is currently on no antibiotics.
# Transaminitis: LFTs elevated likely secondary to shock liver from cardiac arrest at OSH.
#  Hx of HTN: Started metoprolol, lisinopril, eplerenone for cardioprotective effects as above.
You were admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit after having a large heart attack.
