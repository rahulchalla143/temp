Severe Septic Shock - The patient presented with fever to 102 and hypotension despite 5L IVF in the ED.
Respiratory Failure (non ARDS) ??????
The patient required intubation on arrival to ED for respiratory distress.
CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.
Likely [**3-1**] to severe AS and sepsis requiring fluid resusciation.
The patient developed persistent pulmonary edema despite aggressive diuresis following the wean of her pressors.
She had several episodes of acute respiratory distress related to flash pulmonary edema or mucus plugging.
R sided effusions felt not large enough to tap.
Following extubation the patient has required intermittent bipap with aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning.
Severe Aortic Stenosis - The patient has is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2) with a gradient of 75.
She underwent TEE to rule out vegetation and endocarditis as a source of sepsis which was negative.
# CAD s/p CABG - Ruled out ischemia with negative cardiac enzymes.
Patient was unable to take ASA due to aspiration risk.
# Severe Alzheimer's Dementia - baseline speaks in monosyllables and says yes or no to any questions.
