Admission Date:  [**2100-12-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2100-12-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2040-5-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: coffee ground emesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD  History of Present Illness: This is a 60 y/o AAM w/ h/o CAD, active cocaine abuse, prior [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear and chronic hiccups who is transferred from the MICU following an espisode of coffee ground emesis with noted esophogeal blood clot, now HD stable.
He last used cocaine 4 days PTA, noting worsening hiccups, induced vomiting with coffee ground emesis associated with nausea, subxiphoid abdominal pain, and chills.
Of note, cards saw pt given new RBBB, who recommended no acute intervention at this time.
Shortly after arriving to ICU, he underwent an EGD, which noted a large clot in middle third of esophagus and lower third of the esophagus with clotted blood and coffee grounds (1L removed) and small amounts of fresh blood.
The EGD was aborted when he became hypotensive w/ MAP ~ 40.
A repeat EGD showed clotted blood in the middle [**11-22**] of the esophagus with associated oozing.
However, no underlying lesion was visualized that could account for the bleeding.

Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Following clot removal he remained hemodynamically stable without evidence of bleed.
He was transferred to the medicine service where he had no further evidence of GI bleed.
2) Hypotension: Developed transient systolic blood pressures in the 90's in the ED, likely representing hypovolemia in setting of large volume GI bleed.
Initially,  infection was considered as a potential etiology.
Given his leukocytosis and risk for aspiration he was started empirically on levo/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.
However, this was subsequently discontinued prior to transfer to the medicine service since he had no evidence of pneumonia by CXR.
3) RBBB: Seen on EKG in the ED, which was new since his NSTEMI at OSH, but he was noted to have previous evidence of RBBB in the setting of tachycardia.
He was evaluated by cardiology who felt no acute interventio was indicated.
He subsequently ruled out for acute ischemic event with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
Toprol XL was held due to his ongoing cocaine abuse.
Given his pre-load dependence in the setting of his moderate aortic stenosis, in addition to his history of gout, the HCTZ and triamterene were discontinued prior to discharge.
5) Right lower lobe pneumonia: The patient developed a new leukocytosis, fever (101.8) and mild hypoxia (02 sat at 93%) on [**2100-12-14**].
Initial portable CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia and the patient defervesced the following morning.
Antibiotics were initially held, however repeat CXR PA&Lat showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia.
He continued to appear well without fever and his WBC count trended back down from 18.6 to 9.8.
6) Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia with sodium falling acutely from 139 to 123 over a 24 hour period.
Primary psychogenic polydipsia was suspected given his increased water intake.
He was educated on the dangers of low sodium levels, including possible seizures and death, and his water intake was restricted.
Of note, he had no evidence of neurologic deficit throughout the day and remained alert and oriented and conversational.
7) Hypothyroidism: The patient has known hypothyroidism secondary to resection of his thyroid for medullary thyroid carcinoma.
In the ICU on this admission, he was noted to have a high TSH and low T4.
His hiccups returned despite the VNS and he again began to self-induce vomiting in order to help with alleviation of his hiccups.
He has had previous [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tears in this setting, and it was felt that his GI bleed on this admission was also secondary to [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
However, he does complain of cough which is a side effect of the stimulator.
9) Type II DM: well-controlled on sliding scale insulin regimen and diabetic diet.
10)Nutrition: He was evaluated by the speech and swallow service and he passed swallowing study without evidence of aspiration.
11)h/o CAD: Unknown coronary anatomy given his aborted heart catheritization.
It was felt that the patient was likely clinically depressed and would benefit from re-start of his paxil.
14) Insomnia: Difficulty falling asleep secondary to hiccups, cough.
Given a 15 dose prescription for short-term control, but recommended that this be followed up with his PCP.
He reports that the pain is chronic for him, most likely from chronic arthritis.
He also has evidence of osteoarthritis in his hand.
