Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 61618**] Admission Date: [**2149-6-8**] Discharge Date: [**2149-6-8**] Date of Birth:  [**2149-6-8**] Sex:  M Service:  NB   HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 61619**] is a 30 week gestation term male infant admitted to the newborn intensive care unit in critical condition with severe respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal ascites and possible upper airway abnormality.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Mother has a history of depression and a suicide attempt in [**2142**], with a Tylenol overdose.
She also has been treated for her depression throughout the pregnancy with Zoloft 50 mg daily.
Also of significant in the medical history was a paternal niece with the diagnosis of a congenital heart disease who died at 9 years of age.
PREGNANCY: The pregnancy was uncomplicated until 1 week prior to the baby's birth, when mother was noted to have increased amniotic fluid.
One week prior to delivery, increase in amniotic fluid was noted and fetal abdominal ascites was also diagnosed.
Ultrasound performed here revealed isolated neonatal ascites, severe polyhydramnios with an AFI of 41, and a limited view of the heart with 4 [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] was also noted, and a very limited view of the kidneys was also reported.
No pleural or pericardial effusions were noted.
The baby had a reactive fetal heart tracing, with biophysical profile of [**8-11**].
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM - S1 and S2 were normal intensity, no murmur noted.
He had symmetrical movements of his extremities.
DELIVERY AND NEONATAL COURSE:  Delivery was prompted by worsening fetal ascites and some spontaneous fetal heart rate decelerations.
Delivery was by cesarean section with epidural anesthesia.
The amniotic fluid was noted to be abundant and yellow in appearance.
There was a question of potential abnormal smell to the fluid noted by the obstetrician, but this was not noted by our team with the baby.
The baby emerged with initially good tone and some respiratory effort, but no audible cry and no air movement into the lungs on auscultation.
The baby then became bradycardic and with no respiratory effort.
Bag and mask ventilation was ineffective with no air movement achieved.
Two attempts at abdominal paracentesis were made without removal of any fluid in the delivery room.
No bleeding was noted with the tap.
Abdominal paracentesis was performed on admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and approximately 50 ml of serosanguineous fluid were removed.
Followup blood gases showed improvement, with arterial blood gas of 7.28, 55, 62.
Abdominal films revealed centrally located bowel loops, nondistended appearance of the intestine.
There was no evidence of calcification or increased echogenicity.
Lungs revealed extremely dense, white lungs with air bronchograms.
Prematurity at 30 weeks gestation.
Differential diagnosis includes: primary liver disease,    bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal abnormalities, urinary    ascites, congenital infection with parvovirus, CMV,    toxoplasmosis or hepatitis, underlying cardiac disease.
There appears to be either stenosis or    external compression of the upper trachea.
Severe surfactant deficiency/respiratory distress    syndrome.
Perinatal depression secondary to respiratory depression    resulting from abnormal airway.
