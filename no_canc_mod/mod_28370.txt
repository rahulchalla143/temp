The pt has a history of CVA, PVD, and HTN and was initially seen in OSH on [**2197-3-16**] with complaints of constant lower abdominal pain and several bloody stools.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern for SMA embolus.
A mesenteric angiogram revealed patent SMA/[**Female First Name (un) 899**] but a high grade celiac stenosis.
She was taken to the OR by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an ex-lap where she was found to have transverse colitis but no obvious ischemia.
During hospital course, she was noted to have sinus tachycardia and HTN which was treated with metoprolol.
GI was consulted for continuing abdominal pain and guaiac positivel stool during the last admission and recommended colonoscopy as an outpatient to r/o cancer and IBD.
Since her discharge, the pt reports [**6-24**] bilateral LQ pain as well as RUQ pain with +N/V.
The abd pain is unchanged from last admission.
The pain is unrelated to food.
Since then it has become yellow in color but again without food.
In the ED, the pt received Anzmet x1 for nausea as well as 1L of NS with significant improvement in pain.
She had a CT Abd/Pelvis which demonstrated improvements in transverse colon wall thickening and post op changes but no acute pathologic changes.
The pt was seen by surgery in the ED who believed the pt was able to be discharged back to [**Location (un) 582**], however she was admitted to Medicine for pain control.

No accessory muscle use HEENT: pupils 3mm and minimally reactive but equal bilaterally CV: tachy, no m/r/g CHEST: min crackles bilaterally ABD: obese, distended abd with intact staple, no obvious erythema.
EXT: trace bilateral LE edema.
Postoperative changes in the anterior peritoneal cavity and subcutaneous tissues at the midline.
No evidence of small-bowel obstruction.
Air within the bladder, presumably secondary to recent Foley catheterization.

Abd pain, nausea, vomiting, 2 loose bm: The etiology of the abd pain is unclear at this point, however she has known transverse colitis indicating some pathology.
Admission WBC count was 11 but pt did not have a left shift and lactate is low making acute infection less likely.
Incisional pain is also in ddx.
-She tolerated po well thoughout her stay, with no nausea or vomiting for several days prior to discharge.
-She has a follow up appointment with GI on Monday, [**2197-4-3**] for eval for outpt colonoscopy.
-Her abdominal pain continued to improve this admission on supportive care.
This may have been due to her decreased PO intake from n/v.

Cardiovascular: A. CAD: Given her hx of PVD, the pt most likely has CAD as well.
