Patient notes concominant cough, weight gain, lower extremity edema.
Also reports pink-tinged sputum and occasional nausea.
Of note, patient had a recent admission for renal failure in the setting of presumed infectious diarrhea.
She was evaluated for dialysis during this admission but was felt this was not yet necessary.
She also saw transplant surgery for her fistula.
Cards consulted and said: likely demand ischemia associated with CHF.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-13**], there is continued and possibly even worsening florid pulmonary edema consistent with severe CHF.
Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen.
Brief Hospital Course: # Dyspnea: Patient with weight gain, lower extremity edema, CXR consistent with volume overload, BNP elevated to >[**Numeric Identifier 7923**] therefore likely acute on chronic dCHF exacerbation [**2-15**] stopping carvedilol and Valsartan.
Infectious unlikely as no fever or leukocytosis, no sick contacts but could not rule out consolidation on CXR.
Also empirically treated for pneumonia with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin though this was stopped when the patient remained afebrile without leukocytosis and repeat CXR did not show any underlying infiltrate.
For volume control, renal was consulted and did not think urgent HD was necessary.
She still required bipap after this initial diuresis so in conjunction with renal consult and the patient's outpatient nephrologist dialysis was initiated through a tunnelled HD line (AV fistula not yet mature).
# Positive U/A:  Patient with some pressure while urinating.
Culture grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella and so patient completed a 3 day course of Ceftriaxone.
Likely due to ESRD and iron deficiency.
Patient had no signs of bleeding in the ICU.
# Supratherapeutic INR: Patient given vitamin K given her low HCT and high INR.
# H/o CAD: -stress mibi recommended as an outpatient at the patient's previous clinic appointment and this should be considered during her admission.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 671**] HealthCare Center at [**Location (un) 4047**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Fluid overload secondary to Kidney disease .
Secondary Diagnosis: Chronic Kidney Disease Hypertension Diabetes type II   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because of worsening shortness of breath and excess fluid on your body.
You were initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit because you were so short of breath that you needed to be monitored very closely.
