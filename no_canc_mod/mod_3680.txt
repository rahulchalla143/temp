Admission Date:  [**2149-4-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-5-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-6-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Amoxicillin / Blood-Group Specific Substance / Adhesive Tape  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: Acute onset shortness of breath.
History of Present Illness: A 45 year-old woman with past medical history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary disease s/p CABG in [**5-1**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, OMI-Diag) with known occlusion of 2 SVGs with patent SVG to RCA and LIMA to LAD, diastolic CHF (EF 50-55%), ESRD s/p kidney transplant, who presents today with acute onset shortness of breath.
Patient says the symptoms started on the morning of admission with acute onset SOB that woke her from sleep.
There was associated chest tightness.
Both symptoms improved markedly once she sat up, but she continued to experience mild shortness of breath so she called 911.
In the ED she was noted to have bibasilar crackles on exam.
An EKG showed no ischemic changes and CXR showed no clear infiltrate (by my read).
Of note, the patient was recently admitted and discharged two weeks prior to this for worsening dyspnea.
She was found on TTE to have new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
This morning was her first episode of shortness of breath.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
TISSUE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
Low limb lead voltage.
Since the previous tracing the small R waves in leads V1-V2 are more prominent, axis is more leftward and ST-T wave abnormalities are more marked.
Previously seen left lower lobe consolidation and small left pleural effusion have essentially resolved with trace left base residua of atelectasis and possible small amount of consolidation.
There is no hydronephrosis and no perinephric fluid collection.
Specifically, there is no swelling, normal pyramids, and no pelvi-infundibular thickening and normal renal sinus fat.
Left knee and ankle plain films ([**2149-4-29**]): AP and lateral bedside views of left knee show a recent transverse fracture across the patella with moderate fragment displacement.
There is extensive destruction of the medial malleolus and adjacent distal portion of the tibia with displaced fracture through the base of the medial malleolus.
There is associated soft tissue swelling and a single clip in the proximal adjacent soft tissues.
Laterally there is an intramedullary pin through the distal fibula with two fixation transverse screws extending across this rod into the adjacent tibial metaphysis.
No evidence of loosening of this hardware.
There is posterior subluxation of the talus on the ankle mortise and ankle joint in AP projection shows valgus deformity.
Fractured medial malleolus with associated osteomyelitis very likely.
Transthoracic [**Year (4 digits) 461**] ([**2149-4-30**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral segments.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-4-9**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly lower.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is a 45 year-old woman with history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization for shortness of breath presumed due to worsening mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension who now presents with acute onset shortness of breath.
# Shortness of Breath.
Her presentation was felt to be consistent with orthopnea and worsening congestive heart failure.
EKG was unremarkable for ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes were normal.
CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia or infiltrate.
She underwent repeat transthoracic [**Month/Year (2) 461**] that showed severe MR although no significant change from prior.
Additionally, she will need repeat bone biopsy (see below) to confirm that the left ankle infection has been properly treated.
# Type I Diabetes.
# History of Septic Arthritis of Left Ankle.
The orthopedics and infectious disease services were consulted for recommendations regarding ongoing management of left ankle infection.
Orthopedics performed a washout and bone biopsy, and the microbiologic report showed no bacterial growth.
In one to two weeks, she should have a repeat bone biopsy off of all antibiotics to ensure that the infection has been appropriately treated.
# Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (acute on chronic) and Mitral Regurgitation.
# Coronaries.
Her EKG showed no evidence of ischemic changes.
# Rhythm.
There were no active concerns.
# Hypertension.
Hydralazine was stopped due to hypotension during this admission.
There were no active concerns.
# Depression.
There were no active concerns.
Right-sided PICC line.
# Prophylaxis.

It was thought that this was due to your heart failure, which is worsened by your mitral regurgitation (the heart valve that is leaky).
We think that you should have your mitral valve replaced, however, we do not want to do that until we are sure that your foot ulcer is not infected.
You had a bone biopsy while you were here that showed no evidence of infection.
The infectious disease doctors think that we can't know for sure if there is infection unless you have a biopsy performed while not on antibiotics.
If there is no infection we will proceed with setting you up for mitral valve repair.
Someone will also be coming to your house to change your wound vac on Monday and every three days following that.
