She was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and both CK and troponin.
Her left main 70% lesion was stented and her 60% stenosis and her mid left circumflex was stented without complications.
However, after the procedure she had 300 cc of bright red emesis.
She had no history of upper GI bleed, melena and no history of OV positive stools in the past.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes type 2 treated with insulin, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Schatzki's ring, cerebrovascular accident in [**2178**] with residual left hemiparesis treated with Coumadin, TAH/BSO, peripheral vascular disease, status post appendectomy, coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass graft in [**10/2182**] with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, right saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal number one and radial to the posterior descending artery.
History of congestive heart failure with an EF of approximately 30% and hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
FAMILY HISTORY:  A daughter had an myocardial infarction at the age of 33.
She was in no adenopathy.
No jugulovenous distention appreciable.
Heart regular rate and rhythm with a widely split S1, but no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, obese with scars present from prior surgeries.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block noted to be old.
Catheterization on [**9-1**] revealed two vessel and left main disease with a 70% osteal lesion, left circumflex with a 40% osteal lesion and 60% mid segmental lesion and right coronary artery with a tubular 80% proximal stenosis.
There was a mild kink in the left internal mammary artery and moderately elevated left ventricular and diastolic pressure at 19.
Moderate impaired left ventricular systolic function, 36% ejection fraction with global hypokinesis.
Mild 1+ mitral regurgitation was present.
Also a Dieulafoy lesion was noted, which had epinephrine injected into it and bleeding resolved.
There was also some mild gastritis noted not felt to be contributing to the bleeding.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Chest pain most likely secondary to gastritis and Dieulafoy lesion.
Patient with severe three vessel coronary artery disease status post stent placement.
