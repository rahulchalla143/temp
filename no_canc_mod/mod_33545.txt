She usually is an avid complainer and this has not been the case the past two days; in fact, she has been apathetic to what has been happening, including the need to seek medical attention.
No weakness or gait difficulty was noted.
No other speech abnormality.
No visual difficulties.
Told she had a bleed in her brain, she simply shrugged.
She denied all deficits or complaints and was not concerned to be here ("maybe they wanted to get rid of me").
Head CT showed a bleed and the patient was loaded with dilantin 1g IV x 1 and transferred here.
ROS: On review of systems, the pt denied recent fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Left atrial abnormality.
Non-specific inferior ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison ---- CT head ([**2125-4-27**]): IMPRESSION: Right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema and 6-cm leftward midline shift.
---- CXR ([**2125-4-27**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
---- CT head ([**2125-4-27**]):  IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and mild regional mass effect and 6 mm leftward subfalcine herniation.
--- MR head ([**2125-4-29**]): CONCLUSION: Right frontal hematoma again identified without a definite etiology revealed by this study.
However, there are scattered cortical infarctions suggesting embolic disease.
There is no abnormal enhancement.
Differential included hemmorhagic conversion of infarct with embolic infarctions versus amyloid disease with hemmorhage and superimposed embolic infarctions.
Stable right frontal hematoma and scattered cortical infarctions.
The differential again includes embolic infarctions versus amyloid disease.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Evolution and contraction of right intraparenchymal hemorrhage with slightly decreased mass effect.
Normal CTA of the head and neck with no evidence of stenosis, aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation.
An underlying vascular lesion as etiology for the intraparenchymal hemorrhage cannot be fully evaluated due to the acuity of the hemorrhage.
A followup MRI with gadolinium could be obtained in three months to evaluate for an underlying abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course:       [**Known firstname **] was admitted on [**2125-4-27**] to the ICU for observation due to the size of her right frontal hemorrhage.
By the AM of [**4-29**] - she was found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation.
An MRI was obtained on ([**4-29**]) in order to evaluate for a potential underlying mass as the etiology of the bleed.
There was no evidence of a mass, but multiple ischemic punctate infarcts were concurrently noted in bilateral hemispheres.
She continued to be observed on the floors for further management of her atrial fibrillation.
She should also have her atrial fibrillation managed via her PCP / referral to a cardiologist as an outpatient.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: intraparenchymal hemorrhage multiple punctate ischemic infarcts new onset atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: Please monitor for worsening weakness on the left or new weakness on the right side.
Please monitor for changes in speech or vision.
You are at risk for further ischemic strokes due to your new onset atrial fibrillation.
Your hemorrhage was likely due amyloid angiopathy in the setting of transient high blood pressure.
In order to prevent future events you should make sure that your blood pressure is well controlled.
