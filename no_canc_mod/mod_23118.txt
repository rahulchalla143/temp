Imaging: CXR [**4-10**]: New moderate heterogeneous interstitial abnormality, for which interstitial pulmonary edema should be considered.
Perhaps less likely, the appearance could reflect atypical infection in the appropriate setting.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.

Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
