Saturday, patient [**Last Name (un) **] noting nicreasaed swelling of her neck and associated sore throat on Sunday.
Began to have significant trouble swallowing and some subjective shortness of breath so re-presented to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-22**].
Found to have positive rapid strep so was given PCN and ketorolac at that time.
Finally, pt re-presented to [**Hospital1 **] on day of admission w/worsening pain and inability to tolerate PO.
Per husband, prior to this pt had been in usual state of health having recovered from an extended sinus infection with associated post-nasal drip requiring antibiotics in early [**Month (only) 404**].
Pt was speaking in full sentences and able to maintain her airway without stridor but unable to move neck due to swelling.
Seen by ENT in ED who noted pus at L tonsillar pillar, and tenderness and swelling of left anterior neck.
Neck CT in ED revealed extensive edema of deep cervical spaces in the neck L>R with extension into superior mediastinum.
Patient was intubated and taken to OR overnight for debridement and washout by ENT who found murky fluid in RP space but no pus or necrosis.
Thoracics also consulted to evaluate for possible chest/mediastinal extension of infection.

A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.
**FINAL REPORT [**2124-2-29**]**     CMV IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2124-2-29**]):       POSITIVE FOR CMV IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2124-2-29**]):       NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.
A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may reactivate       when immunity is compromised.
Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2111**] mg/dl may cause       interference with CMV IgM results.
Extensive inflammation and edema involving the superficial and deep cervical spaces of the neck, left greater than right.
Asymmetric thickening of the epiglottis, left aryepiglottic fold, and the false cords.
CXR [**2-23**]: There is a right lower lobe faint opacity, likely representing atelectasis.
There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
ECHO:  Borderline normal LV systolic function without regional wall motion abnormalities.
Mediastinal and lower neck fluid appears similar compared to prior study of 1 day earlier without evidence for new large fluid collection.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent basilar atelectasis.
Only minimal decrease of the retropharyngeal fluid.
Unchanged edema of the epiglottis, left aryepiglottic fold and supraglottic soft tissues narrowing the airway.
Unchanged edema in the left carotid space.
Stable edema of the left sternocleidomastoid and stranding of the surrounding fat.
No new fluid collections.
Overall, there has been little interval change in comparison to prior study with stable retropharyngeal fluid and stable edema of the epiglottis, left aryepiglottic fold, and supraglottic soft tissues, narrowing the airway.
Some of the venous tributaries are not well seen; there is narrowing of the left internal jugular vein, as before.
Unchanged edema in the left carotid space.
New bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
No thrombus identified in a short segment of the very distal left jugular seen just above the left jugular subclavian junction.
Occlusive thrombus seen within the left cephalic vein in the region of the antecubital fossa.
MRV/MRA NECK:  In comparison with the prior neck CT dated [**2-28**], [**2123**], there are relatively stable diffuse fluid collections on the left side of the neck, with tissue enhancement in the left carotid space and posterior cervical and paraspinal spaces as described in detail above.
There is evidence of soft tissue edema surrounding the fluid collections on the left side of the neck, causing mass effect on the mid cervical segment of the internal jugular vein and slow flow with a possible adherent non-occlusive thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY PRIOR TO FLOOR TRANSFER PER MEDICINE TEAM (NO SUMMARY AVAILABLE FROM TICU): 29 yo F with PMH idiopathic neutropenia who presented with neck swelling and pain after sore throat and constitutional symptoms, found to have infection and fluid collections in deep neck spaces (retropharyngeal and carotid sheath spaces).
She had been on unasyn, vanc, and clinda consistently since admission for abx coverage at the time of transfer to floor.
Fever curve subsequently trended down and she was feeling better at transfer.
repeat imaging the evening [**2124-2-28**] showed significant improvement in fluid collections and ENT thought pt could continue to be managed with drains and abx (no further OR) unless clinical picture changed.
There was some concern for mediastinitis due to rash on chest and edema seen on CT, but that improved by continuing antibiotics and did not recur.
Heme was consulted and placed pt on G-CSF for neutropenia.
Etiology of cytopenia was uncertain and heme felt this was an inappropriate time to work this up due to complicating factor of infection.
She admitted to rash on LE "red spots" intermittently that she had difficulty characterizing, but no h/o other rashes, joint pains, oral ulcers, photosensitivity.
[**Hospital 662**] HOSPITAL COURSE 29 yo F with PMH idiopathic neutropenia who presenting with deep neck space infection s/p debridement and drainage.
pt had sore throat prior to development of other symptoms and positive rapid strep at PCP office which is the likely source of infection.
No further fevers.
MRI obtained to try to eval for jugular venous clot in setting of fever noted above but only showed sluggish flow and could not definitely rule it out.
Pt given GCSF until neutropenia resolved, then this was stopped.
Will follow up with heme as outpatient  # coagulopathy: thought to be [**12-23**] nutritional deficiency due to neck space infection and recent illness.

You came to the hospital because you had swelling and pain in your neck.
You were found to have an infectious fluid collection.
You were intubated to protect your airway and the area of infection was debrided and drains placed to help remove the fluid.
The drains were removed and you should continue applying and changing the wicks twice a day as instructed by the  ear nose and throat (ENT) doctors.
You will need to get weekly lab draws to monitor your blood counts and electrolytes while on ertapenem.
However, if you were to experience new shortness of breath it is important that you return to the emergency department immediatly.
- Start Ertapenem 1g IV once every 24hrs, continue this medication until directed to stop by your infectious disease doctors - Start Bismuth 30ml by mouth 4x each day as needed for diarrhea - Start a multivitamin daily - Start Hydromorphone 2-4mg every 4-6hrs as needed for pain - Start Compazine 1 tablet every 6hrs as needed for nausea - Start Tylenol 500mg eveyr 6hrs as needed for pain (use before hydromorphone) - Start Docusate 100mg by mouth twice each day while taking hydromorphone - Start Senna 1 tablet by mouth twice each day as needed for constipation  - STOP Ranitidine  Followup Instructions: Follow up with the [**Hospital **] clinic in one week: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] Office Phone: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7767**]  Please follow in the Infectious Disease (OPAT) Clinic with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] Wednesday, [**2124-3-22**].
