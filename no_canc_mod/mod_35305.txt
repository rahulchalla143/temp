[** **] Date:  [**2116-7-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-7-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-11-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Celebrex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: 71 year old male with MMP including severe OSA, recent [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**Date range (1) 79292**] for large R MCA stroke with residual weakness, L hemineglect, bulbar dysfunction (dysphagia s/p PEG, slurred speech), bilateral PEs on coumadin, was readmitted from [**Hospital1 15454**] Hosp rehab to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**7-1**] with lethargy, depressed MS, fevers.
He was found to have septic shock [**1-4**] either central line (had old R subclavian central line since [**6-17**]) vs PNA.
Got IVF reccussitation, short term pressor support.
Also as part of AMS w/u on [**Month/Year (2) **], he got CT head, which showed small area of hemmorhagic conversion.
Neurology evaluated the patient and felt right MCA bleed does not explain decline in mental status, which is likely [**1-4**] infection/sepsis.
Asthma 3.
CVA, LARGE R MCA stroke [**6-9**] (MRA with distal occlusion R MCA), residual weakness L sided, L hemineglect, bulbar dysfunction (dysphagia s/p g-tube [**2116-6-15**], slurred speech) 6.
Recent aspiration Pneumonitis, requiring intubation [**2116-6-17**], then VAP s/p zosyn X 8 days, extubated [**6-23**]  s/p L knee repair and replacement  s/p ventral hernia repair  s/p L hand surgery after fracture  s/p L elbow surgery  s/p G tube and J tube?
Has three children and several grandchildren.
Family History: FH: Father died of CAD and mother died of stomach cancer.
No FH of strokes, seizures and bleeding issues.
Physical Exam: Upon [**Location (un) **] to ICU, physical exam was as follows:  GEN: Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, no M/G/R, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
No gait disturbance.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
CXR [**2116-7-4**] IMPRESSION: Persistent bibasilar atelectasis.
Pneumonia is not excluded.
Streak of atelectasis is seen in the lingular region.
Large right middle cerebral artery territory infarct, with hemorrhagic transformation.
There is no herniation or shift of normally midline structures or herniation.
Fluid within the right mastoid sinus and posterior nasopharynx, likely related to intubation.
Bony defect and irregular ossific density within the right frontal sinus.
CT head [**7-2**]: IMPRESSION: Evolution of the infarct in the right frontotemporal region, with increased hyperdensity in the gyriform pattern, and new small area of hemorrhage within the infract.
Brief Hospital Course: 71y/o male with severe OSA, recent large R MCA CVA with residual deficits, s/p PEG, prolonged hospital course [**1-4**] aspiration pneumonitis requiring intubation, VAP s/p zosyn, bilateral PEs on coumadin, discharged [**6-26**], now admitted to [**7-1**] with depressed MS, fevers, septic shock, unclear source (line sepsis or PNA).
Found to have RLE DVT, s/p IVC filter [**7-2**].
Septic shock, resolved with fluids/pressors/abx: Unclear source (?line sepsis vs aspiration pneumonitis/PNA (RLL on CXR).
Respiratory failure: Multifactorial [**1-4**] possible aspiration pneumonitis, severe OSA, depressed MS, bilateral PEs.
-cont Abx as above -cont O2 to keep sats around 93%, frequent suctioning by NS when unable to swallow/clear secretions, chest PT -also cont albuterol/mucomyst nebs for cough/thick sputum.
CVA, R large MCA territory with multiple residual deficits.
Now with small area of hemmorhagic transformation noted [**7-1**], which has been stable per CT [**7-6**].
Acute MS changes [**1-4**] infection, and are resolving to new baseline.
-keep BP with goal SBP b/w 120-160 to prevent extension of hemmorhage while maintaining cerebral perfusion -cont PT/OT, SCDs, TEDs, kinair mattress, speech therapy -plan to t/f to [**Hospital1 1319**] for long term/rehab today .
Dysphagia [**1-4**] bulbar dysfunction; s/p PEG on TF, however, surprisingly doing WELL with oral intake as long as awake/alert enough to swallow properly.
VTE: bilateral PEs, R peroneal DVT s/p IVC [**7-2**], now off coumadin given recent finding of ICH over prior stroke territory and poss GI source of dropping hgb.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection every eight (8) hours: Sub Q. Disp:*qs qs* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis of unclear etiology Severe sleep apnea DVT Anemia mental status changes.
Could not do endoscopy to r/o GIB given high risk, but if hgb drops, then needs reeval.
