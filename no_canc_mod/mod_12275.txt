Admission Date:  [**2124-11-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-11-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2054-1-24**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old Cantonese female who speaks some English with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presents with a four day history of the acute onset of dyspnea on exertion which worsens with exertion.
Also noted fevers, occasional chills, nonproductive cough and decreased appetite.
Chest x-ray and examination were consistent with pulmonary edema.
The patient continued to have dyspnea and became more tachypneic.
The patient has a history of refractory hypertension managed on Clonidine transdermal and Norvasc.
She has no prior history of heart disease however, she has never had a cardiovascular evaluation.
Cardiac risk factors include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and age.
She does not have any history of diabetes mellitus, smoking history of family history of cardiac disease.
Prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient was able to walk several blocks with minimal difficulty.
She has no remote history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.
She denies any history of chest pain.
Examination was consistent with left and right sided heart failure.
Her EKG at that time showed multifocal atrial tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 with 0.5 to [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V1, V3, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in V5 and V6.
Poor R wave progression with loss in the anterior portions in V1 through V3.
There was no prior EKG for comparison.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, no ethanol, no intravenous drug abuse.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No myocardial infarction, no diabetes mellitus in her family.
Neck with increased jugular venous distention to angle of jaw but no bruits and no thyromegaly.
Heart: Irregularly irregular, positive S3 at left lower sternal border.
Crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Lungs with diffuse crackles two-thirds of the lung fields anterolateral.
Decreased breath sounds at the right base with egophony.
No splenomegaly.
Extremities with one to two plus bilateral lower extremity edema, right greater than left with some stasis changes.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 70 year old female with prior history of refractory hypertension who presents with a four day history of dyspnea and evidence of [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure on examination with enzymes, consistent with myocardial injury in the setting of likely multi-lobar pneumonia.
Cardiovascular:  It was thought that she was in congestive heart failure, likely biventricular heart failure with evidence of pulmonary edema and peripheral edema.
She likely had a myocardial event which led to this acute exacerbation of her heart failure.
There was concern with her troponin greater than 50 that she had a myocardial infarction.
She responded well to the furosemide and was more comfortable from a respiratory perspective.
On the second day of admission, she had a cardiac catheterization done in the setting of congestive heart failure, elevated troponin and EKG changes suggestive of ischemia.
Prior to catheterization, she was found to be hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure up to 200.
She had elevated right sided and left sided pressures.
In terms of her coronary arteries, she had a right dominant system with a short and normal left main.
Her left anterior descending artery showed minimal irregularities with 60% ostial stenosis at the first diagonal.
Right coronary artery showed 80% mid-ulcerated lesion and 70% stenosis at the posterior descending artery.
She had evidence of three vessel disease, however, because she had a fever up to 101.0 F., in the catheterization laboratory, no intervention was done in the catheterization laboratory, secondary to concerns for a possible stent infection.
The plan was to have her return when her fevers and infection subsided.
It was thought that she had a bilobar pneumonia.
Consequently, intervention was deferred until her infection had resolved.
On the third day of admission, the patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema.
On the second day of admission she also had a central line placed.
On the third day of admission, the patient was found to have had a large left sided stroke.
After the cardiac catheterization, she did have an increasing creatinine, possibly from the contrast dye induced nephropathy.
However, because she had evidence of hypovolemia, she continued to be diuresed.
On the third day of admission, she also had episodes of atrial fibrillation.
The first atrial fibrillation occurred when getting her CT scan after her stroke.
She had further episodes of atrial fibrillation later in the day with heart rate of 130 to 160.
Blood pressure started to decrease somewhat with her atrial fibrillation with a systolic of 116.
She then had a pause and reverted back to the sinus bradycardia which gradually increased from 60 to 80.
Chest x-ray was suggestive of bilobar pneumonia, right lower lobe and most likely left lower lobe.
Pulmonary:  The patient had evidence of pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
She was also treated for her congestive heart failure with furosemide and after-load reduction with Hydralazine.
Preload reduction with Nitroglycerin.
She did have that one episode of shortness of breath which was most likely due to acute pulmonary edema.
She was monosyllabic and answering inappropriately.
She was also then sent for a CT scan which showed left sided edematous changes consistent with an early ischemic event.
She did not have any evidence of a hemorrhagic stroke.
First CT scan showed edematous left cerebellar hemisphere with bowing of falx and loss of grey-white matter differentiation on the left side.
It is possible that she had an embolic stroke.
She then had left sided dilatation of her pupil.
At this point, the patient's family had been called with the evidence that a stroke had occurred.
They were informed that their mother's prognosis was grim and the patient's family decided that they would not want her to have an intubation or any extreme measures.
Renal:  The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency most likely secondary to hypertension.
Renal Service felt that Mucomyst at this time would not have any benefit and it was discontinued.
They also recommended continuing to decrease after-load with Hydralazine and then to consider ACE inhibitor once the patient was stabilized.
They felt the increased creatinine was due to her diuresis and possibly due to her contrast exposure.
No further evidence of bleeding was found.
Her stools were guaiac negative however, she was on the heparin and Integrilin but there was an unclear reason for the acute decrease in hematocrit, particularly in the setting of diuresis.
She did not have any spontaneous respirations and was unresponsive to pain.
She has no audible heart sounds.
