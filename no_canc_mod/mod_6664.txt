Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 70 year old female with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension and right CVA with residual aphasia and left sided hemiplegia who was admitted from her nursing facility for fevers, tachycardia and tachypnea.
Not associated with leukocytosis.
No clear localizing sources.
She did have an elevated lactate on presentation although she also appears to have a chronic lactic acidosis of unclear cause.
Multiple CXRs were without infiltrate.
KUB showed constipation but was otherwise unremarkable.
She does have a recent history of clostridium difficile colitis but she had three negative stool samples.
She underwent lumbar puncture which showed 5 WBC cells and slightly elevated protein and was initially treated empirically for bacterial meningitis as well as herpes encephalitis but culture was subsequently negative as was herpes PCR.
The cause of her initial fever is unclear as workup here was negative.
Shock/Hypotension:  Concern related to infection although source unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] presented with fevers, hypotension, elevated lactate and acute renal failure.
Echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction and no vegetations.
This improved to 3.0 with resuscitation but reminded elevated at 3.0.
This appears to be her baseline level and her chronic elevation is of unclear etiology.
[**Month (only) 116**] be related to her chronic respiratory alkalosis.
Low suspicion for pulmonary embolism as patient is on lovenox at nursing facility.
She showed no signs of respiratory distress.
Hypertension: Her antihypertensives were initially held in the setting of acute renal failure and hypotension.
Initially this was considered as a source of her fevers but toxicology was consulted who did not think this was a likely etiology.
Bisacodyl 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO once a day as needed for heartburn.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 4657**] - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Sepsis of unknown origin Elevated lactate Chronic Anemia  Secondary: Type II Diabetes Hypertension s/p CVA Dementia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always Level of Consciousness: Lethargic and not arousable Activity Status: Bedbound   Discharge Instructions: You were seen and evaluated for your fevers.
You had many blood tests, cultures and images but no cause was identified for your fevers.
