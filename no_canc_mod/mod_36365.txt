Admission Date:  [**2117-4-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2117-4-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2048-1-7**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 106001**] is a 68-year-old African-American male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular disease, and Parkinson disease who was admitted with abdominal pain.
The patient apparently complained of one day of diffuse abdominal pain and tightness upon presentation to the Emergency Room.
In the Emergency Room, the patient had an abdominal CAT scan which showed thrombosis of the left renal artery and necrosis of a large portion of his left kidney.
There was also a filling defect in the superior mesenteric artery and concern for mesenteric ischemia.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Review of systems on admission was negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, sputum production, night sweats, cough, visual changes, dysuria, headache, neck stiffness, and new motor symptoms.
Status post cerebrovascular accident with resulting right-sided weakness, dysphagia, and left arm and leg clumsiness.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2114**].
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Pulmonary hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.
His lungs had crackles at the bases.
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm with a positive fourth heart sound.
The abdomen was mildly firm, diffusely tenderness to palpation, positive bowel sounds.
Back revealed there was no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Extremities revealed no edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed a leftward axis with intraventricular conduction delay, left atrial enlargement, and a left bundloid appearance, left ventricular hypertrophy; there were no significant changes as compared with old study.
On abdominal CT, there was occlusion of the left renal artery with necrosis of the left kidney which appeared swollen and acute.
There was a filling defect in the superior mesenteric artery which refilled distally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and heparinized for his left artery and probable superior mesenteric artery clot.
His creatinine increased from 1.4 to 2.2, and his abdominal pain worsened significantly.
The patient was evaluated by Urology, Vascular Surgery, and General Surgery who all felt that the patient needed an emergent abdominal angiogram to assess the extent of his superior mesenteric artery clot and mesenteric ischemia.
This angiogram was performed on hospital day two and showed severe atherosclerotic disease throughout the aorta, iliac, and femoral vessels.
There was a clot in the midportion of the superior mesenteric artery with filling of some small peripheral vessels.
T-PA and papaverine were instilled into the superior mesenteric artery with some clearance of clot and vasodilation.
He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography of the head on hospital day three for evaluation of a new left third nerve palsy since presentation.
On this magnetic resonance imaging, the patient was noted to have an incidental finding of a aneurysm in the trifurcation of the middle cerebral artery.
Given that the patient's likelihood of survival without surgery for his mesenteric ischemia was quite low, no intervention was undertaken for this aneurysm.
Late on hospital day three, the patient began to have progressive hypoxia and hypotension with blood pressures in the 70s/40s.
As the patient and his family had decided to forego surgery, and in doing so fully understood that this would mean the patient's likely death, no intervention was undertaken.
The patient began to have runs of significant tachycardia to the 190s and runs of ventricular tachycardia lasting 20 to 30 beats.
Given the futility of pressors for treatment of mesenteric ischemia without surgical intervention, and the patient's worsening arrhythmias, the Levophed was stopped on the morning on hospital day five.
Left renal artery stenosis and left kidney necrosis.
Congestive heart failure.
Left third nerve palsy.
