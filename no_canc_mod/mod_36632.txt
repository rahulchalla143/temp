Admission Date:  [**2168-7-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-7-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-6-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation  History of Present Illness: Patient with recent illness and admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for pneumosepsis, discharged home on [**2168-7-12**] to rehab at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital on vanc/cefepime with vanc scheduled to complete on [**7-21**].
The patient had initially been doing well at rehab, and according to her daughter, coming to terms with her current rehab arrangement and shortness of breath.
She was unfortunately diagnosed with c.diff colitis on [**2168-7-14**] in the setting of increased stool output and was started on oral vancomycin.
2 days ago on [**7-19**] the patient was noted to have acute worsening of her mentation following feeding, which was normally alert and verbal to be found complaining of shortness of breath, despite having normal oxygen saturations - she was found to have hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and anemia - she was treated for all three including transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs and subsequently underwent suctioning with transient improvement in her mental status.
She had no interval increase in sputum production.
The next day, [**7-20**], the patient was noted to have similar symptoms but even worsening mental status requiring from the rehab area to the intensive care unit as she had a diminished mental status and was being ventilated with a bag-valve mask.
She was found to be somnolent on arrival with a tongue bite and the differential included post-ictal state although no seizure activity was noted, this was confirmed with an EEG which showed slowing but no epileptiform activity.
She reportedly had a normal head CT, and a CT of the chest which revealed left lower lobe collapse which has been frequently noted on previous imaging studies.
Additionally, she was noted to have [**Last Name (un) **] and a significantly elevated vancomycin level - this was presumably held, but not clearly noted in the chart, there was an appreciable decline in the vancomycin trough between [**7-20**] to [**7-21**] from 50 to 30. .
She was seen and evaluated by neurology who recommended volume expansion for possible dysautonomic crisis.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was noted to be completely unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli, occassionally grimacing to suction, but had no purposeful movements.
She was hemodynamically stable, but vital signs were notable for a bradycardia in the low 50s, BP was elevated, but not markedly so.

New left PIC line ends in the right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 5.5 cm to place it within the low SVC.
24-HOUR VIDEO EEG ([**2168-7-22**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of one brief generalized electrographic seizure at 04:23:38 as is described under Continuous EEG.
This electrographic seizure has no clinical correlation on video.
In addition, there are frequent bisynchronus parasagittal periodic epileptic discharges in the first few hours of the recording.
These findings are indicative of diffuse cortical irritability with epileptogenicity.
Furthermore, background activity is diffusely slow and discontinuous indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction of non-specific etiology.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Mild fluid signal in bilateral mastoid air cells.
Very faint flow signal in the left vertebral artery may be related to hypoplastic artery or chronic occlusion.
RENAL ULTRASOUND ([**2168-7-22**]): Normal-sized kidneys with increased cortical echogenicity consistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.
No evidence of obstruction.
EEG ([**2168-7-23**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of generalized periodic epileptic discharges in the first half of the recording indicative of diffuse cortical irritability with potential epileptogenicity.
In the second half of the recording, epileptic  discharges appeared more in a discrete pattern and they resolve after 14:30 indicative of attenuation of cortical irritability.
In addition, in the first half of the recording background activity is diffusely slow and discontinuous with generalized triphasic waves.
These findings are indicative of severe cerebral dysfunction as is seen the setting of hepatic or renal dysfunction where triphasic waves are more common.
In the second half of the recording however, the triphasic waves resolve and a more continuous though slow background activity is present.
No electrographic seizures are present.
EEG ([**2168-7-24**]): This is  an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of moderate to severe generalized background slowing indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction of non-specific etiology.
In addition, in the first 20 minutes of the recording, there are abundant generalized epileptiform discharges indicative of diffuse cortical irritability with potential epileptogenicity.
No electrographic seizures are present.
Compared to prior day's recording, this study shows improvement with resolution of the epileptiform discharges through the recording as well as appearance of a more continuous and faster background activity.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2168-7-24**]): Compared to yesterday's study, there is overall interval stability of mild acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure, right lower lobe atelectasis, and opacification of the lingula.
This is stable from yesterday's study, but slightly increased since [**7-22**].
EEG ([**2168-7-26**]): This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study due to moderate diffuse background slowing with intermittent bursts of further generalized slowing suggestive of moderate generalized encephalopathy of non-specific etiology.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.
Compared to the prior day's recording, this study shows improvement with no epileptiform discharges.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old woman with a history of C5/C6 [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 39850**] status post cervical decompression surgery 1 year ago, trach collar dependent, admitted with encephalopathy and [**Last Name (un) **].
# ENCEPHALOPATHY/COMA: On admission from OSH, patient was completely unresponsive, areflexic, noted to have facial grimace and rigid, flexed upper extremities.
Her OSH EEG reportedly showed no seizure activity.
They were however notable for acute renal failure (Cr 2.3, baseline Cr 0.3) and vancomycin toxicity (vanc level 37.1).
24-hour video EEG showed generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) superimposed on encephalopathic slowing, but no explicit seizures.
Based on her presentation with acute renal failure, it was felt that she likely developed renal failure due to vancomycin toxicity, which caused accumulation of psychoactive meds including Baclofen, Tizanidine, Morphine, Tramadol and Gabapentin resulting in toxic/metabolic encephalopathy as well as some uremic encephalopathy.
# Rigidity: The patient has rigid upper extremities, decorticate posturing, spastic quadriparesis secondary to her C-spine injury.
This was previously managed with Baclofen and Tizinidine, but even with both being held per above her rigidity improved during hospitalization.
# Hypoxic respiratory Distress: At admission, the patient was vent dependent (has trach), subjectively short of breath, but without declining respiratory parameters.
She was afebrile with no leukocytosis so the patient was not treated empirically for pneumonia.
Sputum cultures grew out MRSA, Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas on [**7-21**].
Given her bronchiectasis, positive cultures were found to be likely secondary to chronic colonization.
Because consecutive chest Xrays showed complete LLL collapse (result of prior episodes of Pseudomonas pneumonia and consistent with prior CXRs) with potential worsening with pulmonary edema, the patient was diuresed with 50 mg IV Lasix daily.
The patient was taken off the vent on [**7-27**], and did well off the vent without respiratory distress until discharge.
#[**Last Name (un) **]: The patient's acute kidney injury was most likely intrinsic, but could have some volume component, dramatic increase from baseline (0.3-->2.3), foley in, not obstructive.
The patient had a renal ultrasound which showed diffuse parenchymal disease.
Per renal consult, her renal failure could have been caused by ATN or AIN.
The patient had had no exposure to nephrotoxic drugs and had no documented episodes of hypotension, but her prior treatment with vancomycin and cefepime could have precipitated her ATN or AIN.
Urine eos x 3 were sent out, only 1 of which returned mildly positive.
The patient's Creatinine and urine ouput was monitored and the patient also received 40 mg Lasix IV daily to help with her volume overload.
#Hypernatremia: The patient was mildly hypernatremic on [**7-27**] with a serum Na of 147.
This was most likely [**3-10**] insensible losses with her ventilation, but could also represent the recovery phase of her ATN.
Her free water deficit was calculated to be 2.3 L in the setting of volume overload.
She is reportedly normotensive at baseline on her home meds prior to admission, likely partly due to her multiple neuropsych meds (Baclofen, Tramadol, Tizanidine etc) blood-pressure lowering effects.
She has a hx of guiaic positive stools, anemia, requiring transfusion at outside hospital.
Her PO vanc was continued in light of C diff history and because being treated with broad spectrum abx (Meropenam), will continue PO vanc for two weeks after Meropenam course is completed (last day of PO vanc is [**2168-8-13**]).
Given the patient's quadriplegid status, the patient's Coumadin was d/c'ed on [**7-27**] (because all venous tone is lost after several months of [**Month/Year (2) 39850**], her risk for DVT/PE is significantly lower).
5. hydroxyzine HCl 10 mg/5 mL Syrup [**Month/Day/Year **]: Fifty (50) mg PO every  four (4) hours as needed for anxiety.
13. tizanidine 2 mg Tablet [**Month/Day/Year **]: 4-6 mg PO TID (3 times a day) as  needed for muscle spasm.
21. docusate sodium 283 mg Enema [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1) enema Rectal once  a day as needed for constipation.
24. heparin, porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush: Flush with  10 mL Normal Saline followed by Heparin as above daily and PRN.
Meropenem 500 mg IV Q8H Duration: 3 Days First day: [**7-23**] Last day: [**7-30**]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy and acute renal failure  Discharge Condition: Improved mental status: responsive and conversant  Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 105209**],  You were admitted for altered mental status.
This most likely occurred because you developed a kidney failure and as a result your medications were not filtered.
The build-up of these medications caused metabolic encephalopathy (delirium) and seizures.
START hydralazine 50mg every 6 hours for hypertension 2.
STOP hydroxyzine 25/12.5 mL [**Male First Name (un) **] every 4 hours as needed for pain 10.
STOP morphine 10mg every 6 hours for pain 12.
STOP nitroglycerin 0.4mg for pain 13.
STOP tizanidine 4mg every 8 hours as needed for pain 14.
STOP tramadol 50mh every 6 hours as needed for pain 15.
