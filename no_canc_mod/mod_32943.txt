COPD on adviar with  who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2168-12-26**] after having episodes of painless BRBPR at home.
On [**2168-12-26**] he was admitted to the ICU at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and underwent a colonoscopy that day which showed diverticuli but did not reveal any active bleeding.
On [**12-28**] he underwent another colonoscopy with no localized source of bleeding but did show a large amount of blood in the colon.
Also in the course of the work up of his GI bleed he underwent a CTA of his abdomen on [**12-28**] with no active GI bleeding seen.
Got total of 7 units PRBC to maintain Hct ~ 27 throughout his stay at [**Hospital1 18**], Surgery was also consulted who agreed with the CTA and recommended a transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] if the family wished to pursue a further work up or aggressive treatment such as angio for embolization or surgical resection.
Also during his stay at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] given his history of systolic heart failure and murmur heard on exam he had an echocardiogram which showed an improvement in his EF to 55%, but significantly worsening of his aortic stenosis.

COPD on advair who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with BRBPR 7 likely [**3-9**] to a sigmoid diverticular bleed, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Diverticular bleed self-resolved, however course was complicated by septic arthritis of the shoulder.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Lower GI bleed: Patient transferred from BIDN with a continued GI Bleed without localized source.
Colonoscopy at [**Location (un) 620**] were suggestive of bleeding from sigmiod diverticuli.
Patient was noted to be intermittently hypotensive with SBPs in the 70s which responded to bolus IVFs with improvement to the 90s-100s.
He had no further episodes of bloody bowel movements while in the ICU and was transferred to the medicine floor.
His bleeding then self-resolved with no further interventions.
# Septic arthritis: Patient triggered on [**1-2**] for fever to 103.7 axillary, WBCs rising, developed hypotension requiring transfer to the MICU.
Began complaining of shoulder pain, so joint was aspirated by orthopedic surgery.
Found to have likely septic arthritis of left shoulder joint-- 122K WBCs on joint aspiration and frank pus on washout, however no organisms on gram stain and no growth yet on cultures.
Cannot completely rule out crystal disease because there was not enough specimen for crystal analysis.
ID was consulted, recommended repeat TTE to rule out vegetations (negative) and course of 4 weeks ceftriaxone 1g q24hours (through [**1-31**]).
#Afib- Patient has a known history of afib on digoxin qod at home, however level noted to be low on admission so digoxin increased to [**Month/Year (2) 24018**].
He was noted to be intermittently tachycardic with RVR to 170s when OOB, though he remained asymptomatic at these times.
# Diastolic CHF: Echo at OSH with EF of 55%, LVEF confirmed on echo here with evidence of grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.
He had no evidence of fluid retention, so this medication was not restarted and is not being continued on discharge.
# Aortic stenosis: Last echo in [**2166**] showed mild AS, however echo on this admission shiwed EF 55%, severe AS (valve area 0.8-1.O cm2), LVH, 1+ MR/TR.
Notes he has some dyspnea on exertion, but he denies any syncope or angina.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine at [**Location (un) 620**] was 1.4 on admission.
# Elevated troponin and EKG changes:  Patient was noted to have elevated troponin elevation at OSH felt to be possibly [**3-9**] demand ischemia with non specific EKG changes.
ACS was felt to be unlikely given patient remained symptom free with negative troponin x 2 and normal CK MB.
# Rheumatoid arthritis: Patient was continued on home prednisone.
He was given tylenol for pain in place of his home aleve.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 1036**] - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed Septic arthritis Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Rheumatoid arthritis Aortic stenosis Pancreatic mass Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 76901**],  You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to rectal bleeding.
You stayed briefly in the ICU, but your bleeding slowed down significantly and you were transferred to the medicine floor.
We believe your bleeding was due to diverticuli (small out-pouchings) in your colon, many of which will stop bleeding on their own like yours.
While you were here, you developed severe left shoulder pain and fevers and were found to have an infection of the joint.
Changes to your medications: STOP furosemide 20-40 mg daily STOP potassium INCREASE digoxin 125 mcg to daily (instead of every other day) START ceftriaxone 1g every 24 hours through [**1-31**] START metoprolol 12.5 mg twice daily START oxycodone 2.5 mg tabe every 4 hours as needed for pain START acetaminophen 650mg three times a day START senna 8.6mg tab twice daily START docusate 100mg twice daily START bisacodyl 10mg daily as needed for constipation  Followup Instructions: Department: ORTHOPEDICS When: THURSDAY [**2169-1-19**] at 12:20 PM With: ORTHO XRAY (SCC 2) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 551**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: ORTHOPEDICS When: THURSDAY [**2169-1-19**] at 12:40 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 2191**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2192**], NP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**] Building: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) 551**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: INFECTIOUS DISEASE When: WEDNESDAY [**2169-1-25**] at 10:30 AM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1037**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2335**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] Building: LM [**Hospital Unit Name **] [**Hospital 1422**] Campus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage
