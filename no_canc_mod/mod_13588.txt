Admission Date:  [**2174-3-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-3-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-12-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: s/p seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p Intubation  History of Present Illness: 59 yo M w/ hx EtOH withdrawal seizures and DMII who is transferred from OSH s/p seizures and intubation for airway protection.
When EMS arrived, pt started shaking w/ his eyes closed w/out bowel or bladder dysfunction or tongue biting.
He arrived @ [**Hospital6 **] where he was hypertensive to 260/160 P 70-130.
On the way to [**Hospital1 18**], he became agitated in the ambulance and was moving all extremities -- he received another 4mg ativan and 30mcg fentanyl.
ROS per his wife is no hx of trauma or fever.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: T 100.2 PR HR 81 (70-90's) BP 159/80 (140-200/80-110) AC 650 x 10 (not overbreathing) 5 40% sat 100% Gen: cauc M intubated, sedated lying in stretcher in NAD HEENT: PERRL b/l Heart: RRR, S1, S2, no m/r/g Lungs: CTBLA, no rales, no wheezing ABd: S/NT/ND/no masses Ext: no edema Derm: erythroderma on b/l hands, not involving palms, no other rash on chest, face or extremities Neuro (done by Neurology once off Propofol): no facial assymetry, tongue midline, gag intact.
+apraxia as pt attempted to move his head to brush his teeth instead of using his hands.
CN: ?
visual field deficit as pt confused.
Normal tone, no rigidiy or resting tremor.
TECHNIQUE: 8-MDCT axial images of the head were obtained without IV contrast:  FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, major vascular territorial infarcts.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
There is mucosal thickening and fluid in the posterior ethmoid cells.
There is a hypodense area in the right occipital region consistent with an old infarct.
There is a round hypodensity in the right occipital region in the corticomedullary junction that cannot be seen in the MRI.
It is probably due to volume averaging.
IMPRESSION: 1) There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2) Chronic infarct in the right occipital region.
3) Sinus disease as described above.
[**3-7**] MRI: FINDINGS: There are no areas of elevated signal to suggest acute brain ischemia on the diffusion-weighted scans.
The conventional images show a large area of mixed T1 and T2 signal within the right occipital and temporal lobes, consistent with a chronic infarction.
There are numerous smaller areas of elevated T2 signal, consistent with chronic microvascular infarction within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, as well as the posterior aspect of the thalamus on the right side.
There is a 5 mm area of susceptibility within the right posterior frontal, superior parasagittal region (that is not visible on the followup CT scan).
The combination of findings suggests that the abnormality could represent chronic blood products, as opposed to a meningioma.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are notable for a small air fluid level and mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus, as well as minor mucosal thickening within the sphenoid, both ethmoid, frontal, and mastoid sinuses.
These sinus abnormalities could represent an allergic or some other type of inflammatory process, as well as relate to intubation.
CONCLUSION: No sign of an acute infarct.
Large chronic right-sided posterior cerebral artery distribution infarct.
[**3-6**] chest x-ray: PORTABLE CHEST, ONE VIEW: There are no prior studies available for comparison at this time.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There is linear atelectasis in the right mid/lower lung zones.
There is no CHF, focal pneumonia, or pleural effusion.
[**3-8**] Chest CT: FINDINGS: The finding of mediastinal widening corresponds to prominent mediastinal fat.
There is no hematoma or adenopathy.
There is bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
Superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.
No pneumothorax.
There is coronary artery calcification.
The upper abdomen shows no gross abnormalities.
There are no osseous lesions detected.
Bilateral lower lobe collapse with small effusions.
Superimposed pneumonia is not excluded though aspiration seems unlikely based on the appearance.
[**3-9**] chest x-ray: AP BEDSIDE CHEST: The cardiac silhouette is prominent even allowing for semi-erect position.
The left lower lobe behind the heart is opacified and both hemidiaphragms are poorly visualized.
No PTX identified.
Since similar suboptimal bedside exam 2 days ago, the left lower lobe process has developed or increased.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe atelectasis.
Equivocal vascular congestion/fluid overload and/or small effusions.
These assessments limited by bedside semi-erect positioning  [**3-15**] bilateral carotid dopplers: FINDINGS: There is minimal scattered calcific plaque involving both carotid systems.
IMPRESSION:  No appreciable ICA or CCA stenosis bilaterally.
His head CT and MRI ruled out acute bleed or new stroke.
He was seen by Neurology whose impression was seizure secondary to alcohol withdrawl.
He also had anion gap with possible DKA, so he was placed on Insulin gtt.
Initially, he was persistently agitated requiring multiple 40 mg of Valium per CIWA.
He has a hx of HTN but not on any medications at home.
He may likely have very elevated BP as baseline.
On admission, he was noted to have dterioration in oxygenation and increased secretion from the ETT, CXR with LLL opscification consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
He was seen by swallow evaluation after receiving PO Valium, so showed some risk for aspiration when he is more lethargic.
Seizure: Given history of chronic alcoholism with alcoholic withdrawal seizures and recent history of abstaining from alcohol for several hours, seizure activity felt likely [**1-19**] EtOH withdrawal.
Also maintained on standing valium given that he had seizure on admission.
Patient had an EEG which demonstrated no seizure activity on [**3-13**].
No further seizures while here.
Patient had MRI which showed no sign of an acute infarct.
Noted to have large chronic right-sided posterior cerebral artery distribution infarct.
Head CT showed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage but demonstrated chronic infarct in the right occipital region.
Therefore no acute mass or infarct to explain seizure activity.
Bilateral carotid doppler ultrasounds demonstrated no abnormalities with normal flow.
2.Other neuro: As above, paitent had head CT/MRI/Carotid Dopplers as part of seizure/syncope work-up.
Noted to have old stroke in posterior cerebral artery distribution.
Patient with weakness on standing, dysmetria and trouble with fine motor movements.
Also with left homonymous hemianopsia.
Felt likely secondary to old stroke, possible neuropathy, benzodiazepine side affects and possible long-term alcohol abuse affects.
Aspirin/statin maintained for secondary stroke prophylaxis.
Patient to follow-up there once out of acute rehab.
Alcoholic ketosis: Pt has history of DMII and was admitted with hyperglycemia, anion gap of 17 and glucose and ketones in urine, concerning for early DKA vs. alcoholic ketosis.
Felt to be alcoholic/starvation ketosis.
Diagnosed with pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.
Cardiovascular: a)Patient ruled out for MI; EKG without concerning changes, cardiac enzymes cycled, troponin with slight elevation but felt likely secondary to demand, remained flat.
Statin, beta-blocker, aspirin as noted for other indications.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1) Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure  Secondary: 2) Alcohol Abuse - Continuous 3) Aspiration Pneumonia 4) History of CVA in past, abnormal MRI 5) Hypertension 6) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Take all medications as prescribed.
Contact MD if you develope any new weakness or have sensory changes or if you develop any new concerning symptoms.
The MRI you had here on admission was abnormal and showed evidence of an old stroke.
There was a  question of an underlying tumor, though the suspicion was low.
3) Have a repeat chest x-ray in 6 weeks to ensure your pneumonia has cleared.
Given your smoking history and age, we need to make sure there is no underlying mass.
