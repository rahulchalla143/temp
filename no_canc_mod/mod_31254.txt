IMAGING: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] ([**5-28**]): Type 2 odontoid fracture with mild anterior displacement of the C2 vertebral body in relation with the odontoid process and malalignment at the fracture site.
The fracture demonstrates increased signal through the cleft indicating acute nature of the fracture.
There is also increased signal in the posterior ligaments between occiput and C2 and prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
Mild increased signal visualized within the spinal cord at C1 level indicating cord edema/contusion.
No evidence of extrinsic cord compression identified.
Fractures through the anterior and posterior arches of C1 as well as a type 2 dens fracture with posterior angulation of the fracture fragment and mild canal narrowing.
There is no significant cord impingement; however, prominence of soft tissues posterior to these fractures may represent a small hematoma versus chronic degenerative changes.
No vertebral artery injury or evidence of vascular abnormalities.
Rightward deviated bilateral nasal bone fractures.
Non-displaced hairline fracture of the external table of the left frontal sinus, without extension into the orbit.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
At least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
PATHOLOGY: None   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the acute care surgery service on [**2182-5-28**] for management of traumatic injuries sustained s/p fall in the setting of possible syncope.
Neuro: Patient with Parkinson's at baseline and presented report of LOC s/p fall.
Plastics evaluated facial fractures and deemed these to be non-operative.
Patient experienced bradycardic/respiratory event [**5-29**] as per below and required intubation.
A CT Head was obtained at this time to assess for intracranial process and was again negative.
When awakened patient was found not to be following commands likely secondary to delirium.
Experienced a bradycardic event (Code Blue) on [**5-29**] perhaps secondary to respiratory etiology/mucus plugging.
Metoprolol dosing was titrated up while in the ICU with no further events of bradycardia or hypotension.
ICU day 4 she was found to be anemic with no clear bleeding source, but she was transfused to a hematocrit of 30 to optimize oxygen delivery.
She showed promise in weaning off the vent early, but exhibited persistent neck/face/tongue swelling such that extubation was not feasible.
Her trach showed minor sanguinous secretions until discharge, easily managed with intermittent suction.
We feel volume depletion and traumatic injury explain her gentle rise in creatinine the past few days.
ID: Given concern for pneumonia on CT chest, she was started on Vanc/Cefepime ICU day 3.
5. white petrolatum-mineral oil 56.8-42.5 % Ointment [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
6. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository [**Month/Day/Year **]: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
12. heparin, porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
C1 posterior arch fracture 2.
C2 dens fracture 3.
Respiratory failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the acute care surgery service for management of traumatic injuries sustained [**5-28**].
