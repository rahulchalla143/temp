He had been having angina since [**2154**].
He was seen in OSH ED with CP and ECG showed new LBBB.
He was taken to the cath lab and found to have chronically occluded native arteries and posterior descending artery with 40-50% diffuse lesion.
Initially the plan was to continue medical therapy with asa, plavix, bb, statin and nitrates however on evening of [**10-9**] had recurrent L sided CP which resolved with 1 SL nitro.
Patient's films reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8467**] who felt he had a tight left main that could be stented.
He had no SOB, dizziness or headache.
[**2145**] Angioplasty OM branch distal to graft [**10/2155**]: Stress test with evidence of small inf wall MI, ant apical and lateral ischemia.
EF 40%, inferior hypokinesis, distal anterior severe hypokinesis, diskinesis of apex.
Other History: Dyslipidemia TIA s/p hernia repair   Social History: Lives with his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] ETOH, tobacco or illicit drug use  Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS - T 98 HR 72 BP 92/44 RR 12 Sat 97 Gen: elderly, caucasian male, no acute distress HEENT: NCAT.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left bundle-branch block.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Selective coronary angiography of the LMCA demonstrated 70% distal LMCA stenosis, 100% proximally occluded LAD, 70% ostial LCX stenosis with 80% stenosis in the AV groove branch.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
Course later complicated by hematoma and pseudoaneurysm treated with thrombin injection.
There is Q-T interval prolongation.
A repeat tracing of diagnostic quality is suggested.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left bundle-branch block is new as compared with prior tracing of [**2159-10-11**] and similar to that recorded on [**2159-10-10**].
Right Femoral Vascular US [**2159-10-13**]: RIGHT FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color and pulse wave Doppler examination was performed in the right groin region.
Examination reveals a 3.1 x 2.7 x 1.7 cm pseudoaneurysm in the right groin, with visualization of the neck connecting the pseudoaneurysm to the right common femoral artery.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 82 year old male with history of multiple myocardial infarctions, coronary artery bypass graft with four vein grafts in [**2141**], and chronic angina who was found to have NSTEMI at an outside hospital, underwent cardiac cath there demonstrating three vessel coronary artery disease and left main stenosis.
1) Coronary Artery Disease: Cardicac catheterization demonstrated three vessel disease and 70% stenosis of the left main coronary artery which was successfully stented with a drug eluting stent.
Patient remained chest pain free throughout this hospitalization.
2) Femoral Hematoma: Following catheterization patient developed an expanding hematoma at access site.
During this episode of bleeding patient became bradycardic and unresponsive.
On hospital day 4 patient determined to have right femoral pseudoaneurysm diagnosed by a femoral bruit and confirmed by ultrasound.
4) Rhythm: Patient remained in sinus rhythm with likely rate related left bundle branch block.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual as needed as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction, Status Post Percutaneous Intervention and stent to the left main coronary artery, Right groin hematoma, Right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm status post thrombin injection Secondary:Dyslipidemia, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2141**], status post hernia repair   Discharge Condition: good, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to this hospital in order to have a cardiac catheterization.
Following the procedure you had groin bleeding and went to an intensive care unit until the bleeding had stabilized.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or pass out please contact your primary care provider or come to the emergency department for evaluation.
