She complains of a cough productive of thick [**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum.
Otherwise, the patient is a poor historian, but collateral history from nursing at [**Hospital **] rehab, her brother, and her daughter, who is her health care proxy, is revealing for the patient being non-adherent to antibiotics.
There is also vague history of her having a primary lung lesion that may be contributing to a post-obstructive picture.
She is otherwise noted by her daughter to be in increasing pain after her hip surgery; she is recalcitrant toward medications other than Roxicet, but this regimen does not seem to be controlling her pain adequately of late.
Noted to have acute mental status change.

In addition, there are bilateral nodular opacities.
Would recommend followup to resolution and/or further characterization with dedicated Chest CT. .
Large right gluteal hematoma after right total hip arthroplasty for femur fracture.
Bibasilar airspace opacities concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.
There is interval improvement in widespread parenchymal opacities consistent with partial resolution of pulmonary edema.
There is also slight interval increase in right pleural effusion.
Left retrocardiac consolidation is unchanged.
CT of the right hip was consistent with intramuscular hematoma without RP or intrabdominal involvement; she was also guaiac negative.
Orthopedic surgery was consulted; upon evaluation, they had low concern for compartment syndrome, with no neurologic abnormalities or evidence of ischemia in the RLE.
# S/P ORIF: After holding coumadin, pneumoboots were started in the acute setting and the patient was subsequently transitioned to Hep SQ for DVT prophylaxis.
# HA-PNA: Presented carrying the diagnosis of recurrent PNA in the setting of poor adherence to antibiotics; also had thick [**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum on presentation, coarse rhonci on exam, and evidence of RLL consolidation on PA/L CXR.
Was treated for presumed HA-PNA in light of her recent hospitalizations and residence at [**Hospital **] rehab with IV Vanc/Cipro/Cefepime and discharged on these antibiotics for a total course of 10 days, day 1 = [**2110-7-3**].
# Ectopy: On admission was found to have frequent ectopic beats but was hemodynamically stable.
Cardiology was consulted; upon evaluation, they diagnosed the patient to have SVT with aberrency.
# Hyponatremia: Admitted with Na ~130 and fluctuated between 128-130; thought to be a chronic abnormality possibly due to SIADH in the setting of an extensive smoking history and/or pain.
# Pulmonary nodules on admission CXR: Found to have 3 new pulmonary nodules on CXR thought to be clinically insignficant (2 on left, 1 on right); by collateral history from [**Hospital 882**] hospital, these were deemed to be new nodules.
No interventions or diagnostics were obtained during this hospitalization; outpatient work-up recommended.
# PICC: A PICC was placed without complication for IV antibiotic administration in the outpatient setting.

You were hospitalized because of altered mental status, hospital acquired PNA, and acute blood loss due to hyper-anticoagulation in the setting of your recent hip surgery.
You were treated with antibiotics for your PNA and prior to discharge you were showing a reassuring trend of improvement from the perspectives of lab tests and symptoms.
Your blood loss was treated with reversal of your anticoagulation and you were transfused 3 units of red blood cells, to which you responded well without complication.
