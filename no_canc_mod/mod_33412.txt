Admission Date:  [**2114-10-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-11-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-6-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**] Chief Complaint: cough and fevers x 1 month  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: 70 yo female with complicated hx of lung disease, thought likely to be Rheumatoid lung, previously evaluated/treated at [**Hospital1 **] in MN, now presents with symptoms similar to previous presentations with cough and fevers x 4-5 weeks.
Pt notes that her sx previously began approx [**7-9**], with onset of rhinorrhea with post-nasal drip, development of a cough, and subsequent persistent fevers.
During the initial episode, she was treated with levofloxacin and her symptoms appeared to improve for a few months.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the diagnosis is not entirely clear, she is presumed to have rheumatoid lung disease without evidence of articular involvement.
Pt states that she has had extensive testing, but is unclear about details.
She notes that she has a hx of hematologic involvement with her prior episodes, and has required blood transfusion previously.
Significant for a diagnosis of rheumatoid lung disease.
She was hospitalized after complaints of cough and fever at the [**Hospital3 85404**] in 08/[**2112**].
She was found to have interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, had a hematologic involvement, elevated CCP, and mild splenomegaly.
Her lung disease was consistent with organizing pneumonitis and small airways inflammatory process.
She had a lung biopsy, which was not diagnostic, but consistent with potential rheumatoid lung disease.
There was some question of whether there was a component of hypersensitivity pneumonitis as well given that she lived in a house in [**State 760**] with significant mold.
Proximal lower extremity myopathy.
Distal fibular fracture in [**1-/2114**], after a fall, underwent nonoperative treatment.
Deep venous thrombophlebitis, diagnosed also in [**10/2113**], had a repeat ultrasound revealing some residual clot after three months; therefore, I had an extension of her course to a six-month total period of treatment, finished this at the end of 06/[**2113**].
C. diff colitis x2.
Recurrent urinary tract infections.
Had an admission for urosepsis at the [**Hospital3 14659**] from [**2113-11-2**], to [**2113-11-22**].
Anemia of chronic disease.
Thyroid nodule with a negative biopsy and evaluation in the past.
Fibrocystic changes in breast.
The patient had an extensive lower extremity edema during her hospitalization, had a normal echocardiogram in [**3-/2114**], revealing an ejection fraction of 60% with no valvular heart disease.
No history of tobacco.
No history of IVDU.
She is able to drive and is fairly independent at this point, limited mostly by the pain in her right knee.
No history of abuse.
Mother died secondary to complications from what sounds like colon cancer, also had a history of diabetes.
Both brothers have a history of CAD and valvular heart disease, but no early CAD in the family.
No breast or ovarian cancer.
Ext: 2+ LE edema B to knee.
No evidence of PCP infection or rheumatoid lung interstitial disease.
Mixed solid/ground-glass 1.8 cm LUL nodule concerning for neoplasm such as bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma; 3-month followup CT is recommended to evaluate for resolution.
Splenomegaly; given rheumatoid arthritis and decreased WBC, this suggests Felty syndrome.
Severe tracheomalacia; severe bronchomalacia of right mainstem bronchus/bronchus intermedius.
Splenomegaly with spleen measuring 18 cm in the axial dimension and 16 cm in the craniocaudal dimension and multiple splenules.
No CT evidence of portalhypertension.
No other adenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis.
Compression fracture of the T12 vertebral body with mild retrolisthesis of T12 on L1.
The left adrenal is mildly thickened which may represent adrenal hyperplasia.
Peripheral blood FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING INTERPRETATION Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
DIAGNOSIS: CELLULAR MARROW WITH MARKED ERYTHROID HYPERPLASIA AND NUMEROUS HEMOPHAGOCYTIC HISTIOCYTES.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF MYELODYSPLASIA.
Note:  There is no morphologic evidence of lymphoma or a classic chronic myeloproliferative syndrome.
The presence of numerous hemophagocytic histiocytes raises the possibility of a macrophage activation syndrome which may be related to her previously diagnosed rheumatoid disease.
Although her diagnosis of rheumatic lung disease has been put in doubt by recent imaging of the lungs, her inflammatory markers remain elevated and may be due to an ongoing rheumatological or other autoimmune disorder.
CHROMOSOME ANALYSIS-BONE MARROW KARYOTYPE: 46,XX[14] INTERPRETATION: No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified in metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic proliferation.
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed.
Moderate estimated pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Splenomegaly without associated increased FDG-avidity to suggest lymphomatous involvement.
No FDG-avid adenopathy.
Mild diffusely increased FDG-avidity involving the bone marrow that is non-specific and could be related to drug reaction, though leukemic involvement cannot be excluded, for which clinical correlation and interval follow-up can be obtained as indicated.
Lower lobe predominant subpleural reticulation demonstrating increased FDG-avidity most compatible with a component of rheumatoid lung involvement and associated active inflammation.
Stable heterogeneously enlarged right thyroid lobe with multiple non-FDG avid nodules that can be correlated with ultrasound.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a 70 year old female with a PMH significant for possible RA (on prednisone, azathioprine, and hydroxychloroquine), possible RA associated ILD, and DVT (not currently anticoagulated) admitted on [**2114-10-9**] for 4 months of productive cough and several weeks of fever to 102.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxic respiratory distress.
She underwent bone marrow biopsy demonstrating hemophagocytic histiocytes, therefore the diagnosis of HLH was strongly considered.
Her hospital course has been complicated by episodes of transient hypoxia and intermittent hypotension.
Lastly she had evidence of a missed STEMI and was started on aspirin.
