He describes a chronic decline in function over the past few months, noting that it has been more difficult to rise out of chairs and ambulate.
He at times attributed this to right hip pain as the limiting factor, though later suggested the hip is not painful.
He does carry a diagnosis of OSA and has not been compliant with CPAP recently.
He was unfortunately also inconsistent with symptoms of lightheadedness during these episodes of difficulty walking- He has been nauseated and has not been drinking as much recently.
He complained of severe back pain.
There was no concerning EKG findings, and a CXR revealed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
There was no fracture on a left hip plain film as well.
He recalled having told the ED about a bout of tachypnea last night that was self limiting, but he has no further chest symptoms.
A broad review of systems yields no focal weakness, no fevers/chills, no nausea or vomiting, no chest pain or pressure, no abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, no hematochezia or melena, no coughing or wheezing, no weight gain or loss.

Noting the technical limitations of the film followup PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful if pulmonary symptoms were to persist.

# Hypoxia: Was oxygenating well on room air/2L NC at presentation and now requiring 6L NC with pO2 75.
CXR with equivocal findings for PNA, also febrile with increasing WBC though no left shift or leukocytosis at admission.
Some evidence of volume overload on exam with elevated JVP and bibasilar crackles, also with evidence on CXR, and SBP almost 200 at admission so may have had flash pulmonary edema.
PE also a possibility though no evidence of significant hypoventilation given pCO2 of 50 in patient with OSA and likely elevated pCO2 at baseline.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to ICU and received BiPAP for four hours and his respiratory and mental status improved.
He received course of levofloxacin for possible PNA and was diuresed to relieve pulmonary edema.
Differential diagnosis of altered mental status includes hypercarbia, uremia, sepsis.
PCO2 only mildly elevated, so hypercarbia unlikely to cause this degree of altered mental status.
Chest x-ray questionable for pneumonia.
It is likely that all of these conditions combined to produce altered mental status.
Patient had persistent hallucinations admission.
Most likely represents respiratory acidosis with superimposed AG and non-AG metabolic acidosis vs primary metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation in the setting of chronically elevated pCO2 >50, though serum HCO3 22 in 2/[**2148**].
Non-AG acidosis most likely due to AoCRF.
PH returned to [**Location 213**] during stay in the ICU with treatment of pneumonia and acute kidney injury.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Worsening Cr most likely due to obstruction or prerenal in setting of poor PO intake.
NIFEdipine CR 60 mg PO DAILY hold for SBP<100   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 4542**] Rehabilitation and Nursing of [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Acute kidney injury   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Visual hallucinations with insight Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital for difficulty breathing and confusion.
