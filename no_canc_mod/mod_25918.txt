Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: esophagogastroduodenoscopy paracentesis   History of Present Illness: This is a 47 year old male with past medical history significant for HTN, low back pain, and alcohol abuse who presents from [**Hospital3 5365**] for further mangement of esophageal varices after presenting there with a GI bleed.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been dealing with low back pain for the past few months and has been seeing a specialist at [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center for this problem.
In the ED he was pale and hypotensive (SBP's in the 80's) and had a hematocrit of 10 with elevated transaminases and a coagulopathy.
He denied any chest pain, nausea, or vomiting.
He initially denied abdominal pain but then acknowleged that he may have had some "gas pains" that made it difficult for him to sleep one night.
His vital signs have been stable after fluid resuscitation.
Today, he underwent upper endoscopy that revealed two duodenal ulcers without active bleeding and grade four esophageal varices.
Currently, the patient reports low back pain but denies nausea, vomiting, light headedness, or any other acute issues.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension -Elevated liver enzymes: he reports elevated LFT's for years and that he has had ultrasounds in the past (last perhaps 2 years ago), he denies every being told he had cirrhosis -History of alcohol withdrawal (not recently) but denies any history of DT's or seizures -Hyperlipidemia   Social History: He is single and lives alone.

If clinically indicated, lateral view may help for further assessment.
Nodular heterogeneous liver suggestive of a cirrhotic liver without focal masses.
Sludge within the gallbladder with minimal wall thickening, which may reflect hepatic dysfunction, but no evidence for cholecystitis.
Abdominal ascites.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2178-9-24**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2178-9-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2178-9-22**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):    Brief Hospital Course: 47 year old male with hypertension, chronic back pain, and chronic alcohol abuse as well as recent history of significant ibuprofen use presenting after GI bleed for management of esophageal varices and likely alcoholic hepatitis vs cirrhosis.
Upper GI bleed: The patient presented with melena and a dramatic Hct drop without marked abdominal pain or nausea.
Given size of varices it seems unlikely that these would bleed for such a significant hematocrit drop without nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
Most likely etiology, therefore is peptic ulcers most likley related to NSAID use.
-PPI drip -Given inability to exclude variceal bleed would continue octreotide, start prophylactic abx with ceftriaxone 1gm Q24hr -Hepatology consult in AM -Active T and S, IV access, NPO pending GI eval -will need f/u of biopsies from [**Hospital6 **] -pt was advised to avoid NSAIDs -liver team f/u in 1 week, repeat endoscopy in [**7-14**] wks -H. pylori serologies pending on dc.
Varices/ Portal HTN/ Cirrhosis: Patient with large varices c/w portal hypertension.
This could be due to acute alcoholic hepatitis vs chronic cirrhosis.
Most likely etiology of cirrhosis in this gentleman would be alcohol.
No indication for TIPS at this time given bleeding under control and pt stability.
-RUQ U/S in AM to evaluate liver parenchyma and for presence of cirrhosis -pt appears to have ascites, would intend to do diagnostic tap in AM to confirm transudative process -Discuss TIPS with hepatology  3.
Ascites: Transudative associated with portal hypertension.
No evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Pt has minimal lower lung field sounds and given recent decreased movement would be concerned about atelectasis.
Coagulopathy: Nearly resolved, likely an element of nutritional deficiency in addition to liver disease.

You were admitted to the ICU for treatment of this bleeding and you were seen by gastroenterology.
Your symptoms were thought to be due to bleeding ulcers.
Incidentally, we also found enlarged blood vessels in your esophagus which are likely caused by your liver disease.
We started you on a medication to prevent bleeding from these ulcers.
