ECHO [**2146-12-29**]: No pulmonary hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
ECHO [**2147-1-7**]: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-12-29**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 y/o lady with cirrhosis thought to be secondary to methotrexate, DM, rheumatoid arthritis, presented with ascitic fluid (~1-2 L) leaking through umblical hernia repair site initially but resolved [**1-1**] with diuretics.
No evidence of SBP and cultures taken from ostomy bag over leaking site showing diptheroids were likely due to contaminants.
TIPS was put on hold (patient not encephalopathic, with normal RUQ ultrasound and ECHO but elevated TBili, making TIPS procedure more risky).
She developed a cough with likely pneumonia seen on cxr.
In addition a cellulitis around the periumbilical site was noted.
Other problems included development of hepatorenal syndrome.
A repeat Cardiac ECHO showed increased MR ([**1-14**]+ and higher PA pressures) concerning for worsening fluid overload.
She developed worsening DOE/chronic cough on [**1-3**], felt to be multifactorial (asthma, gerd, fluid overload).
Postop liver duplex demonstrated patent hepatic vasculature.
There was some turbulence and elevated velocity seen within the main portal vein.
A small amount of perihepatic fluid seen just anterior to the liver was noted.
CVVHD was continued for volume overload until renal function improved with urine output increasing to ~ 1-1.5 liters/day.
She had a brief episode of bradycardiaasystole when suctioned while on spontaneous breathing trial.
Some bleeding was noted at the medial portion of the incision.
An echo was done noting a wall motion abnormality possibly related to an old infarct.
Stool was sent for c.diff and was negative x3.
While in the SICU, course complicated by notation of a right radial nerve palsy likely related to positioning.
No limitations in weight weight bearing were recommended.
