Prenatal screens revealed blood type O positive, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, group B strep status unknown, and rapid plasma reagin nonreactive.
Severe vaginal bleeding in the fifth week and admissions for cervical shortening and preterm labor.
The fetus noted to have severe intrauterine growth retardation, oligohydramnios, and large retro-amniotic clot.
Decision to delivery on [**4-15**] for maternal fever to 100.4.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Remarkable for a markedly small for gestational age preterm infant with vital signs stable.
No grunting, flaring, or retracting.
The abdomen was soft and nondistended.
A murmur was noted on day of life two.
An echocardiogram was performed on day of life three which showed a patent foramen ovale and a small ventricular septal defect.
No patent ductus arteriosus.
A repeat echocardiogram was obtained on day of life 15 which again showed no patent ductus arteriosus.
The infant will need to follow up with Cardiology as an outpatient for her ventricular septal defect.
The infant was started on caffeine for apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
Feeds were initiated on day of life six and were advanced slowly secondary to abdominal distention and visible loops.
However, was again made nothing by mouth on day of life 15 for abdominal distention and bilious aspirates.
The infant eventually diagnosed with a Staphylococcus epidermidis line infection and subsequent ileus.
The infant is blood type O positive/Coombs negative.
Around day seven of life, the infant passed a mucousy stool followed by a small plug.
The infant with increased spells on day of life 15 associated with abdominal distention, bilious aspirates, and decreased activity level.
Blood cultures grew out Staphylococcus nonaureus?.
The infant's line infection was treated through the line and subsequent blood cultures on treatment with no growth.
The infant had a urine cytomegalovirus sent on admission secondary to intrauterine growth retardation which was negative.
Two subsequent urine cytomegalovirus levels were sent secondary to periventricular cysts found on head ultrasounds.
NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The infant had an initial head ultrasound on day of life three which had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1131**] of slightly dilated ventricles.
These head ultrasounds showed a slight increase in the size of her cysts and a slight increase in the size of her ventricles to the upper limits of normal.
They felt it could also be consistent with an in utero bleed.
They also noted that these findings could also be seen in some chromosomal abnormalities as well as in congenital cytomegalovirus.
The infant will continue to be followed with weekly head ultrasounds, and Neurology will continue to be involved.
Magnetic resonance imaging deferred at this time secondary to parenteral request as the information would be for diagnostic purposes only not for therapeutic purposes.
GENETIC ISSUES:  Chromosomes sent secondary to finding of periventricular cysts on head ultrasound and were pending at the time of this dictation.
Prematurity at 31 weeks gestational age.
Intrauterine growth retardation.
Small ventricular septal defect.
Periventricular cysts on head ultrasound.
Anemia of prematurity.
Apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
