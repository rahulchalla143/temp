He presented to an OSH with abdominal pain and found to be extremely hypertensive 218/134, elevated lipase and amylase.
He was placed on a CIWA scale, and  after receiving Ativan the pt became tachypneic, needing intubation.
He became hypoxic in spite mechanical ventilation, developed renal failure now with a creatinine of  3.8 from 1.0 baseline.
Findings consistent with severe pancreatitis.
Diffuse peripancreatic stranding and multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.
Pancreatic necrosis cannot be adequately evaluated without IV contrast.
No evidence of intraperitoneal free air.
Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Ovoid hypodensity in the left caudate head, likely due to a subacute lacunar infarction.
Moderate paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell mucosal thickening.
Equivocal sphenoid sinus air-fluid levels.
No definite intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
No gallstones seen.
Gallbladder wall edema likely related to the patient's pancreatitis.
Small early-subacute infarction in the subcortical white matter of the posterior right frontal lobe, most likely embolic.
Chronic lacunar infarctions in the periventricular white matter, in the head of the left caudate nucleus, in the left pons, and in the left middle cerebellar peduncle.
Fluid in the sphenoid and bilateral maxillary air cells, which may indicate acute sinusitis.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No significant interval change in extent of peripancreatic fat stranding involving the body and tail of the pancreas consistent with pancreatitis.
No evidence of pseudocyst, or areas of pancreatic necrosis.
Associated peripancreatic lymphadenopathy is unchanged.
Multiple soft tissue density implants seen within the left upper quadrant and left anterior abdomen are suggestive of splenosis.
Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged.
Diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
Technically limited study secondary to contrast extravasation.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Worsening sinus disease, with air-fluid levels suggesting acute sinusitis.
New early-to-subacute infarction involving the left precentral sulcus/gyrus and subcortical white matter.
Stable appearance to chronic small vessel ischemia changes within the periventricular white matter, left pons, left middle cerebellar peduncle.
Increased opacification of paranasal sinuses.
CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS  [**2102-2-22**] 8:16 AM IMPRESSION: 1) Minimal atherosclerotic calcification involving the carotid bulbs and ICA origins bilaterally without evidence of significant stenosis.
2) Bilateral pleural effusions with evidence of volume overload/CHF.
3) Pansinus disease as above.

Of note he does not have any extraocular movements with dolls, which, given his history, is concerning for Wernicke's encephalopathy.
It is possible that it is a small vessel lacunar infarct, which would most likely be due to small vessel atherosclerotic disease.
He was found to have L frontal CVA, R subcortical CVA (both subacute).
He now inconsistently follows commands and was still requires Ativan for agitation and soft wrist restraints.
[**Name2 (NI) **] had a generalized seizure during his hospital course and was given Dilantin IV for treatment of this, along with the Ativan.
CV: He was tachycardic on admission.
He was tachycardic at times, up to 130-150's, mostly when agitated.
Renal: He developed renal failure.
Due to the patient's baseline underlying edema, the injury was not immediately noticed; however, within 30 minutes infiltration was confirmed via contrast enhancement of the patient's left upper extremity on scout films.
-----Imaging: [**2-22**] CT neck: b/l no significant stenosis.
[**2-21**] MRI: new CVA in L frontal lobe, acute>subacute, precentral area extending to subcortical white matter; LENIs: neg [**2-20**]-TEE-PFO, LVH mild outflow tract obstruction; [**2-18**] KUB: few dilated loops of bowel, No free air, air fluid levels.
no areas of necrosis or pseudocyst.
[**2-10**] ECHO: EF> 75%, nrm valves; [**2-9**] EEG -> very slow waves [**2-8**] MRI/A: New post R frontal subcortical infarct, old lacunars  [**2-6**] RUQ US: gb wall edema; [**2-5**] CT: severe pancreatitis, b/l eff.
