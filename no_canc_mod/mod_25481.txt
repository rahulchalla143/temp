Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation in a structurally-normal valve.

There is hilar fullness and mild cephalization of pulmonary vasculature.
There is no mediastinal enlargement.
There is no pneumothorax or lobar consolidation.
No pleural effusions are noted.
Mild interstitial edema and fluid overload.
Right hilar fullness most likely related to fluid overload.
However, if there is clinical concern for lymphadenopathy followup imaging recommended following treatment of fluid status.
======== Transvaginal US [**2199-10-2**]:  INDICATION: 19-year-old female 11 days postpartum with sepsis and severe crampy pelvic pain.
Evaluate for retained products or ovarian pathology.
COMPARISON: No prior study available for comparison.
FINDINGS: Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound were performed, the latter for better evaluation of the endometrium and ovaries.
The endometrial cavity contains a small amount of fluid and echogenic debris.
There is no vascularity within the debris.
There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
Fluid and echogenic debris within the endometrial cavity without vascularity may represent blood, but devascularized retained products of conception cannot be excluded.
Small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
======== Abdominal US with doppler [**2199-10-2**]:  INDICATION: 19-year-old female with direct bilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia and possible sepsis.
COMPARISON: No prior study available for comparison.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation and the common bile duct measures 3 mm.
There is trace ascites and bilateral pleural effusions.
Gallbladder wall thickening without other son[**Name (NI) 493**] signs of acute cholecystitis, likely reflects third spacing.
Bilateral pleural effusions and trace ascites.
======== CT Abdomen/pelvis [**2199-10-2**]:  INDICATION: 19-year-old female 11 days postpartum with episiotomy presents with sepsis of unclear etiology, acute renal failure, liver failure, and white blood cell count of 48.
Evaluate for abscess, appendicitis, colitis, or other intra-abdominal abnormality.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis without IV contrast due to the acute renal failure.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated atelectasis.
However, underlying infection cannot be excluded.
The liver demonstrates diffuse low attenuation without focal mass lesion.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
In addition, there is low attenuation material in the gallbladder, likely sludge.
There are two tiny calcifications within the left adrenal gland without associated mass lesion.
The kidneys are symmetric without evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
The appendix is not definitely visualized, but there are no secondary signs of appendicitis.
There is mild diffuse stranding in the subcutaneous fat and mesentery and a small amount of fluid in the right paracolic gutter consistent with generalized edema.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a 4 cm pocket of gas within or adjacent to the left iliacus muscle and smaller locules of gas tracking into the sacroiliac joint, left S1 neural foramen and left piriformis and gluteus minimus muscles.
The left piriformis muscle is slightly larger than the right and there is miminal phlegmonous material adjacent to the piriformis muscle.
There is associated rarefaction of the posterior left iliac bone with apparent erosion of the medial cortex (2:72).
There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, measuring simple fluid attenuation.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
BONE WINDOWS: Aside from the left iliac bone findings described above, there is no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion.
Small phlegmonous density anterior to the left sacroiliac joint and possibly continuous with the joint space, with pockets of gas within the left iliacus, piriformis and gluteus minimus muscles with associated rarefaction of the posterior left iliac bone, highly suspicious for septic arthritis of the left sacroiliac joint and associated osteomyelitis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Low attenuation of the liver is likely related to acute hepatitis or generalized edema.
Gallbladder wall thickening is likely related to diffuse edema rather than acute cholecystitis.
Small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
ADDENDUM: On additional review of the images, in addition to rarefaction, there are small locules of gas within the left posterior iliac bone.
Necrotic bone (A-B): Consistent with acute osteomyelitis (see note).
Endometrial curettings (C-F): Decidua with necrosis and acute inflammation; smooth muscle fragments with reactive changes; stains for bacteria are negative.
There is a fragment of cortical bone and multiple fragments of what appear to be hemorrhagic possibly necrotic soft marrow.
It consists of fragments of tan-red tissue that measure in aggregate 4 x 3 x 0.5 cm.
======== Chest x-ray [**2199-10-9**]:  REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with septic shock.
The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC.
There is interval extensive progression of the parenchymal opacities currently involving the entire lungs with bibasilar dense consolidations.
The above-described changes might represent significant rapid progression of infection or superimposed pulmonary edema on the pre-existing abnormalities within the lungs.
======== Liver/GB US [**2199-10-9**]:  FINDINGS: The gallbladder has a similar appearance with no change in the luminal volume.
Again there is gallbladder wall thickening which is entirely nonspecific and could be related to the known hypoalbuminemia.
A trace amount of pericholecystic fluid is noted.
There is a right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of nonspecific gallbladder wall thickening which is likely to be related to third spacing.
The appearance is not suggestive of acute cholecystitis, and furthermore the stability of gallbladder volume would also argue against acute cholecystitis.
Status post drainage of septic left hip, now with spiking fevers.
There are diffuse patchy pulmonary opacities throughout both lungs somewhat sparring the left upper lobe.
Findings are consistent with diffuse multifocal pneumonia and/or superimposed ARDS.
Compared to the prior study, there is a stable moderate-sized right pleural effusion and a moderate-sized left pleural effusion.
The left effusion has increased slightly in size since the prior study.
There is dense consolidation in both lung bases with air bronchograms.
Superimposed aspiration should be considered.
There is high-density material in the dependent portion of the gallbladder consistent with vicarious excretion likely from the prior angiogram of [**2199-10-3**].
There is punctate calcification within the left adrenal gland which was stable from the prior CT scan.
There is a small-to-moderate amount of ascites lateral to the liver which measures an average of 8.7 Hounsfield units consistent with simple fluid.
There is linear density involving the renal cortices bilaterally.
These findings would be consistent with possible ATN and delayed enhancement of the renal cortex secondary to IV contrast administration on [**10-3**].
Reportedly, the patient is making urine, but has an elevated creatinine of approximately 3.
This may represent focal inflammatory or infectious region within the right kidney.
However, there is no surrounding perinephric fat stranding making the possibility of infectious or inflammatory lesion less likely.
There is high-density material within the colon, likely from prior ingested oral contrast on [**10-2**].
There is a surgical defect in the left iliac bone with high-density rounded material.
This is consistent with recent debridement and placement of antibiotic capsules.
Metallic densities are also noted in the distribution of the left superior gluteal artery related to recent catheter embolization.
There is no evidence of a pelvic abscess.
There is diffuse anasarca.
Specifically, there is no evidence of a drainable fluid collection around the left hip.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no lytic or blastic lesions.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities with bilateral pleural effusions.
Findings could be consistent with multifocal pneumonia or ARDS.
Underlying aspiration should also be considered.
Diffusely abnormal kidneys.
However, there is a rim of high density attenuation surrounding both kidneys.
This may be related to vicarious excretion of contrast and delayed nephrogram from IV contrast administration approximately one week ago in the setting of acute renal failure.
In the proper clinical setting, this may represent a focal abscess or inflammatory focus.
However, there is no surrounding perinephric fat stranding which would often be associated with an infectious or inflammatory etiology.
Postoperative and post-embolical changes in the left iliac bone and distribution of the left superior gluteal artery.
New left sacral small hypodense foci may represent focal areas of osteopenia versus new areas osteomyelitis; close attention on followup is recommended.
Left sacral linear lucency may represent developing insufficiency fracture; again close attention on followup imaging is recommended.
Expected post surgical changes in left iliac bone and soft tissues.
======== Chest x-ray [**2199-10-14**]:  IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-13**], 5:22 a.m.:  No endotracheal tube is seen below C6, the upper margin of this film.
Lung volumes are lower and there is greater opacification generally particularly in the right lung.
This could be little changed, could be due primarily to the loss of positive pressure ventilator support, but is also concerning for progression of underlying abnormality, presumably edema, cardiogenic or otherwise.
Small right pleural effusion is presumed.
There is no pneumothorax.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There are multiple rounded radiopaque bodies projected over the left iliac bone, which probably represents antibiotic impregnated beads.
The bowel gas pattern appears grossly unremarkable.
Slight left convex rotary scoliosis suggested in the lower lumbar spine.
FINDINGS: There is a surgical defect in the left iliac bone with round high density pellets which is consistent with the previously described I&D, and subsequent antibiotic pellet placement.
Patchy hypodensities are seen in the left sacrum just medial to the left SI joint (400B; 36, 38).
High-density material projecting in the distribution of the left superior gluteal artery is consistent with catheter embolization material.
Postoperative changes consistent with a left lateral inguinal approach are seen including a 6 cm x 6 cm x 9 cm fluid collection in the left inguinal subcutaneous soft tissue, likely postoperative simple fluid/ seroma.
There is also a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
A small locule of air within the bladder likely represents recent catheterization; mild enlargement of the uterus likely represents recent postpartum state.
New left sacral small hypodense foci may represent focal areas of osteopenia versus new areas osteomyelitis; close attention on followup is recommended.
Left sacral linear lucency may represent developing insufficiency fracture; again close attention on followup imaging is recommended.
Expected post surgical changes in left iliac bone and soft tissues.

Brief Hospital Course: On presentation she was hypotensive with bandemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (creatinine > 3) with fluid refractory shock requiring three pressors.
She was evaluated by the OBGYN and hematology services in the ED, and felt to have a process unrelated to retained POC and a presentation consistent with SIRS (considered responsible for the thrombocytopenia).
Initial imaging of the pelvis was highly concerning for septic arthritis of the left sacroiliac joint and associated osteomyelitis.
Peri-intubation the patient was transiently without a pulse and 3 chest compressions were performed with return of spontaneous circulation.
She was taken to the OR on [**2199-10-3**] for left sacroiliac joint debridement.
The procedure was complicated by significant bleeding which required arteriogram and gelfoam to the left superior glutal artery.
Postoperative course was complicated by ARDS and persistent oxygen requirement despite attempts at diuresis with lasix drip.
She also had intermittent fevers although no additional infectious sources were identified.
She self extubated on [**2199-10-15**] and was stable from a respiratory status since that time.
Thrombocytopenia resolved.
This may have been secondary to residual delerium, although given her very severe illness and temporary pulselessness, some degree of anoxic brain injury cannot be ruled out.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Sepsis, left sacroiliac joint infection, left ilium osteomyelitis.
She presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with an acute picture of septicemia and hypotension.
She now presents emergently to the operating room for debridement, given her significant degree of hemodynamic instability.
Significant amounts of necrotic bone were curettaged and burred.
Profuse bleeding was noted coming from the underside aspect of the sciatic notch.
I tamponaded the bleeding, inserted antibiotic beads including Tobramycin and vancomycin and proceeded to close the wound .
The bleeding appered controlled durign wound closure.
I informed the surgical ICU team to monitor hematocrit in the following hours in the case of persistent bleeding from the surgical site.
Ig so , I recommended to proceed with angiography for control of potential superior gluteal artery bleed if bleeding persisted.
======== Superior gluteal artery embolization [**2199-10-3**]:  INDICATION: 19-year-old woman status post left iliac debridement for osteomyelitis with subsequent bleeding from the left superior gluteal artery with active bleeding seen during surgery and hematocrit drop from 26 to 13.
As the location of the bleeding was known after discussion with the orthopedic [**Last Name (un) 5059**] and due to the patient's acute renal failure, a selected arteriogram of only the left iliac artery was performed.
A C2 cobra catheter was advanced over the wire and an arteriogram of the left internal iliac artery demonstrated active contrast extravasation from the left superior gluteal artery.
Gelfoam was administered proximal to area of bleeding within the left superior gluteal artery.
A final run of the left internal iliac artery demonstrated no active bleeding from the left superior gluteal artery.
As the patient was in acute renal failure, Visipaque was used and the patient was well hydrated and premedicated with bicarbonate.
IMPRESSION: Area of active bleeding seen from left superior gluteal artery with subsequent embolization with gelfoam and coils with good angiographic result and no immediate complications.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSEIS:  Left sacroiliac septic joint and septic ilium.
Via the previously made left lateral window of the ilioninguinal exposure the wound was reopened.
Significant amounts of old clot and hematoma were debrided.
The wound was copiously irrigated down to the level of the bony cavity which was irrigated with multiple liters of pulse lavage solution and the antibiotic beads were applied after removing the old set.
The was no evidence of odor or other sign of persistent worseingin necrosis of the bone.
The wound was then closed after there was no active bleeding using Vicryl sutures and staples at the skin.
[**Known lastname **]'S STATEMENT:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] was present for the entire procedure and then referred the case to the GYN service to perform a D and C.  ======== D&C and removal of suture material from perineum [**2199-10-4**]:  OPERATIVE REPORT  [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 84665**] **NOT REVIEWED BY ATTENDING**  Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]          Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 84663**]  Service:                          Date:  Date of Birth:  [**2179-12-14**]        Sex:  F  [**Year (4 digits) **]:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 50701**], [**MD Number(1) 84666**]  SERVICE:  OB/GYN.
Echogenic material on the uterus.
Echogenic material on the uterus.
PROCEDURES:  Dilation and curettage, removal of redundant suture material from the perineum.
INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 19-year-old female in G1, P1, status post a spontaneous vaginal delivery on [**2199-9-20**], who presented with left hip pain that was making her have difficulty sitting and standing but denied any fever, chills, abdominal pain.
The patient also had some loose stools since her delivery but was otherwise feeling well.
The patient had a precipitous delivery and only received a local anesthesia at the perineum at the time of delivery.
She had a small perineal laceration which was repaired and reported normal amount of vaginal bleeding and cramping since delivery but no excessive abdominal pain or fevers.
She was found to be septic and in shock and was sent from the outside hospital in [**Location (un) 3844**] to [**Hospital1 **] given her septic state.
The patient presented with hypotension and required pressors for blood pressure support.
A pelvic ultrasound revealed a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis, some debris without vascularity in the uterus and no evidence of vascularity.
There was no clinical evidence on exam of retained products of conception.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was done which revealed gas within the left iliac and piriformis and phlegmon which was seen in the left sacral iliac joint.
Given these concerning findings and the patient's concerning state, she was taken to the operating room where she underwent an incision and drainage of the left iliac bone and after coming out of the operating room, her hematocrit fell precipitously and she was taken to the interventional radiology for an embolization of the superior gluteal vessel which was found to be bleeding.
The patient was taken back to the operating room today for repeat incision and drainage of the clot from the bleeding as well as any infection as well as antibiotic bead placement by orthopedics.
The vagina had a first-degree perineal laceration which had been repaired and noted.
The extra suture material which looked like 0-Vicryl was trimmed and hemostasis was noted.
There was no evidence of excessive bleeding or infection on exam.
A sample was sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture as well as sent to pathology for examination.
However, the curettings appeared to be old blood and decidua.
There are no obvious signs of retained products of conception or infection within the uterus in the contents that were curetted.
There was no evidence of any ongoing bleeding.
The perineum was examined and the first-degree perineal laceration had some redundant Vicryl suture which was cut and removed.
