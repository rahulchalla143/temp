The patient reports he had binged on cocaine 3 days prior and developed an "arthritis flare".
He had so much pain in his shoulders he could not get off the couch and could not reach out to eat or drink anything.

[**2183-7-8**] - UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Heart is normal in size with a left ventricular configuration.
The aorta is mildly tortuous.
There are no effusions or pneumothorax.
Right internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed in the interval.
[**2183-7-8**] HEAD CT - There is no evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved, with no cerebral edema.
There is no fracture.
The included portions of the paranasal sinuses, as well as the mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear; there are bilateral conchae bullosa.
Nonspecific mesenteric stranding, unchanged since the prior study.
Persistent splenomegaly.
5-mm heterogenous lesion within the splenic parenchyma is stable as compared to the prior study.
Aspiration versus atelectasis at the lung bases, there is a more nodular opacity at the right base, which could represent pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was intially admitted to the MICU for concerns of his fever and mental status changes.
1) Hypotension - In the ED, he transiently dropped his systolic blood pressures into the mid 90s, resulting in ICU admission.
2) Fever - possible sources included the basilar atelectasis vs aspiration pneumonia seen on abdominal CT (but patient was without cough, shortness of breath, tachypnea); his L knee effusion (found to be gout on arthrocentesis), blood cultures (growing sparse G+ cocci, coag negative in [**2-7**] bottles, thought to be a contaminant), or a urine which grew out 10,000 CFU of enterococci (with no pyuria on his UA).
Based on this clinical picture, the patient was thought to have fever intially due to gout.
His fevers resolved promptly on admission to the hospital, and he remained asymptomatic and afebrile throughout his course.
The patient was discharged on an additional 7 day course of amoxicillin for his enterococcus UTI, repeat u/a showed no bacteria or WBCs.
3) Mental status changes - Patient had negative LP, head CT, no other signs of infection (as above).
He did have significant recent substance abuse.
4) Gout - crystal proven by L knee arthrocentesis performed on HD#1.
He was restarted on his home dose of allopurinol, also started on colchicine, prednisone 30mg qd x 2 days, 20 mg x 1 days, with significant symptomatic relief.
Please don't hesitate to seek medical care if you develop any fever, chills, weakness, urinary burning or any other concerning symptoms.
