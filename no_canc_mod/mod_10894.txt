Admission Date:  [**2119-11-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-12-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2048-8-27**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old female patient with a known history of aortic stenosis reports recent increase in dyspnea on exertion over the past month.
Patient at that time denied history of syncope or chest pain.
Cardiac catheterization performed on [**2119-11-16**] revealed a right dominant system with single vessel coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 0.86 cm squared and a mean gradient of 33 mm Hg, left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 58%, and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 24.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia which was treated with atenolol, known aortic stenosis, spastic colon.
The patient describes a history of scarlet fever as a child, arthritis of both knees, history of renal calculus, significant hearing loss, cataract surgery, status post D&C, status post bilateral knee replacements, bilateral appendectomies, status post tonsillectomy.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Is significant for a mother who died of complications related to a CVA.
Father died of complications related to a CVA.
Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented with no apparent deficits.
Coronary examination was regular, rate, and rhythm with a systolic murmur evident.
Abdomen was soft, obese, and nontender with positive bowel sounds.
Patient was initiated on insulin drip for hyperglycemia at that time.
On the night of her surgical day, [**11-17**] into the morning of [**11-18**], the patient was noted to have questionable seizure activity.
Patient's anesthesia drugs were reversed and she was noted to have increased jerky-type movements.
The patient spiked a fever to 102 at that time, and otherwise remained hemodynamically stable.
She was felt to have had partial complex seizures at that time.
She had a stable cardiac rhythm at that time and her epicardial wires were discontinued to facilitate emergent MRI scan to evaluate the etiology of her seizure activity.
The MRI from later that morning was suspicious for an acute right middle cerebral artery infarct with a small left hemisphere infarct stressed to embolic events.
She was also pancultured for fever and increasing white blood cell counts.
These cultures other than a positive urine culture for E. coli ultimately were negative.
A repeat CT scan on [**11-19**] showed no hemorrhage with no evidence of shift and some, mild edema in the right frontal lobe area.
She had some atrial fibrillation also on that day for which she received an additional bolus of IV amiodarone.
An electroencephalogram was done at that time which was consistent with mild encephalopathy, however, no focus seen for seizure activity.
There are also no clear periods of wakefulness noted at that time.
She was maintained on Dilantin to prevent further seizure activity and her electrolytes were being repleted.
She also had some intermittent bursts of atrial fibrillation at that time with rates between the 80s and 120s with ventricular rates.
On [**11-22**], the patient showed some signs of wakefulness.
She began to nod her head in response to questions asked, although she was noted to have left arm weakness at that time.
Repeat head CT scan also on the [**11-22**] revealed evolution of multiple small right frontal and parietal infarcts.
Chest x-ray at that time revealed a left lower lobe collapse and some left pleural effusion.
The following day on the [**11-23**], patient continued with burst of atrial fibrillation treated with intravenous Lopressor and continued on the intravenous amiodarone.
Chest x-ray showed a persistent left lower lobe collapse with some effusion.
Her intravenous central line has been discontinued and sent for culture which ultimately turned out to be negative, and her ceftriaxone was discontinued since the only positive culture from the previous fever spike was urine, which had been adequately treated.
[**Name (NI) **] chest x-ray showed a continued left pleural effusion for which a chest tube was placed.
She was noted to have a large raised area at the superior aspect of her sternal incision with no erythema and she had some serous drainage on the superior aspect of her incision.
She was begun empirically on Vancomycin IV and levofloxacin via nasogastric tube at that time due to increasing white blood cell count.
Also Gastroenterology consult was obtained for possible placement of a PEG if she were unsuccessful with her barium swallow which was scheduled for the following day.
On [**11-28**], the patient did undergo a modified barium swallow, which she passed well, and she was at a low risk for aspiration.
She also began to have very large amounts of diarrhea over the next 24-48 hours.
Patient has a history of "spastic colon", and however, stated that this was much more significant than her baseline.
She was resumed on her cholestyramine and the Gastroenterology service was reconsulted on [**11-29**] due to increasing diarrhea.
Three Clostridium difficile specimens were sent and were all negative, as well as subsequent stool cultures which also came back negative.
She was begun on Coumadin at the recommendation of the Neurology Service for her stroke as well as for her history of multiple postoperative episodes of atrial fibrillation.
She continued to have some sternal drainage with moderate amounts of erythema around the drainage area and just superior to the top of her sternal wound incision.
Cardiovascularly, patient remains in normal sinus rhythm, regular S1, S2 with no murmur noted.
Erythema is significantly decreasing on the Vancomycin and levofloxacin.
Her INR should be between 2 and 2.5 as a goal for her stroke as well as atrial fibrillation.
Discharge diagnosis is aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement, postoperative atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident with seizure activity, pleural effusion, urinary tract infection.
