REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for interval change in size or new lesions 75-year-old woman with known liver lesions.
Assess for interval change in size or new lesions.
In the left lobe of the liver, there is a 12.1 x 6.1 x 4.0 cm multiloculated mass which has changed its appearance significantly from the prior examination, whereas previously it appeared overall quite heterogeneous with small areas of hypoechogenicity.
There now appear to be large fluid components in this mass.
There are small lymph nodes around the celiac axis measuring 0.7 cm in short axis.
Large mass in the left lobe of the liver.
The appearance has changed significantly from the prior examination of [**2185-4-22**] and the mass now contains large loculated fluid components.
No new lesions are identified.
===========   Brief Hospital Course: [**Date range (1) 77612**] The patient's initial MICU course was complicated by acute GI bleeding, bacteremia, fungemia, and dialysis access complications.
In this complicated setting, she also had a NSTEMI which was medically treated, and also was noted to have a liver mass.
Due to a significant bleeding diatheses, a biopsy could not be performed until the patient was stabilized.
[**2093-5-6**] Her bleeding diatheses was managed with improving nutrition as directed by nutrition consult, and high dose vitamin K SQ for three days.
Her respiratory status decompensated, with increasing oxygen requirement, thought to be due to profound hypotension with even modest ultrafiltration on hemodialysis despite aggressive sodium modelling and dialysis protocol optimization.
Once her coagulation profile improved, her pleural effusion was tapped to optimize her respiratory status, and approximately one liter was removed.
The patient was also significantly deconditioned and in significant pain and often declined physical therapy; her medical regimen was adjusted to include fentanyl transdermal patch for better basal pain control in an effort to increase adherence to a PT regimen.
The patient still had diffuse anasarca with limited fluid removal during HD secondary to symptomatic hypotension.
A repeat liver US was obtained which showed a rapid progression in size of the previously seen lesion.
She was started on zosyn and cipro for empiric coverage.
[**2105-5-23**] The patient preliminary liver biopsy results demonstrate amyloidosis and further discussions with the patient's health care proxy, her son, indicated a desire to moves towards hospice care.
