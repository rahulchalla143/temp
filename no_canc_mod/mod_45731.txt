On [**Hospital 8471**] hospital day two, after the esophagoscopy was performed, which again revealed no obvious evidence of esophageal injury, an esophageal barium study was performed.
This was negative for any evidence of extra-luminal contrast or esophageal rupture.
Levophed was continued to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure but was being titrated downwards.
The P to F ratio was 300; no evidence of acute lung injury and the patient was found to be ventilating easier than previously.
TLS spine was cleared and cervical spine MRI was performed which was negative for ligamentous injury.
On hospital day seven because of comments heard by the patient regarding feelings that perhaps he should not have lived through the accident and apparently some degree of difficulty understanding that his passenger had suffered a fatal injury, there was a question of whether the patient was expressing suicidal ideation and a psychiatry consultation was obtained.
The psychiatric consultant felt that there was no acute suicidal or homicidal ideation present, and their impression was the patient would likely need therapy following discharge during his recovery, to deal with this traumatic experience.
On hospital day nine, an Occupational Therapy consultation was obtained whose impression was that there were significant deficits in orientation, judgement, attention, and visual/spatial relationships, with decreased ability to sequence, to problem solve, and also to perform visual and cognitively inter-related tasks.
Punctate intracranial hemorrhages.
Right lateral maxillary sinus fracture.
Bilateral pulmonary contusions.
Diffuse external injury.
