**FINAL REPORT [**2130-2-27**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2130-2-27**]):    No MRSA isolated.
**FINAL REPORT [**2130-2-26**]**     Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2130-2-26**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.

Mild fluid overload.
Cardiomegaly, extensive right pleural effusion with subsequent right middle and lower lung consolidations, likely to represent atelectasis, pneumonia, or a combination of both.
No pneumothorax.
TTE [**2130-2-25**]: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Critical calcific aortic stenosis.
Mild symmetric LVH with vigorous global biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-11-25**], aortic stenosis severity has progressed.
[**2130-2-28**] RUE US: FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were acquired of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic, brachial, and cephalic veins.
No thrombus is seen around the PICC.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: 89-year-old female with COPD, diastolic CHF, afib on coumadin, CAD, critical aortic stenosis (valve area 0.7 cm2), dementia, hardness of hearing, presenting from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with shortness of breath; likely multifactorial, including PNA, heart failure volume overload in setting of worsening AS, and underlying COPD.
She was kept in the ICU for several days and required BiPAP briefly; she was treated concurrently for HCAP with Abx, CHF exacerbation in the setting of worsening critical AS, and her underlying COPD.
She developed Afib with RVR, likely due to infection and higher albuterol doses; after switching her to levalbuterol and in consultation with cardiology, her HR was maintained on 25mg Metoprolol q8hrs.
Her shortness of breath and hypoxia were likely multifactorial.
First, pt has fever and leukocytosis (WBC 21) with CXR showing new right lower lobe opacity, strongly suggestive of pneumonia.
Other potential reasons for her hypoxia are COPD (no PFTs available) and CHF exacerbation (CXR showing pulmonary edema and BNP elevated to 8000s).
Furthermore, her EF on new TTE was >55%, and her worsening aortic stenosis may have exacerbated her CHF.
# Atrial fibrillation: while she was in the ICU, her EKG showing afib, rates 110s.
The pt is on coumadin at home; daily INR was followed and coumadin dose adjusted accordingly, particularly as pt has hx of supratherapeutic INR on levofloxacin (increased to peak of 8 in ICU).
# Aortic stenosis: Most recent TTE on [**2129-11-25**] showed preserved EF (55%), but moderate/severe AS (valve area 1cm2), and MR/TR.
Rpt TEE in the MICU showed same EF but worsened AS of 0.7cm2.
Pt has an outpt cards f/u visit for core-valve candidacy.
# R arm pain: pt is s/p PICC on R arm.
She c/o pain on R arm on 2/7pm, and had mild swelling and tenderness on exam.
RUE duplex showed no e/o DVT; pt's RUE pain disappeared on its own (was likely musculoskeletal in nature), and she was maintained on APAP for pain prn.
