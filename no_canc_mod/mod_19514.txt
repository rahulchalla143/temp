Brief Hospital Course: 57 year-old female w/ polysubstance abuse, active alcoholism, EtOH cirrhosis, previously with UGIB at OSH s/p EGD on admission showing grades I & II varices and clot overlying peptic ulcer with BRBPR.
Due to prolonged hospital course, discharge summary is in chronological order:  First MICU Course: ([**Date range (1) 72108**])  GI Bleed: Urgent EGD was done on admission [**10-25**], it showed grades I & II varices, and clot overlying peptic ulcer but did not show any actively bleeding varicies.
She was suspected to have a symptomatic ulcer and underwent repeat EGD on [**10-29**] to evaluate the need for TIPS.
A potential culprit ulcer was found, covered by clot overlying the fundus.
Respiratory failure: OSH chest CT showed bilateral lower lobe consolidations, possibly from aspiration and patient required significant ventilatory support.
She was extubated on presodex on [**10-31**] and her oxygen requirement continued to decrease.
Leukocytosis: Patient had a leukocytosis of unclear etiology.
Her leukocytosis was thought to be secondary to an inflammatory process rather than an infectious one, as her hypoxia improved and she was afebrile.
For her mental status, she was treated for PSE with lactulose and rifaxamin.
Her mental status improved dramatically over her course on the floor and she was being screened for rehab, having done well with PT/OT but had a large bloody bowel movement consisting of fresh red blood and clot on [**11-6**], which caused her to be readmitted to the ICU for further hemodynamic monitoring.
Second MICU Course: ([**Date range (1) 9395**])  Returned to MICU with BRBPR concerning for fast upper versus lower GI bleed.
Copious blood seen in colon, but no site of bleeding found.
Given prophylactic levofloxacin.
Continue to have altered mental status.
Given stability of vital signs and hematocrit, was called back to the floor for further management.
She was treated with lactulose and rifaxamin with some mild improvement.
Her altered mental status is more likely due to alcoholic encephalopathy (Wernicke-Korsakoff's type picture) and less likely hepatic encephalopathy as she confabulates, circumvents questioning and has tangible speech.
She was cleared medically but stayed in house for several extra days due to issues with discharge as patient refused acute rehab.
She remained at her baseline mental status and was discharged home with services on [**2181-11-15**].
