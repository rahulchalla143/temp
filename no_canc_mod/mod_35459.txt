HOwever, no seizures were seen clinically or on EEG after her initial 6 seizures.
She was extubated after about 72 hours and protracted intubation may have been due to slight supratherapeutic depakote, and more likely due to propofol.
No seizures were observed other than her admission events.

We suspect that the reason you had so many seizures is that you might have missed some of your seizure medications.
