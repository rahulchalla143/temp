F. who has complained of a headache for the past three weeks according to family.
Family reports frequent falls due to drinking.
Past Medical History: PMHx: low platelet count; alcoholic HTN Hypothyroidism Hearing loss Depression     Social History: Social Hx: alcoholic, binges daily, family thinks last drink 4 days ago, lives alone, smoke pack year history 106.

Pertinent Results: RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2179-11-15**] 11:28 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: r/o pneumonia  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 71 year old woman with s/p SDH, large smoking history, desating REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o pneumonia HISTORY: Status post subdural hematoma, desaturation, evaluate for pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
Left clavicular fracture is unchanged.
Healing right posterior lower rib fracture seen.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2179-11-12**] 8:37 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: assess for interval change  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 71 year old woman with SDH, uncal herniation s/p evacuation REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for interval change CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large right frontal, parietal, and temporal subdural hematoma with mixed acute and chronic components that has decreased in size and now measures approximately 1 cm from the skull base.
Decreased associated pneumocephalus is noted.
There is an approximately 3 mm midline shift, and there is no evidence of subfalcine or uncal herniation.
There are air-fluid levels within the right and left maxillary sinus and opacification of the anterior ethmoid air cells, unchanged.
Improved appearance of large right acute on chronic subdural hematoma with markedly decreased midline shift and no evidence of subfalcine or uncal herniation.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  FINDINGS: There is a large right frontal, parietal and temporal subdural hematoma with mixed acute and chronic components causing extensive effacement of the adjacent sulci, severe subfalcine herniation of approximately 17 mm, and mild uncal herniation causing mass effect on the brainstem and effacement of the ambient cistern.
There is prominence to the left occipital/temporal horns, likely related to mass effect on the third ventricle.
The fourth ventricle also appears slightly prominent.
There is no evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage with periventricular hypoattenuation likely related to chronic small vessel disease.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted within the frontal sinuses.
Large right acute on chronic subdural hematoma causing significant subfalcine herniation and mild-to-moderate uncal herniation.
Prominence to the left occipital and temporal horns along with effacement of the third ventricle is suggestive of hydrocephalus/outflow obstruction.
Multiple air-fluid levels within the maxillary sinus and sphenoid sinus with near-complete opacification of ethmoid air cells in this intubated patient.
Evaluate for acute fracture.
No prior comparison exams are available.
CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITH CORONAL AND SAGITTAL REFORMATIONS:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
Small ossific fragment anterior to C4-C5 is likely degenerative in nature, and there is mild multilevel degenerative joint and disc disease.
Visualized contents of the intrathecal sac appear unremarkable; however, MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of spinal cord injury.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
Pooled secretions are noted within the oropharynx consistent with patient's intubation.
Please refer to dedicated CT head for better description of sinus findings.
The soft tissues display atrophic or absent right thyroid gland with multiple calcifications noted within the left thyroid gland.
There is biapical pleural scarring and areas of linear atelectasis along with mild centrilobular emphysema.
