History of Present Illness: Pt is a 79 yo male CAD s/p CABG, PVD, R Coronary artery stenting, systolic CHF (EF 45%), CRF (creat 1.9), and HTN who is now s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3098**] stenting.
In [**Month (only) 958**], his wife walked into the room to find him hunched over in his chair with + LOC and urinary incontinence.
During [**Month (only) **] the pt had another episode in which he was slumped over in his chair + for LOC and urinary incontinence.
Review of systems + for exertional buttock and calf pain that resolves with rest.
+ for SOB after walking 7-10 minutes.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Peripheral vascular disease status post left iliac stenting in preparation for a fem-fem bypass for right iliac occlusion.
CAD status post CABG in [**2113**].
Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure with EF of 35%-40%.
Status post coronary artery intervention under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Chronic renal insufficiency, creatinine 1.9.
Peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery stenosis, right greater than left .
PSurgH: Colon CA s/p colectomy (last year) CABG ([**2113**])  Social History: +tob 65 pack-year history.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with no JVD.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Echo [**2129-6-14**]: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel coronary disease.
Mild diastolic dysfunction.
Prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Lateral ST-T wave changes may be due to myocardial ischemia or left ventricular hypertrophy.
Severe 80% stenosis of left ICA.
The internal carotid artery waveform has spectral broadening and velocities of 307/134 cm/sec.
The patient had a carotid series on [**2129-6-1**] showing a carotid artery waveform with spectral broadening, velocities of 307/134 cm/sec, an ICA/CCA ratio of 5.2, and 80-99% stenosis.
# Pump: The patient recieved an echo that showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel coronary disease, mild diastolic dysfunction, and EF of 45-50%.
The patient was not on his home ACE or afterload reducers because of the possibility of decreased BP secondary to the vagal effects of stent placement.
# Rhythm: The patient should receive a halter monitor as an outpatient to ensure that his previous two episodes of LOC were not secondary to an abnormal rhythm.
# HTN: The patient's normal home BP medications were held during the hospitalization because of the possibility of decreased BP secondary to the vagal effects of stent placement.
#CRI: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency.
Plavix 75 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Carotid Artery Stenosis  Secondary: Peripheral vascular disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic systolic and diastolic CHF  Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for carotid angiography with placement of a left carotid stent.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
