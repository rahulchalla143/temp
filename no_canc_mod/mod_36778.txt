CAUSE OF DEATH:  Cardiac arrest secondary to cardiogenic shock.
The patient also had mechanical ventilation.
The patient was unresponsive at that institution starting on the 10th.
She had a pacemaker placed for atrial fibrillation on the [**11-10**] and on the 7th the patient was noted to have abdominal distention on KUB, which showed large bowel dilatation.
She is being anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation with Coumadin and receiving Lovenox as well.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease status post non Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2109**], hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, hypothyroidism, gout and blindness.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
Extremities without edema and perfused.
Urinalysis showed moderate leukocyte esterase, moderate blood, few bacteria, 3 to 5 red cells and 6 to 10 white blood cells.
CT of her head was unchanged showing a left parietal lobe infarct, unchanged right thalamic lacunar infarct.
CT of her abdomen showed bilateral pleural effusions.
No small bowel thickening, descending and sigmoid bowel thickening with fat stranding and minimal free fluid.
No pneumatosis, questionable colonic polyp in the descending colon and mild dilatation of the small bowel.
KUB showed the cecum not very dilated, no free air, no evidence of obstruction and air throughout the colon.
ASSESSMENT:  The patient is an 87 year-old female with likely ischemic colitis of the descending and sigmoid colon.
She also had [**2111**] cc of crystalloid and she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in critical condition.
For prophylaxis she was placed on Protonix.
She had received a total of 10 liters over the previous 24 hours and had no fevers or desaturations.
For antibiotic coverage the plan was to initially continue for five days postoperatively.
Due to hypoglycemia following the institution of total parenteral nutrition an insulin drip was started.
She was restarted on Lopresor 5 mg intravenous q 6 once the Dobutamine was weaned off and began on gentle diuresis with prn loop diuretics.
Due to her thrombocytopenia her Lovenox was dropped and all heparin was eliminated on her carrier fluids.
The concern was that the patient could possibly be embolizing from atrial clot given her atrial fibrillation and stopping of her anticoagulation.
On postoperative day six the patient had been restarted on Dobutamine due to low cardiac index and also begun on a Lasix drip for diuresis.
This was due to a positive sputum culture three days prior, which was positive for MRSA.
The patient had cardiac enzymes sent, which were initially negative for an myocardial infarction.
A left femoral line, which was initially in place from transfer from the outside hospital and then discontinued after the patient was transferred from the Operating Room and cultures of this showed E-Coli.
Due to low cardiac indexes refractory to Dobutamine as well as tachycardia the patient was changed to a Milrinone with initial improvement in her cardiac index.
The CAT scan did show some ascites for which a diagnostic tap was obtained the results of which are pending at the time of this dictation.
The patient showed an upward trend in her white count as well.
The patient was also started on oral Flagyl for empiric treatment of possible C-diff colitis, however, these were not confirmed on her laboratory tests.
Throughout the day the patient became oliguric and her blood pressure and cardiac index continued to decline despite the pressors previously mentioned.
The patient continued to worsen her acidosis throughout the day and night and she was found to be asystolic at 2:00 a.m. this morning on the [**11-26**].
On examination with the mechanical ventilator turned off the patient had no heart sounds and no breath sounds.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Ischemic colitis.
DIAGNOSIS AT THE TIME OF EXPIRATION: Immediate cause of death is cardiac arrest and secondary to cardiogenic shock, status post exploratory laparotomy, left hemicolectomy and end colostomy.
