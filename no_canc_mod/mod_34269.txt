However, the lungs appear clear bilaterally with no evidence of focal consolidation.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Minimally-displaced fracture of the left clavicular head with a small surrounding hematoma.
Increased echogenicity of the liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Please note that other forms of more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
No focal liver lesion identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 34 yo M with h/o alcohol abuse who presents with chest pain and L clavicular head fracture, admitted to MICU for EtOH withdrawal.
EtOH use and withdrawal: The patient admits to binge drinking in setting of daughter's death with last drink reportedly 24-36 hours prior to presentation to ED.
On [**2175-8-29**], he was transferred to the general medical floors, where he had no signs of withdrawal for >36 hours.
He reports tongue swelling with PO preparation of thiamine, likely secondary to inert substance in the preparation.
He had no reaction to IV thiamine.
Chest pain: Chest pain was most likely musculoskeletal given ecchymoses, TTP, and visualized clavicular fracture.
Patient does not recall fall but had been intoxicated from EtOH abuse and had fresh bruises.
Constellation of nausea, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath were concerning for cardiac etiology, but EKG baseline with neg cardiac enzymes x 3.
CTA negative for pulmonary embolism.
His pain may have been exacerbated by grief/adjustment disorder or panic attack, and could also be complicated by EtOH withdrawal.
Grief/adjustment disorder: Pt reports feelings of depression and guilt in setting of daughter's unexpected death.
Left clavicular injury: There was evidence of a small hematoma around minimally displaced fracture of the left clavicular head.
Tylenol was discontinued on transfer to the floors and he was told not to restart this for pain as an outpatient.
The elevated LFT's are likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis.
Ultrasound with dopplers showed fatty infiltration of liver, but could not rule out cirrhosis.
U/S with dopplers could not rule out cirrhosis, so it is possible that liver disease could play a role, but this would not be likely to drop platelets so low and so acutely.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. non-cardiac chest pain 2. alcohol withdrawal 3. left clavicular head fracture 4. thrombocytopenia 5. transaminitis   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable, afebrile.
AAOx3, no signs or symptoms of withdrawal.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital on [**2175-8-27**] for chest pain.
We determined that you were not having a heart attack based on your EKG and blood enzymes.
We suspect that the pain is secondary to the recent fall you sustained.
You went to the intensive care unit because you were in danger of having serious withdrawal symptoms.
When you were discharged, you were no longer in danger of having withdrawal symptoms.
You also sustained a fracture to your left clavicle.
We looked at your blood under the microscopy and there were no other changes in  your blood cells.
An ultrasound of your liver showed fatty changes and could not rule out cirrhosis.
Please return to the ER or call your doctor if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, hallucinations, confusion, severe anxiety, fevers, chills, or any other symptoms concerning to you.
