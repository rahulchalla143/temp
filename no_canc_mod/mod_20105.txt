Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
MODERATE GROWTH.
MINIMAL INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION:.
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Compared to the prior study, there is new increased density in the left upper lung zone, which could be a developing pneumonia.
Right effusion is again demonstrated.
Nonselective aortography and selective superior mesenteric artery arteriogram demonstrate no evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding.
Diffuse atheromatous disease was noted.
Selective catheterization of the inferior mesenteric artery was unsuccessful, likely due to severe atherosclerotic disease at its origin as shown on a previous CT scan.
CT head: IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or change from the prior examination.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]: IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of osteomyelitis of the sacrum.
Subtle increased signal within the coccyx could be secondary to partial volume averaging from the adjacent decubitus ulcer.
Moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 level.
Brief Hospital Course: 66F with chronic trach and PEG, s/p CVA in [**2130**] with residual weakness who presents from home with lethargy and hypotension.
Patient with hx of c diff, serratia and MRSA bacteremia in the past.
During a previous admission, pt had MRSA bacteremia but no source was identified.
Blood, sputum cultures sent.
Pt is anuric so no urine culture.
Patient however with multiple sources of infection, including sacral decub ulcers, dry gangrene in both feet, tracheostomy and G-tube insertion sites.
Pt sx's initially improved dramatically with supportive therapy.
cultures returned pseudomonas from sputum and begun on meropenem on [**7-28**].
CT + MRI of sacral and posterior-tibial decubs showed no evidence of Osteomyelitis.
During admission, patient with multiple positive cultures including the following: sputum on [**2132-7-28**] growing pseudomonas and GNR; sputum on [**2132-8-11**], [**2132-8-15**], [**2132-8-20**] growing pseudomonas and GNR; sacral decubitus ulcer swab on [**2132-8-21**] growing GNR, Pseudomonas, coag positive staph aureus, and klebsiella; sputum culture on [**2132-8-26**] and [**2132-8-27**] growing Klebsiella, Pseudomonas; blood culture on [**2132-8-29**] growing enterococcus faecium (VRE but sensitive to linezolid).
Patient has been treated with tobramycin and zosyn for double coverage of pseudomonas in sacral decubitus ulcers, linezolid for MRSA and VRE, and levofloxacin for chronic aortic abscess with serratia.
Patient also with hx of aortic annular abscess with serratia and ?
of endocarditis at [**Location (un) 5871**] and is chronically treated with levoquin.
Vasc surgery recommended amputation with BKA due to gangrneous toes bilaterally.
Pt had a recurrent episode of VRE in her blood and a PNA with psuedomonas and klesiella.
# Lethargy: Patient with lethargy throughout her course, likely secondary to patient's sepsis.
Head CT was negative for any intracranial hemorrhage or mass.
She had her PEEP increased to 8 [**2-21**] increased pleural effusions due to volume resuscitation during bouts of sepsis/GI bleed.
Also, during her acute GI bleed, her rate was increased to help offset a lactic acidosis that occured [**2-21**] the large amounts of blood products she received.
Will likely be able to decrease her FiO2 over time after her pneumonia completely resolves.
Pt was taken off all anticoagulation due to recurrent GI bleeding.
Cardiology consulted for risk of no anticoag with mechanical valve.
Risk of thrombus is approx 10% per year, however pt had large GI bleed on any anticoagulation.
Due to liver failure, pts INR has remained elevated to 2.0 throughout admission.
# ESRD on HD: During this admission, patient was initially on hemodialysis and was converted for a short time to CVVHD.
During this admission, patient became supratherapeutic on coumadin and heparin and developed increased bleeding, including vaginal bleeding, skin tears, and sacral ulcers.
Pelvic US demonstrated thickened endometrial stripe.
Patient's coumadin and heparin drip have been held while concern for active bleeding.
Pt then had active GI bleeding and all anticoag has been held for recurrent GIB while on anticoagulation.
Pt found to have petecial lesion in residual colon, no active bleeding.
Attempted to restart anticoagulation however pt continued to have GIB when on heparin.
On one occasion, a bleeding vessel was found at the stomal site and a stitch was placed by Surgery, with no recurrent bleeding from that vessel.
# Lactic acidosis: Pt was found to be hypotensive to the 50s-60s several times during her hospital course.
This was discontinued and she was started on Daptomycin for VRE bacteremia.
# Thrombocytopenia: Pt had progressive thrombocytopenia throughout admission.
# Wound care: Pt has large sacral decub and multiple skin tears [**2-21**] skin breakdown.
# Code: already intubated, NO SHOCKS, no compressions.
