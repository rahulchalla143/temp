STUDIES [**2173-11-13**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures.
No major vascular territorial infarct is apparent.
Hypoattenuating foci are seen within the periventricular white matter consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
There is mild mucosal thickening involing the ethmiod sinuus.
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage.
Mild ethnoid sinus mucosal disease.
Lung volumes are mildly diminished.
There is atelectasis in the right upper lobe.
No definite consolidation or superimposed edema is seen.
There is atherosclerotic disease of the aorta.
No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.IMPRESSION:1.
Right upper lobe atelectasis.
[**11-15**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-14**], the area of increased opacification at the left base is somewhat less prominent on the current study, though there is some blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with pleural fluid.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old female with Dm1, ESRD on HD admitted from dialysis status post status epilepticus with multple GTC seizures, thought to be secondary to urinary tract infection, without return of mental status to [**Date Range 5348**].
The patient had 4 events in dialysis and 1 en route to the ED.
They were likely generalized tonic clonic by description, and began after 1 hour of HD.
The patient was unresponsive between events and after events.
Etiology of new onset seizure was thought to be either hemodialysis dysequilibration syndrome secondary to fluid shifts/electrolyte shifts in setting of hemodialysis or infectious etiologies given her functional immunosuppression with longstanding DM.
Of note the patient had a low grade fever and had been treated with 3 days of antibiotics for UTI and had urine with frank pus.
Vascular etiology for her seizure was thought to be less likely given her gradually increasing symptoms.
The patient had no further seizures during the hospitalization, however her mental status remained below [**Date Range 5348**] and she was oriented x1-2, able to follow simple commands but generally unable to answer complex questions, with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] ability to talk in full sentences.
No focal neurological deficits were found and she was believed to have a toxic metabolic encephalopathy as below.
The patient's delerium was likely multifactorial in etiology- a combination of infection, being post-ictal, poor glucose control and poor blood pressure control.
The duration of symptoms were felt too long to be merely post-ictal.
The patient was treated for UTI as above, though her symptoms persisted.
Her blood sugars have varied widely and she had one episode where she was briefly unresponsive due to hypoglycemia.
Her MS may was sometimes observed to improve after HD, suggesting her symptoms could be related to toxic build up from renal failure.
3.DM1 -poor glucose control- The patient has DM complicated by triopathy.
She had low BS in the MICU due to poor po intake and was put on a D5W gtt until tube feeds were started [**11-15**] and she was given 3u lantus daily.
On [**11-18**] the patient was hyperglycemic, which was likely due to increased po intake.
It was thought that perhaps the insulin remained in her system due to renal failure.
Due to continued issues with hypoglycemia this was changed to 3u qhs.
On [**11-22**] she "triggered" for unresponsiveness with a FS of 34.
CAD  The patient was continued on ASA, statin, BB.
No active signs of ischemia, no chest pain were noted.
HTN - The patient's HCTZ was discontinued and her metoprolol was gradually titrated up to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] as she was persistently hypertensive to SBPs in 170s, occasionally requiring IV hydralizine.
No active surgical issues were identified, but they recommended to follow up in clinic.
The diet was corrected and the diarrhea resolved but then on [**11-25**] she had 8 loose bowel movements.
She was afebrile, had [**Male First Name (un) **] leukocytosis and test for c. diff toxin was negative.
During her last week if hospitalization she had a few documented guaiac + stools without frank blood or change in color (brown) of her stool.
FEN: As above, tube feeds were started on [**11-15**] for poor po intake.
It is recommended that once her MS improves she have a repeat speech and swallow evaluation as she may be able to be advanced further with increased alertness and attention.
She is not on a renal diet right now due to low phosphate levels.
She is getting banana flakes to add bulk to her stools as she has had some loose stools.
The patient need hemodialysis and is currently on a T, Th, Sat schedule.
Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizures 3.
Peripheral vascular disease (dry gangrene of Right 3rd toe).
Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on hemodialysis.
Hypertension 5.
Confused mental status, often oriented to person only, sometimes to place, much decreased from [**Hospital1 5348**].
Had some diarrhea yesterday, appears to be resolving today with banana flakes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you had several seizures while at your hemodialysis center.
You were evaluated by neurologists who felt your seizures were due to a urinary tract infection.
We treated your urinary tract infection with 7 days of antibiotics.
You remained quite confused during your hospitalization and this was felt by the neurologists to be due to your multiple medical problems, including infection, poor blood sugar control, and problems with your blood pressure.
They felt you would benefit from increased stimulation and rehabilitation.
For your diabetes and blood sugar management we consulted endocrinologists from [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes center, who made changes to your insulin regimen.
During the course of hospitalization you had several episodes of hypoglycemia that was thought to be exacerbated by your poor diet intake but once you were eating better your blood sugars stabilized.
Please go to your follow up appointment at [**Last Name (un) **] to ensure close monitoring of your blood sugar control.
We made changes to your hypertension medications and also managed your blood pressure with dialysis, which brought your blood pressure under  better control.
During your stay you had evidence of blood in your stools (guaiac positive).
Please call your doctor or come to the hospital if you lose consciousness, have a seizure, feel light-headed, chest pain, shortness of breath, develop a fever, or develop any other concerning symptoms.
