ABG done at rehab showed marked hypercarbia (pCO2 100) and patient was referred urgently to the ED.
In the Emergency Department, patient was intubated for presumed hypercarbic respiratory failure.
CXR did not show any acute changes from ED visit 3 days prior (he had presented to ED on [**2142-7-10**] with dyspnea, respiratory status had returned to baseline, CXR was unchanged, and labs did not reveal leukocytosis).

Pertinent Results: IMAGING: Head CT [**7-13**]: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
No major vascular territorial infarct is identified.
There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with age-related involutional change.
Mild periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is consistent with microvascular ischemia.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Calcified lymphadenopathy within the mediastinum is also unchanged.
There is persistent bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
Persistent bibasilar atelectasis.
CXR: [**7-15**]: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-29**] through [**7-14**]:  Atelectasis at the base of the left lung has improved.
Small left pleural effusion persists.
No pneumothorax.
SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]M hx aspiration PNA, Parkinsons disease, who p/w unresponsive episode, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure .
# HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with several recent admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to recurrent aspiration events in setting of neuromuscular disease/Parkisons, which is presumed to contribute to chronic CO2 retention.
Furthermore patient has restrictive lung disease.
Pt was intubated for several days with notable secretions.
Respiratory failure in this event was due to multifactorial issues-mucous plugging with excessive secretions, myositis/muscular weakness from Parkinson's disease and mental status changes/lethargy from hypercarbia.
He had a cuff leak, which was discussed with IP service, if his oxygenation and ventilation are good, then will tolerate the leak.
# UNRESPONSIVE EVENT: Per wife pt gets very obtunded when his CO2 levels increase, his lethargy and unresponsiveness corresponded with significant hypercarbia.
His Head CT was negative for bleed, neuro exam was not remarkable for gross neurologic insult .
ID: Line Infection--Pt was noted to have coag neg staph on 2 blood cultures from [**7-13**] 2 bottled from femoral line that was placed in the ED.
Bradycardia: Patient with multiple types of AV delay, but per EP does not have Mobitz type II and does not meet criteria for pacemaker placement.
Of note, patient does not have hypotenision with bradycardia.
# PARKISONS DISEASE: He was continued on his outpatient medication regimen of Mirapex, Sinemet, Entacapone .
# HTN: His anti-hypertensives were held and BP well-controlled, some BP decrease while under sedation which resolved when sedation was removed.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup [**Month/Day (2) **]: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every  8 hours) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Return to the emergency room if you have fevers, have difficulty breathing, have bleeding around your tracheostomy.
