Transferred vis [**Location (un) 7622**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for further trauma care.
Status post fall from 45 feet one week ago.
FINDINGS: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures is apparent.
Left orbital floor fracture is again demonstrated with both mucosal thickening and persistent hemorrhage in the left maxillary sinus.
There is redemonstration of a 3 by 7mm right ethmoid sinus osteoma as well as mild- moderate bilateral ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.
There has been interval reduction in soft tissue swelling over the left orbit and left frontal region.
IMPRESSION:  Aside from decrease in swelling over the left frontal region, there has been minimal interval change.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no pleural abnormality or free subdiaphragmatic gas.

study needs to be done this PM, prior t  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 33 year old man with communite frmur fracture.
Preop for IVC filter REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: rule out bilat DVT.
thanks CLINICAL HISTORY: Patient with comminuted femur fracture with high risk for DVT.
STUDY: Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound.
FINDINGS:  The study is markedly limited secondary to patient's recent surgeries and surgical staples obscuring the ultrasound field.
No DVT within these portions of the veins.
The distal right superficial femoral vein and popliteal veins are incompletely evaluated, secondary to the patient's condition and while there is color Doppler flow seen within these, they are incompletely assessed.
No clot within the left common femoral vein.
More peripherally, the superficial femoral veins and popliteal vein cannot be assessed secondary to patient's condition.
There is extensive subcutaneous edema within the extremities bilaterally, and there is subcutaneous hemorrhage within the left groin.
Markedly limited study secondary to patient's condition.
No DVT within bilateral common femoral veins.
Right central portions of the superficial femoral vein are without DVT.
Incomplete assessment of the remainder of the veins of the right and left lower extremity.
Removal of external fixator of the left femur.
He now presents for staged procedure, involving removal of the left external fixator and replacement with intramedullary nailing and staged debridement of his open wound.
The piriformis entry fossa was located through a small incision with a K-wire.
A guidewire with a Beaver tip was inserted and the fracture was reduced over the guidewire and then over reamed to a 12.5 mm size in order to accept an 11 mm x 420 mm nail.
It was inserted without difficulty.
Subsequently, it was tapped anteriorly and cut distally in order to restore length and then locked proximally using an alignment jig.
The final contour was found to be satisfactory in range of motion, stability and ligaments as well as rotation alignment.
The wound was aggressively irrigated with pulsed lavaged solution times 6 liters.
Necrotic edges were debrided down to the level of the condyles.
The wound was then closed with isolated nylon stitches of the 2-0 variety.
PROCEDURE:  Closed reduction, left femoral comminuted fracture under traction and placement of external fixator, multiplane.
He sustained a multi-trauma including a left femoral fracture which was significant, comminuted and closed.
This was a comminuted multi-segmented shaft fracture.
In order to facilitate rapid intervention by the vascular service, I decided to perform an external fixator on this leg and do a delayed intramedullary nailing.
I, therefore, proceeded to reduce the fracture with traction.
The fracture was reduced, and the external fixator was tightened.
During assessment of the left lower extremity, it was noted that the left knee was also posteriorly unstable, possibly indicating ligamentous injury.
Orthopedics was immediately consulted because of his injuries.
He was taken to the operating room for repair of his orthopedic injuries (see operative notes).
Ophthalmology was consulted because of his orbital blowout fracture on left; no operative intervention; he will need to follow up with Ophthalmology after discharge.
During the course of his hospital stay, pt developed fevers and an elevated WBC count.
His urine culture grew out pan-sensitive ecoli and he was treated with Cipro.
Also, pt developed an ~7cm hematoma at his proximal medial L thigh which was evacuated, packed with W->D dressings [**Hospital1 **], and allowed to heal by secondary intention.
Repeat head CTs were negative, and an MRI showed no cause for this mental status.
He experienced significant neuropathic pain with this, and the Chronic Pain Service was consulted.
An appropriate regimen of medications was prescribed and the patient's pain improved significantly.
