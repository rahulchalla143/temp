Admission Date:  [**2138-8-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-8-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: found unresponsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Patient is an 83 yo F with a history of COPD, ventilator dependence who was found today at rehab to be off the ventilator.
CPR was initiated (though no documented loss of pulse) and patient was reattached to the ventilator.
Records are limited but report that the patient was unresponsive and possibly hypoxic (though numbers not documented).
On arrival to the ED she had Sinus brady at 50 BP 132/22 rr 20 100% In the ED the patient was found to have altered mental status (unclear baseline) as well as a leukocytosis and CXR concerning for pneumonia.
Anemia - on Aranep; iron studies from [**2137-2-22**] c/w AOCD.
no UPEP sent.
L hiatal hernia 3.
HTN 5.
CAD: h/o MI; no recoerds availble; EF unknown 6. h/o GIB 7.
Diverticulosis 8. h/o MSSA 9. chronic asthma 10.
History of admissions Altered MS in the setting of overmedication and PNA: Pseudomonas and MSSA in sputum (no infiltrate on CXR; no leukocytosis) 11.
Single Lead Guidant Meridien Pacemaker [**12/2137**] for symptomatic bradycardia   Social History: Lives at [**Location 28105**], no h/o tobacco, no etoh, no ivdu.
At baseline needs assistance to commode  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: PE: (last wt at rehab 205.7) Gen: obese woman in no acute distress with trach in place and attached to ventilator HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, no LAD CV: RRR no murmurs Lungs: coarse breath sounds throughout, occasional wheezing, with rhonchi centrally, trach in place Abd: soft, diffusely tender, ND, + BS, per ED guaiac + and negative Ext: moving all 4 extremities equally, good 2+ pulses in all four extremities, trace edema bilaterally Neuro/psych: Would not tolerate plantar reflexes, UE 2+ biceps reflexes.
FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the normally midline structures or major vascular territorial infarct.
Mild periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
There is opacification of the left mastoid air cells without osseous destruction.
Opacification of the left mastoid air cells.
No hemorrhage or mass effect.
Suboptimal  image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor apical  views.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to position.
Conclusions: The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low  normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior  walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No  aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
RENAL Ultrasound: PORTABLE RENAL ULTRASOUND  INDICATION: 83-year-old woman with acute renal failure.
FINDINGS: The bedside study is markedly limited by patient's body habitus and inability to cooperate.
No hydronephrosis is detected on these limited views.
Several simple cysts.
Persistent elevated left hemidiaphragm.
Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
Persistent vascular congestion and multifocal airspace opacity predominantly in the lower lobes.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged radiographic chest; likely mild CHF and multifocal pneumonia.
SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON REQUEST..          OF TWO COLONIAL MORPHOLOGIES.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo F with chronic ventilator dependence secondary to COPD who presents after being found unresponsive.
However, per report was difficult to arouse when off the ventilator, suggesting likely hypoxia secondary to difficulty mentating.
Additionally, though patient may have an element of infection that may be causing some mild encephalopathy.
No other signs of unresponsiveness while hospitalized.
Pneumonia: No increased ventilator requirements, but did have questionable infiltrate on CXR and secretions concerning for infection.
Sputum cultures showed MSSA and Acinetobacter that were resistent to cipro.
COPD/ vent dependence/Asthma: Patient has chronic history of vent dependence.
Cardiac: - Pump: Echocardiogram showed low normal EF with regional wall motion abnormalities likely consistent with known CAD and MI.
No echo was available - CAD: has history of CAD by report and an MI at another hosptital.
- has enzyme leak, but does have last trop .11 and worsening renal function.
No signs of acute coronary syntrome.
- Rhythm: from ECG and cxr it appears that the patien thas a single lead in the ventricle.
From [**Hospital1 2177**] records, it appears that the pacer was placed for persistent bradycardia.
Ok to start beta-blocker for risk reduction given that the patient has a pacemaker for a back-up rate.
Acute renal failure: has elevation of creatinine up from baseline.
Cause is unclear as to her current worsening of renal failure.
Initial labs showed a picture more consistent with pre-renal etiology (FeNA 0.5%) but now showed intrarenal causes (FeNA 1.2%).
Urinalysis did not show signs of overwhelming ATN, though the patient may have had some mild hypoperfusion/hypoxia surronding the unresponsive episode.
Does have known history of diverticulosis/itis and this could be cause of trace guaiac positive stools.
Patient had decreased hct to 25 at time of discharge.
However, a repeat hct was stable and the patient did not have signs of ongoing bleeding.
Hypertension: Hypertensive in ED, but BP range from 100s to 180s in ICU initially.
However, hydralazine was restarted at a lower dose given initial low bp as well as desire to start metoprolol XL for risk reduction given known CAD.
Anemia: per report, has anemia of chronic disease.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 671**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Acute renal failure COPD with chronic ventilator dependence Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: improved respiratory status   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after being found unresponsive.
While at [**Hospital1 18**] you were diagnosed with pneumonia and worsening renal function.
