Respiratory: [**Known lastname 51266**] required treatment for his respiratory distress with intubation and surfactant.
He remains in room air and his last apnea and bradycardia were on [**2102-8-1**].
It was thought possibly to be related to his anemia at the time.
No murmur has been noted at this time and he has maintained normal blood pressures and heart rates during his hospitalization.
On day of life number four he presented with bloody stools and again was made n.p.o.
Enteral feedings were again tried on day of life number 20 but discontinued when signs of possible gastrointestinal obstruction arose.
At that time a barium enema showed a stricture at the splenic flexure and he was transported to [**Hospital3 1810**] on [**2102-8-4**] and underwent surgery for colonic resection at the splenic flexure.
Gastrointestinal:  As mentioned, [**Known lastname 51266**] presented with symptoms of necrotizing enterocolitis on day of life number four, manifested by bloody stools and hematological results.
On day of life number 25, [**2102-8-2**], he presented with symptoms of possible gastrointestinal obstruction with abnormal bowel gas pattern on abdominal x-ray.
A lower GI series was performed on [**2102-8-3**] and revealed a stricture at the splenic flexure.
No signs or symptoms of obstruction were noted.
[**Known lastname 51266**] also required treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
On day of life number five when he initially presented with symptoms of necrotizing enterocolitis, his white blood cell count dropped to 3,100 and showed a significant shift with differential of 4% polys, 13% bands, 2 metamyelocytes, and 2 myelocytes.
With the onset of his GI symptoms on day of life number four he was again cultured and started on ampicillin and gentamicin.
On day of life number five, clindamycin was added due to concern for necrotizing enterocolitis.
The blood culture was no growth.
On [**2102-8-2**], he again presented with symptoms of possible gastrointestinal obstruction.
