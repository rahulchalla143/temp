Admission Date:  [**2112-6-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-7-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-3-4**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICAL ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 66 year old female who presented with light-headedness, dizziness, hematemesis, to an outside hospital on [**2112-6-6**], and was found to have a hematocrit of 15.0 and workup was consistent with an upper gastrointestinal bleed.
At the outside hospital, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2112-6-6**], which revealed grade IV esophagitis, bleeding ulcer 3.0 centimeters proximal to the gastroesophageal junction and this bleeding ulcer was cauterized and injected.
At the outside hospital, the patient continued to bleed actively with falling hematocrit and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy two more times.
On [**2112-6-7**], esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a spurting visible vessel in the distal esophagus and 9cc of Epinephrine were injected.
On [**2112-6-8**], esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed old blood in the fundus and the distal esophagus was injected a third time.
At the outside hospital, the patient was intubated for airway protection as she was noted to have hematemesis with likely aspiration.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2112-6-11**], for further management of her upper gastrointestinal bleed and respiratory status.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, in general, the patient is an obese woman, intubated and sedated.
Heart - regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs - decreased breath sounds bilateral lower lobes, coarse upper airway sounds.
Extremities - 2+ pulses throughout, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
The patient did not require a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy and she remained guaiac negative with no signs or symptoms of active bleed.
Respiratory distress - The patient was transferred here intubated and sedated.
The patient was difficult to wean from the ventilator likely due to a combination of bilateral atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, pneumonia, pulmonary edema.
The patient also was found to have a right pneumothorax on [**2112-6-17**].
Likely, it was a side effect of being intubated on the ventilator as well as due to underlying chronic lung disease.
The patient's bilateral pleural effusions were decreased with diuresis as well as on the right side with the placement of the chest tube.
Right pleural fluid was serosanguinous with 400 white blood cells, 50% polys, total protein 2.9, glucose 107, LDH 515, gram stain negative.
The patient was started on Ceftriaxone on [**2112-6-17**], for her left lower lobe consolidation as well as spiking fever.
On [**2112-6-19**], the patient's pleural fluid and the blood culture bottle was positive for gram positive cocci.
The patient was afebrile and continued on the Ceftriaxone.
On [**2112-6-22**], the patient was switched from Ceftriaxone after five days to Ceftazidime and Vancomycin for increased white blood cell count and fever to 102 degrees with continued left lower lobe consolidation.
These antibiotics were chosen to cover broadly for pneumonia pathogens including pseudomonas as well as hospital line infection from her central line.
On [**2112-6-22**], chest x-ray showed increased pulmonary edema, and the patient was clinically with crackles bilaterally in the lungs two thirds of the way up.
The patient responded very well to diuresis and pulmonary edema decreased significantly.
On [**2112-6-27**], Vancomycin and Ceftazidime were discontinued as the patient had received six days of these antibiotics as well as five days of Ceftriaxone and was clinically stable with no signs or symptoms of infection.
Head CT on [**2112-6-26**], was negative for an acute process.
The patient also received Ativan 2 mg once for agitation with good effect.
The patient's mental status changes were gradually improved on a daily basis and by [**2112-6-29**], she was conversant and appropriate.
The patient was not yet back to her high baseline mental status, but no further workup was deemed necessary.
The patient's mental status changes were thought to be due to the fact that she was intubated for several weeks, on Propofol.
Also, in the Intensive Care Unit setting, the patient was likely very sleep deprived, contributing to somnolence and agitation intermittently.
Cardiovascular - The patient with no known cardiac history but with pulmonary edema which contributed to difficulty to wean from ventilator as well as from oxygen after extubation.
Echocardiogram on [**2112-6-22**], revealed a mildly dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, normal left ventricular wall motion, hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, ejection fraction of greater than 75%, right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion normal.
No pericardial effusion.
Another important factor contributing to the patient's systolic blood pressure and heart rate elevation was anxiety and agitation as mentioned above.
The patient's cardiac vital signs also stabilized as her agitation decreased and her mental status improved.
The patient denied any abdominal pain at this time or other symptoms.
Also found mild ascites and bilateral pleural effusions persisting.
The patient was diuresed throughout the second half of her hospital stay due to pulmonary edema with good effect.
Access - The patient had a left subclavian central line which was eventually removed on [**2112-6-27**], as the patient no longer needed to receive medications via the line.
Esophageal ulcer.
