The patient had positive loss of consciousness with no recall of the events.
Upon arrival, he was complaining of face pain, neck pain and shoulder pain.
He denied any headache, chest pain or shortness of breath.
He also had epistaxis of bilateral nares with a right eyelid significant swelling.
His initial trauma evaluation revealed that he sustained fractures of the nasal bones as well as the spleen, of C4 and 5 cervical spine with anterior widening of the fracture of the right facet joint.
At that time, he was denying blurry vision, numbness, weakness, tingling or any other neurological symptoms.
He was electively intubated on [**4-15**] due to oropharyngeal bleeding and high risk of aspiration with initiation of a Propofol drip for sedation at that time.
He was noticed to have a rise in his creatinine and while awaiting cardiac clearance and a renal consultation, the patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit.
Status post brachy therapy.
History of breast cancer status post left mastectomy.
He underwent ablation for supraventricular tachycardia on [**2194-3-19**], for an atypical nodal re-entry.
The patient had a history of distant appendectomy.
ALLERGIES:   The patient had no known drug allergies.
He was noted to have a laceration on the left side of the nose, hematoma in the right upper and lower eyelids, bleeding from the nose more on the right than the left side, bruise on the left eye, with no bleeding.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, no scars.
Back showed no step-offs, no tenderness to palpation.
The cervical spine, as stated above, showed a C4-5 sprain injury.
Pelvis showed no fractures.
A head CT scan showed a left temporal lobe subarachnoid hemorrhage with a question of a small subdural hematoma in the right temporal region.
There was a right nasal bone fracture.
The chest CT scan and the abdomen shows some degenerative joint disease of the thoracic spine and pleural thickening, otherwise the rest of the scans were unremarkable.
This included an open reduction of a hyperextension injury followed by a C4-5 ALDF with a fibula allograft and ventral screw plate fixation.
His postoperative course was complicated by a peri-operative myocardial infarction with a high troponin and supraventricular tachycardia that required cardioversion.
He was not spiking fevers and we tried to wean him off the ventilatory support.
On this effort, he was aggressively diuresed since he was very positive after the surgery.
The patient failed T-piece trials, especially due to the increased bronchial secretions and it was decided clinically at that time to place a tracheostomy.
He remained afebrile with moderately elevated white count in the 15,000.
He continued to have massive amount of secretions requiring suctioning from the nursing staff fairly frequently.
Over the course of the next couple of days, he was bronchoscoped multiple times and on the 10th, a bronchial alveolar lavage sample was sent to Microbiology and finally came positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Around this time, when the patient continued having increased bronchial secretions, he had sporadic events of cardiac arrhythmias presenting as supraventricular tachycardia to the 130s, always maintaining good blood pressure.
He is Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive.
