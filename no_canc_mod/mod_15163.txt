Admission Date:  [**2149-12-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2150-1-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2081-12-1**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old male with a six to seven week history of exertional chest pressure relieved by rest.
The patient has had no previous history of coronary artery disease, nor any angina.
He has no associated nausea or vomiting.
The patient was then transferred emergently to [**Hospital1 188**] for emergent catheterization after a positive stress test.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, no edema.
No history of transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident.
No claudication.
No gastrointestinal bleeding.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile and vital signs are stable.
His heart is regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur.
The patient had a palpable left femoral pulse, bilateral popliteals, bilateral dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses and bilateral radial pulses.
Carotids had no bruits.
Lower extremities showed no varicosities.
He was without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Postoperatively, the patient was a number of drips including Neo-Synephrine, Milrinone and Amiodarone for intraoperative atrial fibrillation.
While in the unit, the patient had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation which were poorly tolerated hemodynamically.
The patient was heparinized for his atrial fibrillation.
He was also placed on Plavix due to poor bypass targets.
He was also diuresed using Lasix and placed on Captopril for afterload control.
After his initial Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient no longer had any hemodynamic compromise from his atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day six, the patient fell getting out of bed as he was unstable on his feet and confused.
After the fall, he did not have any sequelae.
He did not have any change of mental status as a result of the fall.
The patient was, however, closely monitored for any neurological changes.
It was initially the plan to send the patient to a rehabilitation facility, however, the length of time that it took to get the patient therapeutic on Coumadin and off his Heparin, as well as a newly developing cellulitis at his vein donor site, lengthened the patient's stay in the hospital, allowing him to become more independent from a physical standpoint.
As noted, the patient did develop erythema of his donor site.
After a couple days of treatment with Kefzol, the patient had Clindamycin added to his antibiotic regimen which did cause a decrease in erythema and improvement in his cellulitis.
