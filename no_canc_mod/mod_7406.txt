Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Chest: Small hematoma over Left clavicle, ?site of previous line attempt CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
+systolic murmur II/VI at LUSB.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: Femoral catheter in place, No femoral bruits, RUE diffusely swollen in compression stocking, trace b/l LE edema.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
EKG: Pre-procedure, junctional rhythm at 40 bpm, with ST elevations in II, III, aVF, V3-V6, ST depressions in V2, TWI V3-V6.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated single (1) vessel coronary artery disease.
The left anterior descending artery demonstrated a proximal 30% lesion with TIMI III flow distal to the lesion.
The left circumflex demonstrated no significant disease.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA comments).
Pt presented in cardiogenic shock - hypotensive despite multiple pressor support.
Right heart cardiac catheterization following successful PCI demonstrated elevated right (RVEDP=23mm Hg) and left (mean PCWP=28mm Hg) heart filling pressures.
During the case the patient had several episodes of atrial flutter (150 bpm) treated with amiodarone and lopressor.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with a bare metal stent.
Junctional escape rhythm followed by atrial flutter.
Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with a Mynx closure device.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2148-9-13**]): Mild scoliosis and rotation of the patient limit the evaluation of the left hilum.
Left lower lobe and perihilar alveolar opacities may be due to atelectasis, less likely aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is a 76 year-old woman with history of DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents in cardiogenic shock with an inferior STEMI complicated by bradycardia and hypotension.
At time of transfer to the CCU, she was chest pain free and remained chest pain free for remainder of her hospital stay.
.. # PUMP: Her EF was unknown at time of admission; during the cath, her elevated RAP and wedge were consistent with left heart failure and cardiogenic shock.
An echo on HD 1 showed a preserved LVEF of 70%; however, there was right ventricular cavity dilatation with depressed free wall contractility and possible posterior wall hypokinesis.
# RHYTHM:  She presented in sinus bradycardia (initially she was noted to be in a junctional escape rhythm per the EMS records), all consistent with a right-sided infarct involving the SA and AV nodal conduction systems.
However, on HD 1 she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation and thus she was started on metoprolol and heparin drip.
Because she was symptomatic from the AF, experiencing subjective palpitations (but no chest pain, light-headedness or dizziness), we decided to also start amiodorone with the goal to chemically cardiovert her back to normal sinus.
At time of discharge the patient was in normal sinus rhythm and had been in NSR for approximately 3 days on telemetry with occasional sinus tachycardia with exertion and rare PVCs.
She had diffuse ecchymoses at time of admission from venipuncture and central line trauma in the setting of antiplatelet therapy for ACS.
We suspected that her anemia was due to bleeding as well as marrow suppression given her acute inflammatory state.
Haptoglobin was elevated and bilirubin WNL making hemolytic process unlikely.
The patient's hematocrit continued to have mild suboptimal range during hospitalization and she was found to have a guiac positive stool prior to discharge.
Last Hct prior to discharge was 24.9 and patient was hemodynamically stable without any complaints of abdominal pain or distension.
.. # NAUSEA / VOMITING:  This was treated with Zofran prn and the patient's GI symptoms had abated by the time of her discharge.
While hospitalized, we continued her on RISS and patient will plan to restart her prior metformin and glyburide and Januvia medications.
She was anticoagulated on heparin drip and switched to Lovenox as a bridge to coumadin; thus there was no need for DVT prophylaxis.
PPI was used to treat her GERD and also as GI prophylaxis.
