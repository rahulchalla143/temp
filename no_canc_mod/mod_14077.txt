She was diagnosed with myasthenia and placed on prednisone in 10/[**2195**].
Her symptoms, at the time, included mostly weakness of the upper and lower extremities and initially episodes of double vision and some dysphagia.
Since starting the medical therapy, she has had no double vision or dysphagia but has been having worsening weakness of her upper and lower extremities with a tendency to drop items that she picks up.
She was seen by another surgeon at the [**Hospital3 **] who felt that a surgical resection was not indicated, particularly given her obesity and high dose steroids and the potentially limited beneficial effects for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
She presented to me for a second opinion and our evaluation found a thymoma within the thymus.
Therefore, she had to have a resection for oncological purposes.
