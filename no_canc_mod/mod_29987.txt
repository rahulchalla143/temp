Plan was for protate US to look for prostatic ascess.
On [**4-1**] while on the floor the patient developed hypotension and an acute change in mental status.
Pt was non-verbal with verbal baseline.
He was transferred to the MICU with a diagnosis of septic shock  EKG was unchanged from prior.
Of note patient was unable to complete dialysis (0.5L off) the day prior to transfer secondary to hypotension.
Possible sources of infection included GU tract given purulent penile discharge on admission or abdominal source given distention and colonic dilitation seen on plain films.
Given the abdominal distention surgery was consulted for concern for ischemic colitis.
Over the course of the next 24 hours in the ICU the patient's condition continued to worsen with progressive hypotension and the patient became unresponsive.
Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5-500 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO  [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for back pain.
