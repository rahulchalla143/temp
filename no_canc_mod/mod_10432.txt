The patient was recently admitted in [**Month (only) 404**] when she was first diagnosed with Factor [**Month (only) 7060**] inhibitor with a severe left thigh hematoma which required subsequent fasciotomy.
Her hospital course at that time was complicated by epistaxis and a shoulder hematoma.
On the day of admission, the patient presented with a new left thigh hematoma.
The patient states that she has no recollection of thigh trauma or injury but just noticed on the day prior to admission the evidence of bruising.
Over the day of admission she developed more pain in the leg and noted increase in the amount of bruising and called her physician who told her to come to the hospital.
On admission the patient was complaining of severe left leg pain but denied bright red blood per rectum, melena, hematemesis or nausea or vomiting.
Factor [**Year (4 digits) 7060**] inhibitor acquired, likely related to rheumatoid arthritis, suffering from recurrent bleeding as stated above, initially diagnosed in [**2115-11-27**] when she presented with left thigh bruising and hematoma.
She was hospitalized from [**2116-1-8**] to [**2116-2-5**] for complications of this left thigh hematoma after an intertrochanteric steroid injection.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 64 year old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and a quiet Factor [**Month (only) 7060**] inhibitor diagnosed earlier this year who presents with her second left thigh hematoma.
The patient's bleeding in the absence of trauma was presumed to be due to her Factor [**Month (only) 7060**] inhibitor, despite her relatively elevated Factor [**Name (NI) 7060**] level and PTT with respect to her prior hospital values.
6 to 8 hours and to follow the size of her hematoma and her distal pulses.
The elevated heartrate was likely a combination of pain related to the left thigh bleeding but also with the hypotension likely reflected volume depletion.
As the patient was symptomatic with hypotension and some lightheadedness it was decided to transfuse the patient with 1 unit of packed red cells.
Prednisone and Cyclophosphamide which is both for her rheumatoid arthritis and acquired Factor [**Name (NI) 7060**] inhibitor, she was initially given as stated above Factor VII, q.
Her thigh hematoma was increasing in size among the medial aspect and along the posterior thigh and her leg was quite tender.
The patient continued to be normotensive even though the hematoma on her leg was expanding, there were no signs of compartment syndrome.
4 hours as her hematocrit was stable and there were no signs of bleeding.
