Over the past two days he has noted epigastric discomfort with exertion, while on the treadmill he feels this discomfort after 2-4 minutes, he then stops for 2-4 minutes and the pain subsides and he can continue again for the same amount of time.
No rest symptoms at all.
No shortness of breath prior to today.
No PND, + nocturia worsening over past few weeks.
Stable 2 pillow orthopnea, slightly worsening pedal edema over past 5 days but has been present for 4-5 years in total.
No claudication symptoms.
Syncope 5 weeks ago, seen at [**Hospital3 **] with no clear diagnosis.
Past Medical History: - Coronary artery disease - Hypertension - Diabetes Mellitus - Hyperlipidemia - Osteoporosis - Chronic renal disease  Social History: -Tobacco history: smoked in past, quit 40 years ago -ETOH: per family had "heavy" ETOH use in past, was told he has evidence of cirrhosis 30 years ago and since then continues to drink but has cut down.
RRR, [**3-14**] crescendo / decrescendo murmur @ USB, [**3-14**] HSM at apex LUNGS: Dullness at L base, rales [**3-11**] way up bilaterally symmetrical ABDOMEN: moderate distension, liver edge palpable 3cm below costal margin, no fluid wave, BS+, non tender EXTREMITIES: WWP, trace bilat pedal edema R > L  Pertinent Results: Imaging Studies: CXR: [**12-4**] - Acute CHF  CXR [**2181-12-26**]- FINDINGS: Status post reposition of the nasogastric tube.
The transparency of the lung parenchyma is increased as compared to the previous examination.
Abdominal U/S: [**12-6**] - IMPRESSION: Mildly heterogeneous echogenic liver, which may be compatible with fatty infiltration.
Please note, other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease such as hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
LENIs: [**2181-12-8**]: No DVTs  Head CT: [**2181-12-12**] - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Head CT: [**2181-12-27**] - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
Severe predominalty distal colitis, with some relative preservation of the proximal colon.
Questionable incomplete small-bowel obstruction, or ileus.
Eccentric dilatation of the portions of the sigmoid and descending colon (locations given above), which might suggest small self-contained perforation or large diverticulum.
Bilateral pleural effusion with some adjacent small basilar atelectasis, and evidence of prior asbestos exposure.
No free air in the peritoneal cavity.
Focus of eccentric dilatation of descending colon, in the left lower quadrant, with asymmetrical distribution of contrast and air and significant fat tissue stranding, which either represents acute diverticulitis or perforation realted to colitis.
There is currently no evidence of freee intraperitoneal spillage or air.
Second eccentric dilatation, which might be site of giant sigmoid diverticulum.No inflammation is seen around this and while contrast is seen within it it does not appear to represent an acute finding.
There is no small-bowel obstruction, the dilated loops of the small bowel are likely due to ileus.
Severe pancolitis-relative sparing proximally.
Bilateral pleural effusion with some adjacent small basilar atelectasis, and evidence of prior asbestos exposure.
Large amount of free air under the right hemidiaphragm.
Progressive dilatation of multiple loops of small bowel.
joint fluid: PMNs on gram stain, no organisms seen MRSA screen: neg x4 C. difficile toxin assay: + on [**12-12**], - x3 ([**12-24**], [**12-25**]/, [**12-26**])  Peritoneal wound: [**12-19**]: ENTEROCOCCUS SP.

He was transferred back to cardiology floor 8 days after surgery for management of volume overload, delerium, and acute on chronic renal failure.
NSTEMI: Patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease including HTN, HLD, and PVD.
However, his NSTEMI was thought to be due to demand ischemia from his GI bleed.
Because of his multiple risk factors and hemodynamic instability from the bleed, he was not considered a candidate for cardiac catherization.
ACE inhibitor was held in setting of his renal failure and can be restarted as an outpatient.
Troponins were stable and EKG without acute ischemic changes on discharge.
GI bleed: Patient had melanotic stools and hematocrit drop.
GI was consulted for endoscopy, but the etiology of his GI bleed (upper versus lower) was unclear as patient was deemed a high risk candidate and never underwent endoscopy.
[**Month (only) 116**] have had some component of mesenteric ischemia, given his PVD, which contributed to his colonic perforation.
Colonic perforation.
Found to be C. difficile positive and was started on PO Vancomycin, IV Flagyl, and Zosyn for broad coverage.
Serial CT abdomens on [**12-13**] was concerning for descending colon/sigmoid colitis with a contained area of perforation.
KUB showed air under the R hemidiaphraghm consistent with GI perforation.
Patient was taken emergently to surgery where he was noted to have a perforated sigmoid diverticulitis & underwent a L colectomy with end colostomy and [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch.
Patient was afebrile, leukocytosis had improved, and abdominal exam was non-surgical on discharge.
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: EF 50% with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
Patient had evidence of volume overload including elevated JVP, crackles on exam, and lower extremity edema.
He also was 8L positive after his SICU stay.
Rhythm: Patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation while in house.
No evidence of atrial fibrillation afterwards, was in NSR throughout.
CHADS score or 4 demonstrates patient needs anticoagulation, but coumadin is contraindicated in him given his recent GI bleed.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Had underlying CRI likely in setting of diabetes.
Likely pre-renal in setting of hypotension (had GIB and may have been transiently septic from colonic perforation) leading to intrarenal failure/ATN (FeUrea 50%).
Hypernatremia: Patient had mild hypernatremia likely in the setting of poor PO intake and diuresis.
Agitation: Patient had appropriate mental status prior to hospital admission, and acute developed waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status changes after his colonic perforation, consistent with delerium.
Likely multifactorial (ICU delerium, infection associated from colonic perforation and C. difficile infection, surgical pain/abdominal distension).
Other etiologies included toxic metabolic (acute on chronic renal failure without evidence of metabolic acidosis).
All head CTs without evidence of acute intracranial processes or bleed.
Neuro exam without focal abnormalities.
No evidence of bacteremia or urosepsis (blood, urine cultures all negative for growth.)
Patient was frequently re-orientated with emphasis on sleep wake cycle.
He was kept on standing tylenol 1 gm TID for pain control, which was stopped once the patient was able to mentate and say he had no pain.
Likely has PVD and renal artery stenosis.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath.
You were diagnosed with a heart attack, a GI bleed, and congestive heart failure.
You had an infection of your GI tract with a bacteria called Clostridium difficile.
You also had a perforation of your colon which required emergent surgery and removal of the L side of your colon.
Fluid Restriction: < 1500 ccs/day    The following changes were made to your medications:    STOP: Januvia, Glemiperide, Actos, Niacin  STOP: Norvasc, Hydralazine, Lopressor, and Catapress  INCREASE: Lantus from 7 U at night to 24 U at night  START: Insulin sliding scale as directed  START: Oral Vancomycin for treatment of your colon infection for the amount of time listed below.
Please return to the hospital or call your primary care physician if you experience any of the following symptoms - shortness of breath, chest pain, blood in your stools, worsening abdominal pain or distension, poor or increased drainage of your colostomy bag, poor urine output, light headedness or loss of consciousness, fevers > 101, chills, or any other symptoms not listed here that are concerning to you and warrant physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 2742**].
