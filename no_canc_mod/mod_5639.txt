FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED  [**2132-2-20**] 3:58 am BLOOD CULTURE Negative Pending x 1 Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2132-2-11**]):    NO GROWTH x 2   Brief Hospital Course: 64 y/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia presents with acute respiratory failure.
# Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
His ventilator settings were managed to allow permissive hypercapnea, and remained stable but without improvement.
The differential for the trigger for his asthma exacerbation was broadened, and a mini-BAL was performed on [**2-10**] with sample sent for fungal culture and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 23426**].
# Steroid Prophylaxis: After discussion with Pulmonary prior to discharge pt was started on PCP prophylaxis with Bactrim as well as Calcium and Vitamin D.  # Demand ischemia:  During admission pt was noted to have an elevated Troponin level of 0.16 (which trended down) with negative CK and CK MBs.
# GIB: During his ICU stay the pt was noted to have BRBPR.
# Myopathy: After extubation, the pt had a profound muscle weakness, possibly related to steroids.
# Hypertension: Pt has a history of hypertension for which prior to discharge he was maintained on Cardizem 30mg four times a day.
# Oral Candidasis: Pt was noted to have oral candidiasis was started on Nystatin swish and swallow.

Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) neb Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Asthma Exacerbation Secondary: Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to this hospital after having an asthma exacerbation that required you to be on a ventilator.
