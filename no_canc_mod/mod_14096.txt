Admission Date:  [**2130-1-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-2-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-10-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: Right sided weakness.
Noted her to have no facial droop but weakness in right grip and leg.
In the ED notes, she denied headache, speech disturbance, visual disturbance.
CT scan of her head demonstrated a 2.2x1.8 left thalamic hemorrhage with extension into the left lateral ventricle.
No blood in third ventricle.
Hypertension 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
No masses or LAD.
No thyromegaly.
No carotid bruits.
No rebound or guarding.
Neuro: Mental Status: Intubated, sedated on [**Hospital1 **] (attempted to have nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] but patient became agitated and was fighting vent.
III, IV, VI: No oculocephalic reflexes.
V, VII: No corneal reflexes.
Motor: Increased tone bilateral lower extremities.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     2 2 2  4  4 Left      3 3 3  4  4  With left upper extremity brisker than right.
Several beats of clonus at ankles bilaterally.
There is minimal shift of the midline structures, but the basal cisterns remain patent.
A mild degree of expansion of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is seen.
Tiny hypodensities in the cerebellum and cerebral periventricular white matter are probably microvascualr infarctions.
No extra- axial fluid collection is noted.
IMPRESSION: Left thalamic bleed with extension into the lateral ventricle, exerting mass effect causing minimal shift of the midline structures.
No herniation seen.
----- Non-contrast Head CT [**2130-1-26**]: There has been no significant interval change in the left thalamic hemorrahge with extension of blood to the left lateral ventricle.
The ventricles are stable in size since the prior examination with mild dilatation of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are again noted consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
No new areas of hemorrhage are demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of large left thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and mild left to right shift of midline structures.
Stable appearance of ventricles with mild dilatation of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
----- Non-contrast Head CT [**2130-1-28**]: FINDINGS: The left thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension is unchanged in size.
Mild rightward shift of normally midline structures is unchanged.
The periventricular white matter hyperdensities are again seen, consistent with chronic microvascular infarctions.
There is a new fluid level in the left sphenoid sinus.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus and moderate mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells bilaterally.
The right-sided ventricular drain is still in place, however, in the interval, there is increased intraparenchymal hemorrhage around the drain, especially in the right frontal region.
Mild rightward shift of the septum pellucidum is seen, which is stable.
Cerebral periventricular white matter changes are stable.
IMPRESSION: Increased intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe around ventricular drain.
-----   Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 72 year old female with past medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia who presented as transfer from [**Hospital6 3426**] after developing acute onset right sided weakness around 11am on [**2130-1-25**].
Head CT demonstrates 3 cm left thalamic hyperdensity with extension into left lateral ventricle.
Bowel regimen was ordered to avoid straining and increased intracranial hemorrhage.
Post drain placement, CT scan demonstrated hemorrhage around the drain track in the right frontal lobe.
Follow up head CT on [**2130-2-3**] showed stable size of ventricles and hemorrhage.
Sputum sample on [**2130-1-27**] demonstrated Streptococcus pneumoniae.
From a cardiac standpoint, she ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
Due to mental status, patient was not a candidate for oral feeding.
Has increased tone in both legs and right upper extremity.
Hyperreflexia in bilateral legs (4+) with clonus at ankles, hyperreflexia right upper extremity (4+) and left upper extremity (3+).
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Left thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, likely secondary to hypertension 2.
Hypertension 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Has increased tone in both legs and right upper extremity.
Hyperreflexia in bilateral legs (4+) with clonus at ankles, hyperreflexia right upper extremity (4+) and left upper extremity (3+).
