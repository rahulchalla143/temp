Her hospital course was complicated by frequent episodes of AVnRT (started on diltiazem), community acquired pneumonia (completed course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone), and C. difficile colitis (started on metronidazole).
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] for worsening shortness of breath, bilateral shoulder and neck pain X2 days.
On ultrasound in clinic, she had a small pericardial effusion but generally poor "squeeze" concerning for congestive heart failure.
In the ED, initial vital signs were pain T 97.7, HR 114, BP 114/77, RR 17, O2 sat 97%.
Exam was negative for friction rub, jugular venous distension, distant heart sounds.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was resting more comfortably in bed with no complaints.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Family History: Father died of MI at age 59.
Brother had an MI at 61.
+ for osteoporosis in mother, but no hip fractures or family history of hypercalcemia.
Mood and affect appropriate - slightly anxious.
Sclera anicteric.
Neck: Soft, supple without JVD CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
No wheezing/rhonchi/rales but mild left basilar crackles.
No HSM or tenderness.
Scattered ecchymosis of bilateral upper extremities.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, or xanthomas.
Pulses:  Right: DP 2+ PT 2+  ; Left: DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: ECG: Sinus tachycardia, low voltage, no electrical alternans.
CXR (my read):  Significant left costophrenic angle blunting suggestive of effusion vs. consolidation - more likely the former given meniscus.
?wedge on lateral view suggestive of lobar pneumonia.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism within the main, lobar or segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally.
Evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries is limited secondary to bolus timing.
Moderate-sized pericardial effusion with interval increase in enhancement of the pericardium suggestive of pericarditis.
Ground-glass opacity in the left apex again identified and may be infectious in nature.
Large right and moderate left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Multiple low-density lesions within the kidneys bilaterally which most likely represent renal cysts.
Multilevel discogenic disease with secondary degenerative changes and multilevel neural foraminal narrowing.
Bilateral stable moderate pleural effusions with associated bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
Subtle ground-glass opacity at the left lung apex, new since last CXR, but evident on recent CT, could suggest early developing focus of infection.
Cardiac silhouette is suboptimally evaluated due to summation of shadows with pleural effusions.
PT: 12.2  PTT: 22.7  INR: 1.0  Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old woman with history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism and recent pericarditis, felt likely viral, s/p drainage of pleural effusion (pericardial effusion not drained) and CDiff infection who presents with dyspnea on exertion and returning pleural effusions.
# Pleural Effusions: Patient arrived with SOB and CXR revealed pleural effusion bilaterally.
# Leukocytosis: On admission, patient had a WBC of 40.0.
Patient had intermittent AVnRT episodes but remained stable and was discharged on her home dose.
# Diarrhea: Patient experienced daily loose green BM for multiple days.
Initially it was thought that she redeveloped C.diff, as she had a corresponding WBC.
# Hematuria: On U/A, patient had microscopic blood.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
