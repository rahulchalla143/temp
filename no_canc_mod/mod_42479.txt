Of note, the patient recently had a MSSA bacteremia thought secondary to infected indwelling catheter, treated with 4 weeks of vancomycin.
Labs in the ED were  notable for initially elevated lactate to 6.0 which decreased to 2.0 with fluids, WBC 27.6 with 4% bands.
The patient was put on sepsis protocol, given a small fluid bolus in the setting of renal failure with minimal urine production, and a central line and arterial line were placed.
In the unit, the patient was found to have a tunnel catheter infection that had frank pus at the tip.
Cultures grew out coag positive staph aureus and she was started on vancomycin.
A mild increase in LFTs resolved with gentle hydration and resolution of acute sepsis.

Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with an elevated WBC to 29.6, hypotension, lactate of 3.4, and a bandemia.
Sources of infection were initially considered to be UTI with or without a line infection (right side catheter).
However, upon further evaluation, it was noted that source of infection was likely the catheter alone since withdrawal of the line revealed frank pus and culture grew out coag positive staph aureus.
With two days of consecutive blood cultures being negative, interventional radiology placed a dialysis line on the patient's left side (right side was previously infected) and the renal service was able to successfully use the line for dialysis.
The patient had no temperature spikes, and blood pressures remained at baseline range around 80/60.
2) ?UTI: The patient's initial UA was impressive for a significant amount of bacteria but culture turned out to be negative.
Per above, the patient lost her tunnel catheter due to infection and a new line tunnel catheter was placed on the right side.
Arrhythmia: Amiodarone was continued at her outpatient dose without complication.
CAD: there were no acute complaints of chest pain.
