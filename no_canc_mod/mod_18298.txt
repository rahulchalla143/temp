HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old white male with type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, who developed bilateral calf claudication.
The patient complained of progressive bilateral calf claudication after 100 ft for the previous year.
He denied rest pain or foot ulcerations.
He presented for an elective right lower extremity bypass graft.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Left hip replacement.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
General: The patient was an alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.
Extremities: There were arthritic changes in extremities.
Chest x-ray showed no acute pulmonary disease.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 63, AV conduction delay, old inferior/posterior myocardial infarction.
At the end of surgery, the patient had a warm foot with a palpable graft pulse and Doppler signals of the right pedal pulses.
Intraoperatively the patient became bradycardiac and became hypertensive.
About ten minutes later, he became severely bradycardiac with a heart rate in the 20s.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended continuing telemetry for the patient's postoperative Wenckebach rhythm which they felt was primarily secondary to intraoperative drugs, especially beta-blockers.
They recommended avoiding beta-blockers and using ACE inhibitors, diuretics, Nitroglycerin or Hydralazine for blood pressure control.
The patient had another episode of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia in the 30s on [**2153-1-21**].
At the time of dictation, the patient has a warm right foot with a palpable graft pulse and Doppler signals of the right pedal pulses.
