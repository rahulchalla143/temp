Admission Date:  [**2190-3-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-3-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-11-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: N-G tube placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo male s/p prolonged hospital and rehabilitation course following XRT for [**Location (un) 5668**] cell carcinoma who presents with acute onset shortness of breath at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab earlier today.
Per report from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, patient was noted to have new thick brown sputum with difficulty swallowing.
He was recently started on levofloxacin/flagyl three days ago for treatment of a presumed aspiration pneumonia.
He was placed on BiPAP and later intubated with a two-week course complicated by ARDS, ARF requiring temporary HD, acute delirium, and thrombocytopenia.
He was treated with a steroid taper for COPD exacerbation and broad spectrum antibiotics.

Family History: NC  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: VS: T 98, BP 119/51, HR 88, SpO2 93% on 50% shovel mask, RR 30 Gen: elderly [**Male First Name (un) 4746**], resting comfortably, slightly diaphoretic HEENT: multiple actinic keratoses over scalp, MMM, sclerae anicteric CV: RRR, difficult to auscultate [**3-13**] upper airway sounds Resp: coarse rhonchi throughout lung fields.
No abdominal accessory muscle use, no nasal flaring.
Micro: BCx: negative x 4 UCx: yeast x 2 Urine negative for legionella Stool Cx: cdiff positive Sputum: MRSA MRSA screen + x 2 .
The aorta is mildly tortuous and there are atherosclerotic calcifications of the arch.
There is patchy airspace consolidation at the right lung base which partially obscures the hemidiaphragm consistent with right lower lobe pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion on this radiograph that does not fully include the right costophrenic sulcus.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia.
Atrial ectopy.
Non-specific inferior ST-T wave changes.
Atrial ectopy.
Non-specific inferior ST-T wave changes.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-9**] 5:17 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-8**], there is poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm with some increased opacification suggesting atelectasis or pneumonia at the left base.
Bibasilar parenchymal opacities are also unchanged.
[**2190-3-9**] 4:26 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, there is little change in the position of the nasogastric tube.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50%), which may be partially due to rhythm (appears to be atrial fibrillation based on the transmitral Doppler profile).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Right perihilar and bibasilar opacities appear similar to the previous examination.
Bilateral small-to- moderate pleural effusions are partially layering on this semi-upright radiograph, and there are possible calcified pleural plaques.
[**2190-3-12**] 7:20 PM CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Incompletely visualized are small-to- moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis of the dependent lower lobes.
Coronary artery calcifications are present.
Numerous punctate calcifications are noted scattered throughout the liver and spleen consistent with old granulomatous disease.
There is a small splenule adjacent to the spleen.
There are extensive abdominal arterial vascular calcifications due to atherosclerosis.
There are cysts of the left kidney and other small hypodensities too small to characterize.
The right kidney is abnormally small, cystic, and atrophic with coarse calcification along its medial aspect from old insult.
There is no hydronephrosis.
Extensive soft tissue and mesenteric edema and a small amount of ascites is noted.
There are no dilated loops of small or large bowel.
There is no evidence of obstruction or pneumoperitoneum.
There are numerous colonic diverticula.
Extensive mesenteric edema and small amount of ascites also complicates assessment for wall thickening; however, there is apparent wall thickening of the sigmoid and lower descending colon, as well as the cecum.
There is no loculated fluid collection or abscess.
BONE WINDOWS: There are extensive degenerative changes of the visualized spine.
Wall thickening involving the sigmoid colon and possibly cecum consistent with colitis, more likely infectious.
No evidence of megacolon or pneumoperitoneum.
No abscess identified, within the limits of noncontrast examination.
Extensive atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and arteries.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-12**] 5:08 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-9**] and 30: Moderate bilateral pleural effusion right greater than left has increased more substantially on the right than the left since [**3-9**].
Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement have worsened.
Right lower lung is obscured by effusion, left shows increasing atelectasis.
Upper lungs are clear aside from mild vascular engorgement.
No pneumothorax.
Sequence of changes suggests earlier left heart failure has progressed to biventricular or predominantly right-sided decompensation.
ECG Study Date of [**2190-3-12**]  5:14:32 AM Sinus rhythm and occasional atrial ectopy.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-3-8**] no diagnostic interim change.
There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe volume loss.
There is moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe volume loss.
There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and perihilar haze, suggesting CHF.
The extent of the bilateral pleural effusions is stable.
Moderate bibasilar atelectasis, no secure evidence of pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Otherwise, no relevant changes.
Poor R wave progression across the anterior precordial leads, probably a normal variant.
Non-specifc inferior and lateral ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-3-12**] no atrial ectopy is seen.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-16**] 2:17 AM SINGLE VIEW, CHEST: Moderate bilateral pleural effusion unchanged.
No focal consolidation.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged moderate layering bilateral pleural effusion.
No acute cardiopulmonary process or significant changes since prior radiograph.
His course was notable for decreased urine output, which responded well to fluid boluses.
Also, he developed atrial fibrillation on the evening of the 28th.
He had difficulty swallowing and an NG tube was placed.
He has a baseline dementia and he did become agitated with placement of the NG tube necessitating restraints.
He continued to have intermittent desats thought to be [**3-13**] to mucous plugging, and his floor course was notable for significant pulmonary congestion.
CT abdomen was suspicious for colitis.
#) Chronic renal insufficiency: He had low urine output during his stay, responsive to IVF.
#) Anemia: consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation .
Per report, patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, presumed secondary to heparin products, but no documented HIT-antibody.
