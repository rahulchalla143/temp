She had no other symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, or any other complaints.
No recent travel or change in eating habits.
An abdominal CT was done to r/o an abscess (given that she's on chronic steroids) and it showed diverticulosis but no diverticulitis, as well as stable dilation of her CBD.
She remained hypotensive in the 80s-90s.
Depression 8.
Asthma  Surgical Hx: - hysterectomy at age 36 for fibroids - L TKR - R knee fusion - R eye cataract surgery   Social History: Lives at home by herself in [**Hospital1 8**].
No tobacco or alcohol.
Also had HTN and gout.
Physical Exam: T: 99.5  BP: 88/41 P: 96 R: 19   O2 sat:  97% on RA Gen: awake, alert and oriented female in no acute distress, asking for diet pepsi HEENT:  normocephalic, atraumatic.
no palpable lymphadenopathy.
Lungs: mild insp crackles at the bases, diffuse expiratory wheezes CV: tachycardic, regular, II/VI systolic murmur at LSB Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended.
There is mild atelectasis at the visualized lung bases.
There is no free fluid or peripancreatic fat stranding.
Small bowel and colon loops are normal in caliber without evidence of wall thickening.
A clip is again noted in the inferior vena cava, related to pulmonary embolism prophylaxis.
There is no free air.
PELVIS CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are diverticula in the sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis.
The bladder and rectum appear unremarkable.
There is no free fluid.
Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Stable appearance of the dilated pancreatic duct without evidence of peripancreatic inflammation.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and associated left lower lobe atelectasis.
There is no pulmonary edema.
No new pulmonary opacities to suggest pneumonia.
RLE u/s: no DVT   Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  78 y/o F w/PMR on chronic steroids admitted with diarrhea, fever, hypotension, elevated lactate and bandemia.
She was changed from levofloxacin to Zosyn for suspicion of adverse reaction to levo, having a swollen neck and wheezing.
On the afternoon of [**2200-9-20**], she became confused and combative.
She was given 3 amps of bicarb and fluids and started on heparin for potential PE (stopped after initial bolus given).
The source of lactic acidosis was likely due to hyperperfusion from ongoing sepsis and acute bleed.
Given that source of sepsis was not entirely clear (dirty u/a without urine cx) and with a concearn for occult bleed, CT abd was repeated.
It showed a large perihepatic bleed.
Labs were consistent with shock liver.
CT abd/pelvis revealed no other infectious sources.
Plan was to continue a total of 3 weeks of Zosyn for bacteremia/sepsis of unclear source (likely urine).
[**Month/Day (2) 4338**] liver showed large perihepatic bleed (stable) and an area of intraparenchymal hemprrhage in zone 8 of liver (no active contrast extravasation; no underlying lesion).
possibility of septic embolic event leading up to this although no obvious source as presumed UTI was appropriately ttreated.
Abnormal LFT's and subcapsular bleed: Likely due to shock liver as above.
?CAD/CHF: cath w/ clean coronaries by regional WMA on LV gram and mildly depressed EF.
Has DM so likley has nonobstructive cad and microvasc dz.
E. coli sepsis/bacteremia (presumed urine source) 2.
Perihepatic bleed 3.
Asthma 4.
Diabetes   Discharge Condition: stable; requires albuterol nebs for comfort (asthma)   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as directed.
