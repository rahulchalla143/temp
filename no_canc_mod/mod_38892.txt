CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 1.
Left femoral deformity, displacement and hardware of indeterminate chronicity, with intermediate density in the joint space.
Acute trauma and infection cannot be excluded.
Evidence for portal hypertension, including splenomegaly and recanalized paraumbilical veins, likely secondary to cirrhosis.
Bilateral pulmonary opacities, concerning for aspiration.
Trace perihepatic ascites.
Bright DWI and FLAIR signal in the bilateral globus pallidus with no evidence of corresponding bright signal on ADC may represent a sub-acute hypoxic injury or other metabolic/toxic process.
Ethmoid and left mastoid air cells fluid.
Discharge Labs: [**2121-1-17**] 06:00AM BLOOD WBC-5.6 RBC-4.03* Hgb-12.0* Hct-35.4* MCV-88 MCH-29.8 MCHC-33.9 RDW-14.6 Plt Ct-143* [**2121-1-17**] 06:00AM BLOOD Plt Ct-143* [**2121-1-17**] 06:00AM BLOOD Glucose-108* UreaN-7 Creat-0.8 Na-141 K-3.2* (repleted) Cl-106 HCO3-27 AnGap-11  Brief Hospital Course: 60M history of IVDU/alcoholism, cirrhosis secondary to Hepatitis C, CKD, seizure disorder, asthma, hypertension, anxiety that was found down apneic with acute encephalopathy, hypercarbic respiratory with resultant sepsis likely from pulmonary source and ?
basal ganglia ischmemia in setting of hypotension.
# Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy: The initial differential was broad including drug overdose in setting of prior substance abuse history and positive toxicology screen with opiates and benzos, toxic-metabolic namely hypercarbia/hypoxemia from poor respiratory drive, primary neurogenic such as post-ictal state in setting of prior seizure history or basal ganglia stroke given head CT findings, septic encephalopathy among others.
Likely sequence of events would be process such as pneumonia or drug overdose leading to respiratory failure with subsequent sepsis and hypoperfusion resulting in combined picture of primary neurogenic and septic encephalopathy with contribution of hypercarbia.
Pt was subsequently extubated without complication and his mental status returned to baseline over the course of three days.
Unclear what role likely overdose and/or aspiration pneumonia plated [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Etiology potentially multifactorial secondary to overdose, hypovolemia from poor PO intake, and/or potentially septic shock from aspiration pneumonia.
There was initial concern for cardiogenic shock from STEMI at OSH, but ECG, troponins, bedside ECHO in ER not suggestive of acute event making cardiogenic shock less likely.
No evidence of distributive shock from process such as pancreatitis.
# Hypercarbic, hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to likely overdose and subsequent Aspiration PNA (MRSA): Pt presented with low respiratory rate with pin-point pupils concerning for toxidrome from opiates/benzo; however, he was not responsive to narcan.
His A-a gradient initially was 80.9 suggesting that in addition to frank hypoventilation given clinical history, there was likely some concurrent parenchymal process such as V/Q mismatch (A-a gradient approximately 81).
Initial gas showing primary respiratory acidosis.
Overall, favor toxidrome with subsequent aspiration event.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Basal ganglia infarcts: Head CT showing basal ganglia lesions, which could be concerning for infarcts.
MR revealed a sub-acute hypoxic injury or other metabolic/toxic process.
# ?Hip pathology: Patient with left femoral deformity, displacement and hardware of indeterminate age - per family, had hip operation several years ago.
# History of drug abuse/alcoholism Toxicology screen positive for benzo and opiates.
# Cirrhosis secondary to Hepatitis C (Admit MELD 12): Per report, pt with hx of hepatic encephalopathy in past.
Unknown if varices or ascites/SBP in past.
CT showing evidence of portal hypertension including splenomegaly and trace perihepatic ascites.
No frank evidence of decompensated liver disease.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Incidental findings 1.
Bright DWI and FLAIR signal in the bilateral globus pallidus with no evidence of corresponding bright signal on ADC may represent a sub-acute hypoxic injury or other metabolic/toxic process.
Left femoral deformity, displacement and hardware of indeterminate chronicity, with intermediate density in the joint space.
Acute trauma and infection cannot be excluded.
# Transitional issues - repeat CXR in [**3-14**] weeks to evaluate for resolution of pulmonary process .
The PCP expressed that the pt had recently been dismissed from his practice, but that the pt could follow-up with him within the next 30 days for aspiration pneumonia follow-up.
