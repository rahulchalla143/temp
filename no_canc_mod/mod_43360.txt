He also reported decreased POs since discharge from rehab on [**1-2**] after girdlestone procedure, but denied abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting.
Of note, he had had a 4lb weight gain immediately following d/c from rehab, his dose of lasix was increased to 30mg PO x1 day (since being back on 10mg/day) and is now 4lbs down from rehab d/c weight.
In the ED at the OSH a CXR was performed which reportedly showed a pneumonia per [**Hospital1 18**] ED call in.
ROS:  +30lb weight loss over 6 months.
No rashes, no joint pain.
RV is Transvene and there is a stand-alone SCV coil.

4-5/5 strength throughout (symmetric, however generalized mild weakness).
[**1-10**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2114-11-22**] atrial fibrillation with occasional ventricular paced rhythm persists.
New retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis.
Opacity within the right lung base which has been noticed to be present on several previous radiographs.
There is significant increase in bilateral perihilar opacities and bronchial wall thickening continuing towards the lower lungs with bilateral increase in currently moderate-to-small pleural effusion, finding consistent with pulmonary edema.
[**2115-1-17**] CT head without contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or infarct.
[**2115-1-18**] CT head without contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 76 year-old male with CAD s/p MI x 2, VF arrest, CHF with EF 20-25% in [**9-15**] s/p ICD placement, A. fib, and CKD admitted with pneumonia.
He was initially treated with Levaquin at an OSH ED and transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**], where he had a short MICU course for concern of hypotension.
His MICU course was complicated by low urine output that responded to IVF.
# Pneumonia: Admission CXR showed a RLL opacity, possibly chronic, consisted with soft tissue v. infiltrate as well as a retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis v. infiltrate.
The patient had a productive cough and leukocytosis concerning for pneumonia, especially in setting of questionable aspiration given previous history.
The patient had evidence of a rising peripheral eosinophilia while on antibiotics (possibly due to cephalosporins) without evidence of any rash or end-organ effects.
# Failure to thrive.
The patient presented with history of signficant weight loss, which is ikely multifactorial with elements of depression, dysphagia, and end-stage CHF contributing.
(Dysphagia is chronic dysphagia due to a structural problem with neg EGD in [**3-15**].
# Oliguria: The patient had evidence of low urine output during admission (lowest UOP about 300cc/day), which was fluid-responsive.
PVR showed no evidence of obstruction.
# Congestive heart failure, diastolic, EF 20-25%: The patient was given IVF as necessary, as above, but generally maintained BP 100-120 SBP.
He continued to remain mildly volume depleted/ euvolemic so home dose of lasix was stopped.
The patient was continued on carvedilol, lisinopril, and digoxin with no acute issues.
# Rhythm: Patient has underlying atrial fibrillation with BiV ICD placed in [**2110**] with almost 100% V pacing.
ICD was also interrogated on [**1-16**] for brief pauses (<2 seconds) and was found to be sensing noise from coughing given abdominal placement.
# CVA: On [**1-17**] the patient developed symptoms of dysarthria and left lower facial droop.
There were no other neurological complaints or other deficits on exam.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3 with no EKG changes concerning for ischemia (but difficult to interpret given V-pacing).
# Hyperlipidemia:  The patient was continued on outpatient statin.
# Anemia:  Baseline hct appears to be predominantly 33-35, with hct during admission within baseline.
Iron studies were felt to be consistent with iron-deficiency anemia, and the patient was started on supplementation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 14468**] Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: pneumonia, failure to thrive secondary: coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, ICD placement, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia   Discharge Condition: good, afebrile, VSS, ambulating with assistance, neurologically stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a pneumonia and weakness/ volume depletion.
During your hospitalization you had clinical evidence of a small stroke.
A CT scan of the head was negative for evidence of bleeding.
If you experience any fevers > 101, chills, increased dizziness, shortness of breath, worsening cough, chest pain, weakness or any other concerning symptoms, please contact your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room for further evaluation.
Followup Instructions: Please have your INR checked daily with your coumadin dose titrated accordingly at your nursing facility until in the therapeutic range.
