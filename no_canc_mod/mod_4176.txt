Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated left main coronary artery disease.
There was a 60% hazy lesion in the distal left main at the bifurcation involving the left main, ostium of the LCx and the LAD.
The LAD had moderate luminal disease.
[**2152-12-27**] Echo: Suboptimal image quality.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully appreciated.
LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF guess = 40%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Persistent opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and effusion.

STUDY: Left lower extremity venous ultrasound.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
In summary she had: Emergency off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x2 with Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft obtuse marginal artery.
The wound nurse followed this patient during post-op course for her sacral decubitus ulcer (and she also examined eschar at vein harvest site).
On post-op day six she had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which was appropriately treated and she converted back to sinus rhythm.
