Admission Date:  [**2150-3-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-3-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-1-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: New onset atrial fibrillation, poor urine output  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: RIJ CVL placement and removal Arterial line placement RIJ temporary HD catheter placement R PICC placement Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 75 yo M h/o obesity, DM2, CRI (baseline cr 2.5), CHF, chronically vent dependent [**1-17**] [**12-23**] PNA, presented from [**Hospital 671**] Rehab after pt was noted to be in new atrial fibrillation.
Pt was admitted to [**Location 1268**] VA in [**12-23**] for hypoxemic and subsequent hypercarbic respiratory failure, ultimately requiring two intubations.During that hospitalization, because of failure to wean, pt was trached.
The patient developed a gradual decline in his urine output.
Labs at the time revealed a cr elevated to 5.3.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2-20**] for further evaluation of his renal failure.
During that admission the patient became volume overloaded and was admitted to the MICU for initiation of HD.
The patient's course was complicated by citrobacter and VRE bacteremia as well as acinetobacter growing from the sputum.

There is diffuse interstitial and alveolar edema.
A left lower lobe consolidation cannot be excluded.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted .
Renal US [**3-17**]: Note is made that this is an extremely limited ultrasound due to the patient's body habitus.
The right kidney measures 12.0 cm, and no hydronephrosis is appreciated.
Bronchoscopy [**3-24**]: No evidence of trauma, thin frothy pink secretions consistent with pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 74M h/o morbid obesity, DM2, CRI, chronic vent dependency, p/w poor UOP and A fib, now with clinical picture concerning for sepsis .
# Sepsis: Patient met SIRS criteria with temperature >102 and hypotension with SBP 80s.
He was given broad spectrum abx including linezolid given his h/o VRE, cefepime for broad gram neg coverage in this longterm rehab and hospital resident, as well as his home flagyl.
His cefepime was changed to meropenem per ID given his h/o resistant acinetobacter.
A RIJ CVL was placed for pressors and CVP monitoring.
In addition, his R PICC line was removed and tip was sent for culture.
His urine was felt to be the source as cultures returned positive for >100,000 colonies of pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
In addition, the patient had 2 species of GNR in his sputum, these were not identified at the time of transfer.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile for the remainder of his hospital stay.
He was continued on meropenem to cover possible pulmonary infection as well as UTI, last dose to be given [**2150-3-25**].
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr on admission was elevated to 4.4 which was above his baseline of 1.9.
His acute renal failure was felt to be in the setting of  sepsis.
A renal consult was obtained who felt that his renal failure was [**1-17**] ischemic ATN in the setting of sepsis.
Left kidney was not visualized due to body habitus.
Given his volume overload and oliguria a temporary RIJ HD line was placed by IR on [**3-20**] and HD was initiated the same day.
# Respiratory distress: Admission CXR showed possible b/l infiltrates vs. pulmonary edema, however was extremely limited due to body habitus.
He was primarily maintained on PS ventilation 12/5, however patient was subjectively SOB and his pressure support was increased to 15 on [**3-20**] despite stable O2 sats.
He did not have a significant amount of secretions and remained afebrile and his b/l infiltrates were felt to be [**1-17**] pulmonary edema rather than infection.
On [**3-23**] the patient developed some bloody secretions from his trach in the setting of initiating anticoagulation.
# Atrial fibrillation: new onset in the setting of sepsis.
# hemoptysis: on the day of discharge the patient was having scant hemoptysis and bronchoscopy was performed.
He had pink frothy secretions consistent with pulmonary edema and no evidence of trauma.
The etiology of his scant hemoptysis is likely pulmonary edema only.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID PRN () as needed for anxiety.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease Atrial fibrillation, new onset Pseudomonas UTI Chronic respiratory failure, vent dependent Diabetes Morbid obesity   Discharge Condition: Afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the medical ICU with rapid heart rate and low urine output.
You were found to have an infection in your urine that was likely causing your symptoms.
Given your increased risk of stroke you were also started on a blood-thinning medication called coumadin.
Your kidney function declined in the setting of your infection and the kidney doctors followed [**Name5 (PTitle) **] for this.
It was decided to initiate dialysis and a temporary catheter was placed and you were started on dialysis.
