History of Present Illness: The pt is a 72 year-old right-handed woman with no known significant past medical history (has not been to a physician in years) who presented after being found down and transferred from an OSH with evidence on CT of a right intraparenchymal bleed.
She apparently had a mild headache yesterday but no other significant complaints.
EMS was called and she was taken to [**Hospital 4683**] where she was found (by report) to have a right lateral gaze, posturing and contracted right side, with a flaccid left side.
She was apparently intubated for airway protection and a CT was done that showed a large right sided lobar hemorrhage with 10mm of midline shift.
Unclear how long, occasional EtOH, no drugs.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 96.8  P:80  R: 16  BP:130/65  SaO2:100  General: intubated, sedated HEENT: site of EVD draped, attached to drain, mild scleral injection b/l .
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, mech breath sounds Cardiac: RRR, nl.
III, IV, VI: + dolls eyes V,VII: corneals intact bilaterally r>l IX, X: gag and cough  -Motor: Normal bulk, increased tone in legs, right arm (maybe paratonia) Spontaneous movement of right arm, and both legs, extensor postures of left arm.

There is continued surrounding vasogenic edema, with persistent 10 mm leftward subfalcine herniation, and 3 mm leftward shift at the level of the third ventricle.
There is evidence of intraventricular extension, with a large amount of hemorrhage layering in the bilateral occipital horns.
There is continued sulcal effacement extending throughout the right cerebral hemisphere.
No new foci of hemorrhage, edema, or large vascular territorial infarct are identified.
The ventricles maintain a normal caliber, without evidence of hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of transtentorial or tonsillar herniation.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of large right frontal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, 10 mm leftward subfalcine herniation, and associated diffuse cerebral edema.
