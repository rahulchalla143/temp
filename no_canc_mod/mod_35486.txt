She was having pain in the neck and shoulders after walking 2 flights of stairs at a time.
She had no shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or palpitations during each event.
She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have an 80% proximal LAD lesion and a 40-50% distal stenosis of her OM.
During the intervention the LAD lesion was stented however a linear density was seen that was ultimately thought to be due to eccentric calcification and not dissection.
During the procedure she developed neck/throat pain and intermittently had a LBBB on her EKG.
She states that she recently started to be evaluated by her PCP for anemia which so far has only shown hypothyroidism.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain other than when on lipitor.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP    Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated ([**2101-5-30**]) sinus rhythm at 65 bpm nl axis and intervals no significant ST-T wave changes  [**2101-6-1**]: post-PCI: sinus @65 with PR prolongation.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: sinus rhythm with nl axis and intervals with periods of sinus rhythm with wide complex and leftward axis (LBBB morphology)  CARDIAC CATH performed at [**Hospital **] Hosp on [**2101-5-31**] demonstrated: 80% prox LAD 40-50% distal OM LMCA and RCA were normal.
LCX 40-50% distal lesion RA 12/10/9 RV 29/5 PA 27/12/18 PCW 14/15/11 AO 107/55/78 LV 108/14  [**2101-6-1**]: [**Hospital1 18**] Right dominant system LMCA no apparant disease LAD 80% proximal lesion involving the D1 which had moderate ostial disease LCx: 70% distal lesion supplying 2 OMs PCI: LAD with 2 overlapping Cypher stents, LCX with 1 Cypher stent.
Linear density seen at the distal edge of first LAD stent felt likely to represent eccentric calcium and not dissection.

There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal inferior septum, and hypokinesis of the basal inferio wall and mid-inferior septum (RCA territory).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief the patient is a 65 year old woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia who was referred for elective PCI following developing progressive exertional angina.
#CAD: The patient is a 65 year old woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, diet controlled DM2 presenting for PCI c/b intermittent LBBB and anginal equivalent.
Patient initially presented to OSH with exertional angina found to have signficant 2 vessel disease that is now s/p PCI with stent placement.
Patient initially had some nausea, chest pressure and headache following arrival in CCU, but EKG was unchanged from pre-cath EKG (no LBBB) and symptoms resolved with anti-emetics and rest.
#Anemia:  Patient was noted to be anemic and was transfused 2 units packed RBC's on night of admission and on morning laboratories found to have an elevated TSH with a suppressed free T4, suggesting hypothyroidism as the etiology of her anemia, as iron studies, folate and B12 were normal and stool guaiacs were negative.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for treatment of exertional chest/neck pain.
You likely suffered a heart attack and you underwent cardiac catheterization where we have treated the blockages with angioplasty and stenting.
Missing doses could put you at risk for a severe heart attack or even death.
If you develop any new or concerning symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe nausea, or severe bleeding; please seek medical attention as soon as possible.
