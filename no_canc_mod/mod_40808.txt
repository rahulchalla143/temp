Ms. [**Known lastname 2429**] was admitted to this hospital from [**2200-6-23**] to [**2200-7-2**] with altered mental status.
She was diagnosed with multiple subacute cerebrovascular infarcts likely secondary to cardioembolic phenomenon.
She also was noted to have a persistent oxygen requirement of 2 liters initially attributed to cardiogenic pulmonary edema although hypoxia persisted despite diuresis.
She was discharged to skilled nursing facility on [**2200-7-2**] but her rehabilitation was complicated by two hospital admissions for pneumonia and congetive heart failure (not at this facility).
Per her niece over the past week she has been experiencing cough productive of minimal sputum, sore throat, clear rinorrhea.
She has not been experiencing frank fevers or chills.
She has not had lightheadedness or dizziness.
She has complained of mild shortness of breath with exertion but this is unchanged for the past month.
No chest pain or shortness of breath.
She has had intermittent leg swelling but no leg pain.
On the day of presentation she was noted to have low grade fevers with intermittent episodes of heavy coughing with a choking sensation.
Labs were notable for a WBC count of 14.7 with 87% neutrophils and acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.3 from baseline of 0.9.
She had one set of negative cardiac enzymes and an EKG which showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes.
She had a CXR which showed mild pulmonary edema and a CTA which was negative for pulmonary embolism and also showed mild pulmonary edema.
On arrival to the MICU she is alert but confused and very talkative.
She also endorses mild bilateral leg swelling.
History of left occipital infarction in [**6-/2200**] with associated naming difficulties previously anticoagulated but now on plavix 2.
Possible dementia 3.
Iron deficiency anemia 4.
Asthma in childhood - Currently using 2L nasal canula but no documented underlying lung disease and no pulmonary function tests 5.
Atrial Flutter 6.
Family History: Notable for depression in a grandmother.

Imaging: [**8-29**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation.
[**8-29**] CXR: Mild congestive heart failure.Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
Small right pleural effusion.
[**8-29**] Chest CTA: No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Pulmonary edema with small right pleural effusion.
2.1 cm right renal complex cyst with internal attenuation values mildly higher than simple fluid.
Further evaluation with renal ultrasound suggested.
[**8-30**] LENI: No evidence for right lower extremity DVT.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Suboptimally visualized right renal superior pole cysts, due to difficulty in patient positioning and breath holding in the current clinical state.
Consider follow- up US upon stabilization of clinical state or MR for further evaluation.

Severe mitral annular calcification.
Moderate Mitral stenosis.
Compared to [**2200-6-23**], pt has increased pulmonary hypertension.

[**2200-9-5**] CXR: There is a nasogastric tube in good position with the tip lying within the stomach.
Unchanged moderate right and smaller left pleural effusion unchanged.
Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.
There is relatively well-defined lucency identified posterior to the right side of the heart which may represent a small hiatus hernia.
There is significant scoliosis of the thoracic spine, concave to the left.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presented from home with cough for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive requiring pressor support from c diff colitis.
# septic shock:  Patient was hypotensive on admission fitting a SIRS/sepsis picture and initially required vasopressors to maintain MAPs>60.
She was weaned off the pressor and found to be C. diff positive.
She received 4 days of azithromycin to cover for possible atypical pneumonia given ground glass opacities seen on CTA.
# hypoxemia:  Patient has 2 liter oxygen requirement at home without clear history of lung disease.
She had flash pulmonary edema on night of admission in setting of sinus tachycardia and fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
A cardiogenic cause related to worsening valvular disease was considered but ruled out with basically unchanged Echo.
She will  be discharged on lasix 20mg PO daily and potassium supplementation  # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient had acute renal failure on admission which was likely prerenal in the setting of what appeared to be septic shock with low UOP.
She was diuresed with lasix drip despite renal failure to treat pulmonary edema and improve lung function.
# Anemia, NOS:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.
No active sites of bleeding.
She received 2 units of pRBCs [**8-31**] to improve hypotension and anemia.
Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.
Patient with known occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic phenomenon.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation, controlled on oral diltiazem.
No chest pain or shortness of breath.
Her home digoxin was held in the setting of renal failure.
# Diastolic Heart Failure, acute, decompensated: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of hypotension.
An attempt was made to dry her out enough to minimize her O2 requirement, but she was never able to ambulate without requiring O2 so she was again discharged with home O2, only now with ambulation only.
# Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
# FEN: Due to altered mental status, we obtained bedside swallow evaluation.
They cleared her by bedside eval but could no r/o silent aspiration w/o video.
We elected to defer this evaluation given her goals of care and quality of life to not limit thin liquids, but instead to discharge her with aspiration precautions.
If you have worsening diarrhea or develop fever, please call your doctor immediately or return to the ER.
You had previously been on bumex to help remove excess fluid in the body.
[**Month (only) 116**] also need adjustment of zyprexa dosing if patient still having confusion at night.
