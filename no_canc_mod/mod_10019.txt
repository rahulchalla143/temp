After the medical flight, the patient presented to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room where he became very agitated and self-extubated.
In addition, two doses of activated charcoal were attempted to be administered, both of which did not stay down in the stomach.
Of note, before transfer to [**Hospital1 188**], laboratories were drawn at [**Hospital6 5016**] which included a urine toxicology screen which was positive for amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and cocaine.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has been hospitalized twice for substance overdoses; the first of which the patient reports was related to recreational overdose, the second of which may have been related to a suicide attempt.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In addition, he has used gamma hydroxybutyrate and ephedrine; although, he denies use of benzodiazepines or cocaine.
His respiratory rate revealed the patient was on the ventilator on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation and pressure support with an FIO2 of 100%, respiratory rate set at 12, tidal volume of 700; on this, the patient had a spontaneous respiratory rate as high as 10 and had achieved an oxygen saturation of 100%.
His pupils were 3 mm and reactive bilaterally.
He had no scalp or other head lesions.
He did have moist mucous membranes, and his tympanic membranes were intact bilaterally.
His oropharynx revealed dried blood in the right nares where an nasogastric tube had been placed.
His neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
Heart examination revealed first heart sound and second heart sound with tachycardic rate, and a regular rhythm.
His extremities revealed there was no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No evidence of other trauma.
Subsequently on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient did appear to have fasciculations in the legs bilaterally as well as in the neck muscles.
Urine toxicology screen, per an outside hospital, as mentioned with positive benzodiazepines, positive cocaine, and positive amphetamines.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray post second intubation revealed an elevated right hemidiaphragm with normal cardiac silhouette and contours.
No ST segment changes or T wave changes.
There was a thought process that this may represent gamma hydroxybutyrate withdrawal; a rare, but no unheard of effect of gamma hydroxybutyrate.
Psychiatry determined on the first date of admission that it was unclear given his mental state what was going on and wanted him to remain in the hospital with a one-to-one sitter and for them to evaluation him the next day to make a decision on potential for inpatient hospitalization.
The patient did remain overnight without event, and on the morning of the second day of admission, Psychiatry came to evaluate him and felt that his overdose was not consistent with a suicide attempt and felt that he was safe to be discharged home.
From a medical perspective, the patient remained hemodynamically stable and was afebrile throughout his course.
He did have an elevated creatine phosphokinase on admission (in the 1300-range) with a MB of 2.
In addition, the patient asked for human immunodeficiency virus test before his discharge.
