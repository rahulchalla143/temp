CT L spine [**2121-8-2**]: FINDINGS: Examination of the axial images demonstrate no evidence of fracture.
CT LUE [**2121-8-2**]: FINDINGS: There is a comminuted fracture involving the left scapular [**Doctor First Name 362**] and spine, with a shattered appearance of the scapula.
There is slight fragmentation of the greater tuberosity of the humerus.
There is a comminuted fracture of the distal clavicle.
Rib fractures involving the lateral aspects of the left 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs are seen as well.
IMPRESSION: Comminuted fractures of the clavicle, scapula, and bits of the greater tuberosity.
There is no evidence of shoulder dislocation, and the fractures of the scapula do not extend to the glenoid fossa.
Multiple rib fractures are also present.
CT abdomen/Pelvis/Chest [**2121-8-2**]: 1) Polytrauma with fractures of left clavicle and scapula, with scapular fracture extending to the inferior glenoid.
There is haematoma in the rotator cuff muscles 2) Bibasilar atelectasis with small left sided hemothorax.
3) Grade III splenic laceration.
5) Small left thyroid nodule.
CT C-spine [**2121-8-2**]: IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
No fracture is identified.
A-gram [**2121-8-3**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of active extravasation in the liver.
There is an unusual parenchymal blush at the lower pole of the spleen with relatively early opacification of the splenic vein but no evidence of active extravasation.
Unusual parenchymal blush at the lower pole of the spleen with early opacification of the splenic vein but no evidence of active extravasation.
Note is made of vascular calcification, an accessory ossicle adjacent to the cuboid, and a small inferior calcaneal spur.
No fracture or dislocation is identified.
Degenerative changes at the 1st MTP joint are noted.
No fracture identified.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 50%).
There is hypokinesis of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral walls.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 y/o male s/p being struck by tree noted to have splenic lac, left scapula,and left clavicular fracture.
The patient was also evaluted by ortho for his non-displaced left clavicular fracture and left scapula fracture.
On HD #3, the patients HCT was stable however he was noted to have transient chest pain associated with EKG changes.
He was given nitro for ischemic chest pain.
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 2 and a cardiac echo did not demonstrate any evidence of ongoing cardiac ischemia.
The blood in his urine likely represented blunt kidney truama and foley trauma.
