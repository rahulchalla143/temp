The patient denied any chest pain but mid-back pain is the patient's anginal equivalent.
Of note, the patient's baseline systolic blood pressure is 80 to 90.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
No fevers, chills or cough.
Coronary artery disease status post anterior lateral     myocardial infarction in [**2175-10-20**].
Status post     cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the left     anterior descending, [**2175**], complicated by apical thrombus     requiring emergent coronary artery bypass graft.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10     to 15%, severe left ventricular dilatation, global     hypokinesis starting at the base, known apical aneurysm.
On Coumadin previously which was discontinued at prior     hospitalization for GI bleed.
Severe mitral     regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
History of atrial fibrillation.
Status post cerebrovascular accident.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of     1.4.
Colonoscopy in [**2176-3-19**], showed     diverticulosis with a single polyp at 12 cm.
EGD in     [**2176-6-19**], showed AVM's in the third part of the     duodenum.
Status post ablation of atrial tachycardia.
Of note, the patient's aspirin and Coumadin were discontinued in [**2176-6-19**], after admission for GI bleed.
In general, well appearing, pale, in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular: Diffuse point of maximum impulse, positive S4, regular rate, III/VI systolic murmur heard best at the base.
No hepatomegaly.
Dorsalis pedis two plus bilaterally.
RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia.
There is a persistent right sided pleural effusion and massive cardiomegaly.
Repeat chest x-ray [**2176-10-20**], showed massive cardiomegaly with left ventricular predominance.
No evidence of congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 72 year old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 10 to 15%.
Recent admission in [**2176-6-19**], when he presented with hypotension and melena.
The patient is now admitted with progressive fatigue, melena and orthostasis on examination.
The patient denied any abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting at the time of admission but did complain of back pain which is anginal equivalent and was [**Year (4 digits) 20003**] out by myocardial infarction by serial cardiac enzymes.
First EGD showed a small hiatal hernia and lots of coffee ground blood in the stomach and three AVM's in the stomach fundus which were cauterized.
The first one-third of the duodenum was visualized with no evidence of bleeding.
The patient received approximately five units of packed red blood cells with an increase in hematocrit from 17.3 to 20.1.
On hospital day number two, the patient's sodium started to increase as the patient had been diuresing spontaneously and was NPO for several days.
On hospital day number four, sodium increased to 152 and D5W rate was increased with no evidence of congestive heart failure on examination or chest x-ray despite ejection fraction of 10 to 15% and multiple packed red blood cell transfusions.
Given his history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and coronary artery bypass graft.
Despite large volume given, the patient had no evidence of congestive heart failure during this admission.
Renal:  The patient presented with an elevated creatinine of 2.3 with baseline of 1.4.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
