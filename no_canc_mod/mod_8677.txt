FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-4**], there is no change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle is suggested.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were initially obtained through the chest and abdomen without contrast, followed by contrast-enhanced images through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray.
FINDINGS:  CT OF THE CHEST:  There is marked diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, particularly the left thyroid lobe, most compatible with multinodular goiter.
There is a persistent crescentic pooling of contrast along the medial aspect of the stent compatible with an endoleak.
There is no mediastinal hematoma.
The previously noted small left pleural effusion has resolved.
The lungs are clear with the exception of several small scattered areas of subsegmental plate-like atelectasis.
High-density material is seen in the gallbladder compatible with vicarious excretion of the contrast.
A simple renal cyst is again noted in the left kidney measuring approximately 3.6 cm in greatest dimension.
The previously noted right retroperitoneal hematoma has increased in size and now measures 8.8 cm in transverse, 9.1 cm in AP, and 18 cm in craniocaudal dimension.
A small component of the hematoma is extending medially as before to the region of the right common iliac pseudoaneurysm.
The previously identified pseudoaneurysm which arises at the level of the bifurcation of the right common iliac artery and right external iliac artery is unchanged in appearance and measures approximately 1.3 cm in diameter.
There has been slight interval decrease in subcutaneous emphysema along the right anterior abdominal wall.
There is asymmetric thickening of the right rectus abdominis muscle and somewhat increased attenuation likely reflecting an intramuscular hematoma in this region.
There is no significant free pelvic fluid.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Interval increase in the size of the right retroperitoneal hematoma which now also contains new hyperdense components suggestive of more accute hemorrhage.
Intramuscular hematoma involving the right rectus abdominis muscle, probably minimall increase since the prior study.
No significant change in appearance of the thoracic stent graft and previously noted endoleak.
No evidence of mediastinal hematoma.
