HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old male with an unknown past medical history except for a history of cocaine use and alcohol abuse who presented to the Emergency Room the morning of admission with shortness of breath and [**11-1**] substernal chest pain without radiation.
The patient immediately went into a ventricular fibrillation arrest and received 200 joules times one of electricity and returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm with bradycardia in the 40s.
The patient was intubated and the postcardiac arrest EKG showed ST elevations in II, III, and aVF.
Angiography showed a right dominant system with a patent LMCA and LAD to mid LAD with intramyocardial bridge with systolic compression.
The patient also had mild to moderate disease for which an Angioject was employed for one pass, distal to proximal, with resolution of the filling defect with no residual stenosis at the stent and more proximal disease was unchanged.
There was no distal embolization.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
There were 2+ DP and tibial pulses.
The patient was able to move his hands and feet slightly.
The patient had to be sedated secondary to agitation.
The urine was negative for alcohol, negative for cocaine, positive for benzodiazepines and for aspirin, most likely secondary to administration of these agents in the ER.
The patient's cardiac enzymes ruled him in for a myocardial infarction and his cardiac catheterization results are as described previously.
There was mild regional LV systolic dysfunction and near akinesis of the basal third of the inferior wall.
There was no aortic regurgitation.
There was no mitral valve prolapse but there was 1+ mitral regurgitation.
There was mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
