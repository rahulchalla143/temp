seizure disorder, CAD who presents from a nursing home with acute encephalopathy due to opioids, as well as severe decubitus ulcers.
ACTIVE ISSUES ------------- #.Toxic metabolic encephalopathy due to opioid overdose or possibly undertreated UTI.
The patient recently had pain medications increased and responded well to narcan, which made opioid overdose most likely.
No evidence of seizure with negative EEG.
There was no evidence of active infection.
# Seizure disorder, with eye twitching visualized in ED.
24 hr EEG did not show evidence of epileptiform activity.
Culture showed mixed genital flora and repeat culture showed yeast.
No chest pain or ECG changes.
No known renal dysfunction for explanation of troponin elevation.
Sacral decubitus ulcer with associated pain -Initially home regimen was discontinued due to somnolence.
However, pt did report significant pain and no longer had periods of somnolence.
PT and HCP were aware of the possible risks of opioids causing respiratory depression as well as worsening apneic episodes at night (see below) and did agree to restart opioid pain medication.
Despite, this regimen pt did still report significant wound pain.
Given that he did not have any further episodes of somnolence/AMS, oxycontin 10mg [**Hospital1 **] was again tried, but with recurrent somnolence.
Therefore, final regimen at this time is 5mg oxycodone q4-6hrs prn pain with 5mg [**Hospital1 **] prn 1hr prior to dressing changes.
Unfortunately pharmacy here was not able to perform the below.
However, please consider the above for additional pain control.
At this time, pt is without delerium on current therapy.
However, would have to discuss goals of care further if pain control still becomes an issue, to discuss initiation of hospice care as increasing further doses, may lead to apnea and further somnolence.
#bradycardia with 1st degree AVB-thought to be beta blocker effect.
Hypercalcemia:  Likely in the setting of immobility and possibly dehydration.
#.normocytic anemia-likely due to chronic disease and acute illness.
Pt did not have any evidence of active bleeding.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with confusion and decreased responsiveness.
