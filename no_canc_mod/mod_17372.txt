Admission Date: [**2174-7-3**]        Discharge Date: [**2174-7-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2174-7-2**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NB   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 73536**] presented to the NICU as a 1 day old, term infant, who was referred from the newborn nursery for evaluation of twitching movements and reduced tone.
Fetus was known to be relatively macrosomic but the maternal glucose tolerance test, GTT, was reassuring.
No sepsis risk factors were noted and the mother did not receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.
At delivery, the infant emerged with Apgars of 7 and 8 with no notable resuscitation needed.
Vital signs remained stable although the infant required warming twice for mild hypothermia with normal dextro-sticks, between 45 and 60.
There was mild work of breathing noted initially that gradually improved and the infant breast fed several times without significant difficulty.
The infant was seen by the neonatal nurse practitioner the first evening and thought to appear otherwise stable but due to persistent concerns, the infant was transferred to the NICU on [**2174-7-3**].
There is no history of unusual neonatal illnesses.
Mother is otherwise healthy with no ongoing medical problems and no medication use.
Maternal obstetric history is notable for prior Cesarean section at term, due to failure to progress but with otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy and neonatal course.
Low tone abdominal muscularature.
no sacral anomalies.
Especially with truncal hypotonia.
She was noted to have dusky episodes, some with apnea and some with just desaturations and bradycardia.
She has remained on nasal cannula at 50 to 75 cc flow and 100% and continues to have occasional events as described above.
Cardiovascular:  Outside of the bradycardic events mentioned above, [**Known lastname 4489**] has maintained cardiovascular stability with no murmurs, normal baseline heart rates and normal blood pressures.
The infant did require the initiation of gavage feedings as the enteral feedings were advanced due to poor p.o.
Gastrointestinal:  The infant had mild hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin level of 15.2 over 0.3 on [**2174-7-12**], day of life 10.
Hematology:  No blood typing has been done on this infant.
The infant has required no antibiotic therapy.
There have been no further issues of infectious disease.
Neurology:  Neurology consult was initiated on [**2174-7-3**] due to the neurologic symptomatology.
An EEG was done on [**2174-7-4**] which showed no seizures but        discontinuous background.
A repeat EEG was done on        [**2174-7-11**] and showed subtle changes with a more        continuous background but with continued excessive        bitemporal spikes.
A MRI done on [**2174-7-5**] showed a dysgenic brain -        cerebral underdevelopment, underdevelopment of the        anterior operculum, and simplified frontal gyria        (bitemporal perisylvian/ bifrontal polymicrogyria-        pachygyria)    4.
This        could represent a Sulfite Oxidase Deficiency.
The infant has a diagnosis of early myoclonic encephalopathy of unknown origin.
The prognosis is poor per neurology with limited life-span, intractable seizures, and significant cognitive and motor deficits.
It has been offered to the parents to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the Neonatal Neurology [**Hospital 702**] clinic either with [**Known lastname 4489**] or just as a couple to discuss pending test results, potential autospy results when available, and significance of [**Known lastname 73538**] condition for future pregnancies.
Genetics:  A genetics consult was done on [**2174-7-4**] to rule out a genetic abnormality.
Ophthalmology:  No eye exams have been done on this infant.
Lorazepam oral for agitation or seizures is in a              2 mg/ml concentration.
The infant can have .1 ml              or .2 mg every 4 hours for agitation or seizures          2.
This concentration is 1 mg per ml              and this infant can have this every 4 hours for              agitation or seizures.
10 minutes              while seizures persist.
Early myoclonic encephalopathy of unknown origin 2.
