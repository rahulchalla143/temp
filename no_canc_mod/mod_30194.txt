Coronary artery disease.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Coronary artery disease - status post coronary artery    bypass graft x1.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year old man with history of hypertension and diabetes who underwent an abnormal exercise test in [**2187-2-27**] which resulted in his undergoing a cardiac catheterization.
The cardiac catheterization showed an ejection fraction of 73% but a significant degree of left main disease.
He had otherwise denied any episodes of shortness of chest pain or shortness of breath or any dyspnea on exertion.
Given his significant findings and cardiac catheterization he is referred for possible bypass grafting.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial examination patient was afebrile and hemodynamically normal.
There was a mild I/VI systolic ejection murmur but otherwise his abdomen was soft.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the fact that the patient had significant left main disease which would be best treated with bypass he was admitted to the hospital and scheduled for bypass grafting.
There were no intraoperative complications.
His urine did not evidence any infection nor did his chest x-ray show any evidence of a pneumonia and it was felt this may have been secondary to his cardiopulmonary bypass.
It was noted on postoperative day #4 the patient was having a small degree of drainage from the inferior aspect of his wound.
Sternum was stable and there was no significant wound erythema and it was felt that this serous drainage would just resolve with dressing changes.
Nonetheless he was empirically started on levofloxacin 500 mg once a day to treat empirically any soft tissue or deep infection.
The [**Last Name (un) **] service was consulted regarding management of his diabetes and placed him on metformin 1,000 mg p.o.
As patient was doing well by postoperative day #6 where he had been afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically normal, with saturations in the high 90s on room air and without significant arrhythmia or wound defect it was felt that he could be discharged to home in stable condition.
At the time of his discharge his white count was normalizing and it was noted that his chest x-ray did not show any sort of pneumonia and urinalysis did not show any evidence of a urinary tract infection.
