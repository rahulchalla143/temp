Admission Date:  [**2191-7-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-7-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Morphine / Ritalin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 88 y/o female with h/o HTN, mitral regurgitation, depression, and h/o breast ca who presented with 4 days of nausea/vomiting and dark loose stools.
She states that she recently had a fever (?102).
Guaiac positive black stools.

Family History: No hx of CAD  Physical Exam: Gen: NAD, pleasant HEENT: dry MMM, marked anisocoria, lt pupil 5 mm and rt pupil 2 mm.
Neck: 1+ bilateral carotid bruits CVS: irregular, 2/6 systolic murmur along upper sternal border Lungs: diffuse wheezing Abd: soft, mild tender to palpation at mid lower abdomen, NT, +BS Ext: trace pedal edema   Pertinent Results: [**2191-7-7**] WBC-9.8 Hct-29.8 Plt Ct-164 Glucose-142 UreaN-76 Creat-1.4 Na-145 K-4.0 Cl-106 HCO3-28 CK(CPK)-279-->171-->144-->97-->43-->64 cTropnT-1.54-->1.32-->1.31 .
EKG: [**2191-7-8**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2188-2-9**] atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response has appeared.
Imaging: CXR ([**2191-7-7**]) No definite evidence of consolidation.
However, examination of the left lower lung fields is limited secondary to overlying hiatal hernia.
The whole left hemithorax is opacified with a leftward mediastinal shift due to complete or near-complete atelectasis of the left lung.
The previously demonstrated hiatal hernia is again noted.
CXR ([**2191-7-13**]): Left lung has reexpanded, though the base is chronically elevated by a large diaphragmatic hernia containing stomach and intestine.
Persistent atelectasis of the right lower lobe and small bilateral pleural effusion has increased.
Mediastinal venous engorgement suggests volume overload or at least elevated right heart pressure.
There is no free subdiaphragmatic gas.
No pneumothorax.
This may be due to mucus plugging , atelactasis or endobronchial lesion.
Bronchoscopy would be helpful to evaluate cause of intermittent obstruction of left mainstem bronchus.
CXR ([**2191-7-15**]) Re-expansion of left upper lobe.
Worsening of mild-to-moderate right lower lobe atelectasis and effusion.
LV systolic function appears depressed secondary to extensive apical akinesis.
However, the basal and midventricular segments are markedly hyperdynamic, resulting in a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present; the increased flow velocity across the aortic valve is due to preacceleration in the left ventricular outflow tract.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis  of the distal [**12-14**] of the left ventricle, and akinesis of the true apex.
No left ventricular thrombus is seen.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
UCx [**2191-7-7**] URINE CULTURE (Final [**2191-7-10**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
BCx [**2191-7-7**] (total of 4 bottles) No growth.
SCx [**2191-7-8**] Contaminated, culture cancelled  Brief Hospital Course: 88 y/o female with h/o HTN and no prior h/o CAD presents with vomiting/loose stools and found to have STEMI and guaiac positive stools.
Cardiac - Ischemia The patient presented with a STEMI with STE in inferior and septal leads.
She was found to have positive cardiac enzymes.
Due to GI bleed and patient's functional status, conservative management of her STEMI ensued with aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily.
The patient's initial echo on dopamine gtt revealed extensive apical akinesis; the basal and midventricular segments were markedly hyperdynamic, resulting in a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Dopamine gtt was discontinued within the first few hours in the CCU with subsequent decrease in HR and increased in BP due to improved diastolic filling.
Patient had CHF secondary to diastolic dysfunction and was successfully diuresed with IV Lasix.
Repeat echo revealed some improvement in the contractility of the distal [**12-14**] of the left ventricle and the rest of the walls were no longer hyperkinetic.
Her episodes of RVR responded to IV diltiazem, so she was started on an oral regimen of diltiazem.
No blood transfusions required.
GI was consulted early in presentation and did not proceed with EGD due to patient's cardiac issues.
Mucous plugging The patient was noted to have intermittent mucous plugging contributing to SOB and wheezing.
She had CXRs on [**2191-7-13**] and [**2191-7-15**] which showed collapse of the entire left lobe [**1-13**] mucous plugging and atelectasis.
Wheezing The patient was noted to have intermittent wheezing which is multifactorial secondary to aspiration pneumonia, mucous plugging, CHF (successfully diuresed), and possible underlying COPD in setting of smoking history.
Hypernatremia The etiology of the patient's hypernatremia was thought to be secondary to poor PO intake and a free water deficit.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: STEMI CHF AF/Aflutter with RVR Mucous plugging Aspiration PNA UTI GIB LVOT obstruction .
Secondary diagnoses: Depression Hx breast cancer   Discharge Condition: Normal O2 sats on 5L supplemental O2 (stable) The patient was discharged hemodynamically stable, afebrile with appropriate follow up.
Please return to the ED or call your PCP if you develop chest pain, difficulty breathing, palpitations/rapid heart rate, fevers, or any other concerning symptoms.
