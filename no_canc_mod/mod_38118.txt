Admission Date:  [**2135-1-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-1-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2099-9-11**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 35-year-old woman, who is a current smoker, with family history of early coronary artery disease, who developed acute, severe chest pressure while at work as an emergency medical technician.
The patient initially thought this was musculoskeletal; however, she became diaphoretic, and the chest discomfort persisted.
The patient had a cardiac arrest at the outside hospital.
It was unclear whether it was ventricular tachycardia versus ventricular fibrillation, as the outside hospital did not send any ECG strips.
ECG at the outside hospital showed inferior lead ST elevation with reciprocal changes throughout.
At arrival to the cath lab, the patient reportedly had mild residual discomfort.
In the coronary cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was found to have 95% distal right coronary artery occlusion which received angioplasty, as well as a stent.
The patient developed bradycardia during catheterization and hypotension which responded to dopamine which was started, as well as IV fluids and atropine.
The patient was started on Neo-Synephrine; however, in the cardiac catheterization lab for hypotension just prior to transfer to the coronary care unit.
Upon arrival to the coronary care unit, the patient complained of right groin pain at the site of catheterization, but otherwise denied any shortness of breath, chest pain, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or any other symptoms.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient with an uncle who had a myocardial infarction in his 30s, as well as a grandfather with a myocardial infarction in his 50s.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Heart exam within normal limits with normal S1, S2, no murmurs appreciated, no S3 or S4.
Patient with mild chest tenderness to palpation in the sternal area.
Right groin site of catheterization with some mild oozing of blood, as well as a small, stable hematoma.
It showed ST elevations in II, III and AVF, 1 mm in II, 2 mm in III and AVF with reciprocal ST depressions in I and AVL with T wave inversions, as well as [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in V2.
It was notable for a 95% distal right coronary artery stenosis which was stented, but with good TIMI to distal flow even prior to stent.
It also showed a diffuse 40% proximal LAD stenosis.
The patient's filling pressures were slightly elevated in the cath lab with a right atrial pressure of 15, right ventricular pressure of 38/20, PA pressure of 38/28, and wedge pressure of 28.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 35-year-old female, a smoker, brought in from an outside hospital with substernal chest pain, as well as inferior lead ST elevation, status post coronary catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] with stent placement.
The patient notably had cardiac arrest at the outside hospital which responded to defibrillation.
1) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  Patient with inferior myocardial infarction status post right coronary artery stent.
The patient's early myocardial infarction was concerning for possible abnormal coagulation underlying problem.
Recommend outpatient work-up of coagulation studies.
The patient had no further symptoms of coronary artery disease throughout her hospital stay.
The patient did have a short run of 10 beats of ventricular tachycardia on her first night in the coronary care unit.
Other than this, the patient's rhythm was normal sinus rhythm with very occasional premature ventricular complexes seen on telemetry.
4) PUMP:  The patient's echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45-50%, as well as focal, severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior wall.
The remainder of the echocardiogram was within normal limits with 1+ mitral regurgitation seen.
5) FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient maintained on a cardiac diet throughout her hospital stay which she tolerated well.
The patient did have a small femoral artery hematoma that was stabilized with direct pressure and was stable x 48 hours at discharge.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Inferior wall myocardial infarction.
