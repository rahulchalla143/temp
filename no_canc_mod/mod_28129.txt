Patient was found to have new onset renal failure, with creatinine 5.8.
Patient initially presented to OSH ED after developing acute onset sharp chest and back pain while sitting in a chair while on the computer.
He noted that with this onset of acute pain, he also developed anuria and diffuse weakness and myalgias.
He states that the pain persisted for several hours, and he was concerned that he had an MI, and presented to an OSH, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and stomach "gas bubble" and treated with ciprofloxacin and metaclopromide.
His symptoms failed to improve, and he then presented to his urologist, who transferred him to the ED to be seen.
In the ED, patient was noted to have acute renal failure and markedly elevated LFTs.
He has not traveled recently, and denies any recent sexual exposures, blood transfusions, IVDU, or new medications other than above.
Pt admitted to MICU, a subsequent CT scan showed Aortic dissection and the patient underwent an emergent repair  Past Medical History: borderline HTN  Social History: + alcohol use.

PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Comparison to two days prior reveals increase in size of left-sided pleural effusion, which is moderate.
Right-sided pleural effusion is small and likely decreased.
Retrocardiac density persists, which likely represents atelectasis and effusion; however, focal consolidation cannot be excluded.
Today's exam reveals multiple predominantly upper lung field nodular densities measuring up to approximately 4 mm in size, which likely were present on [**2-26**] and may represent multiple granulomas.
Increase in size of moderate left-sided pleural effusion with decrease in size of small right-sided pleural effusion.
Retrocardiac density, which likely represents a combination of atelectasis and effusion; however, focal consolidation cannot be excluded.
Multiple predominantly upper lung field small nodular lesions, which likely represent small granulomas.

FINDINGS: There is aortic dissection, extending from the aortic root through the proximal portion of the descending thoracic aorta, distal to the great vessels.
This finding is compatible with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11916**] type A/DeBakey type I aortic dissection.
Aortic regurgitation is also appreciated on cine sequences (sequence 7, image #29).
The dissection extends into the right brachiocephalic artery, with associated focal occlusion of the brachiocephalic artery, however, the right carotid artery is patent and not involved by the dissection.
There is a moderate pericardial effusion consistent with hemopericardium.
No specific MR signs of tamponade are appreciated; notably the SVC and IVC are of normal caliber and cine sequences demonstrate grossly normal ventricular wall motion.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.
There is mild adjacent atelectasis.
Ascendnig aortic dissection originating at the dilated (6 cm) aortic root, extending to proximal portion of the descending thoracic aorta, consistent with [**Location (un) 11916**] type A aortic dissection.
Moderate hemopericardium without specific MR signs of cardiac tamponade.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Patent SMA, Celiac, and duplicated bilateral renal arteries.

Pt states this illness began with acute onset sharp chest and back pain that persisted for several hours, myalgia and anuria were associated symptoms.
The patient was treated for "pneumonia and gas bubble".
Symptoms did not improve and his urologist referred him back to ER where he was noted to have renal failure and elevate LFT's.
He was admitted to MICU, a subsequent CT scan showed aortic dissection and he was brought emergently for replacement of ascending aorta and resuspension of aortic valve on [**2-27**].
Discharge Instructions: Call with fever, redness or drainage from incision or weight gain more than 2 pounds in one day or five in one week.
Shower, no baths, no lotions, creams or powders to incisions.
