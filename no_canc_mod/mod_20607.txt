Admission Date:  [**2166-12-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2167-1-2**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old female with COPD, atrial fibrillation, CHF, and aortic stenosis who has had progressive worsening of her shortness of breath.
Previous evaluation by echocardiogram at an outside hospital revealed worsening of her aortic valve stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
The patient was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible aortic valve replacement.
On[**Last Name (STitle) 53680**]ate of admission, a TEE was performed which showed an aortic valve area of 0.8 as well as no evidence of mitral valve regurgitation.
Given these findings, Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], the cardiothoracic surgeon, felt that further investigation of her dypnea was preferable since the aortic stenosis may not have been the primary culprit in her symptoms.
Atrial fibrillation.
Aortic stenosis.
Esophageal spasm, status post esophageal dilation.
Hernia repair.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile with a blood pressure of 118/67, heart rate 77, respiratory rate of 20, oxygen saturation 99% on face mask following extubation.
The physical examination is notable for labored breathing but no accessory muscle use.
There are no crackles or wheezes on examination.
The patient has a III/VI systolic ejection murmur heard throughout the precordium.
There is no lower extremity edema.
At that time, it was felt that her aortic valve area had worsened to 0.6 and that there was also evidence of mitral valve regurgitation.
The patient was referred by her primary cardiologist for aortic valve and mitral valve replacement.
It showed an aortic valve area of 0.8 and no evidence of mitral valve regurgitation.
It was felt that her aortic stenosis was not severe enough to explain her dyspnea in isolation.
Upon review, it was noted that the MR jet was eccentric and was overestimating the stenosis and gradient.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
Multiple EKGs showed a V-paced rhythm.
The patient experienced no episodes of atrial fibrillation during the hospitalization.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 38%.
PULMONARY:  Since it was not felt that her pulmonary symptoms could be entirely explained by her aortic stenosis, a pulmonary consult was obtained.
According to the patient's primary pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36953**], the patient has a history of a mild obstructive picture.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36953**] had performed a thorough pulmonary workup in the past including PFTs and chest CT.
The patient was found to have no desaturations on ambulation with a good pulse ox [**Location (un) 1131**].
A chest CT was obtained which showed mild emphysematous changes but no evidence of interstitial disease or bronchiectasis.
She also had a focal ground glass opacity in the right lung apex as well as small branching opacity of the right lower lobe consistent with a focal mucoid impactation or focal atelectasis.
They felt that the results were consistent with a moderate to severe restrictive pattern secondary to her severe kyphoscoliosis and possibly in part from her cardiomegaly although the percent predicted was not that impression given the patient's age and size.
They felt that the decrement was likely very significant.
The DLCO decrement was felt to correct for lung volume and they were reassured that the patient did not desaturate during ambulation.
Pulmonary consult felt that possible etiologies for the trend down as compared to previous PFTs included the small ground glass opacity, mucous, possible history of aspiration due to esophageal dilation, pulmonary edema, or Amiodarone.
They also recommended an outpatient speech and swallow evaluation to rule out aspiration given the patient's history of esophageal dilation.
Seeing how her pulmonary status is likely to continue worsening, it was felt that the patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**], or pulmonologist should discuss code status considering the need for oxygen or ventilation.
RIGHT FEMORAL AV FISTULA:  The day following cardiac catheterization, the patient was found to have a right femoral bruit on examination.
There was no evidence of hematoma at that site.
A femoral vascular ultrasound was performed which showed an AV fistula but no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
OSTEOPOROSIS:  The patient has severe osteoporosis as evidenced by kyphoscoliosis and a history of compression fractures.
Aortic stenosis.
Restrictive lung disease secondary to kyphoscoliosis.
Congestive heart failure.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Attempts were made to make appointments for the patient; however, since it was a holiday, offices were not open.
