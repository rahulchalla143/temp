[**12-29**] CT Head: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
Mild degree of cerebral atrophy, stable in appearance.
Hypodensities are seen in the periventricular white matter surrounding both right and left frontal horns, within the left thalamus, and in the right basal ganglia.
Mucosal thickening within the ethmoid air cells and right maxillary sinus is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is apparent widening of the mediastinal contour, which is secondary to vascular structures and fat based on prior CT from [**2159-12-12**].
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
4.There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) central aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
[**1-1**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Stable chest radiograph with no evidence of infiltrates or effusions.
[**1-4**] Humerus/Femur Plain Films: LEFT HUMERUS: There is a displaced and mildly comminuted distal periprosthetic fracture of the humerus.
A previous a left proximal humerus arthroplasty is well positioned.
There is diffuse osteopenia.
LEFT FEMUR: There is little change from [**12-6**] of the supracondylar distal femur fracture with associated callus formation.
In addition, three displaced femoral neck fracture appears unchanged though is incompletely evaluated on this femur study and is limited by osteopenia and body habitus.
IMPRESSION: New periprosthetic humerus fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: 69F w/ESRD, recent sepsis of UNK source, presenting with fever and sepsis.
This was considered most likely to be urosepsis, likely secondary to poor hygeine given that the patient is incontinent of stool and likely her infection resulted from GI pathogens entering the urine.
Wounds and osteomyelitis were also considered as possibilities, but her surgical wound from past ortho procedure was clean and did not appear infected.
Urine culture here at [**Hospital1 18**] grew klebsiella and pseudomonas.
A TEE was negative for vegetations.
Antihypertensives were held in the setting of sepsis and were not resumed due to low-normal BP.
The possibility of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-vesicular fistula was raised as a possible explanation of recurrent urosepsis.
The patient had a CT abdomen on a recent previous admission that showed no evidence of such a fistula, so repeat imaging was not done.
Patient had HD M-W-F.  Phos binders were held due to low phos.
Can consider restarting if phos increases.
Altered Mental Status: Likely this was due to sepsis.
Fractures: Orthopedics evaluated the patient while hospitalized, and repeat films of the humerus and femur were obtained.
The patient is not an operative candidate at this time, so fractures have been managed non-operatively with pain control.
5. h/o RLL PE (resulting in PEA arrest): Patient is on coumadin at home.
It was not restarted prior to discharge as her BP remained low-normal without medication.
No evidence of acute blood loss.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: urosepsis with enterobacter and klebsiella in blood cultures, klebsiella and pseudomonas in urine end stage renal disease, on hemodialysis Secondary Diagnoses: history of PE hypertension CHF diabetes type II anemia, secondary to ESRD   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: 1.
If you experience fever, chills, confusion or change in mental status, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms, please contact your doctor or return to the emergency room for evaluation.
- We have held the metoprolol because of low blood pressure.
