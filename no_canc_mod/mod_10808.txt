Admission Date:  [**2158-6-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2158-6-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-9-16**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68 year old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, who complains of five to six days of chest pain and shortness of breath that was intermittent in nature, significantly worse in the afternoons.
The catheterization results revealed a 50% mid- left anterior descending lesion with an additional long 80% mid- left anterior descending lesion with an additional 70% distal left anterior descending lesion and a 60% diagonal lesion.
The left circumflex had no significant disease.
The right coronary artery had 100% proximal stenosis after the right ventricular marginal branch.
The procedure was also complicated by a probable contained coronary perforation distally from a guide wire with contrast appearing to drain into the venous structure and multiple echocardiograms showing no effusion.
Additionally, the procedure was complicated by two episodes of ventricular fibrillation which each responded to a single shock.
Diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:   No allergies.
Generally, he was alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.
His neck examination showed no jugular venous pressure while lying flat, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy.
No murmurs, rubs and no gallops.
The patient had no edema.
EKG results at admission were premature atrial complexes, evidence of inferior infarction, probably acute, considered posterior long involvement; no previous report for comparison is showed.
ST elevations in inferior and posterior leads as well as AVR and before R.  HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.
Additionally, the day prior to discharge the patient was taken back to catheterization laboratory and his left anterior descending lesions were stented with no complications.
The patient's PA diastolic pressures and serial echocardiograms were all consistent with normal right ventricular function and there was no evidence of tamponade.
Throughout his hospitalization the patient was also free of symptoms such as edema, hepatomegaly and jugular venous pressure that would have indicated right sided failure.
3) Rhythm; the patient's ventricular fibrillation in the catheterization laboratory was likely a reperfusion arrhythmia which responded well to defibrillation.
The patient had no other dysrhythmias throughout his hospitalization despite monitoring on Telemetry.
He had no signs of left ventricular failure or right ventricular failure throughout his hospitalization.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The patient was started on a cardiac diet as well as diabetic diet.
Endocrine:  The patient was a known non-insulin dependent diabetic and was not restarted on his oral hypoglycemics, however, he was covered with a sliding scale insulin which was minimally used throughout his hospitalization.
Prophylaxis:  The patient received Protonix for peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis and Docusate for constipation.
