In several areas the fluid is beginning to organize into early abscesses; two enterocutaneous fistulas, one over the wound in the lower pelvis, the second near the umbilicus, both draining oral contrast; and bibasilar consolidation and pleural effusions.
At HD 4 she was extubated but desaturated later in the day due to pulmonary edema with (+)response to lasix.
