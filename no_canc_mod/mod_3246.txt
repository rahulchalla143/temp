The patient's wife explicitly stated that he did not complain of chest pain but did have some back pain.
Upon arrival to the ED, the patient stated that his chest pain had resolved as above but reported that he felt lightheaded and overall feeling unwell.
No significant EKG findings other than bradycardia were reported.
He received several doses of Atropine (2) as well as Glucagon for reversal of any excess beta-blockade.
His systolics were noted to be mostly in the 90s with one episode of hypotension to the high-70s, during which the patient was reportedly asymptomatic.
Of note, his family noted a deterioration in his mental status following either administration of either Atropine or Glucagon.
They further stated that he is typically a very organized and oriented individual though they did state that he has poor vision and decreased hearing.

Left ventricular hypertrophy.

Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
CXR [**2196-11-2**] FINDINGS: A dual-lead left pectoral pacemaker device has its leads terminating at expected locations in the right atrium and right ventricle.
No pneumothorax.
Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectases are mild.
Bilateral lungs are remarkable for mild vascular and interstitial prominence, likely congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o male with CKD, dCHF, AAA, and h/o bradycardia who presents with symptomatic bradycardia with junctioanl escape rhythm.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Bradycardia: Junctional escape rhythm with retrograde P waves likely related to initiation of metoprolol on previous admission.
He did have some episodes of tachycardia on telemetry.
# Acute kidney injury on CKD: Serum creatinine elevated to 3.4, up from recent baseline of 2.0-2.4 believed to be from hypotension in the setting of bradycardia.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Had pulmonary edema on admission likely from bradycardia on baseline CHF also possible exacerbated by acute kidney injury.
# Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission but BP increased after he was in NSR.
6. acetaminophen 500 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO three times a day as needed for pain or fever for 4 days.
7. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO four times a day as needed for pain for 4 days.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check chem-7 and CBC on Friday [**11-4**] with results to [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7978**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7976**] or fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13238**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Bradycardia s/p pacemaker placement Acute on Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure Acute Delerium Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had a slow heart rate and needed a pacemaker.
We have stopped 2 of your blood pressure medicines because your kidney function is worse, another blood pressure medicine has been increased.
START taking clindamycin four times a day for 2 days to prevent an infection at the pacer site.
START tylenol 1000mg (2 extra strength) three times a day to treat the pain at the pacer site.
