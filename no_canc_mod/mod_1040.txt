Admission Date:  [**2163-12-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-12-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-12-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain and fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial tap and drain placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 66yo M PMHx pericarditis w small pericardial effusion diagnosed [**2163-12-15**] at [**Hospital1 18**] ED, started on ibuprofen and colchicine, presenting with new onset chest pain.
1.5 wks prior to presentation patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with retrosternal chest pain, found to have diffuse PR depressions and ST elevations in the context of recent reported viral illness.
Patient reports subsquent improvement in symptoms, and was seen by his PCP [**2163-12-22**], who ruled him out for a PE with a CT contrast given his persistant tachycardia, and performed a TTE [**2163-12-23**] that showed small circumferential pericardial effusion with slight right ventricular diastolic invagination c/w increased pericardial pressure.
However, at midnight on evening of this presentation, patient developed acute new onset, substernal chest pain, described as sharp and pressure-like, non-radiating, exertional, and pleuritic in nature.
It was associated with diaphoresis and nausea.
He denied associated cough, fevers, shortness of breath.
Exam was significant for clear lung fields, elevated JVD.
During this time, patient became increasingly tachycardic and hypotensive, requiring urgent placement of CVL and initiation of dopamine.
Patient now with mild residual chest pain.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Family History: Alzheimer in father, died at age 80 from SBO; he has three sisters, who are generally in good health although one had pericarditis with tamponade decades ago and has since had valve replacements for unclear reason.
No family history of diabetes, heart disease, except for grandfather suffering an MI at age>70.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with JVP of 3 cm above sternal angle, continued kussmahl's sign which is becoming less prominent.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
MRSA Screen [**12-25**]: Negative Pericardial Fluid Cultures: Blood culture, aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, acid fast all negative Pericardial Fluid Cytology [**12-25**]: Negative for malignant cells .
There is a moderate to large sized, echo-dense pericardial effusion.
No overt right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**12-23**]/201, the pericardial effusion has increased in size.
The RV cavity size (in end-diastole) appears smaller but without collapse (this suggests elevated intrapericardial pressure).
Successful Pericardioicentesis with removal of 300cc fluid, improvement in pericardial pressure and overal hemodynamics.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-12-25**], the pericardail effusion is [**Last Name (un) 7322**] smaller (now post pericardiocentesis) without evidence of tamponade.
CXR portable [**12-25**]: IMPRESSION: Interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette even accounting for patient and technical factors.
There is abnormal septal motion.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small, circumferential, partially echo filled pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade, but with abnormal septal "bounce" c/w possible early constriction.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 66M with PMHx pericarditis diagnosed [**2163-12-15**] presenting acute chest pain, found to have pleural effusion and tamponade physiology, now s/p drainage and doing well.
# Pericardial Tamponade [**3-16**] to Viral Pericarditis: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the ED following following diagnosis of viral pericarditis based on symptoms and EKG findings 1.5 weeks prior with progression of symptoms including fatigue and shortness of breath despite taking NSAIDs and colchicine.
He was felt to have clinical evidence of frank tamponade but found to have a large pericardial effusion on TTE without frank tamponade physiology.
He underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab with removal of 320cc's of bloody fluid with exudative laboratory characteristics with resolution of the majority of his clinical symptoms and normalization of his hemodynamics.
His drain was pulled without significant re-accumulation of fluid on TTE and he was discharged with outpatient follow-up, NSAIDs, and colchicine with specific instructions to return for medical evaluation if his symptoms recurred.
# Depression/Dysthymia: Stable.
# Insomnia: Stable.
#Follow-up was arranged for him and he was alerted to present to the ED if moderate-severe symptoms recurred.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion Pericarditis Depression Insomnia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were hospitalized for a collection of fluid around your heart called an effusion.
There is no evidence that the fluid is returning at this time and no evidence that there is an infection of the fluid itself.
We made the following changes to your medicines: -START Oxycodone 5mg by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain (Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking this medication) -START Metoprolol succinate 25mg by mouth daily -CHANGE Aspirin to 325 mg daily -CONTINUE Colchicine 0.6mg by mouth twice daily (Do not discontinue this medication unless your cardiologist says it's okay) - Continue taking your other medications as previously prescribed.
- Continue to take Ibuprofen three times a day for pain .
