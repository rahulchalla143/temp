Admission Date: [**2175-1-29**]        Discharge Date: [**2175-2-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-3-19**]        Sex:  F  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bleeding at right AV fistula site.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year old female with end-stage renal disease secondary to IDDM and hypertension; on hemodialysis every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at the [**Location (un) **] Hemodialysis Unit.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for bleeding from her AV fistula site.
The bleeding was controlled in the ED with a stitch.
She was in her usual state of health, although had an extra hemodialysis session for volume overload.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for Alzheimer's with vascular dementia, right AV fistula, post angioplasty, recent admission in [**2174-12-1**] for mental status changes and question encephalopathy and hypercalcemia.
Positive systolic murmur.
Abdomen is soft and nontender with positive bowel sounds.
No lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Right upper extremity AV fistula is positive for thrill, and this was palpable at the proximal aspect of the fistula.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for bleeding of her AV fistula while in HD.
Noted that the patient was having mental status changes.
O2 saturation improved to 100%.
She received no sedation.
Head CT demonstrated no acute intracranial hemorrhage, and the recommendations from neurology included MRI/MRA to evaluate for stroke.
They recommended treating empirically with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for infection, as it was felt that it was unsafe to perform a LP due to a low platelet count and coagulopathy.
Seizure was likely secondary to uremia.
Impression included proximal stenosis, and a venography was recommended with possible dilatation of more proximal stenosis.
This was felt to be secondary to her dementia.
On [**2-8**], the patient underwent an MRI of the chest and mediastinum to evaluate the left arm for future access to rule out central stenosis.
This study demonstrated a widely patent left subclavian vein, internal jugular vein, brachiocephalic vein, and superior vena cava.
A 2.5-cm peripheral lung lesion with T2 hyperintense center and rim enhancement was noted.
Findings were noted to be possibly related to infection; although given thrombus seen within the central right veins, a septic emboli and infarct were also amongst the differential diagnoses.
After discussion of MRI findings with the patient's daughter, a chest CT without contrast was done to evaluate the left upper lobe lesion.
This was confirmed by CT. A left upper lobe peripheral pleural based mass like opacity was noted.
A small cavitation was seen on the reformatted images.
PT recommended for strengthening and safety.
She did have a one-to-one sitter.
She continued on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for empiric treatment for meningitis; although this was felt to be low probability, and her mental status changes were attributed to uremia and dementia.
On physical exam, the patient's right upper extremity graft site was open to air with sutures without any redness, drainage or bleeding.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Included end-stage renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, dementia, left upper lung nodule, right brachiocephalic occlusive thrombus, status post creation of right upper extremity arteriovenous graft and repair of right upper extremity arteriovenous fistula pseudoaneurysm.
