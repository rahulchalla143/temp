Father has type II diabetes.
She has a sister with type I diabetes.
She was sent to the SICU postoperatively given concern for elevated intra-abdominal pressure.
On [**2140-6-25**] she was taken back to the OR for  abnormal pancreatic duplex ( Absence of flow within the splenic vein and loss of diastolic flow on Doppler waveforms consistent with splenic venous obstruction to the pancreatic transplant)and underwent exploratory lap, transplant pancreatectomy and 4 compartment fasciotomies of bilateral lower extremities.
She also suffered a right iliac thrombosis requiring thrombectomy.
She experienced rapid afib and required cardioversion and amiodarone.
This was consistent with cellular/acute rejection.
The C4d stain was negative with focal staining in less than 10% of the peritubular capillaries.
This was stopped when she experienced pulmonary edema which required intubation.
Early in the postop course she experienced a LUL pneumonia which responded to IV vanco and zosyn.
Sputum was positive for E.coli and pseudomonas.
Prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with left and  right ventricular cavity sizes and low normal left ventricular systolic function was noted.
This was 13 and felt to be secondary to sick thyroid.
She underwent closure of the lower extremities and debridement of the abdominal wound on [**7-15**] (please see operative report).
Fluid from the JP was sent for creatinine and revealed values similar and less than the serum creatinine ruling out a urinary leak.
The foley was removed and she experienced urinary freqeuency attributed to bladder deconditioning secondary to being anuric prior to transplant.
Urinalysis and cultures were negative for infection.
On [**7-29**] she grew out klebsiella from the abdomenal wound sensitive to meropenum.
Neurology and orthopedics as well as PT evaluated her for bilateral plantar flexion deformities and ankle contractures from prolonged immobility.
Neurology expressed concern for possible nerve injury due to compartment syndrome.
Adjustable multipodis boots were obtained, but were not used at this time due to the calf incisions and potential for injury to incisions.
PT/OT worked with her extensively.
Nutrition followed her due to poor po intake.
A tube feeding was utilized for post pyloric feedings.
She experienced significant pain in her extremities and abdomen that was managed with methadone, dilaudid pca, po dilaudid.
PCA dilaudid was stopped and intermittent dilaudid IV prior to dressing changes was utilized for break thru pain med.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
