Aspiration pneumonia required intubation 2.
CBD injury status post open cholecystectomy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2201-6-19**]: ERCP .
History of Present Illness: 60M PMH stage 1 bladder cancer s/p radiation Rx in [**2195**], with two years of intermittent RUQ pain 6 hours after fatty meals and presumed to be cholecystitis, with partial intermittent cystic duct obstruction confirmed by HIDA scan.
He also had a RUQ ultrasound that showed a contracted gallbladder with small stones and a thickened wall.
A challenging and lengthy dissection ensued, requiring extensive stripping of omental adhesions as well as adhesions between the gallbladder and liver bed.
A high ligation near the gallbladder neck was undertaken given the gallbladder neck was edematous and friable, and so it was also oversewn.
Later that day, the patient underwent ERCP which showed multiple filling defects in the CBD.
Cholangiogram did not demonstrate filling of the right and left hepatic ducts and subsequently there was extraluminal contrast outside of the CBD and intestine concern for bile leak.
During the ERCP the patient had an aspiration event, requiring intubation.
Past Medical History: PMH: stage 1 bladder cancer treated in [**2195**] with radiation PSH: open cholecystectomy [**2201-6-16**]   Social History: Married, former smoker   Family History: Diabetes, CVA, HTN, melanoma   Physical Exam: On Admission: VS: T 101.9, 96, 160/79, 21, 100% on CMV 550x16, peep 5, FiO2 60% - general: intubated, sedated - HEENT: NC, AT, NGT with bilious output; ET tube in place - CV: RRR, no M/R/G, S1/S2 normal - Resp: mechanical breath sounds clear to auscultation, no W/R/R - Abdomen: soft, obese, right subcostal incision closed with staples that appears to be healthy (no erythema or discharge) though minimal bruising noted; JP drain with bilious fluid - Extremities: warm and well-perfused  On Discharge: VS: 98.7, 75, 144/76, 12, 96% RA GEN: NAD CV: RRR, no m/r/g RESP: CTAB ABD: Right subcostal incision open to air with steri strips.
**FINAL REPORT [**2201-6-23**]** Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2201-6-23**]):    NO GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2201-6-19**]** URINE CULTURE (Final [**2201-6-19**]):    NO GROWTH.
Multifocal aspiration in the lower lungs.
Post-cholecystectomy changes with drain and surrounding stranding without focal fluid collection to suggest biliary leak or hematoma; however the right hepatic artery is not well seen and interruption/occlusion cannot be excluded with slightly decreased right hepatic enhancement on the arterial phase imaging.
[**2201-6-19**] ERCP: Impression: Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique.
Common hepatic duct and intrahepatics could not be opacified.
There was extravassation of bile consistent with a post operative bile leak.
Examination is limited due to non-breathhold sequence acquisition and no dynamic imaging was performed secondary to same.
Diffuse fatty deposition within the liver.
Decompression of the right posterior intrahepatic bile ducts from the PTBD drain.
There is, however, intrahepatic dilatation of the right anterior and left intrahepatic biliary tree.
Preferential hyperenhancement noted of the left lobe of the liver which is transient and equilibrates on more delayed phase of imaging.
He was admitted in SICU intubated s/t aspiration pneumonia and started empirically on Unasyn.
On [**2201-6-18**], the patient underwent abdominal CTA, which demonstrated post-cholecystectomy changes with drain and surrounding stranding without focal fluid collection to suggest biliary leak or hematoma; the right hepatic artery is not well seen and interruption/occlusion was suspected.
On [**2201-6-19**] the patient underwent ERCP which was concerning for complete bile duct transection with surgical clip.
At the same day, patient underwent PTBD drain placement into right posterior intrahepatic bile ducts for decompression.
The MRCP was limited secondary to non-breathhold sequence acquisition and claustrophobia.
On [**2201-6-22**], patient was hemodynamically stable, his respiratory status improved and he was transferred on the floor tolerating clears IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA on the floor with good effect and adequate pain control.
CV: The patient was found to have mild hypertension and was started on Metoprolol with good effect.
Pulmonary: The patient was treated empirically with IV Unasyn for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
The patient was treated with Unasyn x 7 days for possible aspirational pneumonia.
Endocrine: The patient doesn't have a history of diabetes, however his serum glucose was slightly elevated during hospitalization.
The patient advised to follow up with his PCP for additional work up of possible borderline diabetes.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Transection of common hepatic duct with surgical clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **].
Biliary leak s/p open cholecystectomy 3.
Aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
PTBD Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
JP Drain Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
