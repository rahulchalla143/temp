She had no nausea or vomiting.
She did not have any symptomatic relief with anything at home except for hot showers.

Extremities revealed there was no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
Amylase was slightly elevated at 130.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service for further evaluation of her anemia and abdominal pain.
ABDOMINAL PAIN ISSUES:  The patient's pain was mostly epigastric, and the etiology was unclear.
The patient had a computed tomography of the abdomen done in the Emergency Room which was unremarkable except for common bile duct dilatation of about 13 mm with a small nonobstructing stone within the common bile duct, but no stone was seen at the ampulla.
She also had a 1-cm kidney cyst and an atrophic right kidney.
The patient then had a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography done which showed again that she had common bile duct dilation and an nonobstructing stone at the ampulla.
The patient intermittently had episodes of abdominal pain which would resolve with Dilaudid.
There was no evidence of bleeding.
A colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were done which showed no evidence of bleeding.
Iron studies were sent and were consistent with an iron deficiency anemia.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient's blood pressure was slightly elevated during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course; however, at one point in her stay it appeared that she had some evidence of congestive heart failure.
She had akinesis of the anterior septum, distal, inferolateral, lateral, and anterior walls.
She had 1+ mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
She had no ischemic symptoms or electrocardiogram changes.
The nuclear images showed a moderate fixed defect at the apex.
Given that there were no reversible defects, the patient was cleared for surgery as a moderate risk candidate .
This was felt to be secondary to hypovolemia.
