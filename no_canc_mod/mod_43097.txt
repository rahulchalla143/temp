Admission Date:  [**2156-12-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2156-12-21**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was an 85-year-old gentleman presenting with epigastric pain who felt well upon waking.
On the morning of admission, he had breakfast and thereafter noticed the onset of achy/crampy epigastric pain associated with belching.
He denied any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
The pain was nonradiating and not associated with any fevers or chills.
The patient attempted to take Gas-X times two and had no relief.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post repair times three.
History of transient ischemic attack.
Left carotid stenosis; status post carotid endarterectomy.
History of renal artery aneurysm; status post repair in [**2144**].
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of cerebellar and pontine hemorrhages.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy; status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Hepatitis C with a negative viral load.
Peripheral neuropathy.
Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
He appeared slightly uncomfortable but he was in no acute distress.
There was no jugular venous distention.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no rales.
There was a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
The abdomen was soft, mildly distended, with slight tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic and lower abdominal areas.
There was no rebound or peritoneal signs.
No edema was noted.
The patient was alert and oriented times three with a nonfocal neurologic examination.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Relevant laboratory studies revealed the patient had a white blood cell count on admission of 14.3.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed an unchanged abdominal aorta as well as unchanged bilateral iliac aneurysms.
There was a mildly prominent small bowel loops in the middle third of the small bowel, but with no definite transition point; although, suggestive of a small-bowel obstruction.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a hypertensive urgency as well as with signs of a possible small-bowel obstruction; although, with no nausea or vomiting up to this point.
For his hypertensive urgency, the patient was continued on the Nipride drip and remained stable.
Therefore, the patient was able to take orally the contrast material, and the option to place an nasogastric tube was deferred for the time being given that the patient had no nausea or vomiting.
Found only mild small-bowel obstruction and was able to tolerate the contrast well.
Given the unimproving oxygen saturation even with some Lasix, it was felt the patient might be in some congestive heart failure with rales bilaterally.
However, during intubation after visualization of the vocal cords and placement of an endotracheal tube down the trachea copious gastric contents filled the endotracheal tube which was then removed and replaced by the covering attending without any complications.
On a chest x-ray repeated the next day, there were signs of bilateral diffuse infiltrates suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome likely due to the aspiration of gastric contents.
The patient's blood pressure continued to require pressors for blood pressure support.
For the respiratory failure, the patient was kept on an FIO2 of 100% and was requiring continuous positive end-expiratory pressure.
However, in discussion with the family it was decided to make the patient do not resuscitate given the dismal prognosis from the massive aspiration and acute respiratory distress syndrome developing.
On hospital day three, despite the continuation of pressors, and antibiotics, as well as oxygen supplementation the patient succumb to the septic shock, actually via a cardiac arrest and deceased on hospital day three.
Likely small-bowel obstruction.
Massive gastric aspiration with development of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
