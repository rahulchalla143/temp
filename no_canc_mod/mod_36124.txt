She endorses a one month prodrome of weight gain that started after a diarrhea illness.
In the past couple of weeks she has notice increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort.
She says that the chest discomfort is associated with palpitations.
She thought she was coming down with pneumonia which she has had in the past because she has had a dry cough, chills at night, and post-nasal drip.
Patient went to see her PCP and was noted to have enlarged cardiac shadow on CXR, with concern of large pericardial effusion accounting for her symptoms.
She had an echo this am that showed a moderate pericardial effusion but no tamponade.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is positive for chest discomfort and dyspnea on exertion.
Denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, or syncope.
Past Medical History: breast cancer(CIS) 18 years ago treated with lumpectomy and radiation  Social History: -Tobacco history: None -ETOH: None -Illicit drugs: None  Family History: Father had a MI in 50s and is alive in 80s with CAD.
Mother with CAD in 80s.
Otherwise, no family history of arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Mild RUQ TTP.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
EKG: NSR at 100bpm, NA, NI, no STTW changes .
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**12-5**] pre-pericardiocentesis The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is a very small residual pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-12-5**], the pericardial effusion is much smaller; no tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 58 y/o F with a a remote history of breast carcinoma in siut who presented to her PCP with shortness of breath, found to have a pericardial effusion now s/p pericardial drain.
# Pericardial Effusion: Patient found to have moderate effusion on CT and Echo but no evidence of tamponade.
Fluid analysis consistent with exudate.
Given history of cancer there is concern that this could represent metastasis, ovarian cancer, vs new lymphoma given history of radiation.
Also possible is a viral process which she is currently endorsing.
No evidence of uremia by labs.
# PUMP: Despite a mildly elevated JVP Ms [**Known lastname 1104**] never displayed evidence of venous congestion or tamponade physioloyg.
She has no history of heart failure.
Aside from pericardial effusion, TTE without evidence of heart failure.
Repeat TTE showed decrease in fluid amount.
# Transaminitis: If viral syndrome is cause for effusion, it may also explain transient transaminitis.
It is doubtful that this is hepatic congestion but of concern an underlying metastatic process should be ruled out.
No elevated bili to suggest cholecystitis.
# Small Pleural Effusions: Deferred for PCP follow up.
Medications on Admission: Calcium with Vitamin D  Discharge Medications: Calcium with Vitamin D  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial Effusion of unknown etiology Pleural effusion of unknown etiology Transaminitis of unknown etiology ?viral syndrome   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Ms [**Known lastname 1104**]: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and a CT scan was performed which found a small amount of fluid in your lungs and around the heart.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, cough, fever, chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, lightheadness or dizziness, please call your primary care doctor or go to your local emergency room.
