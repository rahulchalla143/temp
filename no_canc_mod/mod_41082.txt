The U/A on admission revealed a specific gravity of 1.014, hazy, small leukocyte esterase, small blood, positive nitrates, trace protein, negative glucose, negative ketones, greater than 50 white blood cells and a few bacteria.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a [**Hospital 93961**] nursing home resident, at baseline nonverbal secondary to dementia, who was initially admitted for hypoxia and UTI, initially found to be in sepsis and transferred to the VICU on the day of admission.
SEPSIS:  The patient was stable and initially admitted under sepsis protocol to the VICU where she received aggressive hydration, transfused 2 units of blood for a hematocrit less than 30.
She also had a subclavian line placed for access for neurosepsis protocol.
The patient initially had some respiratory distress after her fluid hydration but this improved and was stable with minimal 02 by nasal cannula.
The patient was noted to have gram-negative rods growing from her urine culture and eventually this grew out Citrobacter .................... which was sensitive to levofloxacin and ceftazidime and was the likely source of her sepsis.
The chest x-ray on [**2106-5-28**] showed just mild CHF and no evidence of pneumothorax.
The patient had a follow-up chest x-ray on [**2106-5-31**] which was also consistent with CHF versus pneumonia.
The patient was adrenally insufficient on the admission to the VICU and is to complete a five day course of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.
This improved with 3 liters of 02 and then after aggressive hydration for her blood pressure was in mild respiratory distress, transferred to the VICU but remained respiratory stable on 2 liters and a cool nebulizer face mask.
She did continue to have some upper airway sounds, some cough to help mobilize some of her airways.
Otherwise, she was stable from a respiratory standpoint.
