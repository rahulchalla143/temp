Initial studies undertaken there showed a CT scan head with a small contusion in the left posterior parietal region and there is a question of a small intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the posterior aspect of the Sylvian fissure.
CT scan of the cervical spine was negative, CT scan of the chest was negative, and the CT scan abdomen just revealed a 3.3 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
There was a left femoral neck fracture for which the patient underwent open reduction, internal fixation at [**Hospital6 5016**].
He also sustained a left distal radius fracture, right humeral head fracture, and lacerations of the head.
On the evening of [**2184-10-20**], the patient became markedly hypoxic and was not responsive to Lasix and nebulizer treatments.
A CT scan of the chest showed bilateral pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and a right lower lobe pulmonary contusion without rib fracture.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for intensive care.
Cerebrovascular accident times two with no residual deficits.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
There were fine crackles on the chest bilaterally anteriorly.
The abdomen was distended and nontender.
After several days of intubation, the patient actually self-extubated and did well without the breathing tube.
After the chest tubes demonstrated no further air leak, they placed a water seal and eventually discontinued.
The patient did well initially, but eventually decompensated, had increased wheezes, rhonchorous breath sounds, and eventually desaturated.
Chest x-ray showed multi-focal lung opacities, consistent with an infectious process or adult respiratory distress syndrome.
He was on nebulizer treatment around the clock and was getting aggressive chest therapy with incentive spirometry.
Other studies performed here included chest CT scan angiogram which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, the pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, and pneumothoraces seen initially and consolidations of the lung bases.
Other studies also revealed that the patient has signs of obstructive pulmonary disease.
Orthopedics:  The patient has a left hip fracture status post open reduction, internal fixation.
The patient is remaining on Coumadin for his hip fracture and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Neurologic:  The patient has remained awake and alert throughout his hospital course; however, since extubation, the patient has remained somewhat confused as to location and situation.
A CT scan head on [**2184-11-2**] showed no evidence of acute intracranial pathologic process.
The patient was placed on vitamins for a question of Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome.
It was felt that there was no infectious disease or structural etiology for this cause and was likely secondary to deconditioning and change in environment after the accident.
There was no known source.
Numerous sputum cultures, line cultures, and other investigations for infectious disease were negative.
The patient subsequently had an ultrasound guided hip joint catheter to rule out infection there, which was also negative.
At one point, the patient was placed on several antibiotics, including vancomycin, for empiric treatment.
He has had no cardiovascular issues.
He has had mild tachycardia which we feel is secondary to Albuterol treatment.
Nutri-shakes or equivalent nutritional formula, one can po tid with meals.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  For physical therapy, the patient is to remain nonweight bearing for right upper and lower extremities, but is weight bearing as tolerated on bilateral lower extremities.
Left distal radius fracture.
Right humerus fracture.
