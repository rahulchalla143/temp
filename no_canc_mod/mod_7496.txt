She is admitted for heparin bridge in preparation for mitral valve surgery  Past Medical History: Aortic Stenosis s/p AVR [**2150**].

No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is concentric LVH.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is symmetrical filling of the aortic root in systole suggesting normally mobile aortic valve leaflets.
There is trace AI in the area of the right coronary sinus.
There is a space seen in adjacent to the non-coronary sinus which expands with systole, suggestive of coronary sinus aneurysm.
There is severe (4+) mitral regurgitation directed posteriorly with coanda effect.
There is systolic reversal of pulmonary venous flow, suggestive of severe MR.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
POST-CPB There is a bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in the mitral position.
The peak gradient across the prosthetic mitral valve is 15mmHG, the mean gradient is 7mmHg, with a CO of 6.6.
A small jet of MR was initially seen along the sewing ring at the one-o'-clock position which resolved with protamine administration.
There is mild TR and trivial PI.
Biventricular systolic function appear normal.
There is no evidence of dissection.
There is continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with increasing opacification at the right base consistent with pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis.
There is also evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure.

She underwent her preoperative which included a transesophageal echocardiogram for evaluation of mitral valve.
She received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics however was noted to have rash in the intensive care unit and was treated with benadryl and pepcid, vancomycin was discontinued and was placed on cefazolin for perioperative antibiotic coverage.
In the first twenty four hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated without complications.
She continued to progress, however had episodes of atrial fibrillation and her digoxin was restarted and betablockers increased.
