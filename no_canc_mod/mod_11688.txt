The patient was eating his [**Holiday 1451**] dinner when he noted a tight squeezing in his chest with pain into his arms and neck, no shortness of breath, positive diaphoresis, no nausea or vomiting.
The patient was started on heparin and nitroglycerin at the outside hospital and was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for cardiac catheterization for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
The patient never had chest pain like this before, no previous catheterization.
His chest pain was relieved after eight to ten hours.
The patient was in his usual state of health until prior to this episode, without nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or diarrhea.
The patient also was complaining of abdominal bloating.
Diabetes mellitus times ten years.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Congestive heart failure five years ago.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  Pleasant male in no acute distress.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention or bruits.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmur, rub or gallop appreciated.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, right groin bruit, 1+ pulses bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was admitted with chest pain and a non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
On [**2126-11-11**], he had a cardiac catheterization performed.
It showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 29 with cardiac output of 2.78, left ventricular pressure 160/21, pulmonary artery pressure elevated at 62/34.
Left ventriculography was not performed due to elevated filling pressures.
Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with a normal left main, diffuse 60% mid-left anterior descending artery, 80% diagonal one, 70% proximal left circumflex with 99% mid to distal right coronary artery, it filled mainly via left-to-right collaterals.
The patient ultimately ended up having a cold knife urethrotomy performed on the table with a rigid cystoscope by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
This negated the coronary artery bypass grafting being done on this date and the patient was subsequently brought back to the floor and intended to have coronary artery bypass grafting the following day.
The patient was doing fairly well until [**2126-11-18**], when he was found to have a rapid rhythm with new atrial fibrillation.
He had had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation one day prior, which was treated successfully with Lopressor and amiodarone.
On [**2126-11-18**], the patient had a left bundle branch block while he was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
He was stable following this episode, however, there was concern about possible ischemia precipitating the arrhythmia and causing the left bundle branch block.
The repeat catheterization showed diffusely diseased left main, a diffusely diseased, 70%, left anterior descending artery after the large competitive flow in distal left anterior descending artery and diagonal, left circumflex with 70% ostial stenosis with severe diffuse disease and competitive flow in obtuse marginal, totally occluded right coronary artery in the mid-portion, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery 90% aorto-ostial stenosis with a TIMI-II flow, saphenous vein graft to diagonal patent with mild kinking in mid-portion, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 30% ostial, left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery mild kinking in mid-graft and near anastomosis.
He did not have any recurrent atrial fibrillation and his rate was controlled on amiodarone in addition to low dose Lopressor 12.5 mg twice a day.
The patient had his sheaths pulled and was ultimately discovered to have a right groin bruit.
He was found to have an arteriovenous fistula after having an ultrasound.
The patient was placed on an amiodarone drip intermittently, which was ultimately switched over to oral amiodarone, especially in the setting of a low left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%.
Of note, the patient did not have any ventricular dysrhythmias during the hospitalization.
The patient was in mild congestive heart failure throughout the Coronary Care Unit stay.
The patient has a known left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% and was subsequently placed on afterload reduction with Captopril which he had been on previously.
The patient was doing well until [**2126-11-21**], when he had an episode of chest pain while brushing his teeth.
The patient felt congestion in his chest and heaviness, eight out of ten.
At this time, the patient was noted to be in a left bundle branch block with what appeared to be either sinus tachycardia or atrial flutter with two to one block.
The patient had no further episodes of chest pain, however, it was thought he would benefit from a functional study on [**2126-11-22**].
The patient underwent a stress thallium with pharmacologic stress in the setting of Persantine.
The results showed a mild reversible perfusion defect in the inferolateral walls with global hypokinesis, more pronounced in the inferior and lateral walls, and an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 32%.
Endocrine:  The patient has diabetes mellitus, controlled with NPH insulin.
On [**2126-11-22**], the patient is having his Foley discontinued and having a voiding trial.
If the patient does not void or has a postvoid residual greater than 300 cc, he will have a Foley in place and will be discharged to rehabilitation or home with a Foley in anticipation of a voiding trial in the future.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery bypass grafting.
Diabetes mellitus.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation in postoperative setting.
