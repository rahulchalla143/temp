There is also blood layering in the right suboccipital region, over the right tentorial leaflet, extending anteriorly.
There is no significant shift of the midline structures.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is stable and consistent with age- appropriate volume loss.
There is asymmetric decreased size of the right lateral ventricle and effacement of the right-sided cerebral sulci likely secondary to mass effect from the right subdural hematoma, also grossly stable.
No lytic or blastic osseous lesion is seen.
There is mucosal thickening and air-fluid level in the right and a mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus; the air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus appears new over the series of studies.
Unchanged right subdural hematoma, with only slight mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and effacement of the subjacent sulci, and no significant shift of midline structures.
No new hemorrhage.
Worsening right maxillary sinus mucosal sinus disease with new air-fluid level; clinical correlation for evidence of acute sinusitis is suggested.
ECHO ([**2121-11-20**]) Findings  LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: This [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman was admitted to the General Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain.
He recently fell at home and suffered a subdural hematoma and was initially admitted to the neurosurgical service.
Two days after his admission, he had an acute onset of abdominal pain following reversal of his anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
A CT scan, as well as physical exam and history all pointed towards an ischemic colon with portal venous gas evident on the imaging.
Neuro: s/p fall with R SDH, he had a simple partial seizure in the ED where he received 2 mg of ativan and was loaded with keppra.
Repeated head CTs showed an unchanged right subdural hematoma, with mass effect, but no shift of midline structures or herniation.
The patient remained stable without any focal nuerological deficits.
CV: The patient has  a history of a-fib, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and carotid stenosis.
He triggered [**2121-11-20**] at 0230 for chest pain associated with SOB and diaphoresis.
An ECG showed ST-segment depressions in V4/V5.
Pt had resolution of sx and ST-segment depressions.
The mild elevation in troponin likely represented demand ischemia given recent stressors and surgery.
In the following days he had intermittent Afib alternating with episodes of sinus bradycardia with long conversion pauses.
He had some hypertensive episodes in the following days.
He might require further titration and adjustment of his blood pressure medications.
He will still need long term anticoagulation, although this is currently being held due to recent subdural hemorrhage.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet and pain was well controlled.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for Breakthrough pain.
