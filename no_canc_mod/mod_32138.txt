man with pmh significant for hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, who presented to an outside hospital with abdominal pain, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, chest pain, and hematuria.
His wife reports his symptoms began friday when he noticed hematuria.
he presented to the OSH ED, where CT abdomen was unrevealing and he was told he passed a kidney stone.
He went home, where he developed abdominal pain.
His pain was crampy in nature, and localized over the left lower quadrant.
He then developed lower back pain and shortness of breath, with profound dyspnea on exertion.
Sunday night his abdominal pain was increasing in severity.
At presentation he had an INR of 4.0, other labs consistent with DIC, hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 60's and oxygen saturation in the 70's.
On presentation to the ICU he underwent TEE which revealed hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, but no aortic dissection.
The patient became asystolic during this procedure and was coded, receiving CPR, epinephrine, CaCl2, HCO3.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Sleep apnea   Social History:  drinks one pint of rum or vodka daily, last drink was 4 days ago.
No cigarettes or tobacco.
Left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
Air and decompressed urinary bladder consistent with instrumentation, correlate clinically.
left lower lobe consolidation and ill-defined right perihilar opacity are as seen on earlier same day CXR and CT abd/pelv.
no supine evidence of large ptx or large effusion seen.
TEE: LVEF 75%, no evidence of aortic dissection   Brief Hospital Course: 45 year old man with pmh significant for obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, presenting with profound lactic acidosis and hypotension despite three vasopressors.
#Hypotension: Differential included septic shock, vs. mesenteric ischemia.
CT abdomen was significant only for mild retroperitoneal fat stranding.
Other infectious sources include cholangitis or cholecystitis given elevated liver enzymes.
He was maintained on vasopressin, phenylephrine, dopamine, and levophed for pressor support.
# Lactic Acidosis: Differential included sepsis and mesenteric ischemia given history of abdominal cramping pain.
He was not a surgical candidate in light of his other comorbidities.
# Transaminitis: Likely shock liver in setting of reported hypotension at OSH.
He did have an elevated acetaminophen level, which could have contributed to fulminant hepatic failure especially in light of heavy ETOH use.
# DIC:  Patient was supported with FFP, cryoprecipitate, and vitamin K.  # Myocardial infarction: Patient had ST elevations in V1 through V4, likely secondary to demand ischemia in light of severe hypotension.
