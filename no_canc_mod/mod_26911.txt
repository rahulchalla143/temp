DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2154-3-12**]):       Negative for Influenza B.
There are low lung volumes.
There are likely bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with overlying atelectasis, there is also perihilar vascular prominence, more so on the left than the right, raising concern for asymmetric pulmonary edema.
The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to the bibasilar opacities.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Multifocal pneumonia predominating the lingula, also involving the left upper lobe and right lower lobe, with likely reactive prevascular lymphadenopathy.

# Multifocal Bacterial PNA - Pt presented with several days productive cough and fever, increased O2 requirement to 6L (baseline 2L), exam with bilateral ronchi, CT demonstrating bilateral pnuemonia;  most concerning aspect of presentation is hypoxia, initially requiring bipap in ED, but improved with IV lasix and nebs, sugggesting component of volume overload and COPD as well.
# Chronic dCHF - EF75%, currently appearing euvolemic on exam.
- Will d/c pt on her home dose of Lasix 40mg PO, pt likely has more fluid to diurese but would monitor weights, 02 requirement and Cr closely.
# DMII - reports on metformin at home, although PCP records demonstrate it was discontinued several months ago.
# Depression: continued duloxetine .
Medications on Admission: - Duloxetine 60mg daily - Fluticasone-Salmeterol 250-50 [**Hospital1 **] - Lasix 40mg daily - Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5mg-500mg TID prn pain - Ipratropium 17mcg/Actuation 2 puffs QID prn - Omeprazole 20mg daily - Verapamil XR 120mg daily - Ferrous Sulfate - Miralax prn - Reports metformin (although OMR shows inactivated by PCP [**4-/2153**])  Discharge Medications: 1. verapamil 120 mg Tablet Extended Release Sig: One (1) Tablet Extended Release PO Q24H (every 24 hours).
5. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
8. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 9475**] Care Center - [**Location (un) 3146**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia, bacterial Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure Moderate aortic stenosis Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without exacerbation Obstructive sleep apnea Diabetes Mellitus, type 2   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
This was likely due to the combined effects of a pneumonia and excess fluid (heart failure).
