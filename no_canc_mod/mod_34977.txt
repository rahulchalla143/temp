He reports that approx 5 days ago he started to have chest discomfort which he attributed to "the flu."
He describes this as substernal chest pressure with no radiation with associated severe shortness of breath, "gasping" for air with minimal exertion on walk to mailbox.
He denies diaphoresis, no nausea or lightheadedness.
He denies having these symptoms in the past.
Reports having a fever on [**2-15**] to 101.5 which resolved.
An EKG completed upon arrival to [**Hospital **] Hospital demonstrated ST depressions anterolaterally - leads I, V4-V6, and a troponin was found to be 20.57, down to 18, then elevated to 22.8.
CXR showed mild vascular congestion and he was treated with Lasix 20 mg IV overnight on [**12-13**] due to some shortness of breath and chest pain.
Additionally, he received a loading dose of Plavix 600mg, placed on a heparin drip, continued on atenolol, and nitropaste applied for chest pain.
At time of transfer, he was chest pain free, in no distress, with bilaterally diminished lung sounds.
Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Osteoarthritis - s/p Hip replacement   Social History: Pt is a past smoker, quit in [**2143**], smoked [**2-24**] ppd for approx 10 years.
Family History: [**Name (NI) **] father died of an MI at age 65.
No family hx of diabetes or cancer.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
No bruit, no masses, no guarding or rebound tenderness Ext: No c/c/e.
No femoral bruits.
R groin no hematoma or thrill, pulses 2+ dp and pt bilaterally.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  demonstrated a severe three vessel CAD.
The LMCA had mild non-obstructive disease.
The LCx was diffusely diseased and had a 90% mid vessel stenosis and a 90% stenosis of the OM1.
The RCA was a tortuous vessel with a 100% mid vessel occlusion.
RCA conus branch had a separate ostium and gave collaterals to the LAD as well.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated filling pressures with an RVDP of 22 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 30 mm Hg.
There was a moderate pulmonary systolic arterial hypertension with a PASP of 50 mm Hg.
Patient was noted to be in and out of atrial fibrillation during the case.
Left ventriculography with a manual contrast injection revealed an LVEF of 20% with a global LV hypokinesis.
No significant MR was noted.
Diffusely echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
More advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Ectasia of the distal abdominal aorta measuring up to 3 cm.
Right pleural effusion.
[**2188-2-20**] Transthoracic ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %) with inferior akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Carotid ultrasound was unremarkable while abdominal ultrasound was notable for ectasia of the distal abdominal aorta measuring up to 3 cm.
Preoperative echocardiogram showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %) with inferior akinesis, trace aortic insufficiency and only mild mitral regurgitation.
He awaited Plavix washout prior to surgery and remained pain free on a Heparin drip for intermittent atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day two, he developed rapid atrial fibrillation which was initially treated with Amiodarone and beta blockade.
Despite medical therapy, he continued to experience paroxsymal atrial fibrillation.
He continued to experience paroxsymal atrial fibrillation.
