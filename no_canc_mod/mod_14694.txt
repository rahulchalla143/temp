Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 38 yo F with CRI/ESRD on HD [**3-12**] DM admitted with acute onset of SOB c/w hypertensive crisis leading to flash pulm edema in setting of inc fluid intake prior to admission.
Pulm edema: The patient demonstrated increased troponins on admission (0.59) which peaked at 1.09, CK 203, and there was a question of cardiac disease in setting of diabetes and ESRD (baseline troponin 0.2-0.3).
Cardiac catheterization was performed and demonstrated clean coronary arteries with no evidence of disease.
It was felt that pulmonary edema was not due to acute ischemia but due to fluid overload due to ESRD and dietary non adherance.
She experienced improvement in her clinical symtpoms and demonstrated improvement in physical signs including CXR and pulmonary exam.
HTN:  The patient's hypertension initially improved after receiving nitro gtt in the ED, and she was transfered to the floor without the need for nitro.
ESRD: patient presented with fluid overload and tolerated HD successfully.
