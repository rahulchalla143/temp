Admission Date:  [**2180-10-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-10-31**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint:  dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 14936**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo woman with h/o COPD, pectus carinatum, moderate AS, and chronic diastolic heart failure who presents with a [**1-19**] week history of dyspnea.
She reports increasing shortness of breath such that she was having difficulty with her daily activities (such as using her walker to get down the [**Doctor Last Name **] at her independent living facility).
No hemoptysis.
Over the last 3-4 days, she has had increasing LE edema.
She denies orthopnea or PND.
No chest pain or back pain.
LE ultrasound was negative for DVT, and a CTA was performed to rule out PE.
Although there was no evidence of PE, a large hematoma was found surrounding the thoracic aorta with a 5mm focal defect in the aortic wall suggestive of tear.
Past Medical History: COPD--spirometry included below Pectus carinatum Scoliosos Moderate aortic stenosis on TTE from [**2-/2180**] Chronic diastolic CHF per DC summary [**2-/2180**] Depression Colon CA and small bowel CA s/p resection in [**2160**] and [**2169**] GERD w/ h/o Barrett's esophagus History of falls Hypothyroidism Glaucoma Cataracts Short term memory loss Hospitalized [**2-/2180**] with SBO that required lysis of adhesions, was transiently intubated and on pressors; required lasix for diuresis because of acute on chronic heart failure; also noted to have episodes of sinus tachycardia.
h/o C diff: during [**2-25**] admission, had leukocytosis to 26 and treated empirically for C diff.
Physical Exam: 97.8 84 Left 83/56, Right 98/61 25 97% 4L Elderly woman sleeping in bed, wakes easily, somewhat hard of hearing EOMI, MMM, face symmetric, OP clear Neck supple, no carotid bruits.
JVP to angle of jaw while at 45 degrees S1, S2, regularly irregular (PACs every 3rd beat) with 2/6 systolic murmur at LLSB.
Slightly short of breath with talking.
Lungs with diffuse crackles throughout, decreased BS at bases b/l.
Abdomen protuberant with well-healed midline scar.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]yo woman with COPD and pectus carinatum who presented with dyspnea and was found to have tear in thoracic aorta.
Dyspnea: Most likely multifactorial due to underlying chest wall deformity (from pectus carinatum, scoliosis and compression fractures), COPD, and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
Although pneumonia is also a possibility, she did not have fevers, a productive cough, or evidence of infiltrate on CXR.
Aortic stenosis may contribute to her propensity to develop pulmonary edema/pleural effusions.
Tear in Thoracic Aorta: Unclear why this developed as patient does not have poorly controlled HTN or family history of dissection.
The patient and family communicated understanding of her diagnosis and consensus about the decision regarding medical management only.
Leukocytosis: She has not had fever to suggest infection.
Cultures sent with no evidence to suggest pulmonary infection.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] [**Location (un) **] hospice care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Shortness of breath Thoracic aortic aneurysm Atrial fibrillation Leukocytosis  Secondary diagnoses: Compression fracture Hypothyroidism Depression Glaucoma GERD Cataracts   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: 1)You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.
You had a CAT scan of your chest which showed no evidence of a blood clot in your lungs but did show a small tear in your thoracic aorta.
4)If you experience any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention.
