Admission Date:  [**2118-3-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2118-4-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2044-11-4**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73[**Hospital 4622**] nursing home resident with a history of hypertension and Alzheimer's dementia who presented with an episode of loss of consciousness after defecating.
By report by the nursing home staff, the patient had been recently constipated but otherwise in his usual state of health and had been a recent aggressive bowel regimen.
On the day of admission, the patient had a large bowel movement with some bright blood per nursing home records.
He was found unconscious on the toilet with no report of head trauma or a fall.
The patient was unresponsive to voice, and vital signs revealed a temperature of 99.5, heart rate was in the 70s, and blood pressure was 90/50.
His fingerstick at that time was 200, and the patient received one dose of Narcan with no response.
Of note, the patient had guaiac-positive brown stool in the Emergency Department, and his laboratory studies were significant for a hematocrit of 32 (which is the patient's baseline) and a creatinine of 3.3 (which was elevated from a bowel sounds of 1).
Elevated cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient has had no recent fevers, no cough, and no localizing symptoms (per nursing home staff).
He has no prior history of a seizure disorder.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98, heart rate was 72, blood pressure was 130/70, respiratory rate was 14, and oxygen saturation was 100% on ventilator.
The neck was supple with no midline tenderness and no lymphadenopathy.
Head and neck examination revealed pupils were minimally reactive and mild bloody secretions from the mouth; likely secondary to traumatic nasogastric tube placement.
The lungs revealed rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases, and no wheezes.
A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
The abdomen was soft with no tenderness, and no masses.
Extremities had no edema.
Neurologic examination revealed flaccid extremities but increasing rigidity of the upper extremities with full range of motion.
There was no obvious facial droop.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax, no pneumonia, and proper placement of the endotracheal tube.
A head computed tomography revealed no acute bleed, with normal ventricles and fossae, with no mass effect.
No acute ST changes.
LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS ISSUES:  The patient's syncope was evaluated by telemetry which showed no arrhythmias over 48 hours.
An electroencephalogram was normal, and a transthoracic echocardiogram was a limited study but demonstrated no significant valvular abnormalities.
The etiology of the loss of consciousness was probably a vasovagal event secondary to defecation in combination with dehydration.
Blood cultures were negative, and the patient remained afebrile throughout and demonstrated no evidence for infection or sepsis.
He had no further episodes of loss of consciousness during his hospitalization.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's renal failure was likely due to dehydration.
The patient's rhabdomyolysis also resolved with intravenous hydration with downward trending creatine kinases.
ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient's hematocrit decreased with intravenous fluids, and he was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells.
He had intermittently guaiac-positive stools, and further investigation revealed that he had not had a recent colonoscopy.
Acute renal failure.
