Syncope: It is unclear if this bleed is truly what caused his syncope, as he never dropped his hematocrit and didn't have much in the way of significant bleeding on his EGD.
Possible that he had such severe pain that he passed out, but he states he had been feeling better prior to this.
His episode had a prodrome only of vision dimming, no dizziness.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] test showed no reversible perfusion defects with EF 67%.
His CTA showed very generous pulmonary arteries, f/u TTE to evaluate PA pressures was normal.
Syncope therefore with no clear etiology, possibly [**2-3**] small bleed and decreased PO fluid intake leading to dehydration, evidenced by elevated BUN:Cr ratio, and hemo-concentrated with Hct in high 30s.
Aspirin held due to gastritis.
Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of GI bleed, and may be elevated at baseline [**2-3**] diabetic nephropathy.
