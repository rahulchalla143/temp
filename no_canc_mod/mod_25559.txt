No focal weakness, tingling, or numbness.
-- history of ascites and jaundice -- Grade 2 varices ([**2109**]) -- Portal hypertensive gastropathy (liver biopsy on  [**2116-11-30**].
This study demonstrated mixed micro and macronodular  cirrhosis.
-- Heterozygous for the H63D mutation # Obesity # Right knee arthritis # Osteopenia .
Tobacco: non-smoker EtOH: negative Drugs: negative   Family History: Remarkable for diabetes and coronary disease.
No family history  of liver disease or liver cancer.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vital signs: T 95.2, HR 66, BP 83/41, RR 14, O2 Sat 100%/RA Gen: No acute distress.
Icteric sclerae.
No rebound or guarding.
2+ bilateral LE edema.
EOMI, with no nystagmus.
Discharge Physical Exam Gen: No acute distress.
Icteric sclerae.
No JVP appreciated.
Distant breath sounds.
no murmurs appreciated Abd: +BS.
No rebound or guarding.
1+ bilateral LE edema.
no palmar erythema or spider angiomas appreciated.
No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Supratentorial white matter hypodensities are nonspecific in a patient of this age, but could be related to sequela of accelerated chronic small vessel ischemic disease, given the history of chronic liver disease.
Alternatively, they could be related to an inflammatory or demyelinating process.
No evidence of intra-abdominal or intrapelvic hemorrhage.
Sequelae of cirrhosis including ascites, a nodular hepatic contour, splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 16.9 cm, and varices.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions with overlying pulmonary consolidations, at least some component of which is atelectatic.
EEG [**2117-9-15**]: This is an abnormal EEG because of generalized diffuse background slowing.
These findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Of note there was asymmetric spindle like activity seen only over the left hemisphere, which could indicate relatively worse cerebral function over the right hemisphere.
No evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage.
Mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus and fluid in the bilateral mastoid air cells.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Echogenic liver, likely compatible with known NASH.
Cholelithiasis but no cholecystitis.
TTE [**2117-9-20**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.

# Upper GI bleed: The patient had a positive NG lavage on presentation and given known varices, she had both an EGD and sigmoidoscopy.
Sigmoidoscopy showed non-bleeding grade 1 external hemorrhoids but no explanation for her bleeding.
EGD showed esophagitis and two non bleeding varices at the gastric fundus.
After initial resuscitation the patient's HCT stabilized and she had no further evidence of bleeding.
INR was elevated as high as 3.5 and it did not correct with multiple treatments with vitamin K which was ascribed to poor hepatic synthetic function.
# Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient was oriented to person only after extubation.
She remained intubated in the MICU until [**2117-9-19**] due to poor mental status and inability to follow commands.
# Fever: While intubated the patient developed a fever but no leukocytosis.
Blood cultures and CXR were negative but sputum culture grew pansensitive serratia and pansensitive enterobacter.
# Cryptogenic Cirrhosis: Presumed etiology is NASH.
The patient was on the transplant list but her status is inactive because of high BMI and noncompliance.
A RUQ U/S was performed to look for cause of worsening hepatic function which showed cholethiasis but not cholecystitis.
A TTE was performed which showed mild pulmonary artery hypertension but no evidence of right heart failure to cause congestive hepatopathy.
# Low Urine Output:  She presented initially with acute kidney injury with creatinine as high as 2.1 that was likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion in the setting of GI bleed.
# Pressure ulcer: She was noted to have pressure ulcer while in the ICU.
Hepatic encephalopathy  Secondary Diagnosis 1.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding for which you were given blood transfusion.
Endoscopy of your gut did not show any active bleeding though your mental status was worsened by medications given to sedate you.
