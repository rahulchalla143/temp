Chronic systolic heart failure EF 25% He remained asymptomatic throughout his hospital course.
His antihypertensive and diuretic medications were briefly held with his brief post-operative hypotension but most were restarted.

His coumadin was restarted on the evening of his surgery, and his dose was increased from 12.5mg daily to 15mg daily due to difficulty achieving therapeutic levels.
He is not an ideal candidate for lovenox due to his renal insufficiency and his obesity.
