Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 105348**]/07 with CHF exacerbation, swan was placed that admission and she was diuresed.
Elevated troponin at the time thought secondary to demand.

She had nausea and was noted to have HR in the 30s junctional vs av delay.
On arrival to the CCU, she was feeling tired (hadn't slept all night) but no CP, shortness of breath, dizziness or LH.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

Dig level 1.5  Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo female with severe ventricular dysfunction (EF 10%) secondary to polysubstance abuse and HIV (last CD4 359) who presented with bradycardia secondary to digoxin and amiodarone toxicity.
# Rhythm: Found to be bradycardic to 30's in ED in setting of digoxin toxicity with amiodarone and hyperkalemia contributing.
An attempt was made to place a temporary pacing wire, but this attempt was unsuccessful because of thrombosed veins.
She developed increased shortness of breath and CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema, so patient was diuresed with lasix.
# CAD: No evidence of active ischemia during admission.
Patient requested that her [**Year (4 digits) 2775**] therapy be stopped as she felt that this made her nauseated and gave her abdominal discomfort.
# ARF on CRI: Baseline creatinine 1.3-1.5.
Now ARF on CRI; likely secondary to bradycardia and low EF in setting of digoxin toxicity.
#) Anticoagulation: Patient started on coumadin given poor LV function and risk of clot formation.
