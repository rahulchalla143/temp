Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-4-2**], measured transvalvular gradient is slightly lower, but overall - the findings are quite similar.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF CLINICAL SUMMARY: 75 YOM with h/o severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8), sCHF (EF of 20-25% on [**2108-2-14**]) and regular patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] admitted for [**Last Name (un) **] likely from over-diuresis and pre-renal azotemia.
Pre-renal etiology likely from recently increased Torsemide dose.
FeUrea showed pre-renal etiology.
Pt remained euvolemic on exam.
Critical aortic stenosis, not amenable to aortic valve replacement.
Patient evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who feels he is high risk for Cor Valve.
He was planned to receive a balloon valvuloplasty, and received a valvuloplasty without complication on [**2108-4-2**].
Chronic, stable without e/o ischemia at present.
# CHF: now euvolemic.
Chronic, systolic CHF without acute exacerbation during this admission, LVEF 20-25%.
The patient also has an intermittent LBBB which does not seem to be rate related.
# Shingles: had recent outbreak several wks prior to admission; he had healing skin lesions upon admission, but some residual pain (pt said he did not currently need pain Rx).
Off Torsemide in the course of the hospitalization, his potassium rose, but no concerning EKG changes.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
# HLD: stable.
Patient has intermittent LBBB, will likely become permanent; does not appear to be rate related 3. restarted torsemide at 20mg QOD on discharge to prevent volume overload when pt goes home - please follow up lytes on [**4-11**] and volume status and adjust torsemide as needed.
Discharge weight: 72.8kg; pt was euvolemic to slightly volume depleted on discharge.
Zofran 4 mg [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8426**] Sig: One (1) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8426**] PO every 4-6 hours as needed for nausea for 1 weeks.
Disp:*8 [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8426**](s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Steward Home care and Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Acute Kidney Injury Ischemic colitis  Secondary Diagnoses: Severe aortic stenosis Coronary artery disease Systolic congestive heart failure Shingles (resolving)   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because you had blood tests which showed that you had some kidney damage.
This was likely due to dehydration, due to decreased appetite and the torsemide water pills.
During your stay, you had some loose stools with blood and were evaluated by Gastroenterology.
This was felt to be related to "ischemic colitis," or bowel irritation in the setting of low blood pressures, which is resolving now.
Your heart medications were changed during this admission but please note that management of your heart failure is an ongoing process, and doses will change based on food and fluid intake.
Please weigh yourself every morning and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 3 days or 5 lbs in 2 days.
